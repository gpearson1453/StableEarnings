Footnotes
MOSLER'S IMAGE saved ground on the turns stalking the pace, found room along the rail turning for home to take the lead and held sway under steady
handling. ENGLISH CHARMER , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, challenged for the lead
outside horses in upper stretch and finished gamely. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL , alertly steered to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained near the rail
throughout and rallied mildly. DOUBLE HAPPINESS lacked speed, swung five deep leaving the far turn and flattened out. CIARRAI ABU raced along the
inner rail until the sixteenth pole, eased out and finished willingly. BAY OF ANGELS broke in the air, failed to be a factor and was four wide entering the
stretch. PASS IT ON , three wide the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and failed to rally. AMERICAS WOMAN , a forward factor early, was three wide
both turns and weakened. MAYFIELD OF DREAMS was not a factor. SEVILLA SANGRIA , quickly clear, set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out
entering the stretch and gave way. BUST OUT LADY , outrun, hugged the inner rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
H P MOON leaned in and brushed the gate at the break, recovered then drifted out slightly when assuming command inside rivals, set a rated pace while
handling outside pressure, pulled his way clear two wide leaving the far turn, opened up under some hand urging in mid stretch then coasted home as much
the best. BOLD LEADER settled well off the early pace, angled five wide into the lane, straightened away and closed willingly to be along for the place.
RADICAL RIGHT was used early outside the winner, pressed three wide into the turn, gave hard chase past the three sixteenths, stayed willingly to deep
stretch then faded. MONEY ROOM , away alertly, was bumped soon after, drafted back off the pace, raced two wide into the lane, dropped to the rail in mid
stretch but went evenly late. NATAGAR broke slowly, recovered and showed some speed to reach a forward position, saved ground nearing turn, eased out
around the turn and faded. MATERIALIZE reacted to the winner drifting soon after the break and bumped with MONEY ROOM, raced just off the leaders
into the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and gave way.

IMA IMA STARBOY sprinted to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and was under urging in the
drive. TAUBER , fractious in the starting gate, bumped with POWER BACK shortly after the break, circled foes on the turn, was four deep entering the
stretch and rallied. RAILMASTER hugged the inner rail throughout, was well positioned to strike in mid stretch and flattened out. GALE WINDS , two wide
chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. BY THE SEY SHORE raced along the inner rail around the turn, angled out in mid stretch and
came up empty. POWER BACK bumped with TAUBER soon after the start, failed to be a factor and swung to the four path turning for home. JOSEPH ,
three wide on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
SHACKLED LOVE , in range early on, angled three wide leaving the three quarter pole, moved up within himself then dropped in a bit to engage
PRODIGIOUS BAY after a half mile, took over from that rival entering the far turn then spurted clear, came under strong handling to maintain command
entering the stretch, was fully extended through the final furlong and grimly prevailed. WELLING settled in the clear, edged up three wide into the far turn,
took measure of the winner mid way on the final turn, saw that one get away a bit past the three sixteenths, shifted in giving chase in mid stretch, shifted
back out, finished gamely but his effort fell just short. DREAM BIG DREAMS , unhurried early while off the rail, was put to a drive leaving the three eighths
pole, circled four wide with pursuit into the lane but could only muster up a mild response. JEBOLOGIST prompted the pace two wide outside the leader,
stayed in touch as others converged leaving the far turn, failed to kick on under pressure heading towards the lane and gave way. CAN'T PASS IT UP lost
touch with the field after a quarter mile, raced removed from the rail and never got involved. PRODIGIOUS BAY took over early and set the pace towards
the rail, took pressure past the three quarter pole, ceded command with about a half mile to go, stayed on under asking to about the five sixteenths then
faltered.

ELUSIVE JESTER prompted the pace outside LEAVE 'EM LOADED, overtook that one in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and drifted out
near the sixteenth pole. LEAVE 'EM LOADED , sent to the early lead, angled in approaching the first turn, set the pace along the rail, failed to hold off the
winner in upper stretch, was bumped by JACK OF HEARTS near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. JACK OF HEARTS , three wide the first turn,
stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, had aim on the leader in mid stretch, flattened out and bumped LEAVE 'EM LOADED
when drifting in under right hand urging near the sixteenth pole. ON THE ENGINE raced inside rivals throughout and showed a mild, late gain. CRITICIZE ,
three wide the first turn, advanced four deep entering the far turn and weakened through the stretch. HONOR MY WORLD , caught in close quarters leaving
the starting gate, was rank and checked in tight quarters entering the first turn, failed to be a factor and raced three wide on the far turn. MENTALIST
hugged the inner rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, gave way mid way on the turn and was eased.

MALIBU BEAUTY broke on top, dueled to the inside of RESPONSE TIME while under a bit of coaxing, shook clear two wide into the lane, responded when
set down soon after, opened up under a drive with a furlong remaining and was kept to task to the wire. HITCH A RIDE was rated back from between rivals
soon after the break, angled in and then edged up into the turn, tracked inside past the five sixteenths, eased out a bit in upper stretch, gave willing pursuit
to the wire and narrowly saved the place. MY MY GIRL broke a step slow, was taken wide early, moved up with HITCH A RIDE into the turn, circled four
wide pursuing into the lane then kept on with interest while just missing second. RESPONSE TIME engaged the winner in the opening strides, dueled
outside that one to the about the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER , away alertly, allowed CRY NO MORE to go to the front, rated kindly while taking measure to the outside, moved to engage leaving the
far turn, sparred under coaxing into the lane, wrested command three sixteenths out, shook clear under sharp left handed asking in mid stretch then steadily
pulled away while kept alert. ALWAYSINAHURRY , off a bit slow after being bumped at the break, moved up to be in range after a quarter mile, failed to
initially go on while under pressure past the three eighths, wandered outward a bit heading towards the lane, straightened to be about four wide past the
three sixteenths then leveled off late to nab the place in the final jumps. CRY NO MORE drifted in at the beak and bumped with ALWAYSINAHURRY,
straightened and accelerated to the inside of the winner and took command, went clear after a furlong, met the challenge leaving the far turn, battled on a
slim lead past the five sixteenths to upper stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BOAT , off slowly, recovered and accelerated inside to contention, was taken up sharply off heels heading towards the turn, regrouped and
found room along the rail, rebid to command mid turn, shook clear entering the stretch, was guided out to about the three path, turned away PEDERSON'S
COURAGE while under a drive past the eighth pole then steadily widened. CALLYOURIGHTBACK settled off the pace, advanced between foes into the
lane, angled out and closed steadily on his left lead. PEDERSON'S COURAGE prompted the pace outside TENAX, was floated out a bit by that one while
challenging for command mid turn, had aim on the winner while four wide past the three sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the furlong grounds and
weakened late. WHATCHASAID lost ground four wide stalking the pace, remained in attendance past the five sixteenths but came up empty in the drive.
BADGER TOOTH , between rivals while close up, steadied nearing the turn, angled in to pursue then faded in the drive. TREASURE TRADITION checked
when caught in the jam up into the turn, angled in and lacked a bid. TENAX rushed up inside to command, took pressure into the turn, drifted out past the
three eighths allowing the winner an inside path, chased into the lane then faltered.
