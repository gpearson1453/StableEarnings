Footnotes
WISE KHOZAN soon had the advantage between rivals, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, widened command under a
drive in the lane and was kept to urging until the final sixteenth. AWESOME SKIPPY pressed WISE KHOZAN from outside on the backstretch, did not keep
up on the bend but pulled away for second from outside the final furlong. FINAL CALL bumped with IMPERIAL TEMPLE at the start, was well placed from
inside, swung out for a clear path entering the stretch, fought for second to the last eighth then began to wear down. IMPERIAL TEMPLE bumped with
FINAL CALL at the break, faded from between horses early, saved ground taking the turn, angled to the outside for the stretch run and had little to offer.

Footnotes
CITY POSITION prominent between rivals, lost his path to W W KAN DO leaving the bend, altered inside that one entering the stretch, battled between
rivals, edged ahead nearing the sixteenth marker and narrowly held on under steady handling. ITALIAN CHARM rated off the early speed, picked up his
pace along the rail on the turn, rallied to vie for the lead inside CITY POSITION with a sixteenth left but lacked the needed late kick. COME ON DOVER was
forwardly placed from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the bend, lost further ground staying outside W W KAN DO leaving the turn, fought for the
lead through the lane but came up a little short in a game effort. W W KAN DO was hustled to a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, was
challenged from outside on the turn, drifted out to path four into the stretch, dueled between rivals to hold on but slowly yielded inside the last furlong.
GREAT GRET in contention early, gave way from outside after three furlongs.

TRAVEL ACCOUNT bumped with JULE'S A RUNNER just after the break, was rated between horses for five furlongs, moved clear when asked on the
second bend, was under a drive through the stretch and steadily widened command. WAVE THE GOLD was rated from outside, four wide taking the second
turn, was bumped midstretch then moved clear for second inside the last sixteenth. TEARS ON A RIVER soon had a clear lead, showed the way from
inside, did not stay with TRAVEL ACCOUNT on the second bend, moved ahead for second upper stretch but began to wear down in the late going.
EUGENE also bumped with JULE'S A RUNNER just after the start, was settled at the back and well off the inside, picked up his pace widest on the second
turn, advanced through the stretch and just missed for the show. DROOP'S M D B chased from between horses, did not keep up three wide through the
second bend, closed the gap some upper stretch, bumped with WAVE THE GOLD with a furlong to go and leveled off through the waning yards. JULE'S A
RUNNER squeezed briefly just after the break, gained a clear path just off the inside entering the backstretch, pressed outside TEARS ON A RIVER, also

JOEY B rated off the early pace, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch to move clear from three wide on the second turn, floated out some
entering the lane, was under a drive through the stretch, battled inside JUSTENUFFTUFF the final sixteenth and kept that one at bay under steady handling.
JUSTENUFFTUFF soon shared the lead outside DAVKA, did not stay with JOEY B on the second bend, lost ground fanning outside the latter for the stretch
run, engaged JOEY B with a sixteenth left but had to settle for second best. TOCCETIVE JAC rated from inside, commenced his bid along the rail entering
the stretch, gradually closed the gap, squeezed through inside DAVKA inside the final furlong and edged ahead for third with sixty yards to go. DAVKA was
sent to get the early lead and the inside, challenged on the backstretch and began to slowly wear down before finishing six furlongs.

MARCO'S DREAM stalked the early speed from outside, moved in beside HE HAS NO FRIENDS on the bend then drew off under steady urging through
the stretch. ABSTRACT PAYNTER was bumped and forced out some just after the break, advanced from outside on the turn, came four wide into the lane,
rallied belatedly but took over second with seventy yards to go. DANG IT CASSIE prominent between rivals on the backstretch, followed MARCO'S DREAM
through the bend, gained second midstretch but could not sustain his bid as he gradually lugged in the the last eighth. LINE OF DENHAMS chased from
inside, altered out for a clear path midstretch and improved position without threatening. HE HAS NO FRIENDS was bumped and forced into ABSTRACT
PAYNTER just after the start, quickly recovered to set a pressured pace from inside, was challenged on the bend, no match for MARCO'S DREAM when
set down for the drive and steadily gave way. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) drifted out some at the start to bump solidly with HE HAS NO FRIENDS, raced in
contention on the backstretch but faded from outside on the turn.

Footnotes
FULL MAGAZINE broke inward, took the lead and the inside, was challenged leaving the first bend, moved clear again on the backstretch, given some hand
encouragement leaving the second bend, kept a clear lead while coasting upper stretch, put to hand urging deep stretch and kept THE LAST OPTION at
bay. THE LAST OPTION jostled with SMART TRIAL while in close together going to the first turn, was boxed in on the backstretch, bumped A MERRY
HEART as he squeezed through three wide for a clear path approaching the halfway point, moved clear for second on the second bend, floated out some
into the lane and lengthened his hold on the place as he closed the gap on the leader inside the last furlong. NURSE SADIE was a step slow at the break
then lost her path shortly after that, trailed, gradually progressed from inside, angled outside for the stretch run and drew away for third inside the final
eighth. A MERRY HEART raced in contention from outside, was bumped midway on the backstretch, did not keep up with the top pair as he moved clear for
third from along the rail on the second turn, came off the inside midstretch and flattened out. SMART TRIAL jostled briefly with THE LAST OPTION going to
the first bend, soon recovered, advanced from outside to vie for the lead just outside FULL MAGAZINE leaving the first bend, began to retreat on the
backstretch, gave way after a half mile, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SHELL FIRE crowded briefly at the start, gradually progressed from outside to gain a slight lead four wide on the second bend, angled in some leaving that
turn, fought throughout the stretch to hold on and prevailed. MEGAN'S HONOR rated between horses in the second flight, went for the lead three wide on
the second turn, angled in some as GO FOR SHERRIE cam out a bit with two furlongs left and bumped with that one, was all out along the inside through
the lane, lacked the extra needed in the waning yards but proved easily second best. GO FOR SHERRIE vied for the early lead from inside, did not stay
with TRY TRY AGAIN on the backstretch, angled out some with a half mile to go, was two wide on the second bend, moved out a bit as MEGAN'S HONOR
came in some and bumped with that one at the quarter pole, was steadied briefly, fanned out to path three for the stretch run and pulled away for third the
final furlong. TRY TRY AGAIN moved clear on the backstretch and took the inside but began to wear down before finishing six furlongs. RIVER CACTUS
broke outward, chased from between rivals, was just off the rail on the second bend, angled to the outside for the stretch run and had little to offer.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP also crowded briefly at the start, chased from along the rail and gave way after five furlongs.
