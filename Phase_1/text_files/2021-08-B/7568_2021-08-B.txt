SNIPER KITTEN was well rated behind the runaway pace setter towards the inside, eased out three wide to make a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, was
bumped leaving the turn by the tiring pace setter, then was roused and drew clear by the furlong marker, then was kept to right handed pressure to prove
best. LITTLE KANSAS was void of early speed and saving ground early, then moved out two wide by the quarter pole and rallied well on the inside gaining
the place award late. LONTANI was reserved early, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn but hung late, lost place. IMPERIAL
MISSION was keen early and ran off while three wide on the first turn, then was angled towards the rail down the backstretch while opening up a big lead,
then began to weaken on the turn, drifted out leaving the turn bumping the winner and stopped.
