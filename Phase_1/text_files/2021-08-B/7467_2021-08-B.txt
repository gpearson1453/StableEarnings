Footnotes
D'ARCHER bumped with KAPCORI ROAD at the start then bumped with STOSH and back into KAPCORI ROAD, quickly recovered to gain a clear lead,
showed the way in hand, was asked entering the stretch and steadily opened up under nearly all hand urging. STOSH bumped with D'ARCHER just after
the break, chased from outside on the backstretch, advanced three wide nearing the end of a half mile and gradually edged ahead for second the final
sixteenth. ROLL CALL prompted the pace just outside the leader, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and slowly wore down the last
sixteenth. KAPCORI ROAD bumped with D'ARCHER at the start then was bumped hard by the latter and forced inward, was checked off ROLL CALL'S
heels, soon well back and showed little.

STUMP hesitated at the break, advanced from outside to engage the leader after a furlong, did not stay with JAMMING CAMERON into the bend, was
roused nearing the quarter pole, rallied the last furlong and edged ahead inside the final seventy yards. JAMMING CAMERON broke alertly, was challenged
from outside midway on the backstretch, moved clear again into the turn, floated out some entering the lane, was put to a drive approaching the furlong
marker and did not have enough left in the waning yards. TURN YOUR EYES failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

MOVE ON OVER broke a bit inward, bumping BONNIE DANCES, quickly recovered to gain a clear lead and the inside, was asked entering the stretch, put
to a drive at the eighth pole then was ridden out the final sixteenth. BONNIE DANCES bumped at the break, was hustled some to race closest to MOVE ON
OVER, chased from just off the inside, was all out in the lane and could only just hold his position. FULL OF HEART broke on top but was soon chasing the
top pair from outside, closed the gap on BONNIE DANCES upper stretch but leveled off the final furlong. STRATUS STORM soon trailed and moved to the
inside, angled out widest upper stretch and was closing in for third late.

GONZO settled inside on the backstretch, angled out as he commenced his bid on the bend, came four wide into the lane, rallied under a drive to gain the
lead with a sixteenth left then drew clear while ridden out. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ reluctant to load, vied for the early lead inside R H SMOAKEM, edged
ahead approaching the last furlong but lacked the extra needed deep stretch. BABA LOU prominent from outside, was two wide on the bend, fanned outside
R H SMOAKEM for the stretch run, did not have a serious late bid but gained third inside the final sixteenth. DEANO raced in contention from inside, altered
out for a clear path nearing the final sixteenth and was closing the gap in the waning yards. R H SMOAKEM displayed early speed from outside but
gradually wore down two wide through the stretch.

Footnotes
MIZ BLUE broke on top, showed the way in hand from inside, was asked entering the lane then steadily widened command while kept to a drive to the wire.
I LUV THIS BAR raced in contention from just off the inside, took the rail early into the bend, came off the rail some as she took over second into the stretch,
moved clear for the place but could only just hold her position late. GHAALEB'S MAGIC chased from inside, came into the lane behind I LUV THIS BAR,
altered outside that one after entering the last sixteenth, rallied too late but caught HAMMERED for third. HAMMERED raced closest to MIZ BLUE for a half
mile, floated out some into the stretch, was no match for the latter and ran evenly widest of all the final furlong.

Footnotes
AROSE FOR LYLA hesitated at the start, spotting the rest of the field more than a length, advanced in close quarters between rivals to gain the lead before
finishing two furlongs, was kept in hand from along the rail on the bend, put to a drive upper stretch, lengthened command and was kept to task until the last
seventy yards. CREAL DREAMER prominent between horses, moved clear for second just off the inside on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run,
was all out under steady urging, could not close the gap on the leader but proved easily best of the others. PECOS AUTUMN well placed along the rail,
retreated into the bend, saved ground taking the turn then could only pull away for third through the lane. SHINE DOWN pressed from outside, began to
yield widest on the turn and continued to fade in the stretch.
