FREE TO FLY vied between foes in the two path, moved clear into the stretch and held inside rival safe through the final furlong. FLASHING DIAMOND
settled inside, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. CARAMEL CREAM raced just off pace in the two path, bid wider in the stretch
closing well. SHERO was in tight in the opening quarter mile outside then continued gamely to the finish. HEROIC OFFICER dueled the winner along the
inside to the stretch and weakened. OBSTINATE chased between rivals down the backstretch and eased back into the far turn. PEARLY QUEEN prompted
the pace three wide then began faltering on the turn. MIDTOWN ROSE raced four wide off the leaders and lacked a response.

Footnotes
SHEER FLATTERY prompted pace in hand, took over on the final turn then drew away handily. MOON GATE WARRIOR settled off the pace, split rivals
advancing into the stretch to be second best. IYWAAN lacked speed outside, moved extremely wide into the stretch rallying. FLAT OUT FLASHY urged
close up outside, faded on the final turn then came again. SILVER EDGE lacked speed, offered wide middle move into the far turn then proved empty.
SILVER FURY saved ground throughout and faltered in the stretch. CANTSTOPRUNNING hustled to the front inside and was finished after three quarters.
CANADIAN GAME dropped back early, raced very wide on the final turn and faded.

OMNIA stalked the loose pacesetter outside, bid on the final turn and prevailed following a long drive. BLUE SHINE hustled to the lead inside, was collared
into the stretch and held gamely to the finish. ELUSIVE RYDER broke awkwardly, saved ground, was asked on the final turn and came up empty. ALWAYS
A QUEEN settled inside, was urged before a half mile but gave way.

Footnotes
MANAHAWKIN settled far behind, advanced inside to the stretch, split foes and was up in the final yards. CLEAR THE MINE prompted the pace three wide,
led midway the turn, bid clear, but was caught late. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS was urged close up inside, loomed a threat into the stretch but yielded. THE
ITALIAN set the pace in the two path, drifted out into the stretch and faded. GET THE W steadied between rivals near the half mile pole and faltered.
SMART ROYAL T was reserved off the leaders and never a factor. LEGACY'S PRINCE lagged far behind outside and was always outrun. ASK CHUCK
moved close up four wide down the backstretch and gave way.

THORNY TALE hustled to the front inside, repelled a strong challenge on the final turn and drew off under moderate pressure. LOOKIN AT ROSES settled
three wide, made a strong bid on the final turn but could not get by the winner. EL HERMANO made a menacing four wide move into the far turn then
flattened out. KINGSVILLE angled inside early and began fading on the final turn. DAZZLING TRUTHS lagged far back inside and was never a factor.
ZIPPY prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and faded. EL BORRACHO dropped back early and was always far behind. I SAY I PLAY raced outside

FED POLICY settled early, moved strongly, was taken up inside near the quarter pole, recovered and surged to get up in time. LI'LBITO'CHARM rated
outside, rallied to the front into the stretch, bid clear, but was caught late. BESS angled inside early, bid outside through the stretch but was outfinished.
BUCKS SOME prompted the pace, moved clear inside on the final turn then weakened slightly. TOMARIE trailed far behind, advanced wide with late
energy. ENOUGH LOVE dropped far behind then closed gap without menacing. MINI SCOOP lacked speed and never in contention. LORDEN'S LOVE
fanned five wide first turn, raced close up wide and faded. QUIET PLEASE saved ground within range briefly then gave way. OCEANO ROSSO urged close
up outside, drifted wide and stopped. SWEET LILLY FACTUM fractious prior to the start, rushed to the front inside and stopped. ASSUME CONTROL
lacked speed and weakened steadily. PER RULING #21225PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, FED POLICY WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

MIKE pursued inside, angled out on the turn, rallied then proved no match for the winner. PRIVET MOON prompted the winner outside, challenged on the
turn then proved empty in the stretch. THREE TWO ZONE lacked speed chasing wide and was always outrun. HEART RHYTHM was ordered a late scratch

LOVELY RIDE moved clear inside for half a mile, was engaged on the final turn, repulsed challenges from both sides and prevailed in a very game score.
LEADER OF THE BAND settled at the back of the pack, circled her field on the final turn, advanced very wide into the stretch with a gradual gain too late.
MARION FRANCIS reserved behind rivals, moved out on the final turn, bid, tightened an opponent in midstretch and could not get by the winner. BOLD
TACTICS fanned wide, rallied on the final turn then steadied between rivals tiring in the final furlong. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI came out at the start, saved
ground throughout, but flattened out in the stretch. OFFICE PARTY prompted the winner outside for half a mile and gave way readily. The stewards posted
an inquiry into the stretch run and the jockey of BOLD TACTICS lodged an objection against MARION FRANCIS for interference in the stretch but the result
was allowed to stand.

FULSOME restrained at the back of the field, circled his field when ready on the final turn, moved extremely wide into the stretch and surged clear under
steady handling. ALONZO forced the pace outside, led midway on the final turn, was passed approaching the eighth pole but continued gamely to the finish.
THE KING CHEEK hustled to the lead inside under rating, lost the lead midway on the turn and finished willingly to regain the show. RIDIN WITH BIDEN
rated three wide just off the pace, loomed a threat in the stretch but proved empty in the late stages. FAST BOB saved ground off the leaders and lacked a
rally. THE JONES BOY was well placed inside for five furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
MRS. CREWS dueled outside to the stretch and edged away down the lane while kept to her business. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE stalked the pacesetter outside
then flattened out in the stretch. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR lacked speed, angled inside on the turn and closed well. CHECOTAH vied along the inside, led
narrowly on the turn then weakened. STORMBEAM lacked speed inside early, moved out in the stretch with a mild bid. RISQUE EXPRESS chased within
range then began fading wide on the turn. MAD MARY stumbled badly at the start and lacked a solid rally. ATLANTIC AVENUE raced three wide and gave
way readily. IRON LILLY hesitated at the break and trailed throughout. BANGLE GAL and KNOCK OUT KID were both scratched at the gate on the advice
of the track veterinarian.
