I'VE GOT IT stalked early, went three wide on the turn to apply pressure, edged clear under mild hand urging late. BELLA DONA set a pressured pace
inside, dispatched on rival but was challenged by the aforementioned in mid-stretch and yielded late. WHERES BRAYDEN broke just a bit awkwardly but
gained position tracking in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, came out five wide turning into upper stretch and kept on. ACTION
JUNKY settled off the leaders, raced in behind foes two to three wide on the turn, altered inside a rival nearing the three-sixteenths, went evenly. MARK'S
WARRIOR broke just a half-step slowly and was lacking much early speed, trailed in the three to four path on the turn swinging five to six wide for the drive
and ran on mildly. FABSTRACTION pressed the pace from outside early, was two wide between rivals on the turn, shifted in once in upper stretch and
came up empty.

CAIRO KING broke out just a bit, stalked just off the leaders racing wide, went four deep on the turn, took aim in upper stretch, drove past and clear the final
sixteenth. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM set the pace racing off the inside, went in the two path on the turn, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. DADDY
WHAT IF broke a half-step slowly, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, came out wider in upper stretch and continued to drift out some while gaining
late. KRIS WHO switched out early, pressed from outside three wide heading into the turn, steadily weakened. SOMBRA NEGRA failed to rally after saving
ground. LIL LATIGO was in just a bit tight at the start, went in the two path on the turn and was never a threat.

under steady handling. THUNDER DOME settled well off the pace, was outside rivals between three and five wide on the turn, gained steadily in the stretch
but missed. JET N G stalked the leading trio, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, ran on. DYNAMIC RULER set a pressured pace inside rivals,
raced on or just off the rail through the turn, weakened. NUMEROLOGIST raced off the pace inside a rival going two to four wide through the turn, ran on
evenly. SHINING SOURCE broke a step slowly, shifted in up the backstretch, saved ground through much of the turn, angled five wide past the quarter
pole, failed to threaten. GORKY PARK trailed through the early going, saved ground on the turn before swinging out seven deep leaving that bend, failed to
rally. SEA EMPEROR pressed the pace between runners two wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
PIRATE JUNCTION set a pressured pace racing in the two path, dispatched the early challenger to edge clear in upper stretch but was thereupon
challenged by an inside foe, held that one at bay under steady handling. CANOODLING was caught outside foes three to four wide in the early going,
moved in to enter the far turn two wide, found room in upper stretch, bid inside late but couldn't get past. BECKHAM JAMES broke outwardly, steadied
along the rail when in tight entering the first turn, altered out to be four wide coming out of that bend, tracked the leading pair, kept on evenly in the lane.
SECRET POTION pressed the winner three wide, weakened. SAY IT AIN'T SONI broke inwardly, tracked mid-pack between runners into the first turn going
two to three wide on that bend, shifted in up the backstretch and saved ground on the far turn gaining on the leaders but could not sustain the effort and
flattened out. GIVE EM HECK BECK steadied after the start, raced toward the rear mostly two to three wide on both turns and failed to rally. GREY STORM
steadied at the start, raced four to five wide throughout, made a moderate advance on the far turn but flattened out.

Footnotes
TIZ DONNA BELLA stalked the leaders from outside going four to six wide on the turn, edged past under just mild urging. IZE A CRAFTY GAL tracked the
pacesetter three to five wide, made a mild bid mid-stretch but was outkicked. FOGGIA set the pace, drifted out four wide leaving the turn, weakened. TUTTA
TERLINGUA broke out and bumped with a rival at the start, raced inside early on the turn swinging five wide out of that bend and ran on. BULLY BABY was
mid-pack off the leaders going two wide in behind those on the turn, failed to rally. MINDOFMYOWN was bumped at the break, moved out two to six wide
on the turn and failed to rally. TIME IS PRECIOUS was four to five wide trailing through the turn, swung nine deep into the stretch and made no bids.
