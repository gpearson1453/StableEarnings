Footnotes
DUBBY DUBBIE set the pace on the inside, showed the way clear into the drive, roused in upper stretch and held well. FIRST PREMIO up close outside the
pacesetter through the early stages, chased two wide into the stretch, finished well and proved a game second. SECRET CLUB stalked the leader from
inside, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out and rallied in deep stretch but was not enough. STAGE READY traveled along the inside, saved ground to
the lane, coaxed in upper stretch and improved position. CUCINA settled off the pace, raced four wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. BLAMELESS
traveled outside a rival while in range, went three wide through the second bend, moved out five wide in upper stretch and could not offer the needed
response. FUENTE (GB) took the first turn three wide, navigated the second bend three to four wide and made no impact.

ZERO TOLERANCE took control early from the inside, pressured by SOCIALLY SMART into and around the turn, shook free at the quarter pole, came out
a bit in upper stretch and held gamely to the wire. M IS FOR MAGIC stalked outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch, finished gamely outside the
winner in deep stretch but could not get by. SOCIALLY SMART pressed the pace from outside, lost contact with a quarter mile remaining, lost path when
the winner, came out some at the top of the lane, angled to the inside and kept on for a clear third. KATERINI stumbled a bit leaving the gate, tracked three
then four wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. THE PHARAOH'S GIRL stalked off the rail, climbed along from the seven-sixteenths to the
three-eighths and faded.

NORTH COUNTY GUY unhurried in the beginning, made middle move an swopped by past the seven-sixteenths, cleared with three-eighths remaining,
roused in upper stretch and drew away. BOB AND JACKIE sped to the front and move inside, controlled the pace to the half-mile pole, overtaken past the
seven-sixteenths, steadied along the fence near the three-eighths, continued inside to the stretch then tipped out in the drive and finished willingly for the
place honors. ARTIE'S RUMOR forwardly placed early on in the two path, chased three wide into the stretch, came out in upper stretch and held third under
a mild hand urging. TIZ PLUS tracked the pace in the two path, moved three wide on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane then moved out further in
upper stretch and could not rally. INDIAN PEAK settled on the inside, moved into the two path on the far turn and came up empty.

RIGHTEOUSLY stalked the pace from inside, angled four wide into the stretch, tipped out further at the top of the lane, rallied outside the top pair and
proved best late. YELLOW DRESS bumped with outside rival at the start, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside at the quarter pole, drifted four
wide into the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining, could not hold the winner at bay but finished gamely to the wire. SIMMER DOWN sped to the front
and moved clear, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, fought to upper stretch and stayed on through the final furlong for a clear third. JASMINE
CHIEFTAIN bumped leaving the gate, chased off the inside, four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. ROYAL BLEND traveled in range early on, took the
turn two wide and weakened. LATER DAYS steadied slightly early, was hard to ride through the turn and never made an impact. BIG AL'S PRINCESS
broke out, chased outside a rival four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and faded.

MAN FRIDAY off a bit slow and got shuffled between foes to begin, unhurried early on from inside, angled three wide leaving the far turn, steered out in
upper stretch, closed well and got up late. KENNEBEC traveled near the back of the pack outside a rival then off the rail, came three wide into the stretch,
lacked room in mid-stretch, altered to the outside and closed fast. VANTAGE POINT stalked outside a rival, chased three wide into the drive, drew
alongside nearing deep stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole, then drifted out and interfered with rivals late and was overhauled by the top pair. ROOKIE
YEAR settled off the pace, went three deep at the half-mile marker, exited the second bend three wide, rallied between rivals and got bumped and checked
hard late. MUAY THAI (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, saved ground into the lane, angled out at the sixteenth pole then got bumped between rivals and
checked hard late. INGEST away quickly then ceded the lead early, went up to take then lead at the half-mile marker, lost command soon after, continued to
apply pressure through the far turn, regained the lead in upper stretch, moved clear at the eighth pole but yielded in the late stages. PLAY CHICKEN in
range early from inside, moved into the two path on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, got put in tight quarters and checked hard at the sixteenth pole
and was protected to the wire. SENSEMAKER traveled in mid-pack early, lost ground into the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had nothing left.
MUCHO DEL ORO sprinted to the front from the outside and crossed over, vied with rival up the backstretch, held a short lead through the second bend,
lost command in upper stretch and weakened along the inside. BACK RING LUCK raced off the pace early on, went up to put in a mild bid three deep after

EDGEWAY sped to the front while in hand, dueled for command outside of STELLAR SOUND, battled with that rival through the turn, shook free in upper
stretch, inched away under strong hand urging and held safely in the final strides. PROUD EMMA settled off the rail early, went four wide into the turn,
angled down to the two path around the bend, rallied late for the place but could not threaten the winner. STELLAR SOUND pressed early then went up to
duel from inside, fought with EDGEWAY through the turn, could not match strides nearing the furlong grounds and flattened to third. SCOTISH STAR (ARG)
stalked the top pair on the inside then eased off the rail, went three then four wide around the turn and could not summon the needed response.

into the stretch, struck the front past the eighth pole and drew clear. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE vied between rivals into and around the turn, maintained a
short lead into the furlong grounds, could not match the winner in deep stretch but stayed on to prove second best. ADDYDIDIT veered out and bumped
rival leaving the gate, chased the speed two wide into the turn, entered the lane three wide and kept to task to earn the show honors. SHEMAKESCENTS
bumped with outside for in the beginning, attended the pace outside the top pair, vied three deep into the stretch, then flattened out to a minor award.
ENDLESS THIRST bumped at the start, chased on the inside to the stretch and lacked a rally. SPOILED ROTTEN bumped from inside at the start,
forwardly placed outside the top trio, chased four wide into the drive, bumped with winner while between rivals in upper stretch and weaekened. WEDDING
