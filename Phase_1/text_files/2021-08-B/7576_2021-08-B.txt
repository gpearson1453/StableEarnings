Footnotes
PLEASANT MOON came in and bumped LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS in the opening stride, tracked well behind the leader through the clubhouse turn, took
closer order past the five eighths, encroached outside of CHAPEL BARN into the far turn, prompted the pace two wide around the bend, led approaching
the five sixteenths, took command into the lane and drew off under a mild drive. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was bumped by PLEASANT MOON in the
opening strides and squeezed back, settled at the rear, began to edge closer down the backstretch, rallied in the five path on the turn, continued four wide
into the lane, and chased on to prove a clear second best under a drive. KEARNY COUNTY chased the leading pair inside of YOUNG CORBETT, took
closer order in tandem with that foe down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the four path on the far turn while gradually losing ground on that pair
around the bend, turned four wide into the lane, was outkicked by LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS into the stretch, and chased on best of the rest while drifting
out. YOUNG CORBETT chased the leading pair outside KEARNY COUNTY through the clubhouse turn, took closer order on the leading pair in tandem with
that foe down the backstretch, was in range behind the leaders past the five eighths, settled back into the far turn, chased under a drive while saving
ground, came two wide into the lane, passed a tiring horse in upper stretch but was ultimately outfinished for the show. CALL THE COLONEL was bumped
lightly by LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS in the opening strides, settled near the rear, gradually took closer order down the backstretch in tandem with
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS, was driven from the rear in the four path on the far turn, continued under a drive four wide into the lane and lacked the needed
rally. CHAPEL BARN soon cleared, set an uncontested pace until engaged by PLEASANT MOON into the far turn, clung to a narrow lead while saving
ground around that bend, was headed by PLEASANT MOON approaching the five sixteenths, had no further response when driven inside into the stretch
and faded.

Footnotes
BOSSY SNOW PEA led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and was clear throughout. AKA LIONESS was pinched back
leaving the start, recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the turn between horses in the two
path, and gained ground on the outside down the lane. VALERIE VALESKI chased the leader from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn,
could not go with that rival in the final furlong and finished evenly. AH LEAH broke a bit slowly, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, was blocked in late stretch when a hole closed in front of her, switched outside, swerved out sharply during that maneuver and
finished evenly from there. RULER DAENERYS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and
weakened on the rail in the final furlong. BELLS OF JOY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three
path and was outkicked in the stretch. NEVE DE LUA trailed the field on the outside in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn and
offered no kick. ZIP ATTACK BABY raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and tired
entering the stretch. A JOCKEYS OBJECTION WAS CLAIMED BY THE RIDER OF THE FOURTH PLACE FINISHER ON THE RIDER OF THE SECOND
PLACE FINISHER, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE tracked the leading pair inside of STAR OF KODIAK, raced in the pocket in the two path around the turn, came into the lane behind
MEDAL OF FACT, shifted out near the three sixteenths, found his best past the furlong mark, rallied, and led inside the sixteenth pole. STAR OF KODIAK
was bumped by OMAR ATTACK and then ROYAL COMMISH in the opening strides, was asked for an early advance to track the leading pair into the turn,
encroached upon the leading pair while racing three wide on the bend, vied three wide with the leading flight from upper stretch to midstretch, led past the
furlong mark, but was caught by MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE past the sixteenth pole. RICHY pressed the early pace outside of MEDAL OF FACT, dueled
outside of that foe around the turn, came into the lane between horses while still dueling with MEDAL OF FACT, vied between that foe and STAR OF
KODIAK to midstretch, was no match for STAR OF KODIAK past the furlong pole but kept on willingly to the finish. HERE COMES KYLE chased inside foes
early, raced with the rear of the main group in the two to three path on the turn, was urged up the inside in upper stretch, angled four wide midstretch, and
offered a belated rally. MEDAL OF FACT was sent for speed inside, set the pace while pressured by RICHY early, dueled inside of that foe on the turn and
into the lane, and flattened inside in the final furlong. ROYAL COMMISH broke inward and bumped STAR OF KODIAK in the opening strides, chased three
wide early, bid four wide on the turn, and flattened out three wide into the lane. OMAR ATTACK broke outward and bumped STAR OF KODIAK in the
opening strides, chased between horses down the backstretch, continued midfield in the three path on the turn, raced between horses into the lane,
stumbled in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. VALIANT VINNY hopped at the break and was shut off between horses in the opening jumps, came
awkwardly into stride and soon trailed, raced in the three to four path on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. THE JOCKEY OF OMAR
ATTACK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. UPON REVIEW,
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE INTERNAL FRACTIONS WERE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WAR LANCE chased the leaders well off the pace up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
dueled gamely on the inside the length of the stretch and kept her head in front for the victory. TOWN AGENDA raced at the back of the pack on the inside
through the opening half mile, came around the turn in the four path, swung out to the five path to began an outside bid near the five sixteenths pole, dueled
down the lane and could not get by the winner. MCRAGS hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside late. COCO BRAVADO bobbled slightly leaving the gate,
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, entered the stretch between horses and was
outkicked in the final furlong. BASEBALL POLITICS dueled for the lead on the inside, opening up on the rest of the field up the backstretch, continued to
battle while saving ground around the turn, gave way with a furlong to go and weakened from there. PRINCE OF MAYHEM raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside in the early going, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. RULE FOLLOWER dueled for the
lead on the outside up the backstretch, gave way from the two path midway around the turn, and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
ONE FLASHY GIRL broke outward and bumped LOCASH in the opening strides, tracked the leader through the first turn, edged closer down the back
straight, bid in earnest outside of COUGER past the seven sixteenths, led in the three path approaching the five sixteenths and was soon clear, kept on
under a mild drive in the lane, and maintained the advantage despite veering in sharply late under right handed urging. SUPREME IRENE broke inward and
bumped LOCASH in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair, edged closer in tandem with ONE FLASHY GIRL down the backstretch, tracked the
leading pair in the two to three path on the far turn, chased ONE FLASHY GIRL down the lane with continued interest but proved second best. TWELVE
RED ROSES settled toward the rear outside of GIRLS COUNT through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the back straight and in the
three path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied under a drive and proved best of the rest. GIRLS COUNT settled toward the rear inside of
TWELVE RED ROSES, inched forward to chase midfield down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, was asked three wide into the lane,
kept on but was outfinished for the show. COUGER was soon clear, set the pace inside while keen under a tight hold, was engaged by ONE FLASHY GIRL
near the seven sixteenths and headed by that foe near the five eighths, proved no match into the lane, while continuing at the inside of the tracking flight,
and emptied out in the final furlong. ISABIS settled two wide in the rear flight early, continued near the rear in the three path on the turn, was driven up the
inside in the lane but lacked the needed kick. ALOTMOREACTION chased midpack inside foes, continued to save ground around the far turn while urged to
advance, swung three wide into the lane for the drive, and came up empty between horses. LOCASH was bumped between horses in the opening strides,
settled at the rear inside of ISABIS, trailed inside through the far turn, and offered no bid.

AND WON chased at the center of a well strung field early, rallied in the two path on the far turn, sustained his rally under a drive into the lane, confronted
outside of BOURBON TAN in the final furlong, was carried out by that foe but nonetheless got up in time. BOURBON TAN broke outward and grazed with
FLEETWAY in the opening strides, chased the leading pair inside of POWER CRY, edged closer down the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far
turn in close range of the leading pair, engaged outside of FLEETWAY in upper stretch, led near the three sixteenths, dug in while drifting out in the final
furlong but could not hold AND WON at bay late. ANGELINO settled at the rear early, began to rally outside foes from near the half, took closer order two
wide on the far turn, was taken five wide into upper stretch, sustained his rally and held off HIGH ON SUGAR for the show. HIGH ON SUGAR settled toward
the rear, began to improve two wide around the far turn, swung out six wide into the lane, continued to improve under a drive but was outkicked for the
show. FLEETWAY grazed with BOURBON TAN in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the leading flight into the clubhouse turn, tracked off of
ALLEGIANCE after that foe cleared from the seven furlong mark, engaged outside that foe past the half, vied two wide around the far turn, led approaching
the quarter pole, was headed by BOURBON TAN near the three sixteenths and flattened. COWBOYS DREAM broke outward and bumped POWER CRY in
the opening strides, settled toward the rear outside of HIGH ON SUGAR for the opening half mile, settled back inside approaching the far turn, improved
under a drive inside around that bend, continued inside into the lane and lacked the needed rally. ALLEGIANCE raced two wide in the leading flight into the
clubhouse turn, cleared from the seven eighths, set the pace through the first turn and down the backstretch, was engaged by FLEETWAY while racing in
the two path on the far turn, vied inside that foe, was headed approaching the quarter pole, and weakened. POWER CRY broke inward and bumped
COWBOYS DREAM in the opening strides, floated out approaching the clubhouse turn, chased the leading pair outside of BOURBON TAN around the
clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, flattened out in the five path on the far turn and had nothing further for the drive.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole, wore down his rivals on the outside and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile without much urging from his rider to win handily. WHAT'S UP
DUDE dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, continued to battle from the two and three path around the far turn and into upper
stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. WILE E PEYOTE dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, gave way approaching the eighth pole and finished evenly late. YOU'RE KILLIN ME
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked from
there, no match for the top three finishers. ARRIVAL chased the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
faded down the lane. TWO BIT KID trailed the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, angled in to race on the rail up what remained of
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, still at the back of the pack, and made no bid.
