Footnotes
ME SAY SO, bumped by PRINCESA DEL SOL at the start, settled between foes in the last flight, gradually gathered momentum splitting rivals racing into
upper stretch and surged to wrest the advantage late under firm encouragement. VIKKIS ROCKSTAR broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace,
opened a comfortable advantage on the turn but failed to sustain that momentum. PRETTI TA KELA switched out in the opening stages, raced a bit
erratically nearing the turn, continued in that manner while shifting to the four path in upper stretch, was bumped near the sixteenth marker but continued
with interest to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. BOOZIN AT BOZOS, off last, was settled inside foes racing into the turn, angled out five wide in
upper stretch but made no impact. PRINCESA DEL SOL broke out bumping the eventual winner, gained a forward placing pulling a bit between foes,
continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch, then shifted out bumping PRETTI TA KELA and emptied out late. SHE GLITTERS, urged to a
forward placing along the inside, steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
NORTHCUT broke readily, sped to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, disputed the
issue into the lane while shifting off the inside and gamely prevailed in a strong drive. TWO BY TWO, reserved last along the inside to the backstretch,
angled out five wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late and closed the gap on the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. AMERICAN
MADE angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, was urged to advance inside the pacesetter challenging for command when
presented an opening in upper stretch but was outkicked to the wire. MAKE ME BLUSH tracked the pacesetter between foes in early stages, shifted out
three wide after a half tracking the leader into the far turn but had no final bid. DAYS OF GLORY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, continued
outside foes tracking off the second flight and faded in the drive. CERNAN hopped in the air while hitting the gate at the start, was righted, then prompted to
gain contention outside foes, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to press the pace between foes into the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch.

COMPANY STORE, urged between foes prompting the pace, moved to wrest a clear advantage leaving the midway point of the turn, opened a comfortable
margin in upper stretch and just lasted under brisk left handed pressure. FENDER BENDER angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight racing to the
turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch and continued with steady late progress to close the gap on the winner. DISCREET TIGER broke sharply, was
rated off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, then gained position between foes in that path while outkicked by the top pair. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL
tracked off the first flight four wide on the backstretch and continued evenly into the lane. SAVED BY ZERO, urged inside foes disputing the pace to gain a
narrow advantage after the opening quarter, couldn't match terms with the winner racing into the lane and gave way in late stages. RONNIE CLOUD trailed.

the backstretch to race four wide to the second bend, was prompted to advance in that path racing through the far turn to challenge for command racing into
upper stretch, wrested a narrow advantage midstretch and held YO DAWG safe to the end under firm handling. The latter angled to the inside tracking off
the leaders, split foes nearing the far turn to bid for command between foes with a quarter mile to go, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only
second best. DYNAMOMETER, urged to a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn, lost the advantage entering the backstretch tracking the
pacesetter along the inside, continued along the inside to the far turn, steadied along the rail avoiding a tiring foe racing into upper stretch, then tipped out
entering the lane to prevail for a share between foes. THAT'S NOT FUNNY was rated between foes near the inside racing to the first turn, switched out after
a half, was urged to bid three deep between foes on the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. HURTS SO BAD, forwardly placed between foes racing
to the backstretch, faded after a half. MAGIC REVOLUTION dropped out early. CAKE STOMPER broke awkwardly while being brushed at the start, was
urged to gain contention outside foes with a swift advance three wide on the first turn, shifted to the inside opening a brief lead on the backstretch and gave
out racing through the far turn.

STONE SECRET, off a step slowly, was prompted to advance five wide through the backstretch, took over from a stricken rivals nearing upper stretch to go
well clear, shifted inwards in the stretch and was kept to pressure. HARD TO PARK settled off the second flight along the inside early, shifted out on the turn
to split foes three wide entering the lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. MISCHIEVOUS MO angled inwards to track off the
pacesetter between foes just off the inside racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for third late. BOSS HUGO, forwardly placed
three wide prompting the pace in the opening stages, dropped off the pacesetter nearing the turn, then weakened between foes late. JIMMIE T, off slowly,
switched outside foes to race five wide on the turn and continued evenly into the lane. SHOW BUSINESS angled to the inside early tracking off the second
flight and faded nearing the lane. PRINCE LEO was a brief factor four wide tracking off the first flight but emptied out early. MUSKYMAN flashed brief pace
between foes but gave way early. DEUCE, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, shook clear between
calls entering the turn, was pulled up abruptly nearing upper stretch, then was vanned off the course.

A ROSE FOR RAVEN, urged clear along the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and maintained a
safe advantage under firm encouragement. SUPER CONSTITUTION angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, saved ground
on the far turn steadily gaining position, tipped outside the winner to challenge in the stretch and proved best of the others while no match. PINTXOS
tracked just off the second flight three deep to the backstretch, then continued evenly in that path between foes into the stretch. MARK IN GREELEY,
bumped at the start, settled outside foes to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. GO SPEED
RACER GO tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the far turn and weakened in late stages. SAMYAZA tracked off the second flight
outside a rival to the far turn but offered no rally. STAR MISSION worked his way to the inside racing to the backstretch dropping off the second flight and
never gained contention. BUGLER, off a bit slowly, never gained contention. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off
the pacesetter, gave way leaving the far turn. XTREME MAYHEM ducked out bumping MARK IN GREELEY at the start, dropped out racing through the
backstretch, was pulled up racing into the lane but walked off under his onw power.

GP'S AMAZING GRACE, bumped at the start, was rated tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, lost some ground to that foe on the
far turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and produced a sustained response in a prolonged drive to just edge LASTING INFLUENCE on the wire
under energetic handling. The latter exchanged bumps at the start, was urged through close quarters along the inside to gain the advantage racing to the
first turn, dictated the pace through the backstretch, shook clear midway through the far turn, held sway to late stages but was denied at the wire. MOCHA
KISS tracked the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch and continued evenly to late stages to prevail for a share. GIO'S LIL ANGEL, bumped from
both sides, then shuffled back at the start, recovered quickly to track the pacesetter along the rail racing to the far turn but faded into upper stretch.
GIGGLES AND SMOKE tracked the pace outside foes racing to the backstretch and faded after a half.

Footnotes
A ROZE AND WINE broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace on a narrow advantage just off the inside racing into the turn, turned back a rival's
challenge along the rail racing into upper stretch to go clear and held the late challenge of DEFEND THE ROSE under strong handling to prevail. The latter
was urged inside rivals to dispute the lead in the opening stages, was held up avoiding close quarters midway through the backstretch, saved ground on the
bend, tipped outside the winner racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. DIVA DE KELA settled last while angling to the
inside racing to the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to gain a share. WINNAGER tracked the leaders outside foes
racing three deep into the turn briefly gaining contention but lacked the needed late bid. MOREISBETTER tracked off the leaders along the inside, saved
ground to upper stretch and faded in the drive. WILDLY DRAMATIC switched out while being urged to prompt the pacesetter racing into the turn and gave
way entering the stretch.
