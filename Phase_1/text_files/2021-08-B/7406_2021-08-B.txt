Footnotes
LEMON SLUSH vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch, angled outside the weakening pacesetter, surged under right handed urging and got up in
the strides. MIZZEN SPOILS chased the pace for a half, rallied two wide to make the lead, edged clear late then couldn't handle the winner. SMALLTOWN
CAT stumbled badly at the start then failed to menace. SHANGHAI LILLY broke in front, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. JUST LIKE
MA delayed the start while refusing to load, hopped out of the gate, lost contact with her field on the turn and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
ASTRO JAK prompted the pace five then two wide into the stretch, dug in late and proved best under strong handling. GIO SAMMY broke in front, set all the
pace under pressure and just failed. SMOKIN HOT ENERGY unhurried early, finished with good courage four wide. QUASAR MOON was in tight near the
half mile pole, rallied two wide into the stretch then leveled off. MR LIGHTNING BOY also in tight near the half mile pole, offered a bid three wide on the turn
then failed to sustain that bid. BUY IN never far back, inched closer in the four path on the turn then came up empty. TARTAN THE BULL also in tight
between horses near the half mile pole, dropped back. JOY OF BAPTISTRY had speed along the rail into the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
DIAMOND STATE chased the pace from the six path down the backstretch and through the turn, angled inside the leader when that one swung wide,
quickly opened a daylight lead before the furlong marker and won under mild urging. SHARKS COVE stalked the pace widest, swung to the eight path
entering the stretch and finished clear for second. EXONERATED PREZ trailed early then had a mild late rally. UPBEAT MELODY broke in front, set the
early pace in the five path, angled in a bit into the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch then tired. GET ALONG failed to menace.
WINWITHJIMMY was no threat.

into the stretch, drifted out repeatedly to the six path, dug in when joined by the winner but finished second best. CALTHA pressed the pace into the turn,
loomed boldly two wide nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished. CEVICHE broke outward bumping the winner at the start then trailed.
