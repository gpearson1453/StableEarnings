Footnotes
MALIBU MIDNIGHT raced near the back in the beginning, moved up around the final turn, angled to the outside, made a wide rally, dueled down the stretch
with FLURRY OF FEATHERS and proved the best. FLURRY OF FEATHERS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home
stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. MISS MIRACLE GIRL went to the front, drove clear and lacked a late kick. QUIET BARBARA
raced within contention, saved ground and weakened. TEXAS SPRING raced evenly near the back, had an outside trip and was never a factor. C. F.
SHELAUH void of early speed, finished wide and was no threat. SIBERIANPRODUCTION raced in the middle of the field in the early part and dropped
back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

ASTOUNDING stalked the leaders in the early going, made a bid entering the home stretch, took the lead down the lane and held on well for the win.
GOBLER lacked early speed, made a late wide bid and was gaining on the winner. SUPER HANDY MAN pressed the pace, raced outside around the final
turn and proved no match for the top two. GRAND ATLANTIC went to the front, drove clear and weakened down the final stretch. DUE APEAL raced near
the middle of the pack, eased back, moved up late, but was no factor. SENATOR CON raced in the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late.
LUCKY STREAKER raced within striking distance, faded and was outrun. ITS A CITY DAY always raced near the back and showed little. RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
