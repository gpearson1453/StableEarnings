Footnotes
SAMURAI QUEEN led early, set a pressured pace, was headed mid backstretch, forced the issue from mid turn, rebid a furlong out and drove clear,
widened under steady encouragement and was taken in hand near the wire. CINDERVELLA stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn,
was all out through the stretch and was just up for place. LADIES SIGNATURE broke outward a bit but gained command mid backstretch, led into the turn,
set a pressured pace, was engaged and headed a furlong out and chased to the end but lost position late. TWIRLING WIND stalked the pace, was hustled
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. LEON AZUL broke outward a little and settled at the back of the pack, was
hustled two to four-wide through the turn but failed to menace in the stretch. WAKE UP MAGGIE, at the rear early, chased along the rail and two-wide on
the turn but evened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AMALFI SKY allowed two pairs if foes to go out in front, settled along the inside and advanced without pressure to nestle in behind the leaders late on the
turn, angled out to get a seam between the pacesetters in upper stretch and drove by the pace survivor at the sixteenth pole, inching away late. PLEDGE
chased the top pair inside a rival, came three to four wide to loom outside the leaders turning for home, came widest to run down the pace survivor for place
late. MAGICAL SOUL led inside a rival down the backside, shook off that presser late on the turn and opened up in upper stretch but was caught and
passed by the winner at the sixteenth pole and lost the place spot late. SCATTER THE CLOUDS broke slow and settled off the pace, closed behind the
winner in the two path on the turn, came out to the five path in upper stretch and bested the balance with an outside run. BODACIOUS MISS threw her head
in the air at the start and trailed the field, closed along the rail on the turn and angled out in upper stretch, encountered some traffic at the eighth pole and
ran evenly down to the wire. SWIRLING DANCER stalked and pressed the early leader until late on the turn, retreating from that point to the wire.
FACTOIRE chased the top pair outside a rival, began to fade when four to five wide on the bend and did not recover.

Footnotes
SIR WINSTON raced three-wide in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch, drove clear a 16th out
and drew away under steady pressure. SPECIAL FORCES pressed the pace, forced the issue into the far turn, bid quickly, dueled, was headed mid stretch
and chased to the end. MALIBU MAMBO settled at the rear of the pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but leveled
off in the late stages. ROYAL LASER, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly.
MY SILENCER sprinted to the early lead, set the pace, was joined early on the far turn, dueled, but yielded approaching the stretch then faded. TIMESKIP
stalked the early pace, dropped back on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
FOR MY ELBI stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was up just in time, driving. VIRACOCHA had speed, dueled,
gained control late turn, shook clear into the stretch but was caught on the wire. LA BESTIA raced in mid pack, closed late turn, moved to the rail in the final
furlong and finished under a determined drive. PIPPI stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn then finished gamely.
BELLASPINA showed early speed, forced the pace three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. OSVETA broke outward and
bumped SHES ASTYLISH KATZ, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. RULE THE SEA
was bumped by SHES ASTYLISH KATZ at the outset and settled off the pace, moved two to four-wide late turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and
rallied in vain. SHISHKA stalked the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ was
bumped from between horses leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide into the stretch but failed to menace. SELFLESS DEVOTION
bumped with MY DAD ROCKS leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. A BIT
OF SUNSHINE moved up to duel from the rail in the early stages, gave way grudgingly late turn then tired in the stretch . MY DAD ROCKS was bumped at
the start, stalked the pace, dropped back through the turn and lacked a rally.
