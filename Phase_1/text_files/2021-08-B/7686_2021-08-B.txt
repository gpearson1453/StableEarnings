but proved a clear second. BOBBIES REASON pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, weakened and proved no match for the top two. JEWELED
CROWN challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the second turn, weakened and was outfinished for show. SWEET MILAGROS pressed the
early pace, raced outside around the first turn, faded and was no threat late. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
CARSON'S PRINCESS went to the front, saved ground, was forwardly placed throughout and drove clear down the home stretch. SAINT KENNEDY
pressed the early pace, racing rank, couldn't match strides late with the winner, but held on for second. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) raced within striking distance,
made a late bid and was outfinished for second. VITA void of early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, racing five wide,
but was no factor. LIL EVA JANE raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. CALAJA raced within contention, saved ground and faded.
BANKABLE always raced near the back and showed little. LOVE AND LEMONS raced in the middle of the field, had an outside trip and retreated to the
rear. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

up within striking distance, made a mild bid, but was no factor. REBEL VISION broke a step slow, rushed up, raced within contention and hung. T W N
LETSGOGIRL broke poorly, raced in the middle of the pack, faded and was no threat late. LITTLE GIRLS RULE raced within striking distance down the

PEEKER CINCO unhurried in the early part, racing behind the top two, moved up around the final turn, rallied and was going away at the end, under
confident handling. BRITHASGOLDENCENTS dueled on the front end, drove clear around the final turn, couldn't match strides late with the winner, but was
best of others. GOLIATH RIDGE had a tight start, racing in the rear, made a late gain, finishing wide and was a clear third. MULETRAIN lacked early speed,
made a bid down the final stretch and hung before the wire. LOOKIT dueled on the front end, saved ground and was finished early. CAPTAIN NOBLE broke
in, racing in the middle of the field and faded. PUTTER raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning, dropped back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND

the best. NICE STAR pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE
raced within striking distance, made a late wide bid and got up for show. BODEE BODEE raced in the middle of the field, made a late rail bid and was
outfinished for third. FOURTOEDFRED dueled on the front end and faded down the stretch. MY HEAVY SON lacked early speed, moved up, but was no
factor. CLASSIC'S OMEGA always raced near the back and showed little. SURPRISE SOLUTION lacked early speed, finished wide and was outrun.
