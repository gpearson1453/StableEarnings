along the rail on the final turn, was roused approaching the stretch and finished gamely. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT broke outward, stalked the pace pace,
was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn but evened out in mid stretch. SOCIAL JUSTICE settled off the pace, chased angling from the rail to
three-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. DOMINANT FACTOR raced from off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the final turn but

ARTIE MY BOY stalked the pacesetter, closed late backstretch and bid early turn, gained a short lead, was pressured by IN SEARCH OF, turned that one
back at the top of the stretch and held sway under a hand ride. PERSONAL JOURNEY settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide late turn
and rallied gamely. PAPERBACK HERO raced from off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied
outside. SUIGU STAR settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, moved back to the rail upper stretch but could only
muster a mild rally. IN SEARCH OF raced in mid pack, closed into the far turn, forced the pace three-wide, bid near the top of the stretch but was no match,
veered out a bit and evened out. VERRAZANO BRIDGE hopped out of the gate, came three and four-wide through the first turn and settled in mid pack,
was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but did not menace. MAGIC CONQUEST set a reserved pace, was headed early on the far turn, chased to the
stretch and faded. LIVERPOOL MAN reared at the start, trailed throughout, finished the course and walked off.

Footnotes
SEND THE WORD stalked in the early going, swept to the front before the turn and had a clear lead to the wire while on his wrong lead and tiring somewhat
late. BEYOND BORDERS began awkwardly and settled off the pace early, closed three wide on the turn to catch up to rivals chasing the leader, drove by
outside for second nearing the eighth pole and was gaining on the winner while not changing to his proper lead. CHUNKY MONKEY chased along the
inside, darted up the fence when the leaders drifted out turning for home and was all out to grab the show spot late. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK stalked the
early leader, stayed in the two path on the turn and was battling in the stretch when the eventual place finisher went by, causing him to lose his path,
regrouped and was inching up late for a minor award. CAPE COD sprinted clear, was no match for the winner who zoomed to the front before the turn, gave
futile chase and had the place spot in upper stretch but tired in the final furlong. KARAKONTIE PAT wide and off the pace early, three to two wide up inside
stragglers on the turn and closed with a steady rally down the stretch to best the balance. TRUECREST settled wide and off the pace early, drifting about
two to four wide near the rear on the turn, lay in upper stretch and closed mildly when straightening out in the final furlong. MIDWAY MISCHIEF began very
slowly, was far back and wide exiting the turn, did well to catch a straggler late when showing some interest. BEYOND MY DREAMS sat in mid pack and
two to three wide on the turn, dropping back steadily in the final quarter mile.

and drew clear, set the pace but was unable to stave off the winner late. MENTORING broke inward, dueled a bit then pressed the pace, chased into the

Footnotes
LONG POND advanced from midpack while three wide on the turn to loom dangerously outside the top pair, closed with great determination outside the
leader down the lane and got his head in front at the sixteenth pole, retaining that margin to the wire. BOXER BRIEF broke on top and settled outside the
two early pacesetters, hounded the pace survivor on the turn and took the lead inside the quarter pole, lost the front to the winner at the sixteenth pole but
battled on gamely to the wire. CHANCEL pressed the early leader, took over before the turn and held the front before being headed inside the quarter pole,
battled on to the final furlong and was desperate to hold the show spot late. STAR SCHOLAR chased the trio of leaders in the two path on the turn, swung
out to the four path in upper stretch and was inching up late, just missing the show spot late. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE sat in midpack along the rail, angled out
to three wide late on the turn and out in the five path in upper stretch, closing mildly widest to best the rest. RED MAPLE hit the gate at the start and rushed
up the rail to get the lead, dropped back to chase along the fence when a rival sprinted clear before the turn and was going up and down through the stretch
while losing positions in the final furlong. MILWAUKEE FIBOLT broke out and brushed with a foe at the start, along the rail and off the pace throughout,
never a threat. WASAGA fell back to trail early, always near the rear and never in contention. MR. DYDYK broke out and brushed with a rival when
straightening out, always far back and could not muster a rally.

OLYMPIC RUNNER raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail late turn, chased into the stretch, launched a determined rally and swept to the lead a
16th out, driving. TOWN CRUISE led early, set a reserved pace, quickened late turn, chased into the stretch, was passed with a 16th to run and just held
the place. MARCH TO THE ARCH was taken in hand just out of the gate as his path closed and was rated off the pace, closed along the rail then two-wide
on the turn, encountered traffic in the stretch, moved to the second path where there was room and surged up late and just missed the place. AVIE'S
FLATTER raced in mid pack, was boxed in along the rail through the turn, dove for an opening to the outside then was coming fast but hung in deep stretch.
GRAY'S FABLE pressed the early pace, stalked two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out approaching the final furlong. JOLIE
OLIMPICA (BRZ) stalked early, was hustled from mid pack two and three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. VALID POINT settled in mid
pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out upper stretch. ALFONS WALDE (IRE) raced from off the pace, chased two and
three-wide but backed away late turn, was eased at the top of the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

MISS SPEEDY, at the front early, drew off a comfortable lead, set a reserved pace, was set down upper stretch and finished under a hand ride. SILENT
CAUSEWAY was bumped by IVY'S STAR at the break, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then rallied in vain. DEJAS TOO raced in
mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the far turn and finished gamely. CHOOSE HOPE settled off the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far
turn but never reached contention. SPIDER BELLE broke inward and bumped IVY'S STAR, settled at the back of the pace, chased on the far turn but failed
to menace. IVY'S STAR bumped with the horses on both sides leaving the gate, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn but had
no closing response. HATMAKER HOLIDAY stalked the pace, was hustled into the far turn, chased, but tired upper stretch.

Footnotes

HONOUR settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished under a determined drive. SUNDANCE HIT settled off the
pace, closed two to five-wide on the turn, rallied gamely but stalled in deep stretch. PUGIN stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn, rallied, but evened out
in the late stages. UNO CHAMP settled off the pace, angled from two to five-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied from the
outside. KUDURO raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. AGNELLI settled in mid pack, came two-wide through
the turn, angled out in the stretch but lacked a closing response. PREACHER POWER lost his path at the start, settled off the pace, closed three to
five-wide on the turn, was in striking range mid stretch but flattened out. GOTTOKNOWRIGHTNOW had speed, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the
stretch, was headed quickly and gave way. TORAH'S BLESSING raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide late turn but flattened out in the final furlong.
THE NEWFIE EXPRESS settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then leveled out in the final furlong. DOUBLE THE HEART
showed speed, forced the pace, chased into the stretch but faded between foes.
