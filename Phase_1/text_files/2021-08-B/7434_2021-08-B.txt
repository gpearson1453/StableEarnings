WAILIN JOSIE in hand along the two path, moved between rivals on the turn, quickly found the lead and drew off. SPARTINA SPLASH away well, set the
off the rail while pressed, shook clear nearing the quarter pole, was hooked and then finished well but was no match. RISKY ANALYSIS forced the issue
early, tracked along the three path on the turn between rivals and weakened. LOOKIN KINDA CRAZY hopped at the start, trailed along the two path, angled
wide and failed to fire. SINGLE VERSE well placed four wide on the turn tracking outside rivals and tired.
