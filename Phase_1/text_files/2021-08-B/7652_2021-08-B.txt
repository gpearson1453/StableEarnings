Footnotes
SWEET PENELOPE set the pace along the rail and drew off under a steady drive. BRIGHT AND SHINY tracked the pace inside, angled three wide near the
five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on to gain the place. MISS YAYA chased the pace three and four wide, lacked the needed rally
but churned to gain the show. BELLA SOFI lunged at the start, saved ground and never threatened. SHARED MISCHIEF prompted the winner two wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. MCALLENS MUSIC failed to menace while racing four wide. AWESOME WINNA hit the starting gate, saved
ground well back and as never in contention. CAJUN SPICE played no factor while racing two wide. MAMMA J was outrun while racing four wide. CASA
CHA CHA made little impact while racing two wide. VICTORA'S DIAMOND was outrun inside.

Footnotes
NERVE sped clear early inside, extended the advantage through upper stretch, swapped back to his left lead a sixteenth out and had enough to hang on.
NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) broke slowly, saved ground into the turn, shifted three wide at the top of the stretch, rallied with good energy on the far outside
but ran out of ground. GONE NUTS stayed close toward the inside for three furlongs, moved out for the drive and did not have enough. MR. EXTENSION
chased outside the winner to upper stretch, and weakened. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN brushed the left side of the gate coming out, saved ground into the turn,
and did not make his presence felt. IMPETUOUS SOUL broke two lengths slow, lagged far back to the lane, and passed tired horses. GOLDEN SODA was
outrun three to four wide. CHIQUITO BABY was devoid of speed, raced greenly entering the turn, and remained far back. POSEIDON'S SON raced two to
three wide around the turn, and could not get close. AKINGISALWAYSKING was always outrun. UNIQUE TIME was finished after three furlongs three wide.

Footnotes
COREY tracked from close range inside to the far turn, moved to the two-path to challenge UNCAPTURED HEART from outside after six furlongs, took over
turning for home and drove clear. MADEIRA WINE raced between horses up the backstretch, came three wide off the far turn, and rallied outside rivals to
pick up the place. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN advanced out of the second flight two wide near the quarter-pole, loomed a threat into the lane but was
outfinished. KATIESDREAMGIRL had a ground-saving trip, and ran on with a mild response for the last major share. IRAZU was outrun two wide for six
furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch and passed tired horses. STARRY HOPE was three wide early, moved out to the four-path on the far turn, and tired
approaching the stretch. CLASSY OF COURSE lunged at the start and was off slowest, raced four to five wide throughout and made no impact.
ALEXANDRA AM I pressed the pace outside UNCAPTURED HEART for a half-mile, and was through on the far turn. UNCAPTURED HEART set the pace
inside, got overhauled by the winner at the top of the stretch and folded up.

FRECCIA D'ARGENTO pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of CHESS NOT CHECKERS through much
of the stretch then kicked clear late. CHESS NOT CHECKERS settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, reached near even
terms turning for home, dueled outside of the winner to deep stretch and settled for second best late. NORTHERN TRANSIT saved ground in range, angled
three wide turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and bested the rest. BELLAVALENCIA was off slow, trailed in the two path for a half,
swung widest leaving the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. MAIDEN VOW failed to menace while racing five wide. AWESOME APEAL vied inside for a
half and tired. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER was outrun inside. ONLY TIME played no factor while racing five wide. LOVIN MAKES CENTS set the pace two
wide between foes and stopped after a half. LIBERTALIA had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
MARTYR OF CHARITY was reserved early inside, swept up five wide advancing rapidly near the quarter-pole, reached the front from outside in upper
stretch and drew off under pressure. PANOTTI bumped with BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY at the start, improved position to loom menacingly four wide on the
far turn, could not kick on with the winner but won the battle for second. QUIET STRENGTH took closer order between horses in the two-path after six
furlongs, moved to the rail for the drive and just missed the place. POINT OF INFINITY saved ground close up through the first half-mile, got shuffled back
around the far turn on the rail, had the rider drop the crop outside the eighth-pole, and finished evenly. TOURING EGYPT put in a mild bid three wide
approaching the stretch, but flattened out. PADDY KAYE'S WILD lagged in the second flight early, went four wide on the far turn and could not gain.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY bumped with PANOTTI at the start, and was outrun. SHE'S SO SERIOUS broke a step slow, rushed up to press the early pace
outside, reached a short lead while facing several challengers after six furlongs, and faltered through the drive. CHECK TWICE hustled to the lead two wide
early, got collared on the far turn and retreated.

stalked two wide, re-bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of GODS PROMISE from there to the wire and prevailed. SEAZAN raced off the pace
four wide, closed outside and just missed. GODS PROMISE settled off the pace while racing three wide, cruised up three deep take the lead near the
quarter pole, dueled outside of the winner from there to the final strides and was denied. KING CAIRO bumped with the winner early, set the pace inside,
was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and lacked any further bids. GRRR saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in
upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. KHOZANDO failed to menace while racing four wide. REMENDADOR was fractious in the gate, had some speed
inside but was through early.

THE GREAT KATH settled in midpack early, moved inward around the turn, bid along the rail through the furlong grounds and prevailed in a blanket finish.
TREVESS eyed the dueling leaders around the turn, tipped three wide with aim into the stretch, finished gamely between horses and just missed.
AFFICIONADO (FR) saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved out past the eighth-pole and gained outside the leaders too late. HEIR BALL vied
inside KATIELEIGH to the stretch, edged away coming to the eighth-pole, finished under a hand drive as the rider did not carry a crop, and was overhauled
from both flanks. KATIELEIGH dueled outside HEIR BALL from the outset, and weakened leaving the eighth-pole. REAL DOOZIE raced two wide and failed
to factor. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT trailed to the stretch two then three wide, moved to the far outside and made no headway. TEE UP needed a shoe repair

Footnotes
CHOOSE JOY raced three wide around the turn, rallied determinedly through the stretch on her left lead, caught CAT'S ASTRAY from outside late and
edged clear. BERNIE'S MISTRESS briefly lacked room inside entering the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished with good
courage to get up for the place outside. CAT'S ASTRAY sped right to the front, showed the way inside to the stretch, and yielded through the last sixteenth
of a mile. REINAGOL chased outside CAT'S ASTRAY to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing bid. NIKEE KAN saved ground in range early, and had
no rally. FOLLOW ME MOM was a step slow at the break, moved off the inside to the four-path around the turn, and could not gain.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN TO WIN vied three wide between foes early, angled into the two path midway around the turn, vied inside of CASHIER CHECK through upper
stretch then drove clear. CASHIER CHECK disputed the pace four then three wide just outside of the winner, could not match strides with that foe in upper
stretch stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. GLORIOUS BUSINESS was bumped on both sides at the start, advanced four wide around the turn
then flattened out a bit in the lane. EUPHORIA STAR was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and improved
position. PORK CHOP had early speed two wide between foes, dropped back entering the turn, raced two wide around most of the turn, came five wide into
the lane and lacked the needed rally. HEY HIGH POCKETS had early speed inside and steadily faded. FEDERAL EXCHANGE had early speed two wide,
dropped back entering the turn, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole and continued to fade. CHROME'SRISINGSUN was bumped at the start, raced
off the pace inside, checked near the three-eighths pole and lacked a bid. SOCIAL REVOLUTION was outrun while racing four wide. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
