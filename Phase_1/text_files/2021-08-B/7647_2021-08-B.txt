Footnotes
REDDISH bobbled at the break, steadied soon after, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards.
SWEETWATER CLYDE set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. SECLUDED HARBOR broke sharply to press the
pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JAZZ STORY settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. THE
RUBY OF LIFE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. MY NAME IS SUE was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IN THE VAULT was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead with PAISLEE'S PULPIT from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew
off as a handy winner. IT'S CURLIN TIME chased the winner while racing five-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. PAISLEE'S PULPIT disputed the pace with the winner from the inside for a half and gave way. TIMELESS BELLE was reserved just off the leaders
from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. ASEAAWINNER was off a step slow and bumped, lagged early, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. PAT'S GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

JACANA settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and wore down OREO'S DREAM in the closing
yards. OREO'S DREAM broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a
clear margin with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner from over the top. HEART RIVER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. COVER TWO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, gave way to
her stable-mate into the stretch and gave way late for the minor awards. CAMDEN HIGH pressed the pace of COVER TWO while racing three-wide and
gave way after going six furlongs. BOTTLE NECK lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

PRINCE OF LUCK dueled for the lead COUNT ALEXEI while racing three-wide, vied through a vigorous drive and proved best late. COUNT ALEXEI was
away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way grudgingly in a prolonged drive. OFFICER OF WAR chased the
leaders while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. INQUISITION showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. KING CHARLIE lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten.
ADJUDGED settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. SMILE FOR ASHLEY showed brief speed and weakened.

CHRIS THE BEAVER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged nearing the quarter by MORE HONOR, vied
with that rival and held gamely. MORE HONOR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the winner nearing the
quarter, vied but could not get by that foe in the drive. DOCTOR BRUCE S. chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain in the
drive. WILD WILD KINGDOM lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. HOT ENCOUNTER settled off the leaders early,
saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. REGAZZE CAT showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BAYAKOAS IMAGE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, quickly
opened a clear lead and was ridden out to be kept to task. BROAD APPROVAL lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, moved
between foes in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. MS LYNN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a
contending position but failed to gain late. BLAZINGBELLABLU was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, reached a contending
position but lacked the needed closing response. OUR LYLA GRACE lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not threaten.
CURIOUS SENSATION sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters. LA UNA was
forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. STELLACZAR showed brief speed and weakened. AQUINAS showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and did not menace. STREET SHADOW raced four-wide through the first turn, showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TOP EXECUTIVE broke sharply to track the pace of COASTAL KID from the inside, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
vied with that foe and proved best in a stiff drive. COASTAL KID sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by
the winner into the lane, vied and just missed in a game effort. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out
in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. HOUSE OF LORDS lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished with some late run. BOBBY BRINKLEY settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive but lacked the
needed closing response. NAVAL ESCORT showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and was
not a factor. FALSELY ACCUSED raced off the pacesetters early, lugged out through the second turn and weakened. NATIONHEART settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and weakened. KOWBOYKABIN chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
CREST DRIVE pressed the pace of PURE PURSUIT while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, vied and edged away
through the closing yards. PURE PURSUIT set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with
that foe and gave way grudgingly late. OMACHE KID lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. MIKE MAN'S GOLD
was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. CRACK A COLD ONE broke in the air, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not reach contention. FINAL ROSE raced off the pacesetters early,
saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. AWESOME IMAGE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

ground through the turn and finished evenly late. WHYNOTGEORGIA chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive.
ROBBERYINPROGRESS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. RUN FOR YOUR MONEY lacked early speed,
