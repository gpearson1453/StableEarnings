Footnotes
JETTIN PEGASUS settled two wide wide into the far turn, dropped inside, checked behind the leader near the quarter pole, altered course for racing room
to the five path approaching the furlong marker, responded under a left handed whip and won going away. CIRCLE WILL RUN set the pace along the rail to
the top of the stretch, gave up the advantage to a pair of rivals, dug in gamely through the final stages and got up for second. FORTUNATE GINA chased
the pace for six furlongs, rallied two wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch, maintained controls until deep stretch then was outfinished. GIFT FROM
MOM checked repeatedly along the rail and dropped out of it on the far turn. DREAMINOFJUSTICE failed to respond. HIGH CUPPER trailed.

OUT FOR FUN broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch under right handed urging to win as much the best. BOSSY LADY
bore in at the start bumping GOODNESS SAKES, settled two wide, shifted out for racing room at the top of the stretch and rallied for second. GOODNESS
SAKES was bumped at the start, saved ground and finished with good courage along the rail. COWCHI pressed the early pace three wide, dropped back on
the turn then came on again late. WOLFIE'S PRINCESS pressured the winner into the turn then weakened. GOLOSA was outrun. LITTLE WHO had brief
speed. SASSY POWER was no threat. LUCKY PENNY ROSE lost contact with her field soon after the start, was distanced and jogged to the wire.

FLAT OUT SUPER broke in full stride to set all the pace and maintained her advantage under strong handling. PEGGY'S COVE never far back, moved up
along the inside in the turn, shifted out a bit and was steadily gaining on the winner in the three path. MISS IRISH BOSS stalked the pace three wide and
went evenly. YIELD bobbled inward at the start and closed a gap late. BELLA DUDETTE was no factor. DIXIE THREE pressed the pace two wide through
the turn and was through after a half.

Footnotes
R THREE ANGELS allowed to settle, swung wide, closed willingly near the middle of the racetrack under left handed urging and was along in time.
WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD hopped then bore out at the start, closed rapidly in the six path into the stretch, made the lead then couldn't handle the winner
while drifting out. TALE OF THE LYON chased a fast pace through the turn, inherited the lead then was outfinished. SORORITY SISTER stalked the pace
and went evenly. BUSYBEING FABULOUS raced wide and was was no factor. HOSANNA was outrun. HITCH CITY broke sharply, set a rapid pace for a
half then shortened stride and was used up. THIRDSTRINGDREAMER bore in at the start and was outrun.
