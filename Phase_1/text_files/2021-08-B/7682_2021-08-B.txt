WHERES MY HALTER was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best.
GUNZIG STINGER showed speed from the inside, had a slim lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner.
GLITTER MOUNTAIN was hustled early but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. DR CHAPPELL was in touch and
hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. KING OF AWESOME had no speed and saved ground on the turn but
was never a threat.

turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ZOOLOGICAL was unhurried early and moved up on the far turn but from the five path
at the top of the stretch needed more. SEATTLE TREASURE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the

PEPPERONI tracked the early leaders, raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. STERLING ICE stalked the
early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. DUKE OF HEARTS was off the pace, gained
ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. LILLZ NOT CRYING was in mid pack and saved ground on the turn but
needed more. SILENCIUM set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch. SAVOIA settled off the pace and had a mild gain on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. THY KINGDOM was well back and showed little in a dull effort. SEAMUS was in touch
and hustled along on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
