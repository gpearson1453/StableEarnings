SOMETHING NATURAL allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide on the far turn and through the stretch, battled late and proved best under left handed
urging. BARITONE trailed until deep stretch, surged late five wide and got up for second. LATIN SPICE stalked the pace for six furlongs, loomed boldly
three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. DIVULGENCE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, battled until
deep stretch two wide and weakened late. HOOKED A GOODWIN chased the pace along the rail into the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead
nearing the eighth pole then leveled off.
