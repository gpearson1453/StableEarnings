Footnotes
A VOW OF BEAUTY reared at the start spotting the field three lengths, in hand along the two path, continued on that path around the last turn, eased out,
asked, gained and proved best. TAPIT HAPPY JOHN in hand four wide, gained three from the rail on the last turn, four wide into the lane, took the
advantage leaving the furlong marker, asked right handed, ducked in bothering HONORABLE AVENUE leaving the furlong marker and finished second
best. HONORABLE AVENUE in hand along the two path, tracked on the last turn, slipped inside into the lane, challenged inside a furlong out, took up
nearing the sixteenths pole when TAPIT HAPPY JOHN drifted in abruptly and then failed to gain. LORENZEN rated along the three path, stayed on that
path on the last turn, angled out and failed to gain. JACKS AMERICAN PIE set the pace while pressed early, took charge along the three path after that,
was collared in upper stretch and tired. TRAPPE THE DREAM vied for the lead inside early, tracked along the rail after that and was done on the last turn.
MAGIC EARS saved ground and was done early. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, also a claim of foul was lodged by the rider of
HONORABLE AVENUE against TAPIT HAPPY JOHN for interference nearing the sixteenths pole, was not allowed.

Footnotes
TWISTED SUNSET contested the lead along the three path, four wide into the lane, shook clear and then drew off under the whip. DOUBLE D DAY broke
slow, saved ground on the turn, eased out and finished well. THREEPOINTNINENINE broke best of all, contested the lead along the rail, chased in the lane
and weakened. BOWING SNOWMAN broke slow, in hand along the two path, eased out in the lane and failed to gain. BUSS THE BELL tracked along the
three path on the turn, four wide into the lane and tired. WHISPERING WIND broke slow, three path on the turn, was outrun.
