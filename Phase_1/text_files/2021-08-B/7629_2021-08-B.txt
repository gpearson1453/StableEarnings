Footnotes
CAMP PENDLETON settled off the pace in the three path, angled five wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the stretch, closed outside,
was up leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. TINTORERO raced in range outside down the backstretch, moved four wide to the lead near the
three-eighths pole, vied outside from there to the sixteenth pole, won that duel but was unable to resist the winner. WILD TEXAS TOM was shuffled back
soon after the start, advanced five wide around the turn and stayed on to gain the show. FUN LOADED set the pace in the two path, was collared near the
three-eighths pole, fought on inside to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. SANDY DUDE had early speed two wide between foes, was shuffled back
near the quarter pole, regained some ground in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE saved ground off the pace,
steadied near the quarter pole and again near the three-sixteenths marker and passed tiring foes in the lane. BILLY YANK failed to menace while racing
three wide. PACIFIC LEGEND was in range three wide and faded through the stretch. TEXAS PLAYBOY steadied nearing the three-quarters marker,
stalked the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and was in tight through the final sixteenth. STATEN ISLAND played no factor while racing four
wide. SWIPE LEFT was outrun while racing in the three path. LUVNMESUMCAJUN broke through the starting gate but was never loose from the assistant
starter, vied in the three path for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MALLOMAR saved ground for six furlongs, waited in some traffic on the far turn, shifted off the inside in upper stretch, responded to mild urging
and ran past PLATINUMCENTS from outside under confident handling. PLATINUMCENTS sped right to the front, set a sharp pace inside, remained clear
leaving the furlong grounds but was no match for the winner late. GYPSY WIFE advanced with a four-wide run after six furlongs, but flattened out through
the stretch. MY MASTERPIECE was covered up inside and in range early, but lacked the needed rally when roused. STAR SWEPT lagged well back for six
furlongs, came three wide off the far turn and improved only mildly. LIVIN AT THE BEACH raced four wide around the far turn, and tired. HOT BABE was
urged along chasing outside PLATINUMCENTS, and gave way before reaching the stretch. SHADILEE was never prominent. SIMONELA raced forwardly
three wide early, and tired.

Footnotes
HANDSOME PRINCE pressed FIRST NAY ADMIRAL and PERSONAL MEADOW from outside early, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, pulled clear
into the stretch and widened under a drive. GUACO broke a step slow, was outsprinted four then five wide to the stretch, and rallied outside for the place.
NIMBLE BEAST saved ground throughout, and offered a mild late response to pick up the show. CAPTURED BY FATE was a step slow at the start, raced
three to four wide, and had no closing response. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL bumped lightly with STARSHIP TAXI at the start, vied early inside rivals, and
faded through the stretch. STARSHIP TAXI bumped lightly with FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL at the start, stayed in range two to three wide, and tired in the
stretch. HERE COMES BULLET was outrun to the stretch, and could not gain on the far outside. PERSONAL MEADOW argued the pace between horses
for three furlongs, and had nothing left. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FIVE-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

KHOZMORE stalked the pace two wide, split rivals three wide turning for home, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a drive.
LOVELORN LADY stalked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole, was no match for that foe
but stayed on to be clearly second best. AMERICAN OF COURSE dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened. TIZ ENOUGH was bumped at the start,
raced well back two wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. IDEAL BREEZE broke out and bumped TIZ ENOUGH at the start, sped forward soon after,
dueled along the rail to midstretch and tired. SHES ALL WOMAN failed to menace while racing four wide. FOOLISH HEART broke in a tangle, recovered to
show speed inside but was through early.

Footnotes
ETERNAL REST vied three wide into the first turn, cleared off and moved inside to the backstretch, rated along to the stretch, and widened steadily under a
drive. EYE OF THE TEMPLE raced two wide around the turns in range, could not keep pace with the winner turning for home, but ran on well enough to
secure second. OCTOBER TIME bumped with BOWSTRING BOY at the start, chased outside the winner, came under a ride on the far turn, could not make
an impression and was outfinished for the place between horses. FROSTY WARRIOR raced near the two-path toward the back for six furlongs, and offered
a mild response on the rail to share the show. CURMUDGEON saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved outside and passed tired horses. LINGUINI
saved ground early, took the far turn three to four wide, and did not menace. MORE ADVENTUROUS bumped with BOWSTRING BOY at the start,
advanced up the backstretch outside, and tired after six furlongs. JUST PLAIN ORNERY raced in the four-path while outrun. PRINCIPE tired inside after six
furlongs. CUPID'S DUDE raced four to five wide, and faded after a half-mile. BOWSTRING BOY was bumped lightly between horses at the start, raced in
the second flight three wide, checked nearing the quarter-pole and dropped far back.

Footnotes
COUNTY COURT lacked speed while racing two wide, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, circled the field to take over turning for home, drove
clear leaving the eighth pole and held safe under a drive. DIZZY GILLESPIE tracked the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and rallied outside. CANDY
CRUSHEM disputed the pace two wide and fought on inside of foes through the lane. RANGER UP stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing
the lane, continued on the left lead and weakened. KEEPSAKEKITTEN raced off the pace in the three path, swung widest in upper stretch and never
threatened. SWING WEST was in a bit tight the start, chased the pace four wide and tired in the drive. SO LONG CHUCK dueled inside for six furlongs,
faltered in upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
DIAMOND WOW grabbed the lead after the start, moved clear after three furlongs, and drifted out while widening through the lane. OPALINA steadied soon
after the start, saved ground unhurried for three-eighths of a mile, moved out rallying in upper stretch, and finished with good energy. LADY PUCHI was
outrun early, saved ground into the stretch and rallied mildly on the rail. VELOCISSIMA pursued outside the winner to the stretch, and faded through the
closing stages. TEMERITY pressed the early pace between horses, and tired coming off the turn. DOVE IN CHARGE raced four wide, steadied behind
horses approaching the top of the stretch, and had no rally. SNEAKY CHEEKY advanced late on the turn while shifting out four wide, but could not sustain
the rally. BRUSH WITH THE LAW (IRE) raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired. RESTORATION hit the left side of the gate at the start, and never
got close. MITESSE pressed the pace outside rivals early, and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
OUTFOXED was reluctant to load, settled off the early pace outside, entered the turn five wide, made a quick move toward the front, angled down to the
three path nearing the three-eighths pole, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew off, angled in in upper stretch and widened under a
steady drive. DEVILETTE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, had no answer for the winner but stayed on to hold second.
MY SASSENACH chased the pace three wide between foes and was along for the show. SEQUIN LADY was in range inside, angled three wide near the
quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. VEILED PROPHET steadied early, raced two wide and never threatened. NOBLE DREAMER pressed the pace two
wide and tired after a half. DEMURELY hit the rail nearing the three-quarters marker, raced well back inside, had the rider lost the whip midway around the
turn and had no bids. SPECTACULAR GAL checked leaving the three-quarters pole, made little impact while racing two wide and was vanned off. DEAR
MAMA MIA chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. RACHEL'S ROCK was fractious pre-race, broke awkwardly, rushed up between foes
down the backstretch but was through early. LLUVIA broke a bit awkwardly and trailed throughout. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF
SPECTACULAR GAL AGAINST RACHEL'S ROCK WAS NOT ALLOWED. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE CITY cleared over to the inside with the lead soon after the start, rated along to the stretch, and widened under a steady drive. ROSA STAR
prompted SUNSHINE CITY from the outside, could not gain under pressure after six furlongs, and ran on to hold the place. SHORT CIRCUIT was three
wide into the first turn, moved inward approaching the far turn, came back out to the four-path at the top of the stretch, and rallied mildly. RIVETING SPIRIT
had a rail trip, and could not keep pace after six furlongs. CRYSTAL COAST advanced three wide after six furlongs, then flattened out. APPOINTED was
urged along between horses into the far turn, but gave way approaching the stretch. QUEEN STREET raced three to four wide early, and tired after a
half-mile.

Footnotes
KHOCU broke to the lead, rated along inside to the stretch, and stayed clear under a drive. SWEENEY'S CAT was slow early, began to advance after a
half-mile, came four wide into the stretch and rallied gamely outside the winner. CAMPEADOR was slow early, advanced through the middle stages three
wide, rallied through the lane but needed more. JOYFUL SURPRISE bumped with WROTE IN STONE at the start, saved ground close up to the stretch,
and was outfinished. FROZEN ASSETS became fractious entering the track, unseated the rider and briefly got loose before being apprehended, went to
post keyed up, reared up in the gate unseating the rider prior to the start, broke slowly and failed to menace. BILLY BONES broke a step slow, was far back
to the stretch, and went by stragglers. NONA RAC broke out bumping ASYMPTOMATIC into FORTIFIED, steadied entering the far turn inside, moved out
four wide to the lane and made no impact. HIGH PRESS was strung out five wide into the first turn, and tired after a half. FORTIFIED got bumped at the
start, and was always outrun. WROTE IN STONE bumped with JOYFUL SURPRISE at the start, steadied into the far turn, and tired. ASYMPTOMATIC
(IRE) got bumped into FORTIFIED by NONA RAE at the start, showed speed to the far turn three wide, and faltered. TINKER'S PAL was four wide early,
and retired after a half.
