MAGIC IN A HAT gained the early lead, pulled away leaving the turn and proved clearly best under steady pressure. MARILYN'S MAGIC settled well,
advanced on the turn and managed a mild three wide bid in the stretch. PRINCESS VITA was outpaced while three wide and lacked a rally. BATTLESHIP
MARY forced the pace and weakened. GOLDEN SHOT showed little interest. ISA'S NIGHT FLIGHT was sluggish at the start and always outrun.

SASSY AIN'T I settled well, advanced on the far turn, rallied while three wide in the stretch and was along in time. OLIVE OYL reserved early, commenced
a bid on the far turn, was swung five wide for the stretch run and closed ground. REBEL RISING stalked the early pace, dueled around the far turn and gave
way grudgingly in the late going. BAYLEYWICK set a contested pace, remained in contention for the stretch run and was worn down in the last forty yards.
TAPTHATLUCK broke outwardly, raced forwardly while four wide and lacked a rally. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE was outpaced and put forth a dull try.
