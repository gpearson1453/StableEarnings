Footnotes
I CAME TO SHAME joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issues outside rivals into the turn, shook clear nearing upper stretch,
angled to the inside entering the lane and widened late under some left handed pressure. ROSEHILL ROAD, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the
opening stages, dropped off the leaders while switching out three wide leaving the turn and proved best of the others. EXODUS AND HOPE, restless in the
gate prior to the start, was off a bit slowly, settled last to the turn, drifted wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for a share.
DIGGS WON lost some position avoiding close quarters at the start, angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and continued evenly
between foes to late stages. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE broke sharply, vied briefly for command three wide between foes racing into the turn and gave way
nearing the lane. TIKA TOY, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
RUSTY CAGE broke sharply, was urged between rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, edged clear leaving midstretch under
firm encouragement. NEVERBLINK, urged inside foes prompting the pace from the outset to upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late. DIGITAL
STAR, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled into stride, switched out four wide racing through the turn and continued with interest to improve position.
BLAME BISHOP bobbled at the start, was righted to track off the leaders along the inside, tipped out racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick.
RASMUS, urged four wide in the opening stages prompting the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. TRULY BLING, pulling while caught in close
quarters three wide between foes racing to the turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. SEEK N JUSTICE ducked out bumping at the start and dropped out
early.

Footnotes
BIT COINER, forwardly placed three wide between foes in opening stages, continued with a steady advance to challenge for command nearing upper
stretch, wrested the advantage and held safe the late bid of WILL THE THRILL under firm handling. The latter, under pressure four wide pursuing the
leaders into the turn, continued willingly in that path to close the gap late. HOYA PARANOYA, forwardly placed along the inside racing just behind the
pacesetter, steadied in close quarters racing through the turn, switched out three wide entering the lane and prevailed for a share. SAINT CHARLES broke
sharply, was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but weakened in the drive.
FORTY STRANGERS tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, drifted out five wide under pressure racing into the stretch and finished evenly
late. MAX OUT tracked the pace outside foes racing to the turn, altered course avoiding a drifting rival racing into upper stretch but made no real
impression. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL hesitated at the start to break well behind the field and failed to menace thereafter. TENGO SED flashed brief pace
between foes racing to the turn but was spent early. O G GULFSTREAM GUS settled inside foes and faded from contention early.

Footnotes
PRINCESS RENEE tracked just off the first flight along the inside under light rating to the backstretch, came under some prompting to maintain striking
distance racing into the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch, angled four wide nearing the furlong marker and found a solid late response to wrest a
clear advantage under firm right handed pressure. PRIDDIS ducked out at the start, was righted, then urged three deep prompting the pace racing into the
backstretch, pressed the issue in that path to gain the advantage midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. PINK CHANNEL, brushed
at the start, was urged to terms prompting the pace between foes into the backstretch, pressed inside foes into upper stretch and weakened late. K B'S
MINT broke sharply, angled to the inside to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage through the first turn, dueled inside foes through the backstretch into the
far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA, jostled at the start, settled outside a rival racing in the last flight to the
backstretch, shifted to the four path nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no late response. METAPHAR broke outwards bumping
SMOKING BOSSA NOVA soundly at the start, settled along the inside to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge.

Footnotes
BLAZING CHARM tracked off the first flight along the rail racing through the backstretch, advanced in tandem with a rival entering the turn, tipped outside
the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage from that foe and went clear under pressure. LA ROSA DRIVE broke sharply, angled to the
inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the turn, dispatched that foe nearing upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. REMARKABLE CHARM tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and
continued with interest to improve position. PURPLE SCOOTER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper
stretch. SILVERA tracked off the first flight between foes to the turn and faded into upper stretch. SWEET TATUM, caught in close quarters, then taken up in
the opening furling, shifted outside rivals racing through the backstretch but offered no rally. BINDING TIME, off a bit slowly, switched out four wide, was
urged to gain a position in second flight pursuing the leaders into the turn and came up empty after a half. MISS KITAEN, off slowly, settled along the inside
and trailed the field into the stretch.

Footnotes
DUSTY FORD was slow into stride out of the gate, moved up to the pacesetter very quickly nearing the half mile pole then took clear command at the three
eighths pole and drew off in the lane. MOONSHINE MOXY broke welll, showed good early speed three wide, failed to match strides with DUSTY FORD,
battled gamely through the lane to hold on to a clear second. ADDED DIAMONDS brief speed on the inside near the rail, lost position while getting in tight
when cut off by CHARLIES MISSILE entering the bend, shifted out and came on late to edge multiple foes for show. CLAIRE SAILING tracked the pace
from midpack, angled out three wide in the lane and ran evenly through the stretch. HUNTER'S MAGIC was well back in the early going, angled inside off
the bend and passed a tiring foe late. CHARLIES MISSILE broke sharp, showed good early speed to take command, failed to match strides with DUSTY
FORD and faded in the stretch. LIL HOLY OAK stumbled at the break, unhurried early well back in the field and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BIRDIE BE GONE moved forward quickly with right-handed pressure to forced the pace on the outside, took command at the quarter pole and held sway
through the lane. KNIGHT'S HONOR broke sharply out of the gate, dueled for the lead down the backstretch, battled to the top of the lane, lost command
then drifted in slightly brushing FLASH FLOOD and was outfinished to the wire while holding on to the place. FLASH FLOOD tracked the early pace on the
inside, saved ground through the bend, attempted to sneak through on the rail but was shied in getting in tight between the rail and KNIGHT'S HONOR then
steadied, backed out, altered course out wide and finished willingly. CELTICS WILDCAT chased the pace three wide into the bend and flattened out in the
lane. DODROPIN lacked early speed into the turn and passed tiring foes. HOLY IMAGE was well back early, four wide off the turn and gained mildly in the
lane. STYLIN N PROFILIN no early speed and proved no factor. MIDNIGHT CURRENT was off slowly and proved no threat. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH DRIVE RESULTED IN THE DISQUALIFICATION OF KNIGHT'S HONOR FOR INTERFERING WITH FLASH FLOOD MIDSTRETCH.
KNIGHT'S HONOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
WILD BEHAVIOR broke well from the gate, dueled three wide into the bend, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drove clear. MINE MY TIME tracked
three wide into the bend, commenced bid at the quarter pole but failed to match strides with WILD BEHAVIOR to the wire and settled for place. DRIED
PEPPER forced the early pace between foes into the bend, battled to the quarter pole then weakened in the lane but held on for show. HI HO CHEERIO
was off slow, tracked the pace on the rail and had no late gain to get into contention. BIG LEAGUE BENNY lacked early speed out of the gate, settled four
wide and failed to menace. TIGER THE MAN was sent for the lead on the rail, dueled to the bend and faded. JERSEY LUTE lacked early speed then trailed
past the half mile pole. DUE TO A DATA ISSUE A BACKUP TIME HAS BEEN USED.

evenly for show. BIG BOY MCCOY was far back throughout and proved no factor. SIR BARNABUS was unhurried in the early going and proved no threat.
