MINISTER OF SOUL was rated in the early stages down the backstretch, took command through the far turn, drew well clear in the drive under strong
pressure and was in hand in the latter stages. DRENA'S STAR showed good early speed from the inside but was no match for the winner in the stretch run.
IMPACT PLAYER settled to back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, was three wide in the lane and had not enough for the top pair.
KELLER'S GOLD stalked the early pace, raced three to four wide through the upper stretch and had no response.

match strides with the winner to finish second best. SHAKES CREEK stalked the early pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch to challenge but had
not enough in the drive. MITHQAAL was allowed to settle off the early going, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. CHEST CANDY
dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response. CAN IMAGINE showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and gave

ROVERTON stalked the early pace, moved up to challenge Getcha near the quarter pole, raced three wide in the lane and proved best to get up under
strong encouragement. GETCHA showed good early speed from the inside to set all the pace, was challenged around the far turn, dug in nearing the eighth
pole but couldn't hold off the winner to finish second best. SHAKELAS DESTINY was unhurried in the early stages, moved up five wide into the upper
stretch and was no match for the top pair. ME AND ROSE settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide through the lane had not enough. HAS THE
GLORY was forwardly placed early on, raced three wide and tired in the drive. GUEST CHECK was checked in the early stages, raced towards the inside
throughout and never was a factor. BOOM TRUCK raced four wide around the first turn, was four wide near the quarter pole and never threatened.
HONEY'S COWBOY SOX raced five wide nearing the seven eighths pole, was far back and never threatened.

THEALLIGATORHUNTER raced five wide around the first turn, showed good early speed down the backstretch, took command into the upper stretch,
drifted to eight or nine path, veered in sharply just past the sixteenth pole, came out sharply once again just past the wire and prevailed under steady
handling after racing erratic through the stretch run. A stewards inquiry was lodged for interference in the stretch and ruled no change. BAYOU BENNY
stalked the early pace, challenged the leader through the far turn, was forced to alter course inside the sixteenth by a bearing in Thealigatorhunter, took up
sharply after the wire by rival coming out sharply and finished willingly to the wire. KID'S INHERITANCE stalked the early pace, raced near the inside
around the far turn through the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. LAST MARTINI was allowed to settle early on, raced four wide near the quarter
pole and had not enough in the drive. OUT RUN'M dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and failed to respond. SOTA KING pressed the lead
from the inside and tired.

near the inside in the lane and had no late response. OWEN'S PLEASURE was unhurried early on, raced four wide deep around the far turn, was five wide

Footnotes
ZOE'S DELIGHT stalked the early pace, challenged the leader near the quarter pole, dug in late and proved best under all out pressure. CINCO STAR
pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely but couldn't get by a determined Zoe's Delight. DAME PLATA was
allowed to settle early on, raced thee wide around the far turn, angled five wide through the stretch and showed good late interest. TWOKO BAY was
unhurried early on, raced near the rail in the drive and had not enough.. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced
between rivals in the upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
READY TO RUNAWAY showed good early speed to set all the pace, was challenged by Shabam nearing the quarter pole, responded well to keep a clear
margin, raced in hand into the upper stretch, was asked briefly inside the eighth pole under a steady hand ride, opened up a clear margin and was a handily
winner. SHABAM stalked the early pace, moved up to challenge the leader near the quarter pole, raced near the three path through the stretch and was no
match for the winner. HOTASAPISTOL tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, raced near the rail in the drive and weakened. TIMBER
LADY was slow early, raced far back and never threatened.
