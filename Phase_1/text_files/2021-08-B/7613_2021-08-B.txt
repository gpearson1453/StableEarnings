Footnotes
BRING DA FUDGE lost her path just out of the gate, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and had
command mid stretch under a drive. JUNGLE GODDESS, in range, chased two to four-wide on the turn, led upper stretch but was headed a 16th out but
finished best of the rest. TOUCH OF ROUGE settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five wire on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied in
vain. I AM I SAID dueled briefly then forced the issue into the turn, chased two and three-wide to the stretch then finished gamely to no avail. ELITE SONG,
in touch, chased from the rail on the turn but leveled out mid stretch. LEAVE IT WITH ME showed brief speed, chased three-wide on the turn but lacked a
closing response. SILENT DIXIE dueled, led into the turn, shook clear mid turn but was passed upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TALL WATER devoid of early foot, commenced a rally two to three wide on the turn and tipped out to the six path in upper stretch, drove by the leader with
the eventual place finisher to his inside at the sixteenth pole and outgamed that foe to the wire. CHASING VINNY chased between rivals early, dropped
back late backstretch before rallying to the flank of the leader in upper stretch, took that one on inside the winner at the sixteenth pole but couldn't match the
victor's kick, stubbornly battling to the wire. HIDDEN JUSKIDDIN sprinted clear, held the advantage until the sixteenth pole when the top pair drove by, then
all out late to hold onto the show spot. KEEN SAMURAI leapt up at the start and was at an immediate disadvantage, tried to get into range on the rail but
was steadied out to trail on the turn, came out in upper stretch and closed with a big rush late but could not overcome his early difficulties. PUGIN broke out
at the start, recovered quickly to chase three wide, moved up to stalk on the turn and bid turning for home but levelled off at the furlong marker. DARK ALE
settled along the rail off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and angled out in upper stretch but stalled at the sixteenth pole, running evenly to the wire.
VALUABLE PILLOW chased along the inside, was in behind the leaders at the top of the stretch but outrun in the final furlong. WHITE WEDDING off the
pace in the two path throughout, rallied mildly in the three path down the lane but stalled in the final seventy yards. SPANISH MAJOR wide and off the pace
down the backside, made up some ground while three-wide on the turn before dropping back approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE stalked the pace, angled in from three to two-wide through the turn, was all out in the stretch and swept to the lead a 16th out under a
drive. ANITA GRIGIO bumped with DIVINE MARTHA leaving the gate, settled in range, chased along the rail through the turn, encountered traffic upper
stretch, angled out and finished gamely. HALFINTHEWRAPPER led quickly, set a reserved pace, drew away late turn but was passed a 16th out and
chased in vain. FASHION FLIRT raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn and chased determinedly through the stretch. PLUIE D'AVRIL, in
touch, hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn, was fanned out a bit at the top of the stretch and finished evenly. DIVINE MARTHA, bumped at the
start, pressed the pace, chased two-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. FLAWLESS PINK settled off the pace, dropped back early turn,
saved ground but was never contentious. POST TO POST broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

pace, closed angling in from three-wide to the rail but was blocked late turn, then was impeded again upper stretch and rallied once clear. OUR ZUMA raced
in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, bid a furlong out and was game but outkicked. NOW WE ARE NINE was steadied leaving
the gate, settled in mid pack, dropped back early turn, chased to the stretch and rallied belatedly. PINK LEMONADE, away slowly and off the pace, closed
three to five-wide on the turn the finished gamely. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST pressed the pace, forced the issue into the turn, bid at the 1/4 pole but gave way
at the top of the stretch. THOR'S THUNDER set a pressured pace, was joined late turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch then was passed a furlong out
