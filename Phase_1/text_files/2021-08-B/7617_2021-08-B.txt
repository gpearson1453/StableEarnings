PAULIE WALNUTS hurried away, moved up alongside FREUDS VISION to contest the lead, moved clear approaching the stretch and held safely. DANZA
UNBRIDLED raced four wide into the opening turn, moved up menacingly early stretch but was not able to stall the winner. TRICKY SPEEDSTER angled to
rail to save ground leaving the backstretch and closed well late. GWIZZ stalked three wide and lacked a kick. FREUDS VISION led the field through the
backstretch, dueled inside in the turn and wilted in stretch. GOLD'S UP pulled up shortly after leaving the gate, did not finish and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CAPA BELLA zipped to the front leaving the chute, saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, dueled through the final turn inside of NO
COLLUSION then widened when given her cue. QUEEN RHONDA trailed the field through the backstretch, swung out then closed outside and just got by
for place. NO COLLUSION tracked from the three path, moved up alongside CAPA BELLA nearing the three eighths pole but lacked the rally needed and
was edged out late. LIGHT FAST FEET unhurried early then settled in range, chased the leaders through the final turn and flattened out late. COUNT ON IT
tracked inside and lacked a bid. KENTUCKY ROLL prompted the pace while four to five wide and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

THESHACK pressed the pace through the backstretch, saved ground in the turn, then struck the front when asked at the head of the stretch and edged
away. RAILWAY tracked the pacesetters in second flight, came under heavy urging nearing the stretch drive and nipped rival for place. VICTORY AT LAST
away alertly, took pressure leaving the backstretch, held a slim advantage near the quarter pole but was unable to sustain the bid that was required and was
caught late. PULL THE PIN sat in range outside and tired. MARANGO rated off the pace outside and failed to menace. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE trailed the
field leaving the chute, saved ground and tired early. ALL THAT GOLD offered little.

Footnotes
PADDYSDAYCHARM vied for the lead then set the pace through the backstretch, responded to looming threat from FLAT OUT LEADER moving clear and
held safely. FLAT OUT LEADER tracked outside, raced three wide through the turn, loomed boldly nearing the stretch, but was unable to stall the winner
and held firmly for place. WHODUNIT saved ground racing three wide, advanced outside in the last turn and lacked the needed surge for impact. DIVALDO
positioned inside early, drove three wide into the lane, angled out to the three path and moved to rail in the final furlong to weaken. COMMISSION MAN sat
off the pace while five wide, dropped back through the turn and yielded. SMILEY sat in striking range in the three path and faded steadily on rail. CODE OF
THE WEST never reached contention.

Footnotes
PERDITION sat off the pace from the four path, launched a bid for command near the quarter pole, wore down IMPERIALITE through the stretch and
prevailed under a drive. IMPERIALITE set a pressured pace from the two path, took pressure through the turn and was worn down deep stretch after a long
drive. AWESOME KNIGHT pressed three wide, rallied determinedly between into the stretch and gave way in the late stages. BONANZA CREEK rated well
of the pace outside and showed a mild interest late under encouragement. BRING HOME STANLEY broke slow, chased inside and tired. OUR MONEY
CAT showed little. BLAZING CHANNING hustled inside, lacked running room inside leaving the backstretch and was done early.

PROOF IT taken back early, advanced quickly through the final turn, shifted out to the four path nearing the three sixteenth marker then gathered
momentum and won driving. SOUTHERN WARLORD sat just off the early pace, matched strides through the turn outside of IMPOSING CAT, forged to the
lead into the stretch and was out finished. MY LUCKY MARK tracked the pacesetters from the rail, chased four wide on the turn, continued in contention
through the stretch and secured show. IMPOSING CAT vied for the early lead, took pressure through the far tur inside of SOUTHERN WARLORD, was
unable to move on with rival at the head of the stretch and yielded. REGAL CANDY allowed to settle and bid belatedly. REDNECK REMARK squeezed out
away from the gate then trailed the field and chased to no avail. BURNIN' POCKETS showed good outside speed, fanned four wide through the far turn and
faded. OJO DEL MAR chased four wide through the backstretch and was done early. WILSON chased outside and was outrun.

Footnotes
ITS ALL ON SLEW saved ground from rail, angled out to the three path leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly nearing the quarter pole, was headed into
the stretch and drove clear. BRIOSO vied inside of VISION QUEST leaving the chute, pressed from just off the rail in the two path, held on top in the final
turn, but was no match for the winner in the stretch. BARE BACK JACK tracked the pacesetters from the two path, began bid nearing the quarte pole then
angled to rail early stretch and finished evenly. LONESOME CAT lodged a rail bid into the lane after the quarter pole and improved late. WISER TIMES
stalked the pacesetters while racing four wide through the backstretch and offered a late rally. LONE PIONEER attended the pace while four to five wide,
fanned three wide through the turn and faded gradually in stretch. VISION QUEST held a slim advantage going through the backstretch, was unable to
move on with rivals nearing the quarter pole and gave way. DEVILS COMMAND never reached contention. PATRICK was never involved.
