Footnotes
MAXINE MACHINE settled off of the pace in the two path, tracked the leading quartet from along the inside around the far turn, slipped inside of a trio of
foes in upper stretch to claim place as DELIGHTFUL MOMENT kicked clear, switched outside of that foe at the furlong grounds, and rallied to drive past that
foe passing the sixteenth pole. DELIGHTFUL MOMENT set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids down the backstretch, scooted clear of those
pressing foes entering the lane, but was bested by an outer oncharging rival passing the sixteenth marker. EMERALD stalked along the inside, shifted
outside of the trio of dueling leaders into the far turn, but failed to match strides with the innermost rival of that group in upper stretch, chased before being
outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, and kept on thereater. SURPRISING prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses into the far turn, but gave
way entering the lane. GIDDY UP ZOEY stalked two wide around the first turn, produced an early three wide bid for the lead approaching the nine
sixteenths pole, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the stretch, and faded. HADLEN was outrun after a bit of a slow start. VIMONT
broke outwardly multiple paths, and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
ALEC AND ARTHUR cleared off early on, widened his advantage around the turn and into upper stretch, then held sway through the final furlong while
under driving pressure. BEAUMONT BEAUX tracked three wide, chased the clear leader through the lane while outside of CLEARLY MAD, and caught that
foe in the final sixteenth for place. CLEARLY MAD stalked two wide, chased the clear leader through the lane, but lost place to an outer foe in the late
stages. PEQUENO GRANDE lied far off of the pace two to three wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, and rallied to cut the gap on the leaders through
the final furlong. WAVE LAND OUTLAW bumped with an inner foe the start, trailed the field around the turn, then passed tiring foes late. GRATIFIED
bumped with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but failed to rally. HUGH B.
chased along the inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
LA BELLA ROSA settled off of the pace four wide, gained in hand turning for home, tipped five wide entering the lane, drove past inner leaders approaching
the furlong grounds, and drew clear with good energy. GRAN CHEMIN tracked the pace three to two wide around the turns, aimed to produce a foe-splitting
bid entering the lane, but was forced inwards and lost momentum when MISS GETTY UP drifted into her path passing the three sixteenths pole, got
outkicked by the eventual winner in the process, then stayed on to claim place. FLORIS pressed the pace three wide into the first turn, but was wrangled
back into the bend, got steadied incessantly by the rider around that turn and well down the backstretch, lost multiple positions in the process, shifted
outside of foes into the far turn, produced a five wide sweeping blitz around that bend to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper
stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole, and flattened out. PERSEVERING saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide in
midstretch, and willingly produced a good belated kick to miss show. MISS GETTY UP was taken in hand at the start after breaking a bit inwards, improved
around the first turn to an inside stalking position, split foes into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, briefly showed the way entering the
lane, but drifted inwards passing the three sixteenths pole, and faltered. BRODY SLAM trailed, took the far turn three wide, and failed to factor. ANNA'S
MOONLIGHT set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, disposed of those foes before being headed by a pair of other rivals turning for home, then was
cut off passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. VALLEJO prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but faded into the far turn. ABOVE
MINE pressed three wide, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
DETROIT CITY brushed an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, met LUNAR ROCKET's bid at the five sixteenths pole, dug in to maintain an
advantage entering the lane, bumped with that foe in upper stretch creating separation, then stoutly kicked clear passing the furlong grounds, and drew off
with a strong finish. LUNAR ROCKET bobbled at the start before being brushed by an outer foe, stalked along the inside before tipping two wide into the
turn, ranged up to the leader with five sixteenths remaining, dueled turning for home, but was bumped while being repelled in upper stretch, then kept on to
prove second best. STORMY SUMMIT tracked three wide into the turn, cut down to the two path while chasing the dueling leaders entering the lane, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals in upper stretch, and proved best of the rest. COHESION saved ground off of the pace, then improved mildly without
threatening. SHACKLESFLY chased two wide, then three wide around the turn, but weakened turning for home. GREAT NORTH trailed throughout and was
outrun.

Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER pressed two wide, bid into the turn, vied while maintaining a narrow margin around that bend, then drew clear of his inner counterpart at the
furlong grounds, and was driven home to seal the deal. CONVENTION bumped with an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace, saved ground around
the bend, inched closer turning for home before tipping three wide entering the lane, bumped EASTSIDE COOL in the process, then rallied to gain place a
sixteenth out, and held that position from an outer foe to the wire. NOTARY trailed in the three path around the turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and
rallied outside of foes through the final furlong, but failed to reach place. BEZOS set the pace, sparred inside of JOE FRAZIER around the turn after that foe
produced a bid, then gave way to him at the furlong grounds. CAVE HILL lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and was outrun. EASTSIDE COOL
bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked early on, lost ground to the leading pair into the turn, chased them two wide before being pushed four wide
entering the lane, then faltered while lugging in on his left lead.

Footnotes
MILLIKEN bumped with an outer foe in the early stages, stalked the group of leaders from along the inside, glided through ample racing room into the turn to
bid for the lead inside of pair of foes at the three furlong pole, showed the way thereafter, drew clear of those rivals entering the lane, and widened willingly
under brisk hand urging. CRUMP was slow into stride and trailed the field early on, came into the bend two wide, cleared an inner foe before slipping inside
of inner foe turning for home in pursuit of the leaders, shifted four wide and outside of those rivals entering the lane, then rallied for place while proving no
match for the winner. SUPPRESSOR set the pace inside of multiple pressing rivals while staying multiple paths off of the inner railing, allowed for clear
racing room for the eventual winner who produced a bid into the turn, got headed passing the three furlong pole while between horses, proved no match for
her inner rival entering the lane, then held show through the final furlong. HERE MI SONG pressed the pace four wide, then outside of a pair of foes around
the turn, proved no match for the innermost rival entering the lane, and faded. B MAKER received bumps from rivals on either side in the opening furlong,
tracked the pace two wide, shifted five wide into the turn, and failed to make an impact. MY MIRACLE MAN prompted the pace three wide and between
horses, but faded into the turn. SILVER TAP bumped with an inner foe early on, then was outrun. THIRTYEIGHT vied for the lead two wide and from
between horses, but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
SIGNIFY tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, tipped outside of the leading trio while commencing a rally turning for home, sustained that
advance to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. TOUCH OF CLASS prompted the pace two wide, sustained vying position in pursuit of
CONGRATULATED through midstretch, ranged up to that foe at the sixteenth pole as SIGNIFY rallied alongside, and got outkicked by that rival.
CONGRATULATED set the pace along the inside, resisted outer bids through midstretch, but yielded to a pair of foes passing the sixteenth pole. MADAME
READY stalked two wide, but only managed to chase the leaders evenly through the lane. SPARKLE OF HOPE settled far off of the pace three wide,
shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim a minor share. URSULINA lied off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and
stayed on, but was outfinished for a minor piece. BIZZY ECHO broke inwards, tugged forward to lie just behind the pace setter while a bit keen along the
inside, maintained stalking position around the turn, but gave way passing the quarter pole. BEACHSIDE BUNNY pressed the pace three wide, but faded
between horses entering the lane. LISA'S LEGACY never got involved. LICHITA reared in the gate, threw her rider, and required veterinarian attention
before being re-loaded, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROSE set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of AN APPLE A DAY around the turn, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, and drew off
under driving pressure. AN APPLE A DAY rushed to prompt the pace two wide and from between horses, dueled with CRIMSON ROSE around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and proved second best. MALIBU MARIE tracked two wide, shifted three wide entering the lane, and
chased the leaders home. LAVENDAR LANE broke outwardly, chased four wide, but failed to keep pace with a pair of inner foes turning for home, but kept
on through the final furlong to reclaim a minor share. SUGAR BOO lied off fo the pace in the three to two path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper
stretch, but lacked a rally on jher left lead. COCO PUFF lied far off of the pace four wide, and improved late. SOPHIE GRACE pressed the pace three wide,
but faded in upper stretch. SWEET ANNABELLA broke a step slowly, chased from midpack along the inside, but faded. SWAP SHOP never got involved.
MURGATROYD failed to factor. JERUSALEMA was outrun.
