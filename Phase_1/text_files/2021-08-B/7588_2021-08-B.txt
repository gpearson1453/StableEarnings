Footnotes
MOAM broke a step slow, was coaxed early then settled near the back, came under urging along the rail on the turn, commenced a strong run outside the
five-sixteenths then came under the crop, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied along the rail under a right-handed crop, closed determinedly inside of the
embattled leaders into the final furlong, took over inside the sixteenth-pole and moved clear under strong handling. TWIST JUST RIGHT came away in good
order then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside early on the turn then came out to the two path, spun three wide under pressure
into the stretch, lost the advantage nearing the three-sixteenths, fought on well inside of LET HER INSPIRE U into the final sixteenth and gamely secured
the place while outfinished by the winner. LET HER INSPIRE U stumbled badly at the start, had the rider reach down to adjust his right iron, advanced to
move up just behind the leaders then was taken in hand outside the five-eighths, tugged at the bit under restraint behind the leader and inside of REGAL
REBEL to the half-mile pole, bumped lightly with that foe at that point and created a clear path for herself, was let out then ranged up in the two then three
path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, was carried four wide into the stretch, took a short lead before the three-sixteenths, led under a
drive while batting outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the place but was extremely far clear for the show.
MISS PAB broke in then was corrected by the rider, raced on the outside while ridden along, went three wide for most of the turn, angled five wide outside
the quarter-pole and faltered. JANNIE MAE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear while ridden along, went four wide for most of
the turn, dropped to three then two wide late on that bend and failed to respond. REGAL REBEL chased the pace on the outside, was bumped lightly near
the half-mile pole, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
CLEAR VISION broke on top and showed the way rated in hand along the inside uncontested through sensible splits settled into a comfortable rhythm,
remained patiently handled until the field began to stack up in behind five-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner
into upper stretch roused for the drive, drew off under a drive to prevail in Bill Daly fashion. BORU tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket under a
light rating hold, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tipped out to the three path three-sixteenths from
home, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps to the finish. CASTAGNO just off the inside forwardly placed in closest aim of
the leader under rating, came under coaxing a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and took to the inside straightened away,
ran on to chase the winner home getting collared in the final strides for the place honors. OUTRAGEOUS BET coaxed from the start, settled tracking the
front from the one and one until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths remaining, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on
through to the finish. SPIRIT ANIMAL saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch making some ground, then made no late headway through the final furlong. BOURBON IN MAY just off the inside tracking from mid pack, dropped
back unhurried to near the rear, came under urging at the five-sixteenths when at the tail of the field and tipped three wide into upper stretch, then passed
tired rivals in the lane. BIRD'S EYE VIEW just off the pace three then two wide, began to faded just inside three furlongs to go, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. SMILE BRYAN four then three wide in pursuit, bid under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and
weakened in the stretch. COUNTER OFFER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from near the rear coming under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. MANDATE two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got pushed along with
five-sixteenths to run, angled out four to five wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact. NOBLE THOUGHT saved ground near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and never got involved. Due to a teletimer operator error the mile split
time was unavailable.

under strong urging. JIMMY DAN broke out at the start, was taken back early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went around most
of the far turn in the two path then shifted three wide, was roused four wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, raced just inside of
CAMBI LION in the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. CAMBI LION broke out at the start, saved ground on the first
turn, moved out at the rear on the backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three wide for most of the far turn then shifted four wide
while within striking range, came five wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, raced outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and just
missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. HIGH DEFF (FR) settled in the two path, drafted behind horses on the final turn, shifted four wide
while given his cue at the quarter-pole, gained under a drive to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved
no match for the winner then lost the show. WIN WORTHY broke a step slow, went three wide while in hand on the initial turn, was reserved on the outside,
tugged his way closer outside the half-mile pole, ranged up three wide on the far turn, took the lead approaching the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened. ROYNE brushed with a rival at the start, was reserved on the
inside, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole then was asked three wide into the stretch, dropped in while chasing under the crop into the final furlong
and lacked the needed response. PRAYER BOOK rounded the first turn in the two path, tucked in behind the leader while tracking that foe, moved out near
the nine-sixteenths then gained to make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the final turn, was asked between horses at the five-sixteenths,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. GOLD BEAR went to the front, showed the way on the inside, came under coaxing late on the
backstretch, was headed under urging passing the five-sixteenths, brushed the hedge while dropping back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MISS LIANA got bumped at the start by LOVE ME TOMORROW, who broke inwards, then leaned on that foe briefly while under hustling, raced six paths off
the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the duelers albeit a good deal behind that pair, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong gaining to collar the leg weary and drifting
leader in the final jumps to the finish. FRILLS bumped at the start by CATHY NAZ who broke outwards awkwardly bobbling, dueled three to four paths off
the inside with QUALITY STONES to her outside through blistering splits widening away from the rest of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drifted two then three wide straightened away into upper stretch
shaking off her main pace rival, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat growing leg weary and drifting out despite right handed
correction and was caught in the final strides in a solid effort. QUALITY STONES stumbled at the start pecking the ground and broke towards the top
despite it, dueled from the five path with FRILLS to her inside down the backstretch opening up as a pair on the rest of the field, tucked three wide through
the turn continuing to knock heads coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide for home, got shaken off straightened away
and weakened to the finish while along for the show honors. MEBS WEB bobbled at the break, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch early on
before tucking three wide as JESSICA was tucked four wide from her outside, chased just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and improved position. JESSICA hustled from the gate, raced six paths off the inside briefly before being
yanked to the four path forcing MEBS WEB to shadow her and tucked three wide, came under coaxing with three-eighths to run, swung four to five wide for
home and made no impact. CATHY NAZ broke out a step at the start bobbling awkwardly and bumped with FRILLS, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. LOVE ME TOMORROW broke in at the start and bumped MISS LIANA, then got
leaned on by that rival soon after, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact.

Footnotes
THE CLUB just off the inside just off the duel, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole and
was herded out three paths getting bumped by TOP GUN GIRL from the three-sixteenths to near the sixteenth pole, came in bumping that rival at that
station and dug in gamely to prevail by a neck on the wire. TOP GUN GIRL coaxed from the gate, dueled from the four path with LADY SCARLET to her
inside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, was in the midst of taking
command when the top one took a slight advantage and came out herding that rival three paths trading minor bumps to inside the eighth pole, got bumped
herself fighting head to head when THE CLUB came inwards once and battled on to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. MISCHIEVOUS KISS
lunged slightly at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
JAZZ TIME GIRL chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung
four wide for home, offered up a mild bid a furlong out and flattened out in the late stages. HALO OF FIRE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and kicked on belatedly to the finish. BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE three wide in pursuit, came
under a ride at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHARED FUTURE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LADY SCARLET hustled from the gate, dueled along the
inside with TOP GUN GIRL to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded at the three-sixteenths and
tired. SUPER STING broke slow brushing the near side stall and quickly conceded five lengths to the front when chasing sluggishly and with short strides
four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn and six wide into upper stretch and was eased home well behind.

UNION MAIDEN coaxed from the gate, vied six then five paths off the inside among a quintet briefly and then a quartet before steadily tucking to the three
path in concert with MOVIE MOXY and SHARP STARR to her inside with nine-sixteenths to go, prompted that top pair through the turn allowing them to
knock heads while remaining latched on to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and rallied to take
command from the embattled pair just inside the three-sixteenths, then edged clear under a drive kept busy to the finish. WHISPERING PINES brushed at
the start by THOUGHTFULLY who broke out a step, vied briefly from the three path for the opening furlong among a quintet before easing back to allow that
foursome with her to battle out while taking up the chase three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn briefly before being put to a
prolonged drive at the seven-sixteenths and tipped three wide, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to get up for the place honors in the
final jumps. EMILIA'S MOON chased along the inside, the lone member of the field not to vie for command through the opening furlong, remained inside
until tipped two then three wide from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths pole when put to coaxing, continued three wide for home and improved
position for the show honors. MOVIE MOXY brushed the off side stall at the start, vied among a quintet and then a quartet four then three wide to the
nine-sixteenths before emerging with a pair tucking inside into the turn, knocked heads with SHARP STARR through the bend while UNION MAIDEN sat
perched to their outside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to the front, got collared inside the
three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. SHARP STARR coaxed from the gate, vied five then four wide among a quintet and then a quartet
tucking four wide at the nine-sixteenths before making her way to the two path into the turn, knocked heads loosely between foes through the turn getting
placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened in the late going.
THOUGHTFULLY broke out at the start brushing WHISPERING PINES, vied early on from the two path before being eased back near the nine-sixteenths
to chase along the inside, came under coaxing tipped briefly to the two path at the three-eighths, continued inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RASTAFARA (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, settled while well spotted behind the solo leader, picked up the tempo in the two path on the far turn,
rallied three wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead before the three-sixteenths then kicked clear into the final furlong, responded well under the
crop into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. THIRD DRAFT saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went three wide on the
far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) broke in and
brushed the gate, saved ground on the opening bend, was reserved towards the back, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and improved position to just get the show. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) saved ground while reserved off the pace, was roused outside the
quarter-pole then driven into the two path into upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. AMY C
(GB) went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. DESIGNER READY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. HIT THE WOAH tucked into the two path on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged three wide
on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then angled further out at the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. LOVE AND MONEY sped to the front
then became keen when taken in hand, fought the restraint of the rider while setting the clear pace towards the inside, was let out on the final turn then
asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead outside the three-sixteenths and gave way. STAND BY YOU was taken up a bit early, checked while bearing out
badly into the first turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MESSENGER three then two wide near the rear of the field, came under encouragement at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, closed well outside to latch on the top pair near the sixteenth marker and was up in the very last jump to the wire. FAST GETAWAY coaxed from the
gate, dueled inside of ENCRYPTED from the get go through swift splits coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch shaking off his main pace rival, inched away to the eighth pole, came under growing threat from a pair to the outside and dug in stubbornly clinging
to the lead until nailed in the very last jump to the finish in a game effort. XY SPEED chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge latching on the leader
nearing the sixteenth pole and fought on between rivals to the finish while clear of the rest for the show honors. DISCRETIONARY MARQ coaxed from the
gate, chased four to five wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and kept on through to the finish. BOURBON MISSION three
then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. LOOKIN FOR LOKI hustled
from the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late stages.
THREE OUTLAWS brushed the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. THE QUEENS JULES bobbled at the start recovering outwards into ENCRYPTED, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, got ridden along three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and was outrun. ENCRYPTED (GB) bumped at the
start by the aforementioned foe who recovered outwards from a bobble, came under brief hustling and dueled from the two path with FAST GETAWAY to
his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got shaken off at the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive.
