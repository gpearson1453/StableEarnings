Footnotes
JAYSKER chased the pacesetter, responded leaving the turn, took over and edged clear late under steady pressure. LUCKY D broke sharply, gained a
clear lead, hedl well into the stretch and was worn down late. HEZA WILD RIDE chased while four wide, entered the stretch three wide and stayed on.
CHINLEE settled while three wide, moved closer on the turn, lodged a bid into the stretch and came up empty in the late going. YOU TALKIN TO ME was
always outrun. DAZZL'N MISCHIEF failed to threaten. SIR ELI leaned in at the start, showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
C L LEGACY forced the pace, took over on the turn and kicked clear in the stretch. SAMIRA settled well, advanced on the turn and steadily rallied while
three wide in the stretch. TAPIT'S LADY forwardly placed, was urged on the turn, kept on but lacked the needed bid. TROUBLE IN RED chased while three
wide, moved closer on the turn and managed a mild rally in the stretch. GOTTA HAVE FAITH was outpaced while three wide and lacked a rally. NAUTICAL
MISS swerved in at the start and did not factor. WHO'S MY GIRL was void of speed. RAGGY was always outrun. RUTHIE RULES retreated.
