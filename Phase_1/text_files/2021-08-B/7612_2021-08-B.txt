Footnotes
CATERINA ONE stalked three wide, moved up to challenge into the lane, drifted in slightly when dueling in mid stretch, quickly corrected, emerged in a
battle with NANCYSAIDSO and forged ahead in the final strides. NANCYSAIDSO sped to the front, set the pace toward the inside, was briefly clear after a
quarter mile, dug in when engaged heading into the lane and was guided off the rail, battled gamely on tenuous lead past the sixteenth pole but just wasn't
quite good enough. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM forced the pace outside the leader, sparred three wide between runners in upper stretch, checked when in close
near the sixteenth marker then came up empty. FAMILY FORTUNE saved ground and rallied mildly. ZIG , off a bit slow, raced between runners into the
turn, came three wide for the drive but failed to threaten. ALGODONAL , sluggish from the gate, raced off the rail mid turn but lacked a response. There was
a stewards inquiry into the stretch run and an objection by the rider of SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch. No
action was taken.

STILL DOING TIME vied inside, shook clear near the three eighths, opened up under a light hold leaving the far turn, kept on under strong left handed
rousing past the sixteenth pole and proved best. BLUEGRASS ON TAP drifted out at the break and brushed with a rival, edged up and stalked inside,
dropped back some into the far turn, was under pressure while along the rail into the lane and churned on to pass a tiring foe for the place. NO MORE
MASK came in at the break and tightened a rival, straightened and moved up two wide to dispute the pace, saw the leader get away leaving the three
eighths, gave hard chase into the lane and faded. HELLO JAMROCK , brushed and in tight at the break, was not a factor. CARIBBEAN FLOW broke a step
slow, raced three wide into the first turn, angled in and retreated.

DING DING quickly went clear, set the pace towards the rail, was urged along into the lane, wandered outward a bit and was fully extended to hold sway.
PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , away alertly, chased the winner two wide and continued on gamely to the line. DOTADA , off a bit slow, was off the pace behind
rivals early, dropped in entering the turn, stayed inside for the drive and finished well. RUBI DE LEON , three wide around the turn, lacked a bid.
SUZANNE'S SUGAR , fractious behind the gate, broke slowly then steadied when put in tight, was taken wide to chase, shifted four wide in upper stretch
and kept on willingly. SHE'S A FAST ONE bore out when rank at the break, corrected and rushed up, chased off the rail and faded. SKYLAR'S LADY ,
bumped at the break, raced two wide off the rail into the turn and gave way.

NETTI GIRL , quickly to the front, set the pace towards the rail, responded to repeated right handed rousing in the lane and held firm. RAISED WRONG ,
away alertly, chased the winner two wide and kept on well. SUNDAY IN L B C rushed up early, chased two wide past the three sixteenths, had her rider lose
the whip entering the lane but lacked a solid response. ENTHRONED lacked speed, raced three wide into the lane and failed to menace. MYSTIC COMIN
HOME broke outward and failed to keep pace.

Footnotes
TORCH OF TRUTH stalked three wide, was under a ride from the quarter pole, kept on doggedly under right handed encouragement, battled three deep
past the sixteenth pole and got the bob. YOUNGEST OF FIVE edged up between runners early and prompted the pace, was under a strong ride pursuing
past the quarter pole, dropped inside of the drifting leader in deep stretch, bid inside rivals and just missed in a game effort. ZIGGY MON shook clear of
rivals into the first turn, set the pace towards the rail, remained clear under pressure into the lane, wandered outward and gave way grudgingly between
rivals. CHARGE TO VICTORY , under a snug hold early on while saving ground, pursued the leaders past the three sixteenths, angled out and rallied.
ROUGH SEA was in tight at the break and failed to menace. BIG CITY BOB , in range four wide into the first turn, dropped back leaving the half mile
marker, remained wide and faded. KARAN'S NOTION was rated back off the pace, angled out early, raced between runners past the three eighths and
gave way.

Footnotes
BRUTUS pulled his way to the front, set a rated pace towards the rail, moved clear after a half mile, widened leaving the far turn, responded when roused
into the lane and kept on eagerly under a drive. CELTIC TREASURE , away alertly, prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner, was under
asking leaving the three eighths, kept on willingly and came back for the place. PITCHING ARI chased the winner while saving ground, edged up a bit
leaving the quarter pole, failed to kick on past the furlong grounds and faded. MIAMI MUMBLES , brushed and in close at the break, saved ground off the
pace, angled out near the three eighths, chased but came up empty. SASSY KING lagged back early, angled out after a half mile, made a mild wide
advance heading to the quarter pole but failed to seriously sustain. MY FRIENDS BEER chased between foes near the five eighths, angled in and gave
way. BENANDJOE , brushed at the break, steadied early, angled out and was used three wide to reach contention, chased to the half mile marker, faltered,
was eased through the lane and walked off. FAST CASH dropped off the pace, appeared to be getting out past the half mile marker, was pulled up about a
furlong later and walked off.
