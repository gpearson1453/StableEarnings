GEE STREET was unhurried for a half, advanced two wide to take the lead on the far turn then dug in determinedly to hold. BIG ENOUGH had no speed,
settled then swung out four deep to the stretch and finished in steady run. PULPIT SINGER chased the leader while saving ground, was off the rail on the
far turn, responded in the drive but was bested. CLUBHOUSE SAINT broke slow, trailed to the backstretch, bid three wide on the far turn to loom a threat
into the stretch but got outfinished and finished on even terms with PULPIT SINGER. KAYLA'S COWGIRL sped clear, led for a half mile then tired.

LONO dueled in the early stages, was passed by NOBLE GIRL and pressed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then closed with a strong run to
catch the latter in a dead heat. NOBLE GIRL attended the pace then edged away to a solo lead, was clear to mid stretch, dug in bravely and was nailed on
the wire. GOLDEN FLAME was chasing to the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch but finished willingly. HAWK'S RISING hopped at the start, trailed to
the second turn, was three wide to the stretch and also closed ground. MEGGY'S AMAZING had no speed and was never a threat.

RACHEL'S LADY chased the pace to the backstretch, rallied two wide to take over on the final turn and held under steady urging. IZZY'S INPUT was sent to
the front, set the pace to the final turn while saving ground, could not stall the winner but saved the place. WAHASHA pressed IZZY'S INPUT while off the
rail for a half mile, got outkicked on the final bend and lacked a closing response. SAN JUAN STORM had no speed, was three or four wide throughout and
did not rally. LEAD ACTRESS saved ground throughout but was never a threat.

TAKES A VILLAGE broke a bit slow, was two or three wide to the backstretch, moved up to engage for the lead four wide to the stretch then dug in willingly
to prevail. ROCK SLINGER was on the pace early, raced three wide dueling the winner into the stretch but could not hold on and saved second. WORKING
tracked the pace to the far turn, saved ground to the stretch then was outfinished. SHANGHAI CURLY contested the pace in the early going, raced off the
rail to the stretch and weakened in the drive. CRAZY AL chased the pace three wide to the stretch then also weakened.

FOREIGN PROTOCOL was well placed behind the pace, rallied three wide to the stretch and edged clear driving. DUSALUT set the pace from the rail to
the stretch then was collared and saved second. YEAR OF THE OX got outsprinted to the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and finished in a mild
bid. OLDER BROTHER pressed the pace in the two path to the far turn then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. STORM ON THE RIVER was
also outsprinted to the backstretch, raced two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. MOONLIGHT BLUE had no speed and was
never a threat. DUTCH COLONEL gave a dull effort.

Footnotes
HONOS MAN was unhurried for a mile, rallied smartly on the backstretch the final time, was two wide to the stretch, passed CANYON CREST then had to
dig in determinedly to hold that one safe. CANYON CREST settled for a mile, responded to take command after a mile and quarter, was overtaken by the
winner but fought on bravely to the line. EARNEST set the pace for a mile, was collared, raced three wide but could not make any headway in the drive.
HEY SEQUOIA tracked the pace three wide for a mile, remained a threat for a mile and a quarter then lacked a closing response. WINGS OF THE WIND
had no speed, settled for a mile, offered a three wide bid but could not threaten. ANGELO'S PRIDE pressed the pace for six furlongs, dropped back then
came up empty. ENGRAM had no speed and was never a factor. Internal fractions were omitted.
