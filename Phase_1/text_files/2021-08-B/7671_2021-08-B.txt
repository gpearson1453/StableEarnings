TUNSTALL stalked the pace bidding in the three path down the lane rallying up to grab inside rival in the last yards. LOOPY advanced to press into the far
turn shaking clear along the rail in upper stretch digging in late being caught in the final strides. MRS. ROBINSON gained on the backside chasing through
the far turn, wavered some in upper stretch finishing evenly in the two path to best the others. JILL BABE raced evenly through the far turn moving six wide
down the lane posing no menace. CONGRATS GOLDA away alertly pressed a narrow lead to the far turn wearing out into upper stretch. CONNIE TOO
pressed the pace through the backside into the far turn, had worn out fading in upper stretch when contacted by rival near the eighth pole. MILLBANK
MAGIC was always outrun. ARTISTIC JEWLER saved ground moving in tight on the far turn to upper stretch trying to go through a hole that wasn't there
near the eighth pole hitting rival stumbling and losing the rider in the process, walked off after the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN AND MADE NO CHANGES.
