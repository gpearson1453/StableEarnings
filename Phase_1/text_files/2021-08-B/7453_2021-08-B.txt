Footnotes
BIG SCULLY pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then carried five wide while asked for
more into the stretch, drew even with the runner-up on the outside before the three-sixteenths, dueled with that foe under right-handed crop in the final
furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. INEVTABL CONECTION was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the
two path while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, floated four wide into the stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure
outside the furlong marker, dueled inside of the winner under a left-handed crop in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. ST. LUKES
broke out and a bit slow then checked, spotted the front many lengths, moved out under urging early then dropped well behind the rest of the field, angled in
with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner while gaining into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. SAILOR SPEED settled off
the rail, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, was ridden along in the two path on the turn, drifted out late and lacked the needed response.
STREET HUSTLE broke a half-step slow, was roused early then ridden along on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, continued on his inside
lead in the stretch and came up empty. PIPITO was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path early on the turn, shifted
four wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

seven-sixteenths, was given her cue in the two path with three furlongs to run then put to a pop of the crop, took the lead while cornering four wide into
upper stretch, shook clear while drifting further out into the final furlong then was straightened by the rider and drew off under a hand ride while kept to the
task with flagging of the crop. MISTY VEIL was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, extended the advantage with five furlongs to run, was asked
under increasing threat inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner under a left-handed crop into upper stretch and proved no match while far
clear for the place. MAOILIN brushed with a foe at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along

Footnotes
SILVER STRAND prompted the pace of SARAH HARPER from the outside three paths off the rail, tucked to the two path and dueled through the turn with
that rival knocking heads spinning just off the inside for home, took over a narrow advantage a furlong out, inched away under a drive to prevail. SHALIMAR
GARDENS traded a brush with SARAH HARPER at the start, then got steadied out briefly between foes due to pressure from SARAH HARPER outside and
O'GOTTEN GIRL inside and lost about a length of position, chased three wide early on before tucking to the two path nearing the turn, had O'GOTTEN
GIRL tip out into her lane nearing the seven-sixteenths and was steadied and altered out back three wide at that station conceding another two lengths of
ground before settling back into stride, came under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied coming inwards and
bumping O'GOTTEN GIRL nearing the eighth pole into the two path putting her loosely behind a rival and ran on to chase the winner home safe for the
place honors. SARAH HARPER traded a brush at the start with SHALIMAR GARDENS, then came inwards forcing that rival to steady briefly and pinching
back MUN LUV against pressure inside coming from O'GOTTEN GIRL, showed the way from the two path lightly coaxed along and under pressure from
SILVER STRAND to the outside, had that rival advance into the turn and engaged in head to head combat through the turn under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in and yielded a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages while along for the show
honors. O'GOTTEN GIRL bumped at the start by the breaking inwards MUN LUV, came out slightly just after and forced that rival to be steadied and
pinched out and SHALIMAR GARDENS to steady out briefly in concert with pressure outside from SARAH HARPER, chased along the inside early on
before briefly tipping to the two path, then went back inside into the turn, tipped out to the two path near the seven-sixteenths forcing SHALIMAR GARDENS
to steady just in behind and alter out, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was bumped and
nudged in near the eighth pole by SHALIMAR GARDENS finding herself loosely in behind SILVER STRAND, then weakened to the finish. MUN LUV broke
in at the start bumping O'GOTTEN GIRL, then got steadied when pinched out soon after as that rival came outwards against pressure coming inwards from
SARAH HARPER to the outside, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
BOSS CARA four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung
four wide for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the bumping between SHALIMAR GARDENS and O'GOTTEN
GIRL near the eighth pole. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

GOLD PANDA broke in at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path while still inside that rival on the turn, shook clear in the
three path into the stretch, drifted out while drawing off into final furlong, was kept to the task into the final sixteenth then eased up late while much the best.
GOT THE GOLD broke a bit slow and was last to commence, was urged along on the outside, dropped from the five path to the three path at the
seven-sixteenths, was urged in the three path on the bend then driven five wide into the stretch, dropped in while gaining under a right-handed crop around
the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the drive and safely secured the place. FORTY COMETS was urged along on the outside, went four
wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. V PATTERN was hustled from the start then ridden along well
off the pace, dropped to the two path at the seven-sixteenths and was no factor. FENWAY contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the
turn, floated five wide into upper stretch and tired. ON THE DEAN'S LIST broke a step slow, drifted out while falling well behind, went five wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and was no facor. SEIZER broke in at the start, chased the leading duo from third, saved ground on the turn and faded.
OLIVER'S FORTUNE was ridden along in the back half of the field, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to
respond.

DYNADRIVE just off the inside past the stands for the initial time, took the inside route into the first turn before settling two to three wide just in behind the
top trio down the backstretch, came under light coaxing half a mile from home and remained in behind that trio while just off the inside through the far turn
patiently handled until placed to urging just outside the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to seize command just inside the
three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive kept to task. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART a bit keen when pulling early on four paths off the rail through the
stretch the first time, went four then three wide through the opening bend perched to the outside of the top pair knocking heads under rating through
sensible splits, remained four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the top duo, continued four wide through the far turn coming under
light coaxing at the three-eighths and then more pronounced urging with five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide into upper stretch, seized narrow and brief
command at the three-sixteenths before being displaced inside that station, then ran on to chase the winner home while clear of the rest and second best.
THOMAS SHELBY dueled from the two path under rating through sensible splits with BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON to his outside, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, conceded the front straightened away at the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish while
clear for the show honors. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON three then two wide through the first turn, knocked heads while under rating three paths off the inside
with the aforementioned foe to his outside, continued three wide through the turn and had a rival advance outside now racing between rivals, got set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened through to the finish. PRETTY GOOD YEAR just off the inside tracking from the tail of the
compact field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact.
FORTUITY a bit eager early on pulling on the bit three paths off the rail past the stands the initial time, tucked to the two path through the first turn before
tipping four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing half a mile from home before commencing a long drive four wide with
seven-sixteenths remaining, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired.

VEGAS WEEKEND went to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, came under coaxing on the far turn, was asked for more under threat at the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a strong hand ride into upper stretch then came under a left-handed crop, fought back inside of the runner-up in the final
furlong and prevailed under vigorous handling. BATTLE BLING broke out then was hustled, went three wide on the opening bend, followed the solo leader
from second, moved closer midway down the backstretch, ranged up in the three path on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, took the lead in
the five path into upper stretch, led while switching between a left-handed and right-handed crop multiple times, remained in front into the final sixteenth but
was caught while clear for the place. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN was last to commence, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, was urged along while going from the rail to the three path on the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch under a drive and
lacked the needed response. KERIK came outward at the start, went four wide on the initial turn, settled at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail
early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch then moved out and was no factor. LIGHTNING LOU (IRE) broke out at the start, moved from the inside to
the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, dropped back four wide on the far turn then came six
wide into the stretch and faltered.

AWESOME DEBATE four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and took over
command straightened away into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail and was geared down in the last stages to the wire. IRISH
CONSTITUTION broke out a step at the start and was steadied briefly in tight bumping HANNAH DANCES who was recovering to her outside from a bad
stumble, conceded about two to three lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. HANNAH DANCES stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and was
bumped by the aforementioned foe and conceded two lengths to the front, chased four then three wide down the backstretch lightly coaxed along, tucked to
the two path through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show honors. SADIE LADY showed the way through
blistering splits in hand three then two wide given some rein to work with, came under very light coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch and was overhauled straightened away for home, then backed away weakening and spent to the finish. DIVA BANKER five to six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened.
