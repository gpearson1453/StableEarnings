Footnotes
SOPHIE'S PRAYER within striking distance off the inside, three wide, slight brush into the lane, roused nearing the furlong marker, accelerated and quickly
collared the leader with a sixteenth remaining, drew clear. BRAVE CITY GIRL broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, continued to hold a daylight
advantage through upper stretch, lugged out when confronted by the winner late, no match for that one, held the place. BEYOND D'ORO last away, raced
back off the pace while saving ground, improved along the rail into the lane, flattened out a bit to be going evenly at the end and finish up best of the rest.
MEAN AMERICAN void of speed, roused in the three path turning for home, made little impact in the run to the wire. TEMPLE QUEST closest to the runner
up in the run up the backstretch, brushed with the winner inside that one while still in pursuit entering the stretch then gave way soon after.

Footnotes
SUN STRIKER forwardly placed off the inside, crept closer turning for home, bid between foes with a furlong remaining, edged clear late under steady
handling. BENBOW CAT pressured the leader from the outside for three furlongs, closed the gap on that one entering the straight, lodged a brief and mild
bid with a furlong to run, could not match the winner late, fully extended to save the second spot. GROSSE TETE IAN back off the pace and the inside, four
wide into the lane, staged a rally out in the course to be getting to the runner up late. IZEISMAGA sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace for a half,
faltered when headed by the winner with just less than a furlong remaining. SILVER CHALICE broke out and bobbled to spot the field a couple of lengths,
raced five wide out of the turn, managed little in the way of a rally through the stretch. CONQUISTADOR GOLD in mid pack for three furlongs, backed up in
the drive.

RED MAMBA closest to the leader off the inside, challenged that one in the two path midway on the turn, took over into the lane, clear nearing the furlong
marker while drifting slightly, continued to hold a daylight advantage late, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. SOUTH AL SPARKY in the second
flight while toward the inside, angled out to be three wide into the lane, set down, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late. FLASHBURN
broke awkwardly and slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved out, came four wide and outside the runner up into the lane, lodged a mild rally to
be along for the show. WHOOSAH broke back, lacked speed off the inside, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. FIRST METAL COUNT broke
sharp, set the pace for three furlongs along the inside, faltered when headed by the winner late in the turn. LIONS HOT MESS fell back to trail after the start
and showed little.

Footnotes
FETCHING FURY took control after breaking on top, firmly rated while setting a soft pace, expanded that advantage into the lane and was not threatened to
the wire. SUCRE hopped at the start, recovered to move up to chase the winner, could do little with that rival in the run through the straight, held sway for
the place. HERO OF GOLD forwardly placed off the inside, shaken up for the stretch run, lacked a significant response to finish up best of the rest. KODIAK
SKY away in good order,, settled in mid pack, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. HAVINFUNYET last to leave, void of speed in trailing
most of the way, came four wide out of the final turn, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. SAND DRIFT raced in the main body, had little left
for the drive. POOPSIE DOOPSIE remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
MADAME JANE asked for a bit of run out of the gate to hold inside forward position, edged clear late backstretch, showed the way through the turn,
expanded advantage when straightened for home, roused, maintained daylight to the wire. MYLIES STAR away in good order, raced in the second flight
while in the two path, chased the winner past the furlong marker, made a mild dent in that one's advantage late, clearly second best. CONNECT IT settled
off the leaders while just off the inside, also came in the two path into the lane, staged a mild rally to be up for the place. ORDER UP ANOTHER broke
alertly, chased the pace in the three path, lacked a closing kick, caught late for the place. ASTRO FLASH went one paced while racing four wide out of the
turn. CRAFTY PRINCESS broke back, trailed, raced five wide out of the turn and picked o0ff a couple of tiring rivals down the middle of the strip while not a
serious threat. CUSTOM GUITAR broke back and failed to menace. PENNIE'S MAGIC broke back and remained there also in failing to rally. ST
JOSEPHINE was finished early and began to fade before a half. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

FLAT OUT BIG MONEY allowed the early pace to go while inside, continued to save ground turn, steered out a bit then set sights on the leader when
straightened for home, drove on by under a right handed crop. OLD FASHION AMOUR raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the turn,
rallied to be clear for the place while angling in, not a serious threat to the winner. SUPER LEGS last away, trailed for a half, also came four wide into the
lane, rallied while widest to the wire to be up for the show. ROSE CROWN broke on top, pressed the leader from off the inside for a half and weakened.
LUCKY EVERY DAY narrowly set the pace while along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner approaching the furlong marker. HALF MILE

CAUGHT HIS EYE never far back off the rail, advanced, challenged far turn, took over, drew out through the lane under steady handling. THINKING OF
HER in mid pack early, moved closer three wide late on the backstretch, vied three wide through the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
drifted in with less than a furlong left putting in MALARTACHI in tight and causing that one to steady. RHETT'S RACER broke out, settled off the pace while
inside, continued to save some ground second turn, roused in the two path for the drive, closest a furlong out, finished up flat. MALARTACH settled off the
pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane, angled in a bit, put in tight by THINKING OF HER inside the furlong grounds, steadied, narrowly missed
the third spot after recovering. TWO WITH A TEN broke back, lacked speed, saved some ground second turn, set down in the two path for the drive,
improved position. DORI'S BIRDIES four wide into the first turn, raced back, was three wide through the second turn, lacked a closing response. NINE LINE
BIND broke alertly, narrowly set the pace four five furlongs along the inside, gave way. INSEPARABLE five wide into the first turn, continued outside and
back, four wide through the second turn, remained back through the lane. MY REBEL GIRL moved up to a forward position by late in the first turn, continued
forward in the run up the backstrech, faltered. MY MALLORY'S ON off a step slow, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, THINKING OF HER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH.
OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT AND THE THREE QUARTER SPLIT WERE HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MAY HOUR broke with the leaders, fell back a bit to track the pace toward the inside, in the two path turning for home, put to pressure, kicked down the
leader with a burst of late acceleration. DESTINY WAY moved up to take control, clear into the turn, vied through the bend, clear again when straightened
for home, could not contain the winner late, remained clear for the place. JAKE THE BAND MAN broke alertly, in the second flight off the inside, moved
closer in the three path late in the turn, flattened out in the drive, narrowly gained the show. SIGUR ROS lacked early foot along the inside, improved while
saving ground into the lane, also lacked a late punch to finish up evenly. DRAKKAR broke out, was quickly straightened to force the issue early, advanced
and lodged a bid between foes briefly late in the bend, could not keep up in the drive, outkicked late for the third spot. PRIZELESS went one paced
throughout while racing three wide. SMOOTH COLLIERY remained always back. O'L RED off a step slow, moved out, was four wide out of the turn, failed
to muster a rally. FUTURE RULER broke out, raced in mid pack, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
CRYPTORITHM broke out to bother TORTUGA BAY then steadied, raced well back early, commenced his rally three wide in the far turn, reached the
leader nearing the furlong grounds, put a head in front and held sway under confident handling late. PERFECTOMUNDO broke on top, fell back off the pace
while saving ground, moved up the inside to challenge just before a half, dueled into the far turn, shook clear soon after, continued to show the way upper
stretch, responded when the winner came alongside soon after, proved stubborn to the end. UNBRIDLED PULPIT settled back off the pace, continued
unhurried the middle half, staged a mild rally to gain the show, no threat to the top pair. MR SOLO DOLO cleared the opening quarter, allowed the runner up
the inside before a half, dueled with that rival then could not keep up in weakening through the stretch. R AND R STAR within striking distance while racing
outside, began to fade after half. TORTUGA BAY bothered and forced to check up start, fell back after chasing the early leader, stopped and was jogged in.
OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT AND THE THREE QUARTER SPLIT WERE HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
