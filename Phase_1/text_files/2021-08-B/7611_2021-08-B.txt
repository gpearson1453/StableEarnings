Footnotes
SURPRISE BOSS showed good speed while hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure from the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded
well when set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop late and held under strong
urging. DEVIL OR ANGEL broke in but was away fast then hustled, dropped off the pace under urging, saved ground in a good striking position on the turn,
spun into the two path entering the stretch, pursued the winner under the crop into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed while able
to safely secure the place. SANDRONE broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, went three wide early
on the turn, moved to four wide while gaining under a strong hand ride late on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the
final furlong then flattened out and settled for the show. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT settled comfortably on the outside, tucked into the two to three path on the
turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted in at the furlong marker and came up empty. STOP THE SPREAD was
hustled from the break, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back while still on his inside lead in upper stretch
and tired. BLUE DEJA VU bumped with INDIA TIGER at the start then bumped again with that foe early, was urged along at the back, raced inside early on
the turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to threaten. INDIA TIGER broke in and bumped with BLUE
DEJA VU then bumped again with that foe early, was urged along on the outside at the back, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. RED ROCK
BAY was hustled from the start then ridden along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to respond.

coaxed along in the two path down the backstretch before tucking to the inside into the turn, floated slightly back to the two path midway, came under some
threat to the outside from the runner up, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well kept to task to
the wire. VELVET SISTER coaxed along in pursuit three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, floated out four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase
the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. LAOBAN'S LEGACY bobbled at the break, chased along the inside under coaxing from the

Footnotes
BARRAGE prompted the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, took a narrow advantage in upper stretch,
battled outside of UMBRIA into the final sixteenth, brushed with that foe at that juncture then brushed with him again late and narrowly prevailed under
strong handling. UMBRIA bumped with a rival at the start, was a bit keen under restraint into the first turn, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was
roused on the final turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead while moving out into the final sixteenth
and finished fast to just miss while able to get the place. YARROW went to the front, showed the way near the inside with company to his outside, was
asked outside the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch under the crop, lost the lead to the winner near the three-sixteenths, fought on well inside of that
foe, brushed with the winner at the sixteenth-pole then brushed again with that opponent late and missed while able to get the show. MR. CONNECTICUT
went two to three wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, was roused in the two path on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and improved position to get the last spot in the superfecta. HIT THE NAIL bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the inside of two
opponents then was taken back off the pace before the first turn, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was asked outside the quarter-pole then turned
into the stretch in the two path, moved out while chasing the leaders into the final furlong, was carried out some into the final sixteenth and lacked the
needed kick. SANDRO THE GREAT hit the inside of the gate at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked four
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained some but failed to menace. KING MOONRACER went four then three wide on the first turn,
was rated between horses, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased the leaders past the three-sixteenths,
was carried out some into the final furlong and tired. BIG CASTLE lugged out five wide into the first turn then dropped to the four path, moved up to track the
pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and capitulated. BAY DEFENSE angled in at the rear of
the field, settled at the back while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

SENBEI hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with RUN CURTIS RUN to his outside, tucked inside through the turn widening away as a pair from
the rest of the field and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and
held well to the finish. MONTEBELLO got bumped at the start by the veering in BOURBON'S HOPE and in turn bumped WHO HOO THATS ME solidly into
SHIPSATIONAL, knocking that rival askew, chased four then three wide from mid pack coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and offered up a mild kick surging late to just procure the place honors in the last jump to the wire. HAPPY HAPPY B coaxed from the start, chased
three then two wide in closest aim of the duel up front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded losing position from the three-eighths to the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home drifting in slightly straightened away placing WHO HOO THATS ME in tight along the rail to near the eighth
pole when coming again to improve for the place honors, then got nailed on the wire and was forced to settle for the show. SHIPSATIONAL bobbled slightly
at the break recovering outwards into a solid bump from WHO HOO THATS ME due to pressure originating from the veering in BOURBON'S HOPE, got
bumped in the hindquarters and was knocked sideways steadying and conceding two lengths to the front recovering briefly before being slammed along his
inside by HAPPY HAPPY B soon after getting squeezed against WHO HOO THATS ME and conceding another two to three lengths to the front, chased
along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two to three wide through the turn placed to coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, angled out five wide
into upper stretch and showed good courage to kick on belatedly for the last major share. WHO HOO THATS ME got solidly bumped between foes at the
start due to pressure from BOURBON'S HOPE veering in and in turn bumped SHIPSATIONAL solidly in the rear end, chased three wide until tucked to the
inside three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, cut the corner into upper stretch, got paused and steadied in tight along the rail as HAPPY HAPPY B
drifted in slightly from the outside, gained clearance a furlong from home and was re-engaged by the rider but made no headway to the finish. DAUFUSKIE
ISLAND chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, weakened in the stretch. BOURBON'S HOPE broke in
solidly hitting the near side stall at the start before veering in to collide with MONTEBELLO forcing that rival into WHO HOO THATS ME and in turn
SHIPSATIONAL, chased four to five wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxed three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. RUN CURTIS RUN hustled from the start, dueled three then two wide with SENBEI to his inside while lightly coaxed along, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away when spent and backed away faltering in the stretch.

Footnotes
VALLARAND coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace of LOT OF HONEY from the outside in the two path taking command when placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, came under challenge from CHASING CARA to the outside and floated four wide into upper stretch, shook off that rival just
outside the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat being directed out inside the final sixteenth to look the challenger in the eye and gamely shared in
the victory on the wire. BUSTIN BAY hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out
six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and was guided inwards near the sixteenth marker to see her target in front and gamely got up to share in
the win at the finish bobbing out of unison but equal on the line. CHASING CARA coaxed from the gate, led early on before settling to chase three wide from
just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, bid to latch on the leader to the outside at the
three-sixteenths, got shaken off near the eighth pole and kept on to secure the show honors. OK HONEY just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. I'M FINE
coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. MOSIENKO

BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY bumped with a rival at the start, settled in the two path, dropped to the rail late on the far turn then was roused outside the
quarter-pole, cut the corner along the rail into the stretch, rallied against the fence, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and got up while drifting out
in the final strides. MAKE MISCHIEF charged the front of the stall just prior to the start, hit the front of the gate and broke through the front just prior to the
rest of the stalls opening, came out first but had her momentum stunted by striking the gate, went four wide early on the first turn then tucked into the three
path, settled on the outside, went three wide early on the far turn then shifted four wide at the three-eighths, ranged up with five-sixteenths to run, was asked
near the quarter-pole then took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, led until the final strides but was caught while able to get the place. PAY GRADE
was hustled to the lead, showed the way on the inside through reasonable fractions, was asked before the quarter-pole then spun into the two path entering
the stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths and was outfinished but was clear for the show. A BIT O'IRISH SASS broke in and bumped with a foe,
stalked the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the
lead, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. U GUYS ARE NO FUN lost her footing slightly at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled at
the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a
drive and failed to rally. EPONA'S DREAM traveled three wide around the opening bend, settled at the rear on the outside, was roused in the three path with
three furlongs to run, moved to the five path around the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. COFFEE BAR rounded the initial turn in the three path,
tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty when asked in the three path on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered.

CITY MAN saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, took closer order on the duel that widened away early on and slipped along the inside past a backing
away MICROSECOND nearing the three-eighths marker and was placed to coaxing at that station, swung three wide into upper stretch, and floated four
wide forcing MO READY to check straightened away, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat from his barn mate to the
inside and gamely fended him off to the finish. THERAPIST saved ground near the rear of the field patiently handled until put to coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside for home, angled in to rally up the hedge at the three-sixteenths issuing a challenge through the final furlong to knock heads
through to the finish but was ultimately denied on the wire. SANCTUARY CITY just off the inside tracking from the tail of the field early on, tipped three wide
around a quickly backing up rival near the three-eighths pole and was placed to coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. GRADED ON A CURVE coaxed from the gate, tracked just off the inside in the early stages before going two
to three wide down the backstretch, went three wide around the backing away rival nearing the far turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home
advancing into striking range with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RINALDI hustled from the gate,
dueled inside of MICROSECOND lightly coaxed along widening away from the rest of the field in a gap duel through the opening half mile, had his main
pace foe get protected nearing the three-eighths and held sole command briefly before coming under pressure as the rest of the field took closer order into
the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, yielded just inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. MO READY tracked just off the
inside in closest aim of the gap duel up front, took closer order with the rest of the field on those rivals and tipped out three wide nearing the three-eighths as
MICROSECOND backed away quickly and suddenly, tucked back to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide for home and was checked in behind the floating out CITY MAN and appeared to attempt to savage GRADE ON A CURVE, then weakened to the
finish. MICROSECOND broke open the stall door prior to the start and was well held by the assistant starter and rider preventing escape, got hustled at the
break and dueled coaxed along from the two path with RINALDI to his inside widening away from the rest for the opening half mile, appeared to crossfire
nearing the three-eighths pole and was placed to a protective hold immediately, the rider looking back and around for a seam to retreat through and was
steadied out to the rear of the field, galloped through the far turn under the protective hold and was eased home through to the finish, then walked off under
his own power.

Footnotes
AMERICANREVOLUTION brushed with a rival at the start, moved to the two path on the opening bend, settled off the pace, moved closer under coaxing
outside the half-mile pole, was urged along while inside early on the far turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole
then took the lead in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up under the crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best while placed under a hand
ride in the final sixteenth. BOBBY BO brushed with a foe at the start, moved in while going to the front, set an uncontested pace through solid fractions, vied
inside on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought with that foe into the final furlong and
proved no match while well clear for the place. IT'S A GAMBLE settled well back on the inside, raced behind a foe early on the turn then was roused after
getting room outside the five-sixteenths, saved ground into the stretch and was along for the show. OUR MAN MIKE bumped soundly with a rival at the
start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch
then drifted further out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response then missed the show. ANEJO went three to four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch then was carried out around the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. JOEY LOOSE LIPS bumped soundly with an opponent at the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled
in third position, chased three then four wide on the far turn and capitulated. IT'S GRAVY tracked the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path,
chased on the final turn and retreated. BINGO JOHN brushed with foes on both sides at the start, went two to three wide on the turns and faltered.

Footnotes
GIACOSA broke out at the start bumping KREESIE into CHOCOLATE COOKIE, settled unhurried just off the inside through the first turn before tipping
three wide down the backstretch, tipped out four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths and began to advance circling the field outside culminating in
an upper stretch swing five wide into prominence, took over command nearing the eighth pole and edged away under a drive digging in gamely to fend off a
rival to the finish. MYHARTBLONGSTODADY coaxed from the gate, tracked along the inside getting briefly steadied off the heels of a rival into the first turn
while also forcing CLASSIC LADY to check off her heels in behind, saved ground just off the pace initially in behind MIKE'S GIRL before being able to use
the hedge to her advantage moving inside that rival as the hedge briefly tucked away forcing that one to the two path, advanced inside into the far turn and
came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through to the finish but was ultimately
staved off. CLASSIC LADY coaxed from the gate, got checked off the heels of MYHARTBLONGSTODADY into the first turn, tracked from just off the inside
in mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and tipped out two additional paths near the eighth pole, ran on
to secure the show honors. PECATONICA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. CHOCOLATE COOKIE bumped at the start by KREESIE due to pressure from GIACOSA, race three to four wide through the
first turn and then four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path three furlongs from home, went five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. DANCING KIKI just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened in the
late going. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS fractious in the gate prior to the start, got backed out and reloaded, tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. KREESIE got bumped between foes at the start due to pressure from
GIACOSA, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and offered no rally. KILKEA showed the way four then three
wide into the first turn before making her way to the two path and then to the inside into the backstretch, settled in hand awaiting a challenge and got one
nearing the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and tired. MIKE'S GIRL tracked the pace
along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
PIVOTAL RUN went three wide on the opening bend, settled in the back half of the field, traveled around the far turn in the two path while in hand, was
roused near the quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch, bumped with HIGH TONE while looking for room coming to the furlong marker, steadied while
turned out at that point, regained momentum outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get up. FAST GORDON went four wide on the first turn, was
forwardly placed down the backstretch, moved in on the backstretch, steadied nearing the half-mile pole then dropped to the rail, raced inside early on the
far turn then shifted to the two path, spun three wide into upper stretch under urging, rallied to make a bid into the final sixteenth but missed while just able
to get the place. EIGHT WEEKS LONG hit the outside of the gate solidly at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled well back in the field,
was urged three then four wide on the far turn, brushed with HIGH TONE while driven five wide into the stretch, bumped with that foe at the furlong marker
and was turned in then steadied, regained momentum outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the
show. WICKED KARMA lugged out a bit while inside to the two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the
far turn, maintained the slimmest of advantages into the final furlong but was overtaken. WAR NOVEL was taken back between horses early, went three
wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, made a bid around the
three-sixteenths, battled on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. BRENNAN'S WAR went four wide on the first turn, moved in
while settling off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, espied an inside seam coming to the three-sixteenths but had that
path taken, was urged behind horses to the eighth-pole, lacked room in traffic in the final furlong and lost his best chance. CHASE THE CAT was caught five
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked two to three wide on the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong
and tired. HIGH TONE bumped with an opponent shortly after the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, went two then three wide
while asked on the far turn, brushed with EIGHT WEEKS LONG while four wide into the stretch, raced directly inside that foe while behind another
opponent, bumped with foes on both sides at the furlong marker, turned the inside horse out and the outside horse in then steadied and finished willingly.
REUNION TOUR bumped with a foe just after the start, moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back, was urged along the rail
early on the far turn then shifted three wide inside the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. LAY ON MACDUFF was taken up at the start, went three to four
wide on the turns and was no factor. SUGAR PLUM KING lugged out in three path on the first turn, dropped back on the outside on the backstretch, came
up empty into the final turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. MR. WATTX dwelt at the start then had the rider step off onto the
pontoon of the stall, came out riderless while many lengths behind the rest of the field and was caught by the outrider on the backstretch then walked off.
