Footnotes
REESE C disputed the pace along the inside, battled resiliently through a prolonged drive and was fully extended to prove narrowly best. ROSEHILL ROAD
contested the pace between rivals through the opening quarter, then outside REESE C in dogged fashion, fought hard but wasn't quite good enough.
CLASSIC WHISKEY settled saving ground, got through and finished willingly to earn the minor award. HONORS HONOR vied on the outside early, dropped
off of the dueling leaders after a quarter, was within striking distance through the turn and caved. LEFT OF CENTER was never a factor.

WESTONS WILDCAT raced in the three path along the first turn, set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and won
the nod at the wire. VIVO raced in the two path along the first turn, stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch
but was out-nodded at the wire. SILVER DASH was steadied along the first turn, tracked the pace two wide, was in the three path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch run. MACHO RAPIDO raced in the five path along the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the four path into the lane and
flattened out late in the stretch drive. RUBY'S RED DEVIL was never a threat. MYNAMEIS PRINCE was through after a half.

Footnotes
MARKET KING pressed early, took over command, was off the rail into the lane, drew clear in the stretch and held sway in the final stages. FLASH OF
PROMISE stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. CHICKEN TRUCK tracked the
pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and finished willingly in the late stages. HERZEN set the pace early, was in the four
path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch run. PUBLIC SAFETY was in the four path into the lane with a minor gain in the stretch drive. LOUIS LE
GRANDE was never a threat. PRICELESS MIRACLE broke awkwardly and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
YESTERYEAR vied for the lead early on four wide, was in the three path into the lane, drew clear down the lane and held sway in the final stages.
PASSTHECAT chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and slowly gained on the winner in the final stages.
WORN A BIT vied for the lead early from between horses, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. DERBYS MONEYMAKER vied
for the lead early along the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. EVER ON COWBOY was never a threat. SAN
VALENTINO was never a factor. BOBBY BOOTS stumbled at the start and was done early. OTSEGO had early speed then folded up.
