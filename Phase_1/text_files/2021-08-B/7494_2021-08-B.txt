Footnotes
LA CROIX chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, advanced through the turn two wide, ranged up to leader in
upper stretch, and drove clear while lugging in late. EXPENSIVE DEVON tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on
the turn, launched bid along the inside, and got up for second late. LUCKY DAUGHTER cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear entering turn, held
slim margin entering the stretch, overtaken by winner in upper stretch, kept on while losing second late. BADGER GAL stalked leader three deep on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch three wide and finished up willingly while gaining on leaders. GODDESS APHRODITE off a bit
slow and stalked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in between on the turn and into the stretch, kept on well enough to best rest. IN IT
FOR LIFE came in at the start three lanes, saved ground inside of three horses on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to
improve in the lane. DAIRY KID floated in at the start, had to steady off heels exiting the chute, trailed on the backstretch, angled to the three path on the
turn and failed to threaten. NIP NAP bobbled at the start, sent to contest the pace, settled into a chasing position two wide on the backstretch, entered turn
two to three wide, failed to match strides with rivals starting around the three sixteenths, and failed to have any finish in the lane. BEYOND THE CLOUDS
stalked leaders four wide on the backstretch, continued four wide on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.
