Footnotes
NINE SHOTS prompted pace three wide and outside, dueled out of the turn, beginning edge away late under steady handling. WIDDLE ZEE also with the
pace from the start, dueled inside the winner late in the turn, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, clear of the others. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY last
away, lacked early foot, staged a belated rally to annex the show, too late for the top two. TRAELEE contested the issue up front for four furlongs between
foes then could not keep up. HOPE FOR CHANGE remained always back. D W STRONG was finished early, well beaten at the end. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SATURDAY'S GOLD allowed the dueling leaders to go early, three wide into the lane, challenged on the outside inside the furlong marker, kicked well clear.
MINISTER'S MEDAL broke alertly, dueled up front in the run up the backstretch off the inside, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, proved no
match for the winner late, held sway for the place. SAPONI void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, rallied mildly to be slowly getting to the runner up
late. PAT ME DOWN off a couple of lengths slow, trailed early as a result, moved out to be well out in the course into the turn, picked off a single tiring rival
while not a serious threat. SMITTYS PATRIARCH asked a bit to maintain inside position early, dueled into and through the turn, continued on equal terms
with the runner up into the straight, caved in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BAR TAP broke out, bumped with runner up, with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way through the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled into
the lane, shook off that foe and drew well clear under a steady hand ride. ORB'S SOUL mid pack early, early move into a forward position four wide, vied
three wide into the lane, dueled briefly with the winner into the lane outside that one, proved no match in the final furlong, clearly second best. KRIS T.
pressed early between foes and outside the winner, continued in a forward position second turn, could not keep up in the drive while driving outside,
narrowly saved the show. GEORGIA DAWN forwardly placed off the inside, steered to the inside a bit nearing the furlong grounds, had little left late to finish
up evenly and be outkicked for the show. LADY RAD went one paced throughout while saving ground. NANA'S JOY broke back, raced four wide into the
first turn, never menaced. TIZ ONE FEE remained back throughout to be a non factor. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED

THREE RUN HOMER broke on top, bothered midway on the first turn as COUSIN DARIO crossed to the inside, himself then moved out well wide to chase
that rival onto the backstretch, inherited a clear advantage when that same foe pulled up in distress before a half, steadily drew out through the lane to prove
much the best. CHAOSMOS forwardly placed early, chased the winner into and through the final turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best.
LOUISIANA MOON settled off the leaders, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. BIG MONEY MACHINE last away, trailed throughout
to be never a threat. COUSIN DARIO crossed to the inside in the first turn to set the pace, showed the way onto the backstretch, pulled up abruptly in
apparent distress before a half, vanned off. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
JANET'S DEVIL broke in good order, vied three wide early, dueled into the stretch, continued on equal terms with the runner up past the furlong marker
outside that one, proved narrowly best late under firm handling in a determined effort. STARSHIP FESTIVAL broke on top, set or forced the pace while
closest to the inside, extended and spirited stretch duel, proved stubborn to the end, remained clear for the place. VODKA GIMLET broke back, lacked early
foot while racing outside, five wide into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to finish willingly and annex the show. INTO WISHING settled off the
pace toward the inside, turned in an even effort in lacking a late kick. BOSTON BENBOW vied early while between the top two, fell back off that pair late in
the turn, continued to weaken a bit while drifting out in midstretch. SCORING DRIVE raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, lacked a
response when called on for the drive while in some mild traffic a furlong out. SMOOTH RIVER fell back steadily after the start, failed to menace. STAR
AND A HALF last to leave, remained always back. BIG SESSY forwardly placed for three furlongs, gave way in the drive, finished well back.

BURROW broke on top while racing off the inside, showed the way into the first turn, relinquished the advantage after a quarter, regained the. BIG POWER
RED settled off the pace and the inside, three wide in to the stretch, dropped inside, challenged inside the winner inside the furlong marker, outkicked while
along the rail at the end. OLD SOT void of speed while racing off the inside, was four wide through the second turn, rallied for the show to be far clear of the
rest, not a real threat to the top two. SOBEK reluctant to load, bumped at the start, lacked speed, staged a mild rally to improve position, never a threat to
the top three. WILD ONE FOREVER bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, lacked a closing response. JUSTA SWINGING chased for five furlongs, gave
way. LUNDI wide while keen and sprinting clear in the first turn, threw in the towel before a half, stopped and finished far back. OPENING QUARTER MILE

GRACE'S GAL away in good order, narrowly showed the way inside, rated while holding a narrow advantage up the backstretch, shook clear into the lane,
enough left to hold the runner up safe late. SAFE KEEPING last to leave, trailed for a half while four wide, began to advance continuing four wide in the
second turn, continued to make steady progress on the winner through the lane, not enough to contend late, well clear for the place. CIRCLEOFCOLOR in
some traffic first turn, fell back to trail after a half, came on the outside for the drive, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest while angling in late.
HAIRTRIGGER HEART restless in the gate, pressed the winner early, dueled outside the winner the middle half, faltered in the drive.
BLAMEITONTHEJOCK also somewhat fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced forward, lodged a brief bid three wide in the second turn, gave way in
the drive. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SCHIFF'S CORNER broke with the leaders, raced with the pace three wide into the turn, shook clear of the other speed entering the stretch, held a sizable
advantage past the furlong marker and maintained that lead to the wire under steady handling. HALF KOO KOO showed the way early along the inside,
vied through the turn closest to the inside, proved no match into the lane, could do little with that rival the final furlong, maintained daylight for the second
spot while under encouragement. BLUE DARTER pressed the issue from between rivals, began to weaken in the turn, came back for the show, not a threat
to the top two late. D'WILD BARONESS hopped at the start, raced back off the early pace and the inside, moved closer past midstretch, flattened out in the
late going to be outkicked for the show. TIME FOR A SONG broke in the air, remained always back while racing wide. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ENDURING PEACE broke in mid pack, raced within striking distance, three wide bid, took over late, edged away late under steady handling. ENOUGH
HEART raced back off the early pace, moved closer on the turn while racing outside, continued with that steady advance to be up late for the place spot.
VELVET NIGHT raced back early, moved out, came five wide into the lane, rallied to be up for the show late. C C CROWN'S CHOICE chased the leader for
three furlongs, challenged briefly nearing midstretch then faltered late. MA CHER AMIO off a step slow, void of speed, moved out, steadied in some traffic
midway on the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. MISSBUDLITELIME broke on top, sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch,
continued to lead by daylight turn, confronted past the furlong marker, caved in late. CRYPTO BRAVE settled in mid pack early, faded. GLADS LOVE CAT
was finished early, trailed home.
