quarter pole three wide, then moved in past the three sixteenths and drew off in the final furlong under mild left handed urging. MELTDOWN set a pressured
pace towards the inside and shook clear on the turn, then was headed by the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the
place award. KULMER was allowed to settle while three wide early, then moved to the inside leaving the quarter pole and was along for the show spot late.
RHETT THOMAS hit the gate at the start, then chased the pace three wide and then was empty in the drive. HART WELL had no response while saving

Footnotes
EASY SILENCE was well rated early while three to four wide, made a four wide move on the turn, hit the front leaving the turn and drew clear in the stretch
to prove best under a drive. SPEED ZONE stumbled badly at the start, then advanced five wide on the turn, continued to run on late gaining the place award
late. POLYESTER BRIDE bobbled at the start, then set the pace while racing in the two path, was headed leaving the turn and faded in the drive losing the
place late. DIAMOND DAWN vied for the early lead on the inside, then yielded and eased out leaving the half mile marker and stalked the pace three wide,
made a mild bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. WICKED ECSTASY chased the pace from the inside and weakened. ONE LUCK GIRL showed
little. The half mile fraction was hand timed due to timer malfunction

WHEREWEGOIN was well rated off the dueling leaders down the backstretch, made a three to four wide bid on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn then
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. FRANKINCENSE was reserved while two wide, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung
out four wide for the drive, then had a late rally. TRAFFIC PATTERN vied for the lead three wide while setting a fast pace, gave way grudgingly in the
stretch while moving over to the rail, held show award. CROCE D'ORO vied for the lead on the inside to upper stretch, then angled off the rail nearing the
furlong marker and stayed on to just miss the show award. HERECOMESYOURMAN was allowed to settle while four wide on the backstretch, made a four
wide move on the turn but flattened out in the drive. UCANTHANKMELATER was reserved early, raced five wide on the backstretch and made a mild move
on the turn but lacked a solid rally. TEZ was three wide into the first turn, then raced four wide on the backstretch and offered no rally. TRAFFIC STOP was

Footnotes
GAMERA stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front and dueled for command by the furlong marker, then
edged clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. EL BOHEMIO was in between horses early and shuffled back, then advanced three wide on
the turn, moved to the inside by the three sixteenths pole and rallied well on the inside. SACRED KIKI BIRD set the pace and crossed over to the inside,
then was headed leaving the turn and dueled for command to the sixteenth pole and faded late, bested rest. A LITTLE IRRADIC was reserved early and
was four wide by the three eighths pole, advanced five wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive. DON'T MATTER chased the pace on the inside and
weakened. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and offered no rally. TOPPING hit the gate and was off slowly,
then chased the pace three wide and tired.

the backstretch, moved out on the turn and came six wide into the drive and closed the gap late. DRINKS ON ME was three wide into the first turn, then
chased the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, but flattened out in the lane. BARREL OF DESTINY was allowed to settle while two to three wide on
the backstretch, was advancing sweetly on the turn and went between horses by the quarter pole, then had to check and took up sharply leaving the turn
losing all chance, then offered a belated rally. AZILOOK vied for the early lead three wide, made a two wide bid to set the fast pace on the backstretch and
weakened. GO YEOWOMEN raced between horses into the first turn, then chased the pace three wide on the backstretch, then moved over to the inside by

Footnotes
MIZBEHAVING SIS was off just a half a step slow, then was four wide early, moved in to be three wide entering the turn and making a bid, dueled for
command by the quarter pole, then took over leaving the turn and slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. FRIEND was well placed early while two
wide, then moved out on the turn and tipped out four wide by the three sixteenths for aim on the front runners, then finished willingly but could not gain on
the winner while second best. LADY BERNADETTE pressed the early pace three wide and made a three wide bid entering the turn and then dueled for the
lead two wide but inside of the winner by the quarter pole, then faded in the drive while besting the rest. MAYSVILLE MISS broke inward at the start, then
was void of early speed, started to unwind midway on the turn, came four wide into the drive and offered a belated rally while being hand ridden. QUEST
FOR GOLD was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside and faltered. SWEET TOOTSIE LU had no response while saving ground.

Footnotes
BIZERK was soon clear to set the pace from the inside while clear, came off the rail leaving the turn, then had a long drive with MR.GARY D and held on
gamely to prove best under a drive. MR. GARY D was well rated early and made a inside bid to go on even terms in the furlong grounds, but lost the head
bob to just miss. FADE AWAY was reserved early, moved out to be four wide on the backstretch, then made a four wide move on the turn to move into
contention, moved out five wide in the stretch but finished evenly while besting the rest. SECRETARY AT WAR stalked the pace three wide and weakened.
CABERTOSS was able to cross over to the rail on the first turn, saved ground throughout but lacked the needed rally. BETTER WATCH OUT chased the
pace three to four wide and weakened. STEWARDS RULES failed to menace. ORO DE TEJANO was not a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE STRETCH RUN BUT AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS. Due to a timer malfunction the half mile time
was hand timed.

Footnotes
FORBIDDEN FRUIT was well rated letting the pace setter go early, made a three wide move on the turn, hit the front leaving the quarter pole, then drew out
in the stretch under mild right handed urging to prove best. MYERS TIGER was keen early and opened up a big lead early on the inside, then was headed
by the quarter pole, ran on gamely to the wire to be clearly second best. STRONG ILLUSION was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the
turn but flattened out in the drive, bested rest. HOOSIER PREMIUM was allowed to settle while two to three wide on the backstretch, then moved over to
the inside on the turn and failed to gain. BLUESKIESATNIGHT broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then was reserved on the inside, angled out
in the stretch and offered no late rally. LIEUTENANT KITTY was reserved early, then advanced four wide on the turn and by the quarter pole but offered no
late rally. SECRET SADIE was bumped at the start, then lacked a rally. MISS FORT was bumped at the start, failed to menace. BERTIE THE BEAUTY was
slammed at the start, then raced on the inside and tired. PRINCESS LENNY was bumped at the start, then was not a factor.
