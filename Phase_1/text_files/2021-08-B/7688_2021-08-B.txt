clear under urging. LEAKY CAULDRON wasn't far back two wide then was best of the rest in an even effort. SEEKING THE DREAM chased the winner,
moved two wide to a short lead before a half then faded soon after. DETERMINED LOVE wasn't far back inside then weakened. FROSTED ANGEL was
close to the front to the turn then stopped.
