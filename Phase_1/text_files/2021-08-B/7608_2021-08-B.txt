commenced a bid on the far turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. ADD IT ALL UP gained the early lead, was challenged on the far turn, proved a
stubborn foe but was worn down late. COME ON SWEETIE passed tired ones. DANCING DIAMOND never menaced. SLOOPY HANG ON stalked the pace
and weakened.

SNAP AWAY seized command at the outset, edged clear leaving the turn and held sway thereafter. I THINK I KNOW YOU stalked the pace, proved no
match and stayed on. AMERICAN SUE settled well, advanced on the turn and managed a mild three wide rally in the stretch. QUEEN OF THE ICE was
always outrun. MUCH ABOUT ONE swerved in at the start and did not factor. RUN A FIRE ducked in at the start, buck jumped and trailed throughout.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO RUN A FIRE'S MISHAP AT THE START AND MADE NO CHANGES.

Footnotes
KID'S MISCHIEF seized command at the outset, held well into the stretch and maintained his advantage. BLANK IT stalked, proved no match and stayed
on well. GOTTA LOVE IKE chased while four wide, entered the stretch three wide and kept on. QUANA DUDE outpaced early, advanced on the turn and
managed a mild rally in the stretch. HEAVY FAVOR chased along the inside and lacked a rally. CHUCKMATE was always outrun. MORO CHARLIE failed
to threaten. HE'S SO ZAZZY threw his head at the start and was never involved.
