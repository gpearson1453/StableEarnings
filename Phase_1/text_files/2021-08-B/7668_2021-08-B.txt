HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, was collared by ANIMA entering the final turn, battled from the inside of that rival through the turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and
was all out to fend off TAKE CHARGE GWEN late to prevail. TAKE CHARGE GWEN tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in deep stretch to just miss. ANIMA broke sharply and
tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, collared the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, continued to battle into the lane,
and finished one out from the rail to garner a share in a solid effort. ZETAMARIE away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the
drive. CUSHMAN ROAD hopped at the start to get away poorly, and the rider briefly lost his irons, trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, began to advance three wide midway down the backstretch to gain a striking position approaching the final turn, rallied two wide through the
turn, but had little left for the stretch drive. CATCHACOUGAR settled off the early pace while under snug restraint entering the first turn, dropped back to
trail in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into the start, in particular to
CUSHMAN ROAD. After review there was no change to the original order of finish.

U DID IT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and drew off in the lane, while under confident handling to prove much the best in a dominating performance.
SHAMRA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail under snug restraint, rallied smartly two wide entering the
final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, struggled to keep pace with the top pair midway through the turn, and
had little to offer late. TOMMY TOO tracked the leader while being hung three wide entering the first turn, continued three wide in the run down the
backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the rest of the field entering the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
MOUNT ASGARD away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final
turn, and closed willingly to prevail in the final strides over a very stubborn JUST JIMMY. JUST JIMMY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled determinedly from
along the rail in the drive to just miss. ITSMYDAY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three
wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. WISELY PLAYED stalked the early pace while saving
ground entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. BARNEY
GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and improved his position over the final furlong without
ever threatening. THREE DAY BENDER broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of JUST JIMMY entering the first turn, forced the issue two
wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep pace with the top pair leaving the turn, and faded in the late going.
CAROLINA GENT tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the
final furlong. ONE TOONUMAANY settled well off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backside, was always well back and failed to make an
impact. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of CAROLINA GENT lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
MOUNT ASGARD for alleged interference in the run to the first turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original
order of finish.

Footnotes
REA MEA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained her position into the backstretch,
commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn and quickly assumed command, and widened her advantage through the lane while being kept to task.
PRETTY ARIA away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, eased herself into a stalking trip in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS unhurried
early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found
her best stride late to just miss the place. SUNBRIGHT raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while continuing to
save ground through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
