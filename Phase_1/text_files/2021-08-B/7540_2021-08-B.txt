LOOSE DIAMOND came in at the start, rallied around the second turn, assumed command and drew off under steady urging. CAPTAIN RED settled off the
pace, shifted out for the drive, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. MOONLITE GRAHAM sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead,
tired on the turn , dropped back and finished best of the rest. JU JU GUY failed to threaten in an even effort. INCLUDE HOO raced wide early and was not a
factor. YHA YHA was crowded at the start, was through early and stopped. Hand timed.

PARLEY STREET raced mid pack inside, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide and got up in the final strides. GEORGIAN ROAD vied three wide, fell back
on the turn, came again and was outnodded to just miss at the wire. GABO'S MACONDO was void of early speed, awaited room on the turn, bid inside, was
gaining late and got up for show. FLOWER BEACH vied inside, fell back on the turn, came again and earned show. SIX NINETY ONE vied between horses,
drew off on the turn for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and faltered. SPITTIN HAVOC showed good early speed, fell back and bore out on the turn. BOB'S
ALL IN raced in the back, was carried out on the turn and lacked a bid. The rider of GEORGIAN ROAD lodged an objection against the rider of PARLEY
STREET for alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made. Hand timed.

on the turn, went willingly to the wire and was outfinished in a good effort. MEET JOE raced in close, rallied four wide on the turn, closed steadily and gained
late to narrow the gap. HAVE A LIL PEPPER pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn and finished evenly. IT BETTER BE GOLD pressed the pace to
the turn, dropped back and finished evenly. HOLLYWOOD HEAT lost his footing at the start to be off slowly and trailed the field. Hand timed.
