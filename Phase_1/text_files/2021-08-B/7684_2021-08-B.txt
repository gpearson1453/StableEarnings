HEARTSET broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of TEXAS KID entering the backstretch, assumed command while mounting a two wide
bid entering the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and held MASTER EWEN safely at bay late to prove best. MASTER EWEN tracked the
leaders from along the rail entering the backside, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail to
prove clearly second best. TRUPON ONLINE chased the leaders three wide into the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final urn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. TEXAS KID away alertly and raced to
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of HEARTSET in the run down the backside, was unable to
match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

NOT YET settled off the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, maintained his position into the backstretch, launched
his bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to take control in mid stretch and inch clear late.
ADITYA broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, took
control entering the final turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, but was no match late for NOT YET, while proving clearly second best. YOU DON'T

midway down the backside, continued three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to be along for a share. TOBELUCKY AGAIN
away well and was allowed to settle off he contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, trailed the filed into the final
turn while racing one out from the rail, and finished two wide in the drive. MUSTACHIO away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ADITYA

RICHARDS COMMAND stalked the early pace into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly four out from the rail in the drive to get up in the final strides. WARRIOR'S PROMISE away well and stalked the leaders from along the
rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, dropped to the rail entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss.
BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, assumed command approaching the final turn,
and held a clear lead into the turn, fought determinedly while drifting four wide in deep stretch, but was outfinished late. OMBRE' ROSE broke sharply and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace into the backstretch, was overtaken approaching the final turn, saved ground
through the final turn, but had little left for the drive. DEVIL OF A DEAL tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DONE THAT was slow into stride while proving a handful for her
rider, trailed the field into the first turn while racing in the middle of the track, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, and failed to mount a
late bid in a dull effort.
