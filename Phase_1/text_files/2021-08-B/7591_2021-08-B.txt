Footnotes
LITTLE SAMURAI settled just off the leaders, stalked into the turn five then six wide, struck the lead past the furlong marker and was soon clear, kept on
with just moderate urging. SELECTION PARK settled at the rear off the inside, moved in from the four to three path on the turn, angled in once in upper
stretch for room, made no headway on the winner but was second best. QUICK TO FUSS angled in heading up the backstretch, went two then three wide
advancing between rivals to make a mild bid, was outkicked. BODIE'S LOVE set the pace racing off the fence, went in the two path on the turn, weakened
in the stretch. BINGOS SYSTEM was forwardly-positioned pressing the pace three then four wide on the turn, weakened. ELDORADO DREAM pursued the
leaders four then five wide, came up empty.
