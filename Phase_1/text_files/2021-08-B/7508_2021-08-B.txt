MAKE GOOD CHOICES away well, sat in striking position outside, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, dueled into the lane outside of NEVVARE
then edged away in the final sixteenth. BACK ALLEY CAT raced at the back of the pack outside, advanced quickly through the final turn, was gaining on the
leader late stretch and earned place. NEVVARE tracked the pace from the three path, moved up between foes leaving the backstretch, rallied inside of
MAKE GOOD CHOICES but was unable to sustain the bid required and was edged out late for place. RYANWATER reared at the start, gained closer order
on the turn and yielded. WISER TIMES quickly went to the front, showed the way through the backstretch and was done early. ADMIRAL VANNGO saved
ground and lacked a bid.

TONY'S TAPIT raced four wide through the opening turn, rated well off the pace outside, prompted action near the three eighths marker then obtained a
short advantage into the lane, was kept to task with a few reminders and held safely. BODEMONSTER trailed the field early, took closer order through the
final turn, bid four wide into the stretch, got by a tiring SMART PLAY late then was gaining on the leader but was no real threat. SMART PLAY quickly went
to the front, showed the way through the backstretch would good margins but saw them diminish leaving the backstretch, was confronted at the quarter pole
and was unable to rallied that was needed and weakened inside through stretch. BUCK WEST returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment prior to the
load, saved ground from just off the rail, lodged a rail bid approaching the stretch and passed tiring foe. BANG ON raced in closest pursuit through the
backstretch, raced two to three wide into the far turn and had no closing response when asked. COZY BEAR raced three wide to the turn, settled outside
and was outrun.

Footnotes
EXPLORER BILL tracked four wide, began a bid near the five sixteenth pole then gained the lead, responded to challenge from TANGERINE TAXI into the
stretch and narrowly prevailed under vigorous rousing. TANGERINE TAXI settled inside, angled three to four wide into the lane, rallied determinedly outside
under a strong hand ride and just missed after gamely effort. PREDESTINED raced two wide in second flight, roused into the lane and finished evenly.
SMALL TOWN DUDE raced three wide and offered little when called upon. KICKEN WEST G. vied four wide to the opening turn, prompted from the three
path, gained a slim advantage in the far turn but unable to muster the rally that was required and faded steadily on rail. POOR RUBEN offered little. SALTY
LITTLE DOG vied three wide passing the front side, emerged the leader into the backstretch, took pressure from just off the rail then stopped after the
quarter pole. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND broke poorly, urged closer to the field and was done early. TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to
a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
DANCE SHOES shifted out to the two path approaching the opening turn, sat in striking position through the backstretch, was given her cue at the quarter
pole sweeping by the leader, was kept under handling through the stretch and held. PLUM BLUE settled in stride along the rail, tracked inside along the
backstretch, angled out to three path into the stretch, was gaining on leader late and missed. XTREMA brushed leaving then settled mid pack, was roused
near the quarter pole and lacked the kick needed. MI REYNA sent for outside speed, quickly angled in to secure a rail position racing into the opening turn,
led the field through the backstretch from off the rail, was overtaken and gave way inside. RUN LOLA RUN reluctant to load, raced in close quarters racing
into the first turn, was under a snug hold along the backstretch, chased in the final turn and faded. BAKKEN THE SUN raced five wide in the first turn,
tracked outside and was outrun. SHE LIKES TO PARTY broke in, sat in range from the four path and was done early.

Footnotes
NO HARBOR IN SIGHT broke awkwardly, saved ground through the backstretch, gained closer order leaving the final turn, bid steadily outside and won
driving. DENSE FOG reserved off the pacesetters, overtook the leaders at the quarter pole and was out finished. PROOF IT rated well off the pace outside,
began a bid with two furlongs remaining, drove four wide into the stretch and held show. REY COLIMAN sat mid pack from the rail and rallied belatedly.
FINALLY GOTTCHA vied inside, pressed EVER TRUE leaving the backstretch and weakened in stretch along the rail. JOVIAL DESTINY chased
throughout. KING KLOVER lacked a serious bid. EVER TRUE vied four to five wide leaving the chute, took pressure through the backstretch and was
unable to keep pace with the field. WILSON vied between foes into the backstretch and stopped.
