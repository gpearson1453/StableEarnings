CAMINETTO set the pace from outside rivals, moved clear on the turn while moving in from five to three wide, extended the margin in mid-stretch and held
safe. SMART SPREE contended between rivals early entering the turn two wide and moving a bit nearer the rail, chased the winner but made no headway.
MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC contended inside early, steadied when in just a bit tight past the three-eighths, moved out a path after that then came out further
leaving the turn and ran on. JIM EDD WHO was urged along but lacked speed, switched out up the backstretch, went three to five wide on the turn. MR.
FEARLESS trailed early, shifted out six wide through the turn, came out a bit further in the lane and gained late. THIRSTY JUNIOR failed to rally after going
four wide on the turn. QUANTICO JOE was between runners three wide on the turn, steadied slightly past the five-sixteenths. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HE'S A HIT broke outwardly just a bit, vied inside a foe but well off the rail early, moved clear after the opening quarter, went in the three path on the turn,
was ridden out. LATENITE GOLD broke a step slowly, was forwardly-positioned between runners early, went two wide on the turn, made no late headway
but was clearly second best. WHISKEY THERAPY steadied ever so slightly at the start, trailed early, went four wide on the turn and was along for show.
YUUUGE PARTY exchanged a very light brush at the break, attended the early pace, moved in from six to four wide on the turn and weakened. PALICE
REVENGE exchanged a very light brush at the start, went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. PLATINUM GREEK came out three wide early on the turn,
failed to threaten. I AM A SOUL MAN was not a factor racing inside.

RUNNING FOR GRACE broke inwardly just a bit, vied inside but off the fence, edged clear on the turn, held sway under mild hand urging. BROADWAY
ROMANCE attended the pace from outside going four then three wide on the turn, was no match but second best. JASMINE WHO was up close early, lost
ground on the turn going three to four wide on that bend, ran on for show honors. LADAWN trailed early, went two to three wide on the turn, passed tired
rivals. DIAMOND ONTHE TOE attended three wide and between heading into the turn, dropped back and shifted to the rail on that bend, weakened. JAZZY
RED failed to threaten racing inside.

Footnotes
INGLENOOK vied for the early lead racing off the fence, edged clear on the turn in the two path, met a challenge in upper- to mid-stretch, drifted out late but
held. BLUE LUNA WHO switched off the inside, advanced four then five wide on the turn, made a mild bid in upper- to mid-stretch, could not get by and was
not persevered with at the end. TEXANA was forwardly-positioned between runners early, went two to three wide on the turn, had no extra in the drive.
ZIPPIN BY U pressed then stalked from outside going three to four wide on the turn, weakened. INFINITE TALENT was bumped and steadied after the
start, saved ground inside but came up empty. CATTY DOM bumped the inner foe at the start, went in the two to three path on the turn and was not a
threat. BLAIRS GAL was not a factor racing in the two to three path on the turn.
