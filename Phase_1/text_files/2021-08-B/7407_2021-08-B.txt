yielded grudgingly and held for place. DYNA CAT raced close to the pace, shifted out on the turn, closed steadily and got up for show. GABO'S MACONDO
raced outside, lacked the needed late rally and was outfinished for show. NEVADAN dueled past the eighth pole and faltered. CHILL HAZE was off a step
slowly, moved up inside and was through early. Hand timed.

HAIL ON HOOFS set the pace, drew off at the top of the stretch for a clear lead, was shortening strides late and just lasted. SUBTLE RIDE was unhurried
early, saved ground to the turn, shifted out, closed under steady left handed urging and was gaining late. SALSA VERDE raced mid pack, bid off the rail,
closed steadily and was gaining late. ORATORY GLORY trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. OWEN'S SHOT veered out at the start, stalked the pace,
angled in on the turn, bid and came up empty. UH OH SEVEN stalked the pace to the second turn, angled out and gave way. Hand timed.
