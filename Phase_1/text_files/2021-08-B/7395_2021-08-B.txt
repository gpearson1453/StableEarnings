placed inside turn, rail bid into stretch, was no match for the winner, gave best to save the place. TUFFENOUGHTOSTART had outside speed under
pressure, short clear lead turn, gave way into stretch, kept coming with a place bid outside. MISS TIZZY FIT pressed inside early, saved ground turn,
advanced mildly. DONT GET SMART showed little back and off the rail. QUIETLY QUICK stumbled at the break, stalked outside, lacked rally.
