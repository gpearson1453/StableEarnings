Footnotes
MISS NITAP broke sharp, dueled up front closest to the inside up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed just as a second foe was challenging midway
on the turn, shook clear of that rival when straightened for home, maintained daylight late under a firm and steady right handed crop. G'S SQUEEZE closest
to the dueling leaders in the run up the backstretch, advanced and tried the winner from the outside late in the final turn, could not keep up with that one the
final furlong, remained clear for the place. K R LUCKY DAY settled off the pace just off the inside, dropped toward the inside to improve while saving ground
into the lane, could do little with the top pair in the run to the wire. BIND ON EARTH dueled early outside the winner for just over two furlongs and began to
weaken. BUILDING HOME a bit antsy in the gate prior to the start, broke a step slow and failed to seriously menace. FINNLEYS ENCORE broke back and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BE A BANDIT settled behind the pace early inside, moved closer late backstretch, moved out slightly and took over three furlongs out, clear by late in the
final turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the lane while kept to pressure. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH in the second flight early, closed the gap into
the far turn, chased the winner into the lane, could do little with that one the final furlong, fully extended to persevere for the place. CAJUN SHOTS five wide
into the first turn when well off the pace, raced back the middle half, came five wide out of the final turn, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be
gaining for the place. MISS MABELEE tucked in to save some ground from well out in the strip into the first turn, raced in mid pack the middle half mile,
came four wide out of the final turn, improved slightly while also closing the gap on the runner up. LAST DESTINY fell back to trail soon after the
start,continued to see them all in the run into the final turn, passed tiring rivals to improve position without posing a serious threat. ABIGAIL G angled in
entering the first turn, bit closer after a half, three wide into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. CANDY CANDY CANDY chased the early leader,
began to fade after a half toward the inside. SALT LIFE ANGEL sprinted out to a long lead the opening quarter, continued to show the way by daylight up
the backstretch, gave way when headed by the winner in the far turn. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ANDIAMO GIACOMO broke out, was straightened to race in the second flight inside, steered out three wide late turn, challenged, took over, well clear a
furlong out, held the runner up safe late. CUSTOM KAT broke out, settled in mid pack inside, angled out turning for home to bother PALACE WIND entering
the stretch, set down for the drive, finished up willingly to be steadily getting to the winner late. SAILING JETT in the main body for a half outside, came five
wide into the lane, staged a mild rally race closest to the top two a furlong out, lacked an addtional bid, saved the show. PALACE WIND steadied at the start
to be last away, moved up to mid pack off the inside the opening quarter, raced in the two path through the turn outside the runner up, bothered a bit by that
one entering the stretch, finished up evenly. NOSY BANKER raced in the second flight off the inside, had little for the drive. MUSADA broke on top, sprinted
clear soon after, set the pace for a half, weakened when headed by the winner in upper stretch. YANK CRIME chased the leader for a half, gave way. IZZY
B WINN broke back, trailed throughout, never a factor. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PALACE WIND AGAINST CUSTOM KAT
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MADISON'S PLACE broke on top despite coming out a bit, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear in the turn, steadily
increased his advantage through the lane under firm handling. SWEET PRAYERS allowed the pace to go early, moved closer three wide while under
pressure turning for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, saved the place late while under pressure. AREYOUINABAND forwardly placed
while racing off the inside, came between foes into the lane, set down, not enough late for the place, narrowly saved the show. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA
dueled inside, fell back, went evenly in the drive while remaining along the rail. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES raced back off the pace and the inside, came
four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on. FOURSWEETNIECES broke in and steadied to be last away, trailed early as a result,
improved a bit into the lane, waited behind a wall of horses nearing the furlong grounds, lacked a kick when clear late. JENNIFER'S ARCH finished early,
fell further and further back to trail home well beaten.

Footnotes
SNEAKY ALLIE KAT fell back a bit after the start, mid pack and in some traffic onto the backstretch, began to advance on the outside into the far turn, four
wide into the lane when rallying, closed with good determination to get up for part of the win. ALIGNED INTEREST prompted the leader off the inside,
moved to challenge second turn, shook clear into the lane, drifted out nearing the furlong grounds, dug in late to respond when challenged, held gamely to
earn the dead heat. MARVINS GOLD in the second flight along the inside, inched a bit closer into the lane, poised to make a late bid, came up lacking in the
late going. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY void of speed while racing off the inside, improved position bit into the lane, not a serious threat. MORO PHAROAH in
mid pack early, fell back the middle part, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a posing a serious menace as well. DARK MATTER broke alertly, set
the pace inside, weakened when headed turning for home. BEAUX VICTORY four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside and was four
wide again into the lane when tiring, continued to fade. FULLY PERSUADED off a step slow, was five wide into the first bend, stopped after a half, far back.

Footnotes
ALTERANA pressed the pace for a half off the inside, crept closer late in the turn, extended stretch duel, drifted out slightly midstretch, finished with good
determination to prove best. HIGH CRUISE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, continued to set the pace turn, responded
when challenged from the outside entering the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. BEST
YOU EVER SEEN back off the early pace while between foes into the turn, continued in the two path for the drive, proved no match for the top two, edged
clear of the others. PARK RIDGE BENNY went one paced throughout while saving ground to no avail. OUTOFTHISGALAXY in the second group while
outside, four wide into the lane, lacked the needed response as well. BROADWAY ICE last away, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field,
jogged in.

Footnotes
IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME allowed the pace to go early, went after the leader far turn, took over, dueled into and through upper stretch, put that foe away late
then held the runner up safe in the final strides. KATIE'S KARAT last away, raced back off the early pace, came three wide out of the final turn when
advancing, slowly getting to the winner in the waning strides. WORLD OF WONDER broke alertly, was keen while stealing off to a long early lead, continued
to hold a large margin into the far turn, responded when challenged soon after, headed, found more to duel upper stretch, proved stubborn until weakening
in the late going to lose the second spot while saving the show. JUST PASSING THRU turned in an even effort throughout in failing to produce a closing
response. GATOR PROUD lacked speed in trailing for much of the way, switched to the outside for the stretch run, came up empty. VERRAZANO ISLAND
closest to the leader for a half, closer far turn then gave way soon after. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SPECIAL STORM broke back, moved up steadily to be a forward factor before a quarter, vied three wide turn, dueled through the stretch, proved narrowly
best in a determined effort. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR broke on top, sprinted clear early, vied along the inside through the turn, dueled with the winner
closest to the rail stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. LIGHTNING HARBOUR chased early, advanced to challenge between the top
two through the turn,could not keep up with that pair in the drive, remained clear of the rest. THE THREE KS last away, remained back the opening two
furlongs, improved position gradually while not a serious threat. UNBRIDLED HOPE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. PRIORITY
POINTS void of speed the opening quarter, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious factor. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY broke back, advanced
with a middle move four wide into the early part of the turn, gave way. HEZA FORTUNE raced in mid pack the opening quarter, stopped before three
furlongs, finished far back.
