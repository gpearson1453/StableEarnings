TWISTED PATH stalked the pace, settled in mid pack, closed on the far turn, chased into the stretch, bid a furlong out, drove clear, was drifting out in the
late stages but held sway under light handling. POPTHECHAMPAGNE raced in mid pack while two and three-wide on the both turns, chased into the
stretch and rallied gamely. CANADIAN ESSENCE set a pressured pace, was hustled from the rail late on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch,
was passed a furlong out and chased to no avail. ELFIN FOREST was pinched back leaving the gate, got up to force the pace, was lapped on to late turn
but evened out in the stretch. MI TIA REGIS settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. ALIYAH'S ACTION
stalked the early pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch and evened out. ROSES LITTLE GIRL broke inward and
settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
I'LL TAKE THE GOLD, in range, rode the rail throughout, was steadied behind rivals near the top of the stretch, bid along the fence mid stretch, drove clear
and came out a bit but held sway under a drive. ASHA IRONBORN forced the pace, dueled into the stretch, was headed, rebid mid stretch but was
outkicked. STARLIGHT RIDGE settled at the rear of the pace, came four then three-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied
outside. HAI BOBBI, in range, raced two-wide on the turn, was boxed in upper stretch, found path and angled clear then chased to the end. BOBBI'S
LEGACY broke through the gate, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, was pinched back mid stretch and evened out. VERY SAVVY pressed
three-wide, continued to dog the leaders through the turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out in the final furlong. AFTER REVIEWING THE START THE
STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT BOBBI'S LEGACY HAD AN UNFAIR START AND WAS DEEMED TO BE A NON STARTER. IT WAS ORDERED THAT
THERE WOULD BE REFUNDS FOR ALL SINGLE RACE TICKETS WAGERED ON BOBBI'S LEGACY AND MULTI RACE BETS USING BOBBI'S
LEGACY WOULD RECEIVE THE RACE FAVOURITE IN HER PLACE IN THE SECOND RACE.

Footnotes
READY LADY led quickly, allowed two rivals to go to the front so as to sit in behind them on the rail, followed the eventual pace survivor and second place
finisher into upper stretch, got a seam inside the three sixteenths and ran by that one at the sixteenth pole in a very professional debut performance.
GUILEFUL took the lead inside a rival soon after the start, was challenged and headed by that one late on the turn but was playing possum, shook that foe
off in upper stretch but couldn't hold the perfect trip winner at the sixteenth pole, clearly second best. EVERYDAY MAGIC four wide and in midpack down
the backside, moved up four to five wide into contention on the turn, tipped out to the six path in upper stretch and looked menacing at the eighth pole but
hung in the final sixteenth. HALLANVAARA had one rival beat on the turn, closed inside and angled out to the four path in upper stretch but could only inch
up down the lane to grab a minor award. SWOOP TO FINISH broke slowly but quickly recovered to get up the rail in behind the eventual winner late on the
backside, dropped back before coming three to two wide on the turn and shifted out five to seven wide in upper stretch but ran out of run in the final
sixteenth. JOIN THE DANCE broke slowly, up quickly to chase the leaders between rivals and out side the winner, still in behind the leaders awaiting room
in upper stretch and bumped by a drifting in foe at the three sixteenths, dropping back from that point when room appeared. ROSIE AMOR began slowly
and was in mid pack, came three wide to bid on the turn but was out of run by midstretch and faded. MIZZ GEMMA stalked and pressed the leader, took a
brief lead late on the turn but had given that up in the early stretch, dropping positions in the final eighth. GOLDEN STING had no early speed and was
always far back.

TRANSIENT (GB) settled in mid pack, closed two to four-wide through the far turn, launched a strong drive, swept to the lead upper stretch and widened
under a drive. BEQUIA settled at the rear of the pace, closed between rivals late turn, chased into the stretch but ran into traffic, hung briefly then rallied
smartly. CAPPY raced from off the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn, tipped out mid stretch and rallied gamely outside. UMNEYAAT
broke outward, dueled outside two others, was taken back mid backstretch to stalk the duelers, chased three-wide late turn, bid upper stretch but was
outkicked through the stretch. TRANQUIL SKY settled in mid pack, chased from the rail on the far turn, launched her bid upper stretch but was forced to
steady in tight on the fence a furlong out, angled outward and finished gamely. VIVID VIXEN dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch, launched her bid,
was outkicked and gave chase. BUTTERED TOAST dueled from the inside, gained a short lead at the top of the stretch but was quickly passed by
TRANSIENT and chased along with her peers.

IL MALOCCHIO raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide through the far turn, challenged well into the final furlong and prevailed under a drive.
EMMELINE stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch, was engaged in the final furlong but was
outfinished in the late stages. CIELO D'ORO broke outward and settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the far turn then finished under a
determined drive. MISS SPEEDY led quickly, set the pace well in hand, widened to a comfortable lead but yielded upper stretch and gave way. MISS
MARIE, rated off the pace, chased hard on the far turn then rallied gamely in vain. YOUENS raced in mid pack, was roused on the far turn and chased
through the stretch.

Footnotes
MODUS OPERANDI broke a step slowly and settled off the pace, closed three-wide on the turn, rallied gamely, led in the final furlong and finished under a
hand ride. DESERT POEM raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn then posted an all out rally between rivals. FINDING PERFECTION raced in mid
pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. HASSAH (GB) settled in mid pack, closed
three-wide late turn, moved to the rail mid stretch and finished gamely. CANADIAN MAGIC dueled, pressed the pace on the turn, chased into the stretch,
launched an all out bid but was passed and gave way. LINE OF VISION raced from off the pace, was steadied behind rivals early on the turn, moved
outside and closed four-wide then made a mild gain in the stretch. RINCE TAPAIGH dueled briefly and dropped back, stalked the pace from the rail and
chased through the stretch. MIZZONA dueled, led through the turn, was clear in the stretch but was swarmed in the final furlong and gave way. HOLD THE
APPLAUSE broke slowly and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased in the stretch but failed to menace. CALAIS COVE settled off the pace,
was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response.
