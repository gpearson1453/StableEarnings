BOOM BOOM GIRL stalked the loose leader, took over at the five sixteenths pole nd pulled away under moderate urging. THRILLING BABY settled inside,
angled out on the final turn and rallied. SOUR MASH took a clear advantage inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened. SAME MOON lacked
speed, saved ground to the stretch and just missed for the show award. CASTILLEJA settled off the pace three wide and was finished after three quarters.
MISQUILLO lagged far behind then caught a fading rival late. CREATIVE LOVE moved close up inside for five furlongs and stopped.

NOBLE ENDEAVOR pursued the loose pacesetter, moved inside leader in the stretch and quickly drew away while ridden out. AMERICAN QUALITY
sprinted clear in the opening quarter, drifted out in the stretch tiring but was easily second best. REGAL RUN advanced three wide on the turn then flattened
out in the stretch. ASHRAQ chased wide off the leaders and was never a factor. SAPONARA raced inside and was never in contention. BRONY BOY was
urged just off the pace inside and stopped after half a mile. THOROVER was a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

SUGAR STREAK rated three wide, took over when ready nearing the quarter pole then eagerly drew off while kept to urging. COTTON CANDY CUTIE
hustled to the front inside, was collared on the final turn and was easily second best. GALILEO'S AFFAIR bobbled just after start, settled inside and offered
a mild rally. LIL MISS HOTSHOT raced rank soon after the start, saved ground and faltered. DIRTY BIRD prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and
gave way. FLORENCIA raced wide off the leaders and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LOUIE'S WISH set a measured pace inside, repelled a rival on the turn and edged away under steady encouragement. LEGAL GUMP prompted the pace
outside, bid at the quarter pole then yielded. DIAMOND SETTER settled well behind, advanced inside then flattened out late. THE ROBERT trailed very
wide down the backstretch, made a brief bid after half a mile then proved empty. SPIRIT SPECIAL raced off the pace three wide between foes and lacked a
rally. MY MAN ELVIS raced close up briefly then gave way readily. DANGERFIELD chased just off the leaders in the two path and stopped abruptly. PER
RULING #22032PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, LOUIE'S WISH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.
