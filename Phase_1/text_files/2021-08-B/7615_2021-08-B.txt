Footnotes
PACHI was sent for pace, shook clear of CRANKSHAFT near the five eighths, set the pace in the two path on the turn, went to a drive midstretch, and held
sway. GRAND HIDEAWAY settled two wide in the rear flight, began to improve two wide approaching the three eighths, split horses in upper stretch and
was forced out slightly while getting through, angled four wide midstretch, sustained his rally but could not get all the way to the leader. MORRISTON came
out and bumped RENEGADE BOB in the opening strides, chased midpack, began a smooth bid in the four path from just past the seven sixteenths, loomed
into the stretch, could not get to PACHI, continued to give chase under a drive, and lost the place late. CRANKSHAFT was sent for pace but outsprinted by
PACHI from the five eights, tracked that leader inside of RAHFEE TOWN from there, saved ground around the turn, came out slightly in upper stretch and
forced GRAND HIDEAWAY out, and flattened out. RAHFEE TOWN tracked the leading pair outside of CRANKSHAFT, raced in range in the three path on
the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and came up empty. RENEGADE BOB was bumped by MORRISTON in the opening strides, settled at the
inside of the rear flight, trailed while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter and offered no response.

VITALE dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening furlong, dropped back to track the leaders up what remained of the backstretch, raced in the
two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and pulled clear while drifting out mildly late. BIRDMAN RICHIE
was bumped by the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead between horses and then on the inside up the backstretch, opened up while
saving ground around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival to the wire from
there. MEATABALL veered in slightly and bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, dropped
back slightly while running in the three path around the turn, and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. ERUDITE was away from the gate
slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn, swung out to the five path entering the turn and showed no kick. LIFE IS GRAND dueled for
the lead between horses in the opening stages, dropped back to chase the pacesetters on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the
turn and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
W W KAN DO was forward early, advanced to engage outside of MONGOL BULL nearing the half, cleared into the turn, set the pace in the two path around
that bend, swung four wide into the lane and was driven between horses, carried a narrow advantage through midstretch, lost the lead to MONGOL BULL
near the sixteenth, but gamely battled back to the front in time. MONGOL BULL broke sharply, led early, was headed by W W KAN DO to his outside into
the turn, tracked that leader into the bend, switched two wide and bid outside of W W KAN DO near the five sixteenths, swung five wide into the lane and
continued to fight on, wrested a narrow lead near the sixteenth, but was caught again by the winner nearing the wire. BOOM BOX was fractious in the gate,
settled at the rear, trailed into the turn, took closer order in the three path around the bend, rallied two wide between horses in the lane, fought on inside the
leading pair in the final furlong but missed. GREELEYS ICE tracked the leading flight early, bid three wide outside the leading pair past the three eighths,
swung six wide for the drive, kept on with interest to the finish but was narrowly outkicked. DUMBMARK chased between horses early, continued three wide
around the turn, was driven between horses into the lane, dropped inside in upper stretch, rallied and loomed midstretch, but flattened out in the final
sixteenth. RIPE ATTACK settled at the rear of the main pack outside early, bid four wide near the five sixteenths, floated seven wide into the lane, kept on
under a drive but was outfinished. EASTER MUSIC was sent for pace inside but outsprinted by MONGOL BULL and W W KAN DO, chased inside foes
down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, came into the lane in the two path, was driven behind the leading line, took closer order late but
ultimately lacked the necessary kick. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE OPENING QUARTER WAS HAND TIMED.

outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and weakened between horses in the final sixteenth of a mile. SHOWIT raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn between horses in the two and three path and was outkicked in the stretch. NICE
AND TRUE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and tired while drifting out in the
final furlong. STORMY EMPIRE trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, and made no bid.

Footnotes
TALE OF THE NILE tracked the leader down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and loomed outside the
pacesetter, drove to the lead with a furlong to go, and quickly cleared. TIMINGISEVERYTHING soon trailed, continued patiently in the two to three path on
the turn, swung five wide under a drive into the lane, and offered a strong belated rally to prove second best. FORT RIDGE chased midfield early, continued
well behind the leading pair two wide around the bend, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, rallied in the lane but
could not hold off TIMINGISEVERYTHING for the place late. STRATE REMARK was sent for speed, set the pace while keen early, saved ground on the
front end around the turn, floated three wide into the lane and was engaged by TALE OF THE NILE to his outside, was no match for that foe from the
furlong mark and flattened out between horses. MAXIMUS IMAGE settled at the rear of the main group early, improved position slightly into the turn, saved
ground while chasing around the bend, was driven inside into the lane, switched two wide midstretch, and was outkicked late. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS
tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, chased well behind the leading pair while saving ground around the turn, was driven between horses in upper
stretch, dropped to the inside near the furlong mark while continuing to chase the leading pair, and flattened out late. OFFLEE FUN settled toward the rear,
raced in the two path at the rear of the main group around the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, drifted out under left handed urging and
ultimately lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, gained ground on the
outside in upper stretch, wore down his rival and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. KENNESAW dueled for the lead on the outside up the
backstretch and from the three path around the turn, took over entering the stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and chased the eventual winner home
from there. ETCHED IN STONE chased the leaders from the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground
in late stretch while drifting out. NAME REJECTED tracked the frontrunners on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and
finished evenly on the outside down the lane. WELL TOLD raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. ONCOMING TRAIN raced in the middle of the pack in the opening stages, saved ground around the
turn, gained some ground down the stretch and was no match. LAKE MILLS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. KOSHER COWBOY hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch and around the turn and made no bid.

NOBALS chased midpack outside of foes, continued midpack in the three path on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths and responded well with
a rally through horses, angled inside of MAGICIAN STONE in upper stretch, drove to the lead near the three sixteenths, and drew off in the final furlong
while kept to the task. MAGICIAN STONE prompted outside of SUBURBAN COURT down the back straight, dueled outside of that foe around the turn, led
near the quarter pole, was driven three wide into the lane, could not hold off NOBALS as that foe rallied to the lead inside him near the three eighths, but
kept on stalwartly under a drive while drifting out to prove second best. BALADI was bumped by MAGICIAN STONE in the opening half furlong, chased
between horses down the chute, settled back to the inside of the rear flight, raced inside of LAND REMEMBERED in the two to three path around the turn
while still with the rear flight, swung four wide into the lane, gradually angled further out and rallied mildly for show. RED LABEL broke outward and bumped
LAND REMEMBERED in the opening strides, attended the pace three wide early, tracked the leading pair while still three wide on the turn, went to a drive
past the three eighths, raced into the lane three wide, proved no match for the leading pair into the final furlong and lost the show late. DRIVEN ONE
tracked the leading trio, was driven in the two path on the turn while continuing to chase midfield, turned for home two wide under a drive, lacked the needed
kick and weakened in the final furlong. LAND REMEMBERED broke slightly inward and bumped with RED LABEL in the opening strides, settled at the rear,
raced in the rear flight in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. SUBURBAN COURT was hustled to the
lead inside, set a pressured pace down the back straight, dueled inside of MAGICIAN STONE around the turn, was headed by that foe for good nearing the
quarter, and emptied out inside.

Footnotes
CHACALOSA trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, forced her way through a narrow
hole on the rail nearing the quarter pole, gained ground inside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. QUEENS UP raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the three path, began an outside bid entering the stretch and gained ground
steadily to the wire, but could not threaten the winner. PURR SEA pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path
around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, was caught with a furlong to go, gave way, and finished evenly while drifting late. PLUS CHIC tracked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled on the outside in upper stretch and
was outkicked late while finishing evenly. WONDERSTRUCK raced off the pace between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path,
swung wide entering the stretch and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. TONE IT UP trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch and
into the turn, raced in the two path from there, passed tiring horses in upper stretch and did not sustain her run. PRINCEDREAMCESS dueled for the lead
between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path coming around the turn, and weakened further in the stretch. SHEZ
RECKLESS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, was forced out slightly when
CHACALOSA came through on the rail near the quarter pole and faded entering the stretch. UPSIDE DOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn, tired further entering the stretch, was eased to the wire, and
was precautionarily vanned off after walking soundly onto the van.
