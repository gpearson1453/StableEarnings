Footnotes
WHICHWAYTOMALIBU well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drew off, then lasted under steady
pressure. ZOODLES mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. ANOTHER
SOFTBALL stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, weakened late and held the show.
SHOOT YOUR CUFFS mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. TRI TRY COLORS allowed to settle,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR never far back, saved ground through the
turn,
came
through
inside,
then
drifted
out
and
weakened.
TOUCH
OF
LA
GREY
improved
his
position.
MIKADO
was
a
brief
factor.
UHAVETOBEKITTENME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then faded in the lane. FIGHTIN PHIL was no factor.
