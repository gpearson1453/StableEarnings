TIMELESS BOUNTY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead, exchanged bumps while matching stride to the wire and
proved best by a narrow margin. TIME HEIST away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, dueled gamely with the winner while
exchanging bumps and just missed. PRETTY STORMY steadied along the inside near the half mile marker, altered course to the six path entering the
stretch and went evenly. ELGAR failed to menace. TYPE SETTER had speed from the start, inched closer three wide into the turn then came up empty.
BUCKY broke slowly and trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
