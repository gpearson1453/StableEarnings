SOUIXPER CHARGER set the early pace in the two path, then moved to the inside on the turn, was headed leaving the quarter pole, then responded well
when given a left handed pop with the riding crop, drifted out through the furlong grounds and was resolute to prove best. SHIPPINGPORT prompted the
early pace from the inside, then was rated back and taken off the rail to make a three wide bid on the turn, dueled for command leaving the quarter pole and
looked to gain a short advantage by the furlong marker, then was carried out through the furlong grounds and hung late. HARD NIGHT broke outwardly at
the start, then made a mild bid three wide on the turn and finished willingly to best the rest. HUG THE MUNNY chased the early pace two wide, then moved
to the inside and weakened. WYMAN was allowed to settle and was three wide on the turn but had no rally. MURDO was off slow then was reserved early
and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC D'ORO was settled three wide early in traffic, then once clear made a four wide move on the turn, then drew off in the stretch under hand urging
to prove much the best. VINEGAR VEGGIES pressed the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, stayed on willingly to be second best
while clearly no match for the winner. WARRIOR'S BATTLE set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened in the drive, bested rest. RUBY JANE
steadied nearing the three eighths pole, then angled out for racing room, made a run on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole but was empty in the
drive. AMERICAN REALITY passed the tiring rivals. ROYAL ROSIE pressed the pace in between rivals and weakened. SUTTON'S CAT was off slowly,
then made a middle move and tired. FROSTED CHARM was off slowly then was not a threat. RATTLEME chased the pace on the inside and stopped.
FAITHFUL AUSTIN was not a factor.
