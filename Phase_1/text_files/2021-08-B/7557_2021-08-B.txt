Footnotes
SMOOTHING IRON was unhurried early, trailed in the two to three path through the turn, shifted five wide in mid-stretch, got up late from between runners.
WESTERN SMOKE was outside a rival off the leading trio going three to four wide on the turn, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, made a late bid but was
outkicked. TAINO HOUSE pressed from inside, came off the fence a bit late on the turn losing ground on the leader, kept on inside that one in mid- to
late-stretch but was no match for the top pair. GUSHER bobbled slightly after the break, pressed from outside going three wide on the turn, kept on in the
lane despite drifting in a bit was outkicked. RED RASCAL raced off the leaders in the two path on the turn, came out seven wide in mid-stretch and was not
a threat. REBEL ROUX set a pressured pace two wide, gave way.

Footnotes
DOM WAYNE attended the pace just off the leader, applied some pressure to a new leader while three wide and outside that one on the turn, took the lead
in mid-stretch and dug in to edge clear and turn away rivals. COMING ABSTRACTION shifted in leaving the backstretch, tracked from on or just off the rail,
made a mild bid inside in mid-stretch but was outkicked. RIGHT JAB was a bit reluctant to load, set the early tempo then eased off the lead allowing others
to go on with it content to stalk four wide, lacked the needed late kick. SECRET'S DOUBLE shifted in from four to three wide on the turn racing just off and
in behind the leaders, was within range in mid-stretch but evened out. C D POLDARC was well-positioned off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, failed
to rally. POP QUIZ came out after the break placing rivals in tight, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, angled out past the quarter pole, ran on
five to six wide in the lane. REMEMBER THE BULL was in just a tad tight at the break then moved forward inside rivals but racing off the fence through the
turn with a narrow lead on that bend until upper stretch, gave way and faded. BAKERS CHOICE broke inwardly, trailed well back early racing off the inside
mostly in the three to six path and was not a threat. BIG WHISKEY steadied at the start, raced toward the rear three to four wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE FACTS exchanged a bump at the start then quickly sped clear to dictate terms in the two path, was still well clear into mid-stretch but had no
extra and shared the win. FRANKLYENERGIZED exchanged a bump at the start, pursued the aforementioned going three wide, kept on under steady
handling late to get up and share the top prize. PHOENIX FIRE was forced in a bit at the break, settled off the leaders, moved out from two to four wide on
the turn, came out six deep turning for home and rallied but fell short. FORGOTABOUTME broke in a bit, was close up off the leaders racing inside,
weakened. R H EXPRESS ran evenly while going mostly four to five wide. BECOME AN INSIDER failed to threaten moving in from five to four wide on the
turn.

Footnotes
SI CAPITAN MG settled well back early three wide, began to advance into the far turn moving out three to five wide on that bend, struck the lead by the
furlong marker and drew away under urging. SNOW IN THE NORTH shifted in entering the first turn, saved ground on the rail through both turns, came out
a bit in upper stretch and ran on for place. A B LOOKER settled mid-pack two to three wide early, took closer order up the backstretch tracking inside,
moved out four wide by the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch putting a narrow head in front briefly but lacked the needed late kick. MORE FIREWATER
stalked four to five wide early, bid three wide on the far turn taking a narrow lead but could not sustain the effort. COLOR ME GONE vied inside rivals, gave
way. IT'S OVER DUDE vied outside three wide early, continued to contend from between rivals on the far turn, came up empty and was not persevered with
in the lane. EL MAFIA had brief speed from between rivals early, dropped back while moving out four wide, was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
DANCES FOR KAMIA broke on top and quickly moved clear to dictate terms racing just off the rail, widened on the turn and into upper stretch then held
safe. D'TATWAY broke awkwardly and was then urged to keep up, went four to five wide on the turn, kept on late to get up for the place. FLYING BLUE
broke a step slowly and was in tight after the break, settled toward the back racing on then two wide on the turn, was in a bit tight past the three-sixteenths
and angled out coming past the quarter, gained steadily seven to eight wide in the lane. BETTY C chased the winner three to four wide, had no extra.
BRECHIN'S COMMAND went three wide on the turn, moved up past rivals into upper stretch then evened out. JERRYS WAY was mid-pack two wide into
the turn, shifted to the rail on that bend, came up empty. PARAWAN reared at the start losing the rider, walked off.

BIG MAC DADDY stalked from outside, moved nearer five then four wide on the turn taking the lead by upper stretch, kicked clear in the final furlong.
BARBARA'S CHAMP quickly moved to clear while moving out heading up the backstretch to dictate terms very wide, shifted in entering the turn going in the
two to three path on that bend, was no match for the winner. ESTEEMED broke a step slowly, raced well back off the leaders along the rail into the turn,
began to advance on that bend shifting out coming near the five-sixteenths, fanned six deep into the stretch and ran on. REEL EM IN was in a bit tight four
wide between runners early on the turn then eased off and angled to the rail, evened out in the lane. BRAZILIAN SUMMER was coaxed forward and
switched out heading up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
EVACUEE broke a step slowly at the start, stalked just off the leaders into the turn, went four wide on that bend, struck the lead just past the furlong marker
and kicked clear under steady handling. ON A WARPATH stalked the pacesetter into the turn, edged closer to press three wide on that bend, put a narrow
head in front briefly in the lane but was outkicked. CHEESE TRAY tracked inside, saved ground on the turn, came out five wide in upper- to mid-stretch and
ran on. CHAMP SPIRIT broke outwardly but sharply, quickly sped clear and angled in drastically, was challenged by an outside foe on the turn while racing
in the two path, weakened in the lane. STRAWBERRY WHISKY settled off the inside, went in the two to three path on the turn, swung seven deep into the
stretch and ran on. SPINNING BLACK was very hard to load, raced toward the rear going four to six wide on the turn, swung out eight deep into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. JORNALERO was forwardly-positioned racing two wide into the turn, dropped back and faded.

outkicked. AWESOME WALKER broke a bit awkwardly, moved up heading into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, swung seven deep into upper
stretch and improved position. BRYNLEE'S LEMONADE settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, passed rivals while running on evenly. SHEZA
DANDY R F raced evenly going two to three wide on the turn. ATILL I CHIME dueled outside a rival three wide through the turn, weakened in the lane.
ROYAL QUEEN switched out, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. TAYLOR RAIN showed very brief speed inside, dropped back and came out in
upper stretch but failed to rally.

Footnotes
MINE ME bumped with a rival at the start, tracked two wide in behind the leaders into the turn, struck the lead by the quarter pole, kicked clear under urging.
NOVA STAR bumped at the break, raced wide off the leaders going four to six deep on the turn, kept on in the lane to get the place. FABULOUS FORUM
was in a bit tight leaving the backstretch along the rail, saved ground, was in range in upper stretch but had no late kick. METAROSE settled at the back,
went in the three path on the turn, passed tired rivals. STREAMING TIGER broke inwardly then abruptly moved out, shifted back in heading up the
backstretch then back out again, entered the turn three wide, lacked a late bid. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE was up close early, went three wide out to five deep
on the turn, weakened. QUESTA set the pace while racing off the rail, went three then four deep on the turn, drifted eight wide into upper stretch and came
up empty.
