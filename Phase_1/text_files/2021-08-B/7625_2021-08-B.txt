Footnotes
MAJESTIC ATTACK broke a bit inward then was rated along the rail just off the early leader, commenced his bid on the turn, was roused leaving the bend,
put to a drive upper stretch, drew off and was kept to urging until the last seventy yards. CYCLONE ATTACK set a pressured pace between rivals for three
furlongs, did not stay with MAJESTIC ATTACK leaving the turn, no match for that one when set down for the drive but easily second best. CARNAVAL
CONQUEST pressed from outside then began to fade with three furlongs left.

LT. JUNIOR GRADE bore in as he was hustled leaving the chute then showed the way in hand, was put to a drive midstretch and lengthened command
while kept to urging until near the wire. FINAL CALL in contention early from inside, moved to the outside nearing the bend to commence his bid, advanced
three wide, took over second entering the lane then slowly drifted out as he pulled away for the place. NUMERO PRIMO raced in the second flight from
outside on the backstretch, was just off the inside taking the turn, flattened out for the drive but lasted for third. AWESOME SKIPPY somewhat slow into
stride, chased from outside, was in path three on the bend and had no late bid. MY LITTLE TIP was well placed from inside on the backstretch but gave way
midway on the turn.

Footnotes
EQUALLY EVEN broke a step slowly and outward, was allowed to settle, advanced four wide on the bend, rallied to gain the lead near the sixteenth marker
and was driven clear. INSTA GLAM pressed from outside on the backstretch, took over two wide on the turn, moved clear entering the lane, did not have
enough left deep stretch but stayed clear for the place. MARQUEE COWBOY broke alertly, set a pressured pace from inside, did not stay with INSTA
GLAM on the bend, ran evenly through the stretch and was unchallenged for third. PINCH MINE chased from midpack, had the rail on the turn, swung out
behind EQUALLY EVEN for the stretch run and made up minor ground late. LILALEE was an early factor but faded from well off the inside on the bend.
CREAL ANGEL failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. APPLE VALLEY was prominent from outside on the backstretch, three wide taking the bend then
gave way from between horses in the lane. FULL OF HEART chased from just off the inside, angled to the outside on the turn, had little to offer for the
stretch run and lugged in the final furlong.

W W COOKIE MONSTER broke on top, was taken to the inside, rated on the front end until leaving the bend, put to drive midstretch and kept
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER at bay. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER was soon pressing W W COOKIE MONSTER from just outside, all out in the lane but failed to
have the extra needed. D' YANK well placed from inside on the backstretch, angled out into the turn, moved back in leaving the bend, rallied belatedly the
last furlong and found himself boxed in nearing the wire. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in on the bend, swung to the
outside for the stretch run and had no late bid.

Footnotes
WAR COLORS advanced from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the bend, split rivals four wide leaving the quarter pole, fanned out further into the
lane, took over midstretch then drew away under a drive. FOGGY KITTEN showed the way just off or along the rail, drifted out to path three entering the
stretch then battled inside PASSION'S IMAGE for second the final furlong. PASSION'S IMAGE prominent early, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned
out to stay clear of FOGGY KITTEN into the lane, vied for the lead briefly then fought for the place, lacked the extra needed but stayed clear for third.
DEAUVILLE MIST well placed inside, failed to keep up along the rail on the turn, swung out to path three for the drive, failed to have a significant response
and angled in for a clear path in the waning yards. QUEENS GIFT pressed the early speed from outside, did not keep up leaving the turn, altered inside
FOGGY KITTEN upper stretch and continued to gradually yield. SIMPLY FAST chased from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, lost further ground
fanning to path six into the stretch and flattened out. TAP'S LULLABY chased from between rivals, swung out widest on the turn and had little to offer for the
drive.

Footnotes
FLASH OF MISCHIEF was kept just outside the early leader, roused two wide on the second bend, all out in the stretch, took the advantage with a furlong
to go, floated out a bit as he edged ahead the last eighth and held on under steady handling. IRISH UNITY soon had the lead and the rail, showed the way
in hand, was asked leaving the second turn, fought gamely through the lane but did not have enough in the waning yards. GAGETOWN moved up from
inside on the first bend, swung out for a clear path leaving that turn, was three wide taking the second bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. W W
CRAZY settled well off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, lost ground four wide taking the second bend, rallied belatedly the final furlong, came
up short but was easily best of the others. TWO WORLDS soon trailed from inside, angled out to progress nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane
behind W W CRAZY and failed to have a significant response. HOZIER chased from just off the inside and gave way from along the rail on the second
bend. EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE in contention early, began to fade from between rivals once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
ARCHIEMYBOY was rated on the front end just outside OIL MONEY, moved clear when allowed on the bend, steadily drew away under a drive in the lane
and was kept to task until nearing the wire. STALLONE chased from outside, stayed in path three on the turn, lost ground staying outside the drifting OIL
MONEY entering the stretch, took over second inside the last eighth and began to steadily lug in nearing the final sixteenth. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE reared
up at the break, spotting the rest many lengths, gradually progressed along the rail and caught OIL MONEY for third late. OIL MONEY vied for the early lead
from inside, did not stay with ARCHIEMYBOY on the bend, angled outside that one near the quarter pole, drifted out to path four into the lane, was no
match for ARCHIEMYBOY, began to wear down, altered outside STALLONE with a sixteenth left and continued to yield. There was a stewards' inquiry into
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE'S start but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
BUBBA CABALLO well back early, moved to the outside for a clear path midway on the backstretch, advanced three wide on the bend, swung out to the
middle of the track entering the lane, rallied under a drive, took the lead approaching the sixteenth marker then drew off under urging. HE HAS NO
FRIENDS shared the lead from between rivals, moved clear when allowed on the turn, drifted out badly into the stretch, bore in when put to right-handed
pressure approaching the eighth pole, was straightened, lugged in some, again under right-handed urging, with a sixteenth left and narrowly lasted for
second. LEE LA DEW gradually angled in on the backstretch, was just off the rail on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, gradually angled out for a
clear path as he made his bid, gained a clear path five wide and took over third in the waning yards. TO THE BANK angled outside BEE ATTACK after a
furlong, was two wide taking the turn, moved up to third and gained a striking position upper stretch, took the rail with a furlong to go and leveled off late.
BILLY NOT WILLIAM prominent from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, gained second upper stretch, altered in as HE HAS NO FRIENDS came in
approaching the eighth pole and flattened out two wide inside the last furlong. TOUCH BY FELICTY displayed early speed outside HE HAS NO FRIENDS,
did not stay with that one on the turn, came three wide into the lane, began to fade between rivals and gradually lugged in after entering the final furlong.
WAR TRAIL was steadied behind TO THE BANK after the first eighth of a mile, stayed well off the inside taking the bend and had no late bid. BEE ATTACK
disputed the early pace from inside but began to fade after three furlongs. YOUJUSTGOTTUPPERED showed little.
