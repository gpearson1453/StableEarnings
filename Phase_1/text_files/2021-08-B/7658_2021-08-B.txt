Footnotes
NO DOUBT steadied at the start, settled well back off the leaders, advanced while saving ground on the turn, continued to rally in the lane to get up late
inside. F S POSITRACK broke outwardly, was off the leaders racing inside, came out a path on the turn then another path leaving that bend making a bid
for the lead, took the lead just past the furlong marker and led till the final strides. MY CRAZY SISTER moved out and bumped lightly with a rival heading up
the backstretch, began to advance four wide on the turn making a bid at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort. KABULL chased the long
leader inside a foe but in the three path, lacked the needed late kick. MICKEYS GOLD broke a half-step slowly, was urged along but devoid of speed,
moved out from three to five wide on the turn and wider still for the drive, ran on with interest to pass rivals. SMOOTH BLUES exchanged light contact near
the half-mile marker, went five wide on the turn, came up empty. CHROMATIC JAZZ sped clear early racing off the inside, extended the margin in the two
path into the turn, was collared leaving that bend, drifted out while weakening in upper stretch. CAUSING CHAOS had contact with inside and outside foes
near the half-mile pole, eased back and shifted in to go four deep on the turn, failed to rally. DIABOLICAL TURN was well back early racing just off the fence
in the two path through the turn, was not a factor. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, FRACTIONAL SPLITS WERE PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY BUT
FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
VALUE N FAITH set the pace off the rail with a narrow advantage, entered the turn four abreast, edged clear and shifted in to be two wide coming out of
that bend, drifted out in upper- to mid-stretch under left-handed use of the crop, switched to a right-hand and straightened out and held. S S WINSTON
pressed from between rivals, moved out from two to three wide on the turn then wider still into upper stretch, kept on but was not enough. SUN TREADER
settled last but one off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn, came out in upper stretch and was put to a drive, was gaining but too late.
ANXIOUS INDIAN stumbled then bumped a rival at the start, chased in behind three then five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. S S DIAMOND was bumped
at the break, angled to the rail about the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn and flattened out in the drive. LIMITED OFFER
pressed from inside, steadily weakened. KEATON attended the early pace, moved in from five to four wide on the turn while starting to weaken, came up
empty. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL broke a step slowly and lost his path at the start, trailed racing off the rail going through the turn in the two path, was not a
factor. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF S S WINSTON AGAINST VALUE N FAITH ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
LAUGHING ROCKETT prompted the pace from inside, drew clear in late stretch. STORM N GOLD dueled outside going two wide on the turn, was no
match for that one but saved the place. CLOSING TIME CUTIE was off slow and lost her path at the start, thereupon angled in, went in the two path through
the turn, missed second. TIZ MY HOUR came out slightly and bumped a rival clearing the gap, stalked four wide on the turn, failed to rally. MS TAKE HEED
lacked early speed, angled in, saved ground on the turn and gained late. WAITIN ON A RAIN was outpaced early, raced inside on the turn. DR. MINISTER
was bumped into a foe in the early going, caught five wide into the turn then eased back and shifted in three deep before coming out a path leaving that
bend, failed to rally. SASSY QUEENIE was bumped early, raced outside going seven then five wide on the turn then came back out for the drive, was not a
threat. ATTACKING GIRL was bumped into a foe early, moved in six to four wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
GERDA'S GONE was unhurried at the rear racing inside, moved out leaving the first turn, advanced five wide on the far turn, took a narrow lead at the
sixteenth pole and appeared to wander out thereafter but nevertheless held. BLUE BOY WHO stalked three wide early, advanced three to four wide on the
far turn to make a bid, struck the lead and was clear into upper stretch, kept on late. TESTING THE WATERS went three to four wide on both turns, fought
on gamely in the lane and just missed. TRACTOR MAN set the pace in the clear after breaking alertly, raced two to three deep through both turns,
weakened some. WRAPPED saved ground inside, was within range heading into upper stretch but came up empty. BROZILIAN (BRZ) angled in earl on the
first turn, saved ground thereafter and ran evenly. REBACK HOME was mostly four to five wide, soon dropped back and faded.

ADORABLE BRITTANY vied between runners early and into the turn, went three then two wide on that bend, drew clear under a drive. INDIAN DIVA
exchanged a couple light bumps at the break, raced off the inside but inside a rival going in the five path on the turn, fought with that one for the place and
prevailed for the runner-up spot. SELL BABY SELL exchanged a light bump at the start, raced outside the aforementioned runner six wide and dueled for
place but missed. LITTLE VALLEY GIRL pressed from outside going four then three wide and came up empty. ZENMAGIC settled last but one racing in the
two path, ran on to improve. BUCA SARABI was in tight and altered in after the break, moved out to enter the turn three wide fanning seven wide on that
bend, kept on mildly late. MISS LUBBOCK exchanged a light bump at the start, moved to the inside tracking mid-pack into the turn, came out four wide by
the three-sixteenths and emptied out. SAY HELLO TO HEAT came out three of four deep in the early going pressing the pace inside foes, moved back
nearer the rail into the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
SAMURAI JACK broke out just a bit, tracked from inside, bid turning for home taking a narrow lead, lasted from the late challenge of DIABOLICAL KING,
who exchanged a bump at the start and was in tight, advanced three wide on the turn, angled six wide coming out of that bend, was gaining late but missed.
ALMOST A STORM dueled inside a rival but racing in the two path, dispatched that rival but met two others from inside and out late on the turn, kept on into
mid-stretch then yielded grudgingly late. MEGA SOURCE broke out just a bit, settled well back at the rear in the two to three path, gained mildly. LAYCOCK
BAY veered in and steadied at the start, made a strong middle move five then four wide early on the turn to reach contention but could not sustain the effort.
E BAR GOLD broke awkwardly and steadied a bit, chased four to five wide, came up empty. FAMOUS ROCK STAR dueled outside three to four wide into
the turn, dropped back and faded.
