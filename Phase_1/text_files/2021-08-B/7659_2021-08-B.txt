Footnotes
FIRST HOMESTEAD four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path into the turn and prompted the pace
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a right handed stick taking command at the three-sixteenths,
dug in under threat and switched leads after a right handed strike coming inwards a sixteenth out and forcing HUSHION to steady in behind, got corrected
switching back to his correct lead and inched away to the finish to prevail. MOONACHIE rushed the stall door as the latch was sprung bobbling a bit and
was away to a half length advantage, conceded the front and chased just off the pace just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away and kept on inside to the finish. THE GREAT DANSKY four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and
offered up a mild bid. HUSHION established the front after the start and showed the way in hand from the three oath, tucked inside through the turn,
continued three wide for home, got collared at the three-sixteenths, was guided out slightly and dug in under a drive and was forced to steady at the
sixteenth marker as FIRST HOMESTEAD came inwards switching leads under an off side crop, then weakened in the late stages. FREUDIAN SIP got
pinched between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. HIGH HEATER broke out at the start pinching back FREUDIAN SIP in concert with FULL SALUTE, chased along the
inside early on, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. FULL SALUTE broke in at the start bumping
and pinching FREUDIAN SIP in tandem with HIGH HEATER, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper
stretch, got placed to a protective hold near the eighth pole and was eased up before being pulled up inside the sixteenth marker and was subsequently
vanned off. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on FIRST HOMESTEAD and HUSHION at the sixteenth pole as well as a Jockey's
objection by the rider of HUSHION alleging interference against FIRST HOMESTEAD in deep stretch. After review, it was deemed that FIRST
HOMESTEAD had indeed interfered with HUSHION costing that rival a placing and FIRST HOMESTEAD was disqualified from first and placed fourth
before the race was declared official.

RING OF FIRE was fractious in the gate and tossed his rider out the rear then was backed out and reloaded, came outward at the start and bumped solidly
with PARTNER'S HOPE, established a good position under coaxing, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, rallied four wide under a
drive into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of PARTNER'S HOPE in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed in a
head-bobbing finish. PARTNER'S HOPE was bumped solidly just after the start, settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, rallied while cutting
the corner into the stretch, made a bid along the hedge at the three-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied on the wire.
ROGERS GINGER was restless in the gate, settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch then moved
further out at the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the show. UNCLE MO'S CAT settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, moved out
under a drive outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. CHARLESTON STRONG was hustled from the break, pressed the pace on the
outside of a duo, chased three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch under a drive, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and tired.
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE broke out and a bit slow, was hard ridden at the rear, started the turn in the two path, angled five wide at the five-sixteenths,
drifted inward in upper stretch, was guided around the outside of foes while lugging in a tad inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SHACKLE CAT
showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two to three path under a bit of extra left-rein pressure on the turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive and capitulated. EVERESTING was hustled from the start, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked three then four wide on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. NOT STORMY broke out a bit, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn,
moved into a reasonable striking position into upper stretch but failed to respond. CONGRATS FOR GLORY disputed the pace on the inside, vied along the
hedge on the turn, spun into the two path under urging at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded.

BREAKING THE RULES settled unhurried at the tail of the field along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside nearing three furlongs to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a good finish
closing through the final furlong, had a seam open up between the top pair but chose to angle to the inside instinctually as ANALYZE IT got directed out to
look SACRED LIFE in the eye closing the hole and was up in the final jumps to prevail. SACRED LIFE (FR) just off the inside tracking the front under a light
rating hold, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside through the final furlong and missed at the
finish. ANALYZE IT coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path under some prompting from MADE YOU
LOOK to the outside and widened away as a pair from the rest of the field, tucked inside through the far turn and came under coaxing five-sixteenths from
home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in clinging to the lead, got directed out to look SACRED LIFE in the eye a sixteenth from home and was caught
in the final jumps to the wire by a pair. MADE YOU LOOK coaxed from the start, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside three then two wide
advancing to knock heads through the latter portion of the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in threatening
through to the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. BODECREAM lunged at the start and was coaxed briefly soon after, settled just off the
inside through the first turn before giving chase two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the far turn urged along with five-sixteenths
remaining, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to the finish but was outkicked.

Footnotes
PERFECT MUNNINGS broke a half-step slow, showed speed on the inside of BLUE GATOR then dropped off the pace midway down the backstretch,
moved out with a half-mile to run, chased in mostly the three path on the turn, took over under a drive into upper stretch, shook clear under the crop into the
final furlong, had the rider put the crop away outside the sixteenth-pole and widened under a brisk hand ride to the wire while much the best. BLUE GATOR
broke in and bumped with a foe but came out in front, showed speed on the outside then moved clear midway down the backstretch, controlled the action
while a touch off the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then headed into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place.
BOURBON BAY settled off the pace, was taken in hand while off the heels of PERFECT MUNNINGS at the nine-sixteenths when that foe came out in front
then altered back to the inside, chased along the rail on the turn and came up empty while able to get the show. DADDY KNOWS was in tight quarters near
the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and had nothing left. BRONX BOMBER was in
tight near the three-quarter pole then dropped back, settled well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths
then driven three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BLEWITT lunged out significantly at the start and bumped with BLUE GATOR then was taken up,
spotted the front several lengths, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GERRYMANDER just off the inside just off the pace in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, edged clear briefly before digging in under threat from a pair in the late stages and held safe to prevail. DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE
coaxed from the gate, chased five then four paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn commencing a steady advance
from the three-eighths pole and coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
place honors. A MO REAY hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and
offered up a good finish to close in for the show honors latching on the top pair as they hit the wire. ROSEBUG broke in brushing the near side stall and then
brushing FANNIE AND FREDDIE, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn steadily
advancing and following DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position through to the finish.
MOMMASGOTTARUN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from OUR SOUPER LOVE to the outside through
solid splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded a furlong from home, then
weakened in the late stages. OUR SOUPER LOVE crossed soon after the start to the three path and prompted the leader from the outside two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened in the late going. FANNIE AND FREDDIE brushed at the start by
ROSEBUG, who broke inwards, came under hustling and chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under
encouragement from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.
OH MRS. MAISEL reluctant to load prior to the start, broke in brushing the near side stall and then recovered outwards bumping with SOARING, chased
two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn pushed along from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and
made no impact. SOARING bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and made no impact. RUN FOR THE HILLS hustled from the gate, had
MOMMASGOTTARUN come inwards and was placed in tight inside that rival balking along the rail three times in the opening furlong, showed brief speed
along the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, faded through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home and was eased
home to the finish.

few lengths, settled while unhurried on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then dropped back to the inside at the
three-sixteenths while put to a drive, rallied into the final furlong, moved out then bumped solidly with rivals on both sides while boldly splitting foes at the
sixteenth-pole, had her momentum stalled just a bit and finished with good energy but missed while able to get the place. VAGARIES (IRE) angled in at the
rear of the field, saved ground around the opening bend, settled at the back, was roused three wide on the final turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch, shifted out more inside the furlong marker, drifted in late and finished willingly to just get the show. BALI BELLE tracked the pace on the outside in
the two path, chased on the final turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead to the sixteenth-pole, drifted in under a
right-handed crop at that station then bumped with KINCHEN and weakened then lost the show. GUN BOAT went to the front then became keen when
taken under restraint, remained for the opening quarter-mile, showed the way near the inside, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came under a
drive in upper stretch, battled with BALI BELLE to the sixteenth-pole, bumped soundly with KINCHEN at that point and also weakened.
ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace on the inside, took an awkward stride leaving the backstretch, chased
inside on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the two path, dropped back into the final furlong, kept on into the final sixteenth and tired. BARRETT was
hustled from the start, settled in the two to three path, was urged along in the three path on the far turn then came four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. PEARL EARRING was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged
along in the two path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and was no factor. OPENTHEGATE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
MONTAUK DADDY broke out at the start and got out floating out to the five path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn under a tight left
rein and showed the way, floated three wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a drive and was corrected when edging clear to the eighth pole, held well to
the finish kept to task. DETERMINED FURY chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
closed well to secure the place honors. CHARLIE FIVE O six paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to be
along for the show honors. STANHOPE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to the finish. BARDOLINO three to four wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. ELUSIVE EDGE five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun four wide for home and was outkicked. OUR TROUBADOUR three to four
wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. LOADED JOE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and offered no response. AIR
SHOW chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed. WILD WILLIAM grew
fractious at the break just as the latch was sprung and nearly reared up, the rider dismounting to the stall pontoon for safety as the assistant starter rightly
released his charge with the gates springing open, got away well behind the rest without a rider and completed the course under his own power before
being apprehended by the outrider and walked off. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on WILD WILLIAM before the result was allowed to
stand and the race declared official.

Footnotes
SIFTING SANDS (GB) coaxed from the gate, settled just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide
into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to close in through the final furlong and was just up at the wire. DREAMER'S DISEASE established the front and
showed the way under rating along the inside through moderate splits, remained patiently handled and cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused near the
three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside and was nailed in the very last strides to the finish. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST
forwardly placed tracking the leader from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on
under a drive to be along safe for the show honors. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DR JACK saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no kick. RANGER FOX pulled on the bit eager early on under the restraint of the rider
and grew rank along the inside through hard held until five furlongs remained, tracked the leader from a loose pocket and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. IN EFFECT just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. STRAW INTO GOLD spun three wide into the first turn and
tucked to the two path midway, settled unhurried near the tail of the field, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide at the top of
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHULAINN was taken in hand early then reserved under a snug hold in the three to four path, rallied five wide coming to the quarter-pole, closed fast to get
the lead in upper stretch, battled outside of an opponent into the final furlong, shook clear approaching the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging.
LORD FLINTSHIRE went three wide on the opening bend, settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch
and finished with good courage to get the place. LANDBISCUIT moved in towards the rear early, settled at the back in the two path, angled four wide at the
five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly to get the show. JARREAU bumped with a foe just after the
start, moved in early, settled on the inside, raced in hand late on the far turn, was roused three wide into upper stretch, split foes around the three-sixteenths
and improved position to just miss the show. MADE MY DAY (IRE) bumped with a rival just after the start, went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off
the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the final turn, was asked while making a bid coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out in upper stretch, battled
with the winner into the final furlong and weakened. PARADE FIELD went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, raced two then
three wide on the final turn, dropped back some at the five-sixteenths, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed
response. GIRL DAD was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path, took the lead
before the five-sixteenths, led to the quarter-pole then was headed into upper stretch and gave way. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) went two to three wide on the
initial turn, settled near the back, saved ground while asked on the far turn, moved off the rail in upper stretch then came between horses and failed to rally.
GATEWAY GUARDIAN angled in early, went two to three wide on the turns, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CALIBOGEE stalked the
pace on the outside while three wide, was given his cue on the far turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated. MOLINO broke in and bumped with a foe,
was well placed while settling nicely on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved off the rail late on that bend and faltered. COUNT DOWN
bumped with a foe at the start, went to the front, tossed his head while keen under restraint into the first turn, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead
midway through the final turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.
