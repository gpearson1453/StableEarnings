inside in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, took control midway through the turn, and held ACE DEUCE safely at bay late to prove best.
ACE DEUCE away well and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and closed three wide in the drive to prove second best. PITCH COUNT away alertly and pressed the pacesetter one out from the rail through the stretch
the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival leaving the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive
to garner a share. CRAZY PROPHET unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide entering the final turn from the back of the pack, and
finished four out from the rail in the drive. BETATHANABOYFRIEND settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first
time, was asked to pick it up entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. SPOKANE'S GEM
