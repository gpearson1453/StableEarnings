GOLD ROSE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear advantage nearing the three-eighths marker and held by a
diminishing margin. SKY'S THE LIMIT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, responded when set down for the
drive and was gaining on the winner late to just miss. BIG CALI GIRL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted out in
mid-stretch and finished evenly when straightened away. DISCREET DEMONS showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

LARSEN BAY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. FLYIN BY was bumped
repeatedly at the start, pressed the pace of COASTAL QUEEN while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole but
could not match strides with the winner in the drive. COASTAL QUEEN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way to
FLYIN BY after the opening quarter. CELINAS BLUE BIRD was pinched back at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. BAT MAN'S BULL settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed rally. COASTAL CAT was bumped repeatedly at
the break, lagged early, angled out into the stretch and did not reach contention. HAVARTI GOLD settled off the leaders and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
IOWA KID sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TRIBUNAL LOVE chased the
winner while while racing three-wide throughout, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. OXBOW PARK steadied at the
seven-sixteenths and again nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out nearing the quarter and finished with good late energy. ROARRALLYROAR settled
off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. HE'S BANDIDO lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CHUCK'S BULL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
TIEMPO DE ORO was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

YOU GO GIRL broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane. FOR YOU
ONLY was away alertly to duel for the lead with the winner from off the rail, could not stay with that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place.
LUCKY LONG LEGS pressed the pace from the inside, checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with a late
bid. STAND IN YOUR LOVE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was not a factor.
SHARMEL was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MISS MONIQUE lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

STAND TO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. FRANKS FIX IT chased the
winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN lacked early speed, saved ground through the
turn and finished with good energy. LONG LANCE lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. FORTY SMOOCHES
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. AMERICAN BUDDHA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and weakened. LOCHNESS showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

SPARKLING LUTE broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the half-mile marker, increased that advantage into the lane and
drew off as a handy winner. MIDNIGHT LUCK chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to be
second best. MARK MY WORD chased the leaders while racing five-wide, drifted in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. PREMIER LEAGUE was
off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. REBEL ROAR was void of early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. STANLEY RYDER was away in good order to chase the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn,
checked in mid-stretch and weakened thereafter.
