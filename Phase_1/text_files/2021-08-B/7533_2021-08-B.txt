rallied, was clear late, then came out near the wire to bump the winner hard. KINGOFTHERAINBOW dueled inside of a foe, then yielded in the stretch.

Footnotes
APRIL'S NO FOOL was well rated along on the inside, lacked room by the three sixteenths pole, angled out for racing room and closed well to get up in time
under a drive. DOWNDELANE was rated along three to four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and shook clear by the furlong marker but it was not
enough, caught late. DANCE MONEY broke out and bumped a foe shortly after the start, stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but
flattened out. BACKHAND broke inward at the start, then was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide on the turn and came wide into the stretch but
faded. AMAZING GAL was bumped hard after the start, then went up to set the pace on the inside and gave way. NOBLE PRIZE was allowed to settle four
to five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BRIT'S WIT hesitated at the start, then was settled back while saving ground, advanced on the inside while in hand, then found room in the stretch and
quickly accelerated and drew clear late to prove best under a hand ride. CREATIVE MIRACLE was rated early and made a four wide move on the turn,
drew clear passed the furlong marker, but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place. SIEGE OF BOSTON was allowed to settle on the
inside, moved into contention on the inside on the turn, eased off the rail by the quarter pole, angled out by the furlong marker and finished willingly. MR
CREED was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and offered a late rally. SARGEANT BARGER chased the early pace and made a two to three
wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. KENDALL SQUARE set the pace while clear and weakened. STAVANGER was off slowly and failed to
menace. BETTER TONE was bumped at the start, then settled three wide on the backstretch, then was between horses on the turn and tired. CAUSE TO
CRUISE was off slowly and veered inward at the start, no factor. TOTALIZER stopped.
