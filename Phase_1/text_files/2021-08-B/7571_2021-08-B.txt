RAECHEL'S RISK took command at once, angled to the rail on the backstretch, was displaced entering the turn, came again soon after, drew clear in early
stretch then widened under urging while drifting out late. SMOKIN CLASS wasn't far back in the three path and lacked the needed closing. OUR SWEET
GIRL broke in the air, advanced outside early, opened a short lead into the turn then faded through the lane. SUPER BELLE briefly showed speed inside.
PAPI'S BABY GIRL trailed after a slow break.

KRISTO made a run along the rail on the turn, steadied behind the leader leaving the quarter pole, took over after five furlongs then drove clear through the
final sixteenth. THESE BLUES broke slowly, was unhurried early then finished fast outside. WHITE BLUFF rallied three wide around the turn, gave his best
on the outside into the final furlong then flattened out. TRUE WISDOM opened a clear lead soon after an alert break, angled to the inside entering the turn,
ran out entering the stretch and faltered. CUMBERLAND GAP rallied two wide between horses around the turn, loomed a threat into the final furlong but
weakened. MONEYBAGS trailed after a slow break.

TEQUILA FOG had position two wide and rallied to the front in late stretch. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out
from the inside and gave way late. WIRETAP angled to the rail nearing the turn, moved closer before a half then lacked a strong closing response.
CONGRATS ANSWER was very slow from the gate, lagged inside into the stretch then bore out under steady left hand whip. COLOR FORCE was finished
early.
