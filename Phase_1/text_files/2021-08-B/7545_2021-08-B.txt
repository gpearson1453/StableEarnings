CITY TEMPER broke sluggishly, rushed out to contest the lead along the rail, shook clear some a furlong out and under steady pressure proved best.
DOSAGE AND MIMOSAS away on top, contested the lead three across early, dueled into the lane, chased and finished well. GENTLE ANNIE never far
back along the three path, angled out some and finished with good energy. ANSELMI vied for the lead between, tracked the leaders along the rail into the
lane and weakened inside. OUCH THAT HURT broke slow, two path into the turn, saved ground into the lane and tired.
