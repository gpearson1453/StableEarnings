Footnotes
EXCLAIM tracked along the inside while a bit keen around the first turn, bid for the lead outside of the pace setter but inside of the bidding CARNIVORE into
the far turn, forged an advantage from that foe in upper stretch, shifted outwards while inching clear of that rival approaching the final sixteenth, and safely
held from a inside bid late. LOONSHOT was last away, saved ground at the rear of the field, improved to chase the leading trio from along the inside around
the far turn, shifted three wide turning for home, stayed on through the final furlong to bid for the lead inside of the leader late, but did not have enough to
catch that rival. CARNIVORE stalked two wide, bid for the lead three wide and outside of EXCLAIM, briefly showed the way entering the lane, but drifted
outwards approaching the furlong grounds causing him to be repelled at that station, then ran on thereafter. BRAZIL NUT settled off of the pace two wide,
shifted four wide turning for home, and chased from between horses through the final furlong. JACKPOT WINNER settled at the rear three wide, saved
ground while trailing around the far turn, altered outside of foes passing the furlong grounds, but continued to drift due to that correction, and failed to factor.
BIG PETE tugged clear, early on, met a pair of bids into the far turn, and gave way passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
DOMINAR stalked two wide, ranged up to the leader in hand with five sixteenths remaining, assumed command at the quarter pole, drew off under mild
hand urging through midstretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. AMIGO MIKE cleared off early on, but offered little resistance to the
bidding DOMINAR approaching the quarter pole, then safely held place through the lane. PLONDER stalked along the inside of DOMINAR while a bit off of
the inner railing down the backstretch, but failed to match bidding strides with that foe into the far turn, then chased while hanging on his left lead through
the lane without progressing on place. HARVEST GOLD chased from the three path while off of the pace around the turn, and failed to factor. FOX CREEK
LADY showed brief speed along the inside early on, but lost position at the nine sixteenths pole, and steadily faded thereafter. SHOE BIZ was outrun.

DOUBLE DARE YOU set the pace along the inside, showed the way while well in hand around the turn, spurted clear from chasing foes in upper stretch,
and held sway to the wire. MAGNA G FORCE stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that foe
home while holding place late. LADY JENNEVIERE tracked two wide, awaited racing room from between horses turning for home, held her path entering
the lane while commencing a chase, then shifted three wide at the sixteenth pole, and produced a belated gain. PARKING TICKET saved ground off of the
pace, but to no avail. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) tracked three wide, but came under an all out drive to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, failed to respond, and
faded turning for home. SKYVALUE pressed the pace two wide, but faded at the quarter pole. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS

CHROME FINISH dueled for the lead inside of ELVIRUS, disposed of that foe passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off turning for home, and was driven
home under strong urging. BLAKE B. bumped the gate at the start causing his rider to briefly lose his right iron, trailed along the inside, gained on the
leading pair turning for home, swung outside of them entering the lane, claimed place from a tiring foe in midstretch, and proved second best. ELVIRUS
dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. COMMAND CENTRAL was outrun.

Footnotes
ISLAND BOY set the pace along the inside, met TKOTCHKE's bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, dug in to resist that foe turning for home, repelled
that rival in upper stretch, and held firmly to the wire. TKOTCHKE stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, but
was repelled in upper stretch, and ran on well. FRA MAURO settled off of the pace two wide, bid for show between horses in upper stretch, and claimed that
position at the furlong grounds. JUST A IRISH LAD saved ground while tracking the pace, but to no avail. FATHER G tracked three wide, came under an all
out drive to keep pace into the far turn, but tired entering the lane. SPHEROID was outrun.
