ADULTING broke sharply to the top shaking off pressure on the turn to go clear along the inside in upper stretch then barely held to a late challenge at the
wire. DREAMING OF PARIS tracked evenly through the turn moving five wide in upper stretch angling in a bit finding a final surge missing on the wire.
DATA PRINCESS stalked the pace pressing on the turn being rebuffed in upper stretch staying after it late in the six path. LA NEGRITA was a step slow
early racing evenly in the three path down the lane posing no menace. MELODRAMATIC struggled well back.

FLOWZANO stalked the pace rallying to lead nearing the quarter pole drawing off down the stretch to win as much the best. LOOPY away alertly led early
then was hooked on the turn ceding to rival being dispatched in upper stretch holding as a clear second best. WEST COAST TEMPLE far back early saved
ground to upper stretch improving modestly there. SHIPMANS MAGIC hopped slightly at the break playing no factor. LADY JORDAN gave way on the turn.
