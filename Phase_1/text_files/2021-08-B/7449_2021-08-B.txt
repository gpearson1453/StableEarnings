Footnotes
DANCIN WITH ANGELS moved up inside to duel before a quarter, alternated for the advantage through the turn while continuing along the rail, shook clear
when straightened for home, held the runner up comfortably at bay the final furlong under steady handling. CARIBE NIGHTS away in good order, raced
closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, came three wide when set down for the drive, could do little with the winner from midstretch in, clearly second
best. REAL CITY SPEED broke sharp, set the early pace, was joined by the winner before a quarter, dueled with that one into and through the turn in the
two path, could not keep up in the drive nor contain the runner up, finished up best of the rest. COUNTRY CUT in a bit tight at the start, raced back off the
pace, continued in even fashion through the lane. THE BIG SHOW raced back off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a significant response in the
drive. BLAZE OF GRAY in mid pack while racing inside, had little left for the drive. C C'S COWGIRL fell back to trail after the start and showed little.

Footnotes
WAYPOINT moved up to duel in the three path into the first turn, pressed the other speed from the outside in the run up the backstretch, took over into the
far turn, well clear into the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. AND YET ANOTHER last to leave, lacked speed in
trailing for a half, advanced on the outside into contention second turn, floated out four wide by a rank TIN DELAY turning for home, proved no match for the
winner through the stretch, edged clear for the second spot. TIN DELAY back off the early pace, moved closer after a half, pressed late in the final turn
when bumping with RARE STRAIN, rank, got out soon after to float the runner up out, recovered and went evenly through the stretch. DAVES FRIEND
DEWEY in the second flight early, fell back to lose position in the run up the backstretch, went one paced in the drive to also finish up in even fashion.
RARE STRAIN within striking distance inside, continued to save ground far turn, bumped, took up along the rail turning for home, lost all chance. D W
STRONG dueled early closest to, but not on the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way into the far turn, continued to back up through the
stretch to finish well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF RARE STRAIN AGAINST TIN DELAY FOR
INTERFERENCE EXITING THE FINAL TURN, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
KEHRON'S CREED dueled early closest to the inside, edged off to a slightly larger advantage into the turn while setting a soft pace, hooked up again in the
run to the wire late in the bend, heated stretch battle, stubborn to the end. SWORN SILENCE broke alertly, dueled out of the chute, fell back off the other
winner into the turn in the two path, regained that one from the outside late in the bend, spirited stretch duel, fully extended late to gain a part of the win.
COSTA SUGAR in the second flight while in the two path, proved no match for the winners in the run through the stretch, edged clear of the rest. LUCKY
LINZ also chased the dueling leaders closest to the inside, came up empty for the drive to finish up evenly. SWANEE BEACH broke back, moved closer in
the turn while four wide, flattened out in the drive. PRINCESS ARWEN last away, trailed early, five wide into lane, failed to menace. MADISON'S WILD ONE
was finished early, far back.

FIRSTSLATE broke on top, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way turn when edging clear, drew out through the lane while being kept to
task. SISTER CHLOE last to leave and slow to settle, trailed for three furlongs, swung out give wide turning for home, rallied for the place in belated fashion,
too late for the winner. BOURBON BLUES forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner into the stretch, had nothing for that one, proved no match for
the runner up as well. AUDACIOUS GIRL lacked speed, in some traffic along the inside turning for home, lacked a closing kick when clear for the drive.
MENZEL well back off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a closing response. MA CHER AMIO back off the pace and the inside, came four wide into
the stretch, lacked a closing rally. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL chased the winner early, began a steady retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
GABY'S PROMISE dueled early while closest to the inside, began to edge away late in the turn, clear when straightened for home, extended that advantage
past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up while under stiff handling. MAVE RUNNER forwardly place while well out in the strip, three
wide through the turn, four wide turning for home, set down for the drive, finished well to be getting to the winner late, ran out of race track in the final strides
for that one, well clear of the others. CRIDER CHASE in the main body while racing outside in the run up the backstretch, moved a bit closer while four wide
exiting the turn, continued modest late interest to be best of the others. OKALANI back off the pace and the inside, raced between rivals through the turn,
also displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position slightly. MY LITTLE FIRE dueled early outside the winner, pressed that one out of the turn,
fell back in the run to the wire. SEVEN COME ELEVEN lacked early speed and made little impact. MIDNIGHT TRIP in mid pack for four furlongs along the
inside, faded in the stretch run. EMERY'S DREAM broke alertly, just as quickly fell back, trailed throughout in showing little.

KICK N KISS settled off the early pace toward the inside, began to creep forward in the second turn, tipped out three wide into the stretch, set down,
finished with good resolve to kick down the leader. MISS DAWN dueled early off the inside, clear before a half through some soft fractions, remained well
clear until late, caught final strides. GILDED APPLE broke out, within striking distance off the inside, tucked in a bit to save some ground first turn, stalked in
hand the middle half, three wide into the lane, remained in striking position past the furlong marker, lacked the needed late punch. COLD HEARTED
WENCH bothered slightly start, void of speed four five furlongs, steadily improved position through some traffic while not a serious threat for the win.
RUNNING ROSADO back off the pace through the first turn outside, was never dangerous in lacking a closing response. ENVOY'S GUILT broke on top,
dueled inside the runner up through the first turn, began a steady retreat after a half. SISTEROFTHEMOON remained always back in failing to threaten. MY
REBEL GIRL in mid pack early, backed up. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

HEZA WAY MAKER broke sharp to be forward early, fell back to lose some position in the turn, saved ground into the lane, shifted out when taking aim on
the leader nearing the furlong grounds, closed with good determination to be up in time while between horses at the wire. GOLD PUNCH cleared early,
extended that advantage a bit while along the inside turn, continued to hold daylight left, weakened to be caught in the waning strides, narrowly saved the
place while closest to the inside of the first flight. HE'S A BOMB hopped at the start, raced back off the pace, three wide into the lane, closed well while too
late outside the top two. BODE'S LIGHT last to leave, trailed well back for a half, floated out six wide into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late
interest down the middle of the strip. STARZIP back off the pace, came five wide out of the turn, picked off a single tiring rival to improve only slightly in the
drive. LUCKY BREAK chased the runner up for three furlongs off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA THUNDER unruly loading, broke well, set the early pace inside, larger lead turn, well clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the
runner up late. YOAKAM in the second flight outside, came four wide into the lane, set down, finished willingly to be steadily getting to the winner, ran out of
room. LUCKY BIG DADDY void of speed, came three wide into the lane, angled to the inside to improve position and be clear of the rest at the end. SPRY
CHARLIE back off the early pace outside, very wide into the lane, mild late gain. LOOKIN FOR LARRY in the second flight toward the inside, lugged out
nearing midstretch, lacked the needed closing kick in the drive. RENE'S PRINCE last away, moved up to race in mid pack for three furlongs, made little
impact in the drive. HOLDEN PASS pressed the winner early, chased that same rival through the turn, was tiring in upper stretch when bothered nearing the
furlong marker, continued to weaken. ARGYBARGY BUCK in mid pack when in tight, checked up with just over a half mile remaining and did not recover.
UNBRIDLED BABY lacked speed, was in tight and was shuffled back early in the turn, trailed home.
