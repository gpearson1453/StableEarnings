SHARP JUSTICE set a pressured pace while racing off the rail, then drew clear leaving the turn and was kept to pressure to prove best. SENORITA EMMA
stalked the pace four wide and came five wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be gamely for the place. JUSTA DOLL was bumped hard at the start,
chased the pace two wide, eased out on the turn and came into the stretch six wide while making a bid, then was outfinished for the place award. SHES MY
TREASURE pressed the early pace three to four wide and weakened. LILMISS SASSYPANTS was fractious in the gate, pressed the early pace in between
horses and then came up empty. THE STONE EVENT was settled back early, then raced erratic through the stretch and lacked a rally. SHE'S NO TOY
broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then showed good early speed between rivals but stopped abruptly. SUMMER PICNIC was off slowly, then
hustled on the inside and stopped.

GET N TIPSY led inside, taking the field through slow fractions, was clear in the stretch, was challenged outside and surged late. JUST HUMMING was
blocked inside most of the way, angled five wide at the three-eighths for running room, responded and rallied strongly, drew even with the winner but
couldn't match that one late. SWIFT TEMPLE raced in the two path and bid late to nab the show spot. PEEKACHICA pressed the pace three wide, then
gave way in the stretch. TOUCH OF BLESSING attended the pace outside of the winner, then gave way in the stretch. SAVEDBESTFORLAST stalked the
pace inside, then faded in the stretch. CANDY EMPIRE failed to menace.

Footnotes
TO FAT TO FISH was allowed to settle early, made a decisive four wide move on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn and was kept to left handed pressure
to prove best. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY pressed the early pace and made a two to three wide bid on the turn but could not go with the winner while second
best. SUNDAY DRIVE set a slow pace from the inside, then weakened while saving the show award. LONGLIVEJUSTICE hopped at the start, then was
rated along the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and had no punch. COMES N THREES chased the pace three wide and weakened. CORBIN had
no response.
