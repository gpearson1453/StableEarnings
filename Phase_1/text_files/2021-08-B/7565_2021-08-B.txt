latter stages. MI CASIMIRA dropped back to back of the pack early on, raced four wide down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths
pole but was no match for the winner. MISSPOKEN stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and had no
final winning bid. KARMA IS GOLDEN was forwardly placed to stalk the top pair early, dropped back a bit around the far turn, raced three to four wide
through the drive and had not enough. RUBY DOOBY DOO raced up close early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT PHOEBE was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up towards the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid through the stretch
and just prevailed under strong encouragement. ESTILO ELEGANTE raced five wide near the seven eighths pole, was rated down the backstretch, fanned
six deep into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. SWEET TINA raced four wide around the first turn, pressed the early leader early on and
weakened in the drive while racing between rivals. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL showed good early speed, raced well off the inside into the upper lane and
weakened in the latter stages. HOME BY SEVEN was slow early, raced four deep near the quarter pole and had no late response. HOT NAIL dropped back
early on, raced three to four wide and never was a factor. LA SMARTY raced up close early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and failed to sustain a
bid. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

CONFESSOR showed good early speed, was rated down the backstretch to set his own uncontested pace and raced well clear around the far turn through
the stretch run under steady handling. HIBACHI bobbled at the break, tracked Confessor down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the three
sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL was unhurried in the early stages to drop back to the back of the pack, made a
inside bid near the quarter pole but had not enough in the drive. THE RIGHT PATH stalked the early pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and had no late response. EL SAMURO stalked the top pair from the inside and retreated the final quarter of a mile. Video time might not actually
match the one mile fractional time.

PLAMEN tracked One Slick Start down the backstretch, challenged the leader around the far turn turn and built a long lead through the lane under steady
handling. POLTERER was rated down the backstretch, moved up four wide through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. ONE SLICK START
showed good early speed to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA was coaxed along early to stalk the top trio
and failed to have a response.
