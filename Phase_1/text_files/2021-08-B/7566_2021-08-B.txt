Footnotes
COMMON LAW CAT off a step slow to trail early, raced back up the backstretch, began to move closer midway on the turn, tipped out three wide turning for
home, put a head in front nearing the furlong grounds and drew clear under steady handling. COMBAT COMMAND with the early pace off the inside,
allowed a rival the rail late backstretch, dueled through the turn outside that rival, vied between foes and inside the winner past midstretch then could not
keep up, edged clear for the place. FLASH ME BACK moved up inside to contest the pace late backstretch, dueled through the turn along the inside,
gradually weakened through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. MY LITTLE FLACO broke on top, briefly flashed some speed outside the runner up, fell
back before a quarter, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. MY GUITAR pressured the issue early from the outside, began a steady
retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
FAST VERDICT steadied at the start in breaking a bit awkwardly while rank, tracked the leaders toward the inside while remaining a bit slow to settle
through the first turn, moved out to be three wide turning for home, up in time late in edging away. ANTIETAM ROAD broke on top, dueled up front in the
two path through some soft fractions, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, comfortably clear for the
place. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI dueled up front inside the runner up through those pedestrian fractions, weakened the final furlong to finish clear of the rest.
TAKEN BACK void of speed, improved a bit into the lane then proceeded evenly to the finish in lacking a closing response. WITCH DOCTOR prompted the
dueling leaders in the three path for five furlongs and began to weaken. ICE CRUSH last away, trailed most of the way while four wide out of the final turn.
OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
VELVET ISLE broke back, moved up into a forward position before leaving the chute, took over into the turn, shook clear entering the stretch, extended that
advantage through upper stretch, drifted out a bit under a left handed crop nearing the furlong grounds, appeared to sulk while lugging in under right handed
pressure, continued to draw out in the run to the wire. BEE HOUSE lacked early foot, came five wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, finished well to
be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. AMOREENA STAR within striking distance early, crept a bit closer three wide late in the turn then flattened
out in the drive. TEN TAP DANCES void of speed in trailing for a half, improved position by passing tiring rivals. MISS INVADER settled in mid pack while
racing toward the inside, saved ground to no avail in coming up empty for the drive. TYPHOON ZING set or forced the pace four just under five furlongs,
faltered in the drive. EXOTIC TOWN forwardly placed briefly in the early going, began a steady fade before a half.

HARLONS COMMISION in the second flight for three furlongs off the inside, emerged from between foes into contention exiting the turn, drifted in a bit
when moving to challenge past the furlong marker, drew clear under a brisk hand ride. MONEY INTHE STARRS broke alertly, fell back to race in the
second group outside the winner, four wide turning into the lane, finished willingly to be slowly closing the gap on the winner late. GRILLIN last away, trailed
for three furlongs, improved position to be up for the show late with some mild interest, not a serious threat to the top two. NEW ORLEANS SPICE with the
pace while between horses for three furlongs, held a narrow advantage into the lane, dueled with the winner past the furlong marker then faltered when
headed by that rival to lose a couple of positions. SHACKLELACKALACKA set or forced the pace four three furlongs while in the three path, gave way in the
drive. GOLDEN BET also with the pace for three furlongs, faltered as well along the inside when the real running commenced at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
I'LL RAISE YOU with the pace from the start along the inside, shook off the other speed entering the stretch, drew out under steady handling. SONOMA
CRUSH broke alertly, contested the pace outside and three wide, dueled with the winner late in the turn, proved no match through the lane, clear of the
others. VALYRIAN lacked early foot, saved some ground out of the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to finish up best of the rest. STORMATION
flashed some early foot while between foes for three furlongs and began to fade. MEDAL OF COURAGE off the pace while racing outside, made a mild
advance four wide to be closest to the top two with a furlong remaining, flattened out in the late going. TEN SILVER PINS remained always back.
WHATAKISS fell back quickly after the start, continued to race sluggishly into the turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
CLUB SODA cleared from the outside after breaking in good order, set a glib set of early fractions, remained clear into the lane, enough left to hold the
runner up safe in the waning strides. C'MON VE chased the winner up the backstretch while in the two path, closed the gap on that one a bit late in the turn,
saw that progress stall in upper stretch, coming again late. FIRE BLASTER settled off the pace, even effort to finish up best of the rest. WARRIORS GEM in
the main group while inside, continued to save ground through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run to be outkicked for the show spot. WHY JOEY
WHY broke back, lacked speed and was never dangerous. LADDIE BOY last away, raced back and off the inside, four wide into the stretch, lacked a
closing kick. SET HUT chased the top two for three furlongs then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
EMERALD FOREST broke sharp, helped set a quick set of early fractions off the inside, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, drew out steadily
through the lane under an intermittent left handed crop. DREWCITABLE raced in mid pack off the inside, in the two path through the turn, improved position
a bit into the lane, closest to the winner with less than a furlong remaining, no match for that one, lasted for the place. TURN ON THE MAGIC void of early
foot, came three to four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the runner up late. MAGEEZ last away, raced well back for a half,
began to pick it up out of the turn, improved position through some traffic. LEMNISCATE quick duel inside, continued on equal terms with the winner into the
turn, gave way late in the bend and continued to weaken through the lane. GALAXY BUILDER void of speed, five wide into the lane, made little impact
through the lane. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL chased the dueling leaders for a half and began to give way. PAPA BRO settled in mid pack for a half, had
nothing left for the drive. MCFEELY underwent a shoe repair in the paddock and was finished early.

Footnotes
PERFECT PEACH broke on top, narrowly set the pace while in the two path, inched away when straightened for home, held the stubborn runner up safe in
the late going. DOBBY SUE also away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. LAST GHOST void
of speed, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA broke out and was last away, raced back early and outside, four
wide through the turn, improved to race closest to the top two with a furlong remaining, flattened out in the late going to be caught for the show.
TAKENFORGRANTED forwardly placed early outside the top two, faded in the drive. SPECTACULAR IZZY in mid pack early off the inside, steadily faded
after a quarter.
