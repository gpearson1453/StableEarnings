Footnotes
CHRISTINE'S JACK was away in good order to duel for the lead with BENNY THE JET while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-eighths marker and drew off as the easiest of winners. BENNY THE JET broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with the winner from the inside,
was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. BRAHMS FOREST settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked
the needed closing response. ONE TUFF MINISTER lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. ON THE WINGS OF was
void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

BRILLIANT BIRD dueled for the lead with BLOWING BAYOU while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and was
ridden out to the wire. ABRAA JABRAA was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. BLOWING BAYOU bobbled at the start, disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way to that rival after
going a half. A FILLY CAN DREAM showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. SUDDENLY AWESOME lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EL MAESTRO broke sharply to press the pace of OVERLY FAST while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and held sway to the wire. TIGER MOUNTAIN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with
good energy. OVERLY FAST was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied and gave way through the final furlong. DANNY ZUKO was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing
response. PRAYFORTATERS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. STONUS MAXIMUS was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. AWEZEE settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. RIVER KAT was off a step slow
and lagged throughout.

A VIEW FROM ABOVE broke in stride to open a clear margin at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by COBRA JET in
mid-stretch, vied with that rival and edged clear through the closing yards. COBRA JET was bumped at the break, chased the winner while racing four-wide,
moved up to engage with a furlong to run, vied but could not match strides with that foe in the drive. SARGENT KLINE was bumped at the start, lagged
early, raced from off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. CHECK THE GEAR was forwardly placed from
the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. FIRING PIN settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to rally.
DECIMATE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THUNDER MUSIC was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
KORON was away in good order to duel for the lead from between foes, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out through the lane to
be kept to task. GOLD N GLITTER was away alertly to duel for the lead with the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished
well to be clearly second best. WEGOTTODRINKING was off slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished
with a belated bid. PONTIFFANY pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. SMILING SALSA was off a step slow, raced off the
pacesetters early, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. CADILLAC MARGARITA was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and
failed to rally. HELLS CROSSING showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
IKNOWYOURFACE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated into the lane and drew off. CLOSE THE SHOW LO was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position in mid-stretch but could not gain on the winner late.
LOOKOUT TAYLOR was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. CLASSIC LEAH broke sharply to chase the
leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. CHOTEAU was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. IF YOU WANT IT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace.
