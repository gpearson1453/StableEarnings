inside the winner early, was taken up early on the turn, ran out entering the stretch then weakened to be second best. CATTY'S UNCLE lagged along the
rail for over a half then passed tired ones. BOURBON MUSIC had early position outside, raced three wide between horses around the turn and weakened.
FAIRY DREAMS wasn't far back two wide between horses to the stretch then weakened. GIMME A JAMESON settled early, made a four wide run around
the turn then flattened out.

VENOMOUS STATE settled, raced two wide around the turn, split horses leaving the furlong grounds then drove clear through the final sixteenth. HIS
NAME IS SUE drew clear from between horses midway on the turn, but was little match in the drive. EARNER raced three wide with the pace into the turn,
remained close into the final furlong then weakened. MOTATAABEQ lagged then outfinished tired ones while no factor. W W SPRINGTIME was prominent
early between horses, angled to the rail on the turn then tired in the lane. OFF DUTY was hustled from the gate, dueled into the turn, stopped and was
eased up through the lane.

then flattened out. WELL BORN made the early pace inside and was finished after a half. ENKIDU stopped.
