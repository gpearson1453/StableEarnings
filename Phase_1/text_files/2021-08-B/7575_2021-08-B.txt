UNCLE TAP sprinted to the lead and drew off under steady urging. BULLAWAY hopped at the start then rushed to contention but was no match for the
winner. PERVASIVE pressed the pace from the two path early then faded in the turn and held the show. MACHO SANCHO had an awkward start but was
close early then was never a factor. OTHER THAN THAT stumbled badly at the start and was never a factor.

MOONFIELD was off a step slow then steadily advanced from the three path and inched clear in the stretch drive but just lasted. DIVA'S DIVA was allowed
to settle from the two path angled out at the eighth pole and closed willingly to just miss. MADISON'S QUARTERS vied for the lead from the inside to fight
gamely in the drive and held well for the show. GIVE EM FITZ was unhurried early from three wide and improved position late in the drive. TAYLOR'S
BEAUTY broke alertly to set the pace for a half from the two path and gave way in the stretch. T. P. RIGHT LANE bobbled at the start then was forwardly
placed in the two path then angled out for the drive but was empty.

mild bid. PREACHER rushed to the lead to set the pace from the inside and weakened late. DOBY trailed the field but was able to gain ground late.
