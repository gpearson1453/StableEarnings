bobbled at the start, recovered quickly and dueled for the lead, edged clear after five eighths but could not stall the winner in the drive while easily besting
the other two. PAMPERS N' BOOTS had no speed, settled for a half mile, was two wide but lacked a closing response. LATITUDEFORTYTWO dueled the
runnerup for a half mile then stopped, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
RUNNIN DIVA bobbled slightly to begin, stalked RED DAHLIA for a half mile, bid outside that one five eighths out, rallied to the front and held driving.
CONVINCE chased the leaders for a half mile, bid two wide to the stretch and could not catch the winner. RED DAHLIA had the best speed, set the pace
from the rail, took up inside the winner into the far turn then finished evenly. NAMORITA was allowed to settle, saved ground then swung out three wide on
the far turn but lacked a closing response. DUTCH MAMA had no speed and was never a threat. VISION OF THE KAT also had no speed and was outrun.
WHERE'S FRANKIE chased the pace from the rail but gave way after five furlongs. The jockey on RED DAHLIA lodged an objection against the rider on
RUNNIN DIVA for alleged interference into the far turn but in a unanimous decision, the stewards made no change.

Footnotes
HE BE DANGEROUS was well placed for a half mile, raced two wide then was outkicked to mid stretch but gamely dug in and prevailed. FINE RED
RESERVE was unhurried for a half, advanced two wide, edged away to mid stretch but could not stall the winner. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT had no speed, was
making a rail run on the far turn but was stuck behind JHAWK FLYER when that one had troubles, had to steady hard then recovered and finished willingly
in a very good effort. EQUIVOCATOR had no speed, settled to the far turn, bid three wide to the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly. BLUE SUNSET
chased the pace for a half mile, was fanned to the four path on the far turn but weakened in the drive. JHAWK FLYER set all the pace, was inside and
stumbled on the far turn, had the rider lose his right iron and gave way. GRAYSLAND GIRL was rank early, settled but stopped suddenly after a half mile,
was eased and walked off.

SHENANDOAH STAR had good speed, dueled three wide to the backstretch, edged away to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. COASTAL
STARLITE took up at the start, trailed to the second turn, checked inside into the stretch then closed willingly to get the place. TRUE FRIEND got
outsprinted then circled four wide to the stretch and closed steadily. BARBELLO (NZ) had no speed, was three wide to the stretch and finished well.
WINNING SOUND attended the pace then pressed the winner down the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch then was outfinished. SWISS SCRIPT
also was a pace factor to the backstretch, got outkicked to the second turn and weakened in the drive.
