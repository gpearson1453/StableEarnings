Footnotes
CLUB CHAMP tracked the leader from the inside then took command at the eighth pole and drew off. BIG TONY sprinted to the lead to set the pace for a
half and was caught at the eighth pole to be second best. LET IT RIP trailed the field early then made a late rally to be up for the show. SOONER THAN
SOONER was unhurried early and steadily advanced to improve position late. FERRIC was close up early made a three wide bid on the turn but failed to
menace. ORPHAN ANGIE chased the leaders from the three path and weakened. IF THE BOOT FITS raced in the middle of the pack but was not a factor.

Footnotes
TOMBI sprinted to the lead to set early pressured pace from the inside then drew clear under light urging. OUR HALF FIRST was allowed to settle near the
back early from the two path then advanced between horses in the stretch to be up for the place. NOT NECESSARILY tracked the leaders from the three
path then made a late rally to be up for show. CRUZ'N OLLIE pressed the pace from the two path for a quarter then stayed within striking distance until mid
stretch and weakened. I'M A STAR broke sharply and lead briefly then raced close up from the four path made a mild bid going into the stretch but was
empty. PERVASIVE raced in the second flight from the four or five wide but failed to menace. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA vied for the lead from the three
path then settled off the leaders and gave way late in the stretch. BOLD IMPACT was close up for the first eighth while racing three wide then dropped back
and was not a factor.
