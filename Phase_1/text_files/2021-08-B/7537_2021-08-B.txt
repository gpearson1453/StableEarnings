HOLDTHATLOVE seized command at the outset, edged clear leaving the far turn and held sway in the stretch. DARK SILENCE saved ground, advanced
on the far turn, was swung four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. SPARKLE O MINE chased while three wide, continued three wide into the stretch
and stayed on. RAISIN RAISIN leaned out at the start, chased the pacesetter and weakened. SHIMMERING DREAM was always outrun. MISS LEIN was
void of speed and never reached contention.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CIRCLE raced forwardly while three wide, responded on the far turn, edged clear and was all out to fend off AMBITIOUSLY PLACED. The hopped
at the start spotting the field a few lengths, was reserved, commenced a bid on the far turn, managed a belated bid and was gaining. STONECOLD
STUNNER outpaced early, moved closer on the far turn and stayed on in the stretch. MISCHIEF MAMA saved ground and lacked a rally. MATT'S HONEY
was always outrun. CYCLONE SORORITY led early, was headed on the far turn and yielded. FLYTA stalked, the early pace and faltered.
