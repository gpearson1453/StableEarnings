the rest. V. E. TIA tracked the early pace setters four wide, made a five wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. GIDDY GOOTZ was allowed to

Footnotes
WEST COAST JUSTICE was rated along three to four wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and gained a short lead by the
furlong marker, then prevailed late after a long drive. RHAPSODY IN GREY pressed the pace and made a four wide bid to draw clear on the turn, then was
headed nearing the furlong marker, then kept on to the wire but could not get to the winner. QUEEN CHARMAINE was well placed throughout three to four
wide and was in contention nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive, held show award. NOT A ROLE MODEL chased the early pace four
wide, then was three wide by the quarter pole and finished evenly to best the rest. IMA N H LADY CAT passed the tiring rivals. AMA LUCY lacked a rally.
QUITE WHIMSICAL was reserved early while five wide, made a six wide middle move and then tired while wide. RODSSILVEROAK was not a factor.
SEQUEEKER set a pressured pace on the rail and then was through after a half mile, stopped.
