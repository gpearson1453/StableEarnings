urging. AMERICAN CHAOS stalked the winner early and made a three wide bid on the turn but could not go with that rival in the stretch while clearly second
best. OMAHA RED chased the early pace two wide, angled out in the drive but came up empty, held show award. WINTER'S GHOST was reserved early,
then had a belated rally on the inside to just miss the show award. DARE GOES DA DEVIL was allowed to settle and was four wide by the quarter pole,
then offered no rally while wide. DREAM ISLAND was off a step slow then was not a threat. STAR ON THE MAP tracked the early pace on the inside and

NAVY PIER pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under a couple of right
handed pops with the riding crop. KINGSBURRY ATTACK was allowed to settle and moved to the inside on the turn, angled out in late stretch to rally well
for the place award. INSIDE THE CIRCLE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the final furlong, lost the place spot late. COLD BIRDIE
broke in bumping ARTYIE AND JESSIE then raced near the back, was bumped by the three eighths while three to four wide, then advanced on the turn
three wide but offered no late rally. ARTIE AND JESSIE was bumped at the start, then steadied in tight entering the far turn, then was no threat. LITTLE
TOOT was reserved early while in between horses, then checked and bumped with a rival by the three eighths pole and had no rally.

Footnotes
BLUES MARY tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid to prompt the pace three wide on the turn, continued that bid when straightened, edged
clear in deep stretch then held off MIDNIGHT FROST to prove best in a gutsy effort. MIDNIGHT FROST was rated along the inside to nearing the quarter
pole, then eased out and swung out five wide for the drive, closed well on the outside but too late. ESTARDO set the early pace two wide, then moved over
to the inside on the turn, shook clear again by the furlong marker but was caught late and lost the place award at the wire. ME TOO MO was reluctant to
load, then was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the stretch and rallied well on the far outside. TIZ SUSAN ANN was well placed early on the inside,
then steadied slightly on the turn, tipped out two wide for the drive to be between rivals but had no punch. HEY HEY was reserved early and came into the
drive on the inside, angled out in the stretch but lacked the needed kick. IRISH HALO was bumped at the start, then failed to menace.

Footnotes
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS raced between horses on the first turn, then was rated two wide down the backstretch, moved to the inside on the turn, made a
decisive inside move leaving the quarter pole to slip through on the inside of the pace setter, then moved off the inside when straightened and quickly shook
clear, then was given a few reminders around the sixteenth pole to remain clear to the wire. SON OF GRACE set the early pace while racing towards the
inside, came off the rail slightly around the quarter pole and was bumped slightly by the winner when that rival passed on the inside, then kept on willingly to
the wire to be clearly second best. KIT KOWALESKI raced on the inside on the first turn, then was three wide down the backstretch, came four wide into the
drive and was along for the show spot. OFF TO THE BEACH was reserved early, then raced four wide down the backstretch, swung out six wide for the
drive and had no rally. IRISH TUFF was three wide into the first turn, then pulled three wide and was hard to handle on the backstretch, made a three wide
bid on the turn but weakened. FIFTY ONE NINETY was three wide into the first turn, then made a four wide middle move to press the pace by the eleven
sixteenths pole then tired.

Footnotes
KATIE M'LADY was away alertly and set the pace on the inside, was well handled throughout, was sent down leaving the turn and drew clear by the furlong
marker, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. SERENE was reserved early and raced three to two wide on the backstretch, moved out on the turn
and was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed well late drifting in late. DREAMFUL was rated along the inside, then tipped out two to
three wide leaving the turn, was gaining in the stretch but hung late. OLLIE'S GOLD stumbled at the start, then was four wide into the first turn and a bit
rank, then was given her head to go on and prompt the pace and move in to be two to three wide, then was willingly through the lane and was bumped twice
near the sixteenths pole and faded late. GASTOWN was off slowly, then was settled back early, made a five wide run on the turn but then came up empty.
SHE'S WANDAFUL stalked the pace three wide early then stopped.

DIVE DEEP was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace on the inside, then drew off in the stretch to prove best under left handed crop urging. JETTIN
OUT stalked the winner and made a three wide bid on the turn but could not sustain that bid while being clearly second best. SPLASH FOR GOLD was
allowed to settle early and was three wide by the quarter pole, offered a mild late rally to gain the show spot. SHANGHAI POINT was bumped at the start,
chased the early pace on the inside, angled out by the three sixteenths and was empty. TRE LEE DIVINE broke outwardly bumping SHANGHAI POINT,
then settled in on the inside and had no rally. TALE OF THE NILE was allowed to settle while four wide, then came five wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. MIAS MOONBEAM raced three wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STORMIN EL PRADO dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid to draw clear leaving the turn, then held sway late to prove best under a drive.
MISTER KELLY was bumped at the start, then chased the pace and was between horses leaving the turn, closed well in the stretch but could not get by the
winner, second best. YALIKEANYTHING was reluctant to load, then settled early and advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out by the furlong marker
and rallied well late gaining the show award late. DESOTO'S WAR was shuffled early on the inside, then chased the pace on the turn from the inside,
angled out by the three sixteenths pole, but had no punch. MOON FLASH dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the stretch. LAST SPRING was
reserved early while three wide by the three eighths pole, then was four to five wide by the quarter, then had a belated rally six wide. ON THE MUSCLE was
settled back early, then found best stride late on the inside. CLEAR TO CLOSE failed to menace. MACHO CLASSIC was settled four wide early and
weakened. SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased the early pace four wide, then got out leaving the turn and stopped.
