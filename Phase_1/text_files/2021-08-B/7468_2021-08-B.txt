Footnotes
BLUE EYE KITTEN saved ground in striking range early, was guided out three wide with aim at the leaders leaving the far turn, overpowered OUR TEN
ANGELS from outside entering the final furlong and drove clear. OUR TEN ANGELS prompted the pace outside STREAKING GREY, challenged for
command on the far turn, wrested the lead in upper stretch, then could not deny the winner through the late stages. EARNESTINE N HAZEL (IRE)
alternated between the rail and two-path in the second flight for six furlongs, and finished willingly to get up for the show. EXAGGERATED MOMENT raced
two to three wide on the turns within range, and could not menace with an even finish. STREAKING GREY established a moderate pace inside for six
furlongs, could not withstand OUR TEN ANGELS turning for home and gave way. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL raced in the second flight and never factored.
TONALA posed no threat two wide. PRINCESS KYLISE lagged well back for six furlongs, angled to the far outside at the top of the lane and made no
headway. BLAZINONBAYOU hopped at the start and was off slowest, recovered to a forward early position three to four wide, and tired before reaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
DAVID'S ROSE was bumped at the start, sped off to a clear lead soon after, drew off around the turn and held clear while ridden out. DEL REY DOLLY
broke sharply, dropped back under urging while appearing green down the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn while still urged along off the pace
then ran on well through the lane to be a clear second. MORE MUCHO broke a step slowly, raced well back four wide and was along for the show. CAGUA
failed to menace while racing three wide. LADY YOUNES broke inwardly and bumped the winner at the start, chased that foe two wide and tired in the lane.
OODLES ON FIRE was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact. MONETARY SURPRISE steadily faded inside. BALLYMENA chased the
pace three wide and retreated through the lane. NOBLE PRESENT was outrun inside. HOPS PETUNIA played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
RUN LEA RUN saved ground forwardly placed to the stretch, came off the rail leaving the furlong grounds, responded well and caught
WHISKEYONHISLIPS from outside late. WHISKEYONHISLIPS dashed clear with an alert break, showed the way inside, repelled a bid from NEOPHYTE
past the quarter-pole, remained well in command to deep stretch, then yielded in the final 50 yards. NEOPHYTE got forced in by MUNDIAL at the start, put
in a sustained run three wide leaving the backstretch, loomed a threat outside the pacesetter turning for home, but flattened out. TAKEMYSHOT raced two
wide around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch inside. FURCIFEROUS chased outside for three furlongs, and tired. PO BOY never reached
contention toward the inside. SUPER NECESSARY was always outrun. HEAVY WEIGHT spotted the field two to three lengths at the start, and remained
outrun. CHIQUITO BABY was far back throughout. MUNDIAL broke in bothering NEOPHYTE, and was never in the hunt. INDEED INDEED banged the
right side of the gate coming out, and raced far back.

NACHO PAPA tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, reached near even terms in upper stretch, vied outside of THE RED MAN
to the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. THE RED MAN disputed the pace two wide, led between foes around much of the far turn, battled on inside of the
winner to the sixteenth pole and yielded. DARK AGES saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes for the show.
CREATIVE CLOUD chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. CONVERTER vied inside and tired in the lane. UNO TIGER stalked
the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the lane.

TRINNI SUMMER broke slowest, advanced three then four wide approaching the stretch, caught SMOOTH MUSIC from outside leaving the furlong grounds
and edged away. SMOOTH MUSIC pressed the early pace, challenged CHEVAL DORE from outside at the top of the stretch, reached the front coming to
the eighth-pole but was outkicked to the wire. KHOCU stayed in range around the turn near the four-path, had aim through the lane and needed more.
CAN'T BE BROKEN saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid closing bid. CHEVAL DORE vied outside BOTTOM DECK to the turn, could not match
strides with SMOOTH MUSIC through midstretch, and faded. NANTAN LUPAN failed to menace two to three wide. GIVE ME TWO STEPS was outrun
throughout. DOO WOP DON was never in contention. BOTTOM DECK vied early inside CHEVAL DORE, got out badly approaching the quarter-pole
despite the rider pulling with both hands on the left rein, and dropped far back. BULK broke slowly, went wrong in the left hind leg on the turn, pulled up in
distress at the top of the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN set a clear pace just off the rail and widened while drifting out a bit under left-handed urging. TRAPPEZOID was up close inside, angled out
nearing the lane, had aim outside of the winner but could not gain on that foe through the lane. MEADE stalked the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally
and held well enough to preserve the show. CAUSALISTIC saved ground and failed to menace. MR TITO'S played no factor while racing two wide. MALIBU
MAX bobbled at the break, chased the pace three wand four wide and faded through the lane. AYCAPOTE trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
SATURDAY NITE GIRL cleared to the early lead inside, rated along through even fractions for six furlongs, and stayed clear under a drive. CASTLE BORN
saved ground on the turns while in range, shifted off the rail into the final furlong and finished strongly to separate from the rest of the field. KELSEY'S
SHOT prompted SATURDAY NITE GIRL from outside to the stretch, weakened through the late stages and barely saved the show. MAGNOLIA ROAD
bumped with ANGELIC STORM after the start, raced three to four wide on the turns, and finished evenly between horses. KNOW BY HEART (IRE) settled
in the middle of the field two wide on the turns, cut the corner into the lane, bumped solidly with BARBARA past the eighth-pole and was one-paced to the
wire between foes. BARBARA saved ground to midway on the far turn, shifted out three wide to the stretch, bumped hard with KNOW BY HEART past the
furlong marker and could not gain outside rivals. EASY COME EASY GO pursued the leaders three wide to the far turn, and had nothing left in the stretch.
PRESENCIA was four wide on the first turn, and never factored. SUM RETURN bumped with BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA at the start, bobbled midway on the
first turn while moving inside, and never got close. MALIBU SKY bumped with BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA at the start, and was always outrun. ANGELIC
STORM bumped with MAGNOLIA ROAD after the start, and was outrun four then three wide on the turns. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA was bumped from both
sides at the start, and was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
DISCREET TUNE vied early between horses, outdueled LOYAL LOUIE coming off the turn and widened the advantage under a drive. LOYAL LOUIE
pressed the early pace outside, looked DISCREET TUNE in the eye with a quarter-mile remaining, got shaken off by that rival turning for home and ran on
second best. EMICRACK (CHI) raced two wide on the turn, moved inside for the drive and was just up for the show. VENERATE saved ground in midpack
to midway on the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain outside. SMOKE ALARM broke in bumping TRY ME, strode
awkwardly around the turn getting outpaced, and remained outrun. TRY ME got bumped by SMOKE ALARM at the break, gave chase three then four wide
to the top of the stretch, and tired. BACH was a step slower than the rest at the start, and never reached contention. BAHAMIAN BEAT vied early inside

Footnotes
SILVER PACKAGE settled off the pace along the inside, swung four wide in upper stretch, kicked in outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and powered
clear. LEYENDA was devoid of speed while saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch, closed strongly between foes and was up for the place in the final
strides. NENITA vied two wide, drew clear near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth marker and lost second in the final strides. MARICOPA hit the
starting gate, raced well back two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied belatedly. CARISMATICA failed to menace while racing three wide.
AUDREY never threatened while racing four wide. QUEEN ABARRIO chased the pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, remained in
range through the midstretch then tired. VIVA LA REINA dueled inside and retreated through the lane. THE BIGGEST ONE stumbled at the start, was in
range two wide and was through after a half. AUBURN was outrun while racing two wide. MANGROVE MAMMA was fractious behind the starting gate and
never involved while racing four wide. ASTROMELIA had brief speed three wide.
