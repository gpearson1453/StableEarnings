Footnotes
FOLD EM went to the front, drove clear, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the best. PRETTY AUTOMATIC pressed the pace, saved
ground around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. ALL EARS broke a step slow, rushed
up, within contention and proved no match for the top two late. TAPPIN'TIME raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, weakened and was no
threat late. MAGICAL STARDUST pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly. BAD GAL RIRI void of early speed and showed little. RACE WAS

WAR TRIBUTE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear and won under steady urging. LAST TO KNOW unhurried in the beginning,
moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and was gaining on the winner. JR'S SAUVAGE raced within striking
distance, came around the final turn on the outside, lacked a late rally and proved no match for the top two. DOUBLE PRIORITY raced near the back in the
early going and passed tired ones late. PREFERRED PROSPECT dueled on the front end in the early part and faded. POWER SERVE raced within
contention, came around the first turn on the outside, retreated and was no threat late. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
