Footnotes
TRUELY RIGHT was coaxed forward inside heading up the backstretch to duel inside a rival, took a narrow lead at the three-eighths, edged away past the
five-sixteenths, drifted out leaving the turn, stumbled at the furlong marker while clear, continued to drift late and just held. ZENFULLY ZESTY set the early
tempo then was joined by the aforementioned, dueled outside that one, lost ground leaving the turn, kept on to hold the place. CALICHE stalked the early
pace, went four then five wide on the turn, moved in once in the stretch and kept on to narrowly miss. CHIPPSTER stalked from outside, went five to six
wide on the turn, evened out late. QUETZALCOATL chased early, went three then four wide on the turn and weakened. MAJORWAYHOME appeared to be
getting out a bid up the backstretch, bumped a rival lightly near the half-mile marker, shifted in leaving the backstretch to go two wide on the turn and was
not a threat. DYNASTY SMOKE was bumped near the vicinity of the half and in tight having to slightly tap on the brakes, went in the four path on the turn
and came up empty. TS QUEEN OF SASS showed little racing off the inside. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ZENFULLY ZESTY
AGAINST TRUELY RIGHT ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
