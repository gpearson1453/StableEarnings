Footnotes
MALIBU MOIRA was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the turn and eased out two wide to pass a tiring rival, then angled in by the three
sixteenths pole to make inside bid and drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. TRAUMARAMA was well placed early on the inside,
then eased out and made a three wide bid on the turn, finished willingly but could not go with the winner late, second best. AIR TURBULENCE pressed the
early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to take over on the turn but weakened in the drive. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE broke outwardly at the start, then
chased the pace four wide, then came five wide into the stretch and was empty. GRATS ROAD set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
GALILEO'S ROCK was away alertly and soon clear while in hand and crossed over to the inside, dawdled along while clear and being well handled, then
drew off leaving the quarter pole and was ridden out to prove much the best. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was bumped hard at the start, then was reserved early,
eased out on the turn for racing room and swung out four wide for the drive and finished willingly to be game for the place award. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN was
bumped at the start, then was settled back early, swung out six wide for the drive and offered a late rally. MR. SARCASTIC was taken back early, swung out
five wide for the drive to offer a belated rally. IMTHEPRINCE broke outwardly at the start bumping a foe, then was allowed to settle early but lacked a rally.
CHANGING LANES was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four to five wide down the backstretch and weakened. AUTHORITARIAN was
between horses early, then chased the winner two wide on the turn and weakened. SUGAR DOG FOX tracked the pace from the inside and tired.

Footnotes
BIZERK set the pace while crossing over to the rail, was well handled on the front end, then was kept to right handed pressure to prove best. ROCKY RUSH
was allowed to settle early, then made a inside middle move to move into contention, then tipped out three wide for aim on the pace setter, was gaining
slowly but could not get to that rival while second best. BOLD PROPHET was allowed to settle while three wide, then had a mild late rally on the inside.
ARTIE'S LADY tracked the pace three to four wide, then floated wide leaving the turn and had no kick. ZACAPA RUN jumped a shadow and checked into
the first turn, then came three wide into the drive and lacked a serious rally. ALLEN tracked the pace two to three wide and weakened.
