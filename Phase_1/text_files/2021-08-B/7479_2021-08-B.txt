Footnotes
PINO IN A PURSE closed on the backstretch and pressed the pace, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn, rallied gamely, swept by the leader
mid stretch and held under a drive. SOMEONE ELSE forced the pace, dueled two-wide through the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and finished
under a drive to the wire. THE GOOD WITCH stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out.
BONNIE LEE led early and set a pressured pace, dueled through the turn, gained a short lead at the top of the stretch but gave way with a 16th to run.
DISCREET BEAR was taken back early and raced from off the pace, closed three-wide early turn, angled out five-wide at the 1/4 pole, lost ground at the top
of the stretch and chased to no avail. UNCLAIMEDTREASURE was off a step slowly, closed up the rail to stalk the pace, was taken back from tight quarters
at the turn, chased to the stretch but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes

under a hand ride. SALTY CANDY raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. SOUPER SIZE IT showed early speed then
stalked the pace, chased on the turn and finished under a determined drive. CARDIFF HALL raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn
then showed some interest in the stretch. BLACK HILLS BRONCO raced in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but
failed to menace. DANIELLE'S SONG was steadied at the start and again just a few strides later, trailed through the turn but never reached contention.
ONE THOU was also steadied leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. ROYAL FANFARE showed brief
speed, pressed the pace, chased but dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER SOUPER SIZE IT AGAINST
SALTY CANDY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS AFTER REVIEWING THE RUN THROUGH THE
STRETCH.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE trailed around the first turn, advanced three wide on the far turn into a striking position, had only the leader to catch turning for home and drove
by that one in the final seventy yards, inching away late. MATINEE in between rivals for the lead around the first turn, shook off those challengers and
opened up into the far turn, had a clear advantage in the stretch but did not change leads and was caught at the seventy yard marker. DOWNY BOY was
three wide chasing the top trio around the first turn, at the rear into the far turn and rallied two to five wide into the stretch, on the flank of the winner in upper
stretch but could not match that one's energy in the final stages and settled for the show. AM PREPARED sat on the rail inside two rivals behind the leaders
in the first turn, had a perfect striking position late on the second turn but could not take advantage of it and ran evenly down the lane. PICCADILLY BEAU
bumped by a rival at the start, settled between rivals chasing the top trio around the first turn, dropped back to the rear into the far turn and put in a nice run
along the fence into the stretch, squeezed through a small seam in midstretch but ran out of gas in the final stages. FIRST SPRING moved up inside the two
leaders to make it three in a line for the front on the first turn, dropped back mid backstretch to chase the pace survivor into the far turn and retreated down
the stretch. ROBUSTO broke out and bumped a rival at the start, rushed up to contest the pace outside two rivals on the first turn and faded late backstretch
down to the finish.

SENOR JOBIM broke outward, pressed the pace, bid mid turn, dueled, gained a short lead a furlong out, drifted out in the late stages but held under a drive.
IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then launched a determined drive between rivals. FORESTER'S
TURN set a pressured pace, was engaged mid turn, dueled, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out, stayed gamely to deep stretch
and gave way. PIVEN, always in range, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. RECONFIGURE was rated in range on the
backstretch, came two and three-wide through the turn, was blocked briefly at the top of the stretch then posted a late run. DOTTED LINE stalked the pace,
was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly.

but was caught as he approached the wire. SPITE STORE stalked the pace from the rail. came out a bit mid turn, chased two-wide into the stretch the
rallied gamely. SATURDAY GEORGE forced the issue, dueled into the turn and gained a narrow lead, was headed at the top of the stretch, chased, but
evened out late. COMEDY TOWN stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then closed willingly through the stretch. FROSTED ICING
stalked the pace, was steadied in tight mid turn, eased back to the rear then lacked a rally. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY IN REGARDS TO SPITE

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, chased into stretch, was determined, took the lead a furlong out and held
sway under a strong hand ride. BEST AND FINAL, in mid pack early, stalked the pace from the rail on the turn, chased two-wide into the stretch and rallied
gamely. STEEL WOOL was bumped by VERRAZANO leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn and was all out through
the stretch. CHAIRMAN FOX bumped with BUTTERONMYTIE leaving the gate, set a pressured pace, dueled through the turn, was headed a furlong out
and chased gamely to the end. BUTTERONMYTIE bumped CHAIRMAN FOX at the outset, forced the pace, dueled on the turn, was headed a furlong out
and chased to the end. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS pressed the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. ABSTEMIOUS pressed the
pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and although he did not menace in the stretch he showed some interest.
VERRAZANO LEGACY broke inward and bumped STEEL WOOL, was under strong restraint on the backstretch, closed along the rail through the turn but
was blocked through the stretch. WHIZMO stalked the pace, dropped back five then four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally.
