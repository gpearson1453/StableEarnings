ANGEL well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. QUEEN BESS stalked the pace on
the outside, lost some ground through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
NICE ACE well placed and inside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off under mild urging. PURE SPRING
allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. BUMMER well placed and
between, saved ground on the two path, angled out to bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. DIALED IN ON ALICE mid
pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. TOUCH OF LA GREY allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and passed tiring rivals. GILGIMESH well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and had no rally. LET PEACE PREVAIL set the early pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final
furlong. CONTEMPLATING tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and faded the final furlong.
