HAVE A PLAN grabbed the lead, held well into the stretch and was reeled in late. FEARLESS WILL saved ground and stayed on with out posing a threat to
the principles. COOL CATOMINE stalked the pace and weakened in the late going. POST CLOSE was outpaced while four wide and did not factor. EPIC

GONE WITH THE FINN assumed command early, edged further clear into the stretch and held sway thereafter. OSCAR WINNER WALLY chased along
the inside and stayed on well in the stretch. STORMIN' J. J. settled while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed bid.
YEARS FLY BY was void of speed and no factor. NEW GOSPEL stalked the pace and weakened. ONE BAD DUDE showed little.
