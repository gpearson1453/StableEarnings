Footnotes
SATCHEL DE RITCHES stalked the pace along the rail into and around the turn, given his cue with a quarter mile remaining, slipped through along the
inside into the stretch, cleared outside rivals and drew away under urging. DARK HEDGES tracked the pace off the rail, went two wide around the turn,
angled inside at the three-sixteenths and outfinished TAKE ME FOR A SPIN for the place. TAKE ME FOR A SPIN chased under coaxing up the
backstretch, bid three wide at the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and got edged for the place. STAY HAPPY sat off
the pace early, went four wide into the turn, angled to the three path then back out four wide into the lane and finished evenly to round out the superfecta.
REEDLEY sped clear and angled to the two path, led through the turn then got pressured at the quarter pole, was overtaken by the winner at the
three-sixteenths and weakened through the lane. UPPER ROOM traveled off the pace, entered the stretch four to five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
SUKI stalked the top pair from inside then moved off the rail, bid three deep on the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear leaving the turn
and drew away under left-handed encouragement. VIAZAR settled along the inside, moved closer up the backstretch, lacked room through the far turn,
steered out at the top of the lane, showed late effort and bested the rest. UNBREAKABLE dropped back early, went outside rival or three wide on the
backstretch, driven three to four wide into the stretch and faltered in the late stages. LOOKIN SO LUCKY unhurried in the beginning, traveled in the two
path, was coaxed while angling out late the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and never threatened. FRAZZLED set the pace under pressure
from outside early, dueled with CHEERFUL CHARM up the backstretch, vied inside on the turn then could not kick on the winner leaving the bend and
faded out of contention. CHEERFUL CHARM pressed the pace early from outside then went up to duel on even terms, fought into the far turn, chased the
winner into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SAMURAI CHARM sped clear and crossed over to the two path, angled to the rail around the first turn, drew away on the far turn, felt pressure from outside
in the final furlong but held the runner-up at bay while drifting out a bit late. CALIFORNIA KOOK was a bit rank around the first turn, traveled within range off
the rail, took aim three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the winners flank and got floated out a bit late but lacked the needed late punch. FI FI
PHAROAH settled off the pace, advanced outside rivals on the far turn and evened out in the final furlong. COVER VERSION stumbled at the start, raced at
the back of the pack, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. GINJA stalked outside a rival, lost ground on the second bend and weakened.
BYE BYE BERTIE checked off the heels of the leader on the first turn, went up to press briefly early on the backstretch but could not stay alongside the
pacesetter for long, chased along the inside through the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
GOLD RUSH CANDY dueled for the lead outside of MOOSE MITCHELL to the stretch, battled down the lane and won the bob at the wire. MOOSE
MITCHELL dueled on the inside with GOLD RUSH CANDY, battled through the stretch, fought valiantly to the wire and missed. SIPPIN N KISSIN sat off the
pace early, angled to the rail on the turn and bested the rest. EREBUS chased two wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position.
ARTHUR SPOONER well placed early behind the dueling pair, lost ground around the turn and weakened. FORGIVING SPIRIT stalked outside a rival, five
then four wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch, bled and walked off.. BROOKYS TAPIT lacked early speed, raced wide up the backstretch,
entered the turn six wide, angled to the four path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAN ON THE MOON took the lead quickly then controlled the pace through the early stages, given his cue at the quarter pole and inched away in the lane.
FINAL FINAL traveled four wide around the clubhouse turn, bid four deep on the far turn, proved no match for the winner and stayed on to secure the place.
FULL DRAW bobbled the start, lost path briefly soon after, traveled six wide in upper stretch, took a bad step at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out.
RACETRACKERS stalked the pace on the inside, steadied off heels at the three-eighths, remained inside to the lane and improved position. MOUNT
PELLIAR stalked the pace outside a rival then three deep, entered the stretch three to four wide and flattened out. VERY IRISH was closest in pursuit early,
asked with three-eighths remaining and weakened. SALAH raced off the pace, went between rivals on the backstretch, exited the far turn two wide and
never made an impact. SUPER CLASSIC chased from off the pace, three deep at the four furlong mark, was put in tight into the far turn and had little left for
the drive.

Footnotes
POP POP'S DREAM reserved early in the two path, angled out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied four deep then drifted in and bumped
rival inside the furlong grounds and proved best late. QUINEVERE (GER) settled in the two path outside a rival, ranged up three wide into the stretch, bid
three deep in the lane, got bumped by the winner and floated from mid-stretch on and kept on gamely to the wire. BADGER KITTEN settled near the back,
traveled two wide then swung four wide into the stretch, closed well through the final furlong and was gaining to the wire. WITCH MOON unhurried in the
beginning, steered to the inside, angled out for the far turn, swung five wide leaving the second bend, rallied late and filled out the superfecta. MONGOLIAN
MISSION stalked the lead outside a rival, driven two wide into the lane, bid between foes in the stretch and faltered late. WHISTLER'S STYLE sped clear
establishing the front, opened up a comfortable lead, held a diminishing advantage into the stretch, clung to the lead with a furlong remaining and yielded in
the late stages. GLORY OF CHROME settled inside, angled two then three wide on the second bend and could not summon the needed response.
GOLDEN JOURNEY stalked along the fence, tipped two wide leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. PLUMA fractious in the gate, was closest in pursuit
from the two path then moved inside, saved ground into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT DAN set the pace under pressure, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and drew away. GIVE ME THE
LUTE pressed from outside, dueled around the bend, lost contact with a furlong to go and saved the place. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) settled outside a
rival, came four wide into the lane, brushed with rival in upper stretch and put in a mild late bid. KNEEDEEPINSNOW chased along the inside, moved out in
the lane and lacked a late bid. LITTLE JUANITO chased three deep and never responded to urging. TEXAS WEDGE settled off the pace, went three wide
into the drive, brushed and lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally after. COLLUSION ILLUSION trailed early, raced off the rail into the stretch and
failed to menace. CHASIN MUNNY chased between foes and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
AZUL COAST up close early outside the pacesetter, bid alongside on the far turn, led into the stretch, dueled through the lane and was all out to prevail.
ZESTFUL sped to the front from inside, challenged on the far turn, responded when asked, lost command into the stretch but fought back along the inside
through the turn and finished gamely to the wire. BOLD ENDEAVOR chased the speed a bit off the rail, exited the far turn two wide and finished evenly for
the show. MANHATTAN UP traveled off the pace early, raced two wide then along the inside into the stretch and improved position. TAISHAN tossed his
head and was off slow to begin, went four to five wide on the first turn, moved out six wide on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and had little
left for the drive. ORDER AND LAW traveled three deep or four wide on the first turn, between rivals on the backstretch, came six wide into the stretch and
tired. FIGHT ON went three wide between rivals on the first turn, traveled in mid-pack early, coaxed around the far turn, went three wide into the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
UNUSUAL RIDE traveled in mid-pack early on, tipped out in the lane, drew alongside in the final sixteenth and drove past. BIG BELL dueled for the lead
from inside to the lane, cleared in upper stretch and yielded grudgingly in the final sixteenth. OUR MISS MILLIE tossed her head and hopped slightly at the
start, traveled two wide then moved to the inside, came back to the two path on the far turn, steered out in upper stretch and held the show. SKY ON ICE
traveled in mid-pack while outside a rival, angled three wide on the far turn, tipped out in the stretch and showed a mild response to earn a minor award.
CHAO MAR bumped both sides leaving the gate, traveled four wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and produced a mild rally. FINNLEY'S KITTEN
bumped inside rival, raced in range early on, coaxed two wide on the second bend and could not find the needed response. ELA CALIMERA MOU was rank
early, raced near the back of the pack, coaxed two wide through the far turn and advanced in the stretch without threating. VALENTINE GHOST dueled for
the lead from outside, battled into the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. MOMMA MOCCA traveled along the inside then moved out into the
backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and weakened. KOKO'S MOM settled off the inside, came three wide into the stretch and never made an impact.
SUGAR PLUM hopped at the start, steadied off heels early, fought the rider past the seven-sixteenths and never got involved. MISS O'BRIEN bumped
leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, chased four wide into the stretch and weakened.
