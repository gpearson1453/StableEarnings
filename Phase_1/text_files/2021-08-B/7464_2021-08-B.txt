Footnotes
IRONSTONE ROAD trailed the field early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane, altered in while rolling late and was just up at the
wire. KITTANSETT stalked the pace early on, rolled up along the turn, took over command and cleared the field nearing the lane, was in the three path into
the lane, clung to the lead near the eighth pole but inched away again and was caught at the wire. JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked the pace early, was in the
four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung in the late stages. FORT KNOX tracked the pace early along the inside, was off the rail into the
lane, stayed on well down the lane from the inside but weakened late in the drive. GENERATOR was through after a half. MOMOA set the pace for a half
then folded up.
