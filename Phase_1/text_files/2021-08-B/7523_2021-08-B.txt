Footnotes
GODDESS OF FIRE tracked the pace while coaxed along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, shifted in under a right-handed crop just after
turning into the stretch, moved out while switched to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, pursued the runner-up on the outside into the final
sixteenth and got up in the final strides under strong urging. EVERYONELOVESLINDA showed good speed, set the pace on the inside while under
pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear under a strong hand ride into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop outside the
furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth, switched to a right-handed crop in the final strides and was denied while far clear for the place. DOVER DREAMS
dropped well behind, went three then four wide on the turn, remained on her inside under a drive until inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead
at that point and safely secured the show. SAFFRON MOON moved out while urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the crop and failed to threaten. FOUR DAWN broke in and brushed the gate then was corrected by the rider, pressed the pace on the outside then in
the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead to the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and tired.
TIME FOR CUPID was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dropped back
under strong urging into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
JADES GELLY bobbled at the break under coaxing, dueled inside of SHESADIRTYDANCER down the backstretch and through the turn, got set down
spinning along the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. MIA BEA STAR coaxed from the gate, raced three wide off the duel
before advancing through the turn to latch on that top pair inside the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on clear of the rest and second best. A RING THING chased three then two wide coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for
home, drifted out two to three paths before being corrected and was outrun. SHESADIRTYDANCER stumbled at the start, recovered under hustling to duel
from the two path with JADES GELLY to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home in the midst of being shaken
off, then stopped through the stretch and was eased home to the wire.

the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. STRETCHTHESTORY angled in at the rear
of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and was no factor. BELLA DOMENICA was urged along off the pace, traveled
around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch under the crop, moved out at the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. SISTER'S
GHOST lost her footing and bobbled at the start, recovered to set the pace under pressure from the inside, vied in the two path while between foes on the

just off the inside briefly before tipping three wide as LADY MILAGRO took to the inside, tucked back to the two path into the turn and advanced on that rival
taking command near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide for home, got roused straightened away into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive to
prevail. LANDSLID broke on top, chased four wide coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, angled in to swing three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to be along clear for the place honors, second best. OPENING NIGHT stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping

on belatedly for the show honors. LADY MILAGRO struck the near side stall at the start, then got bumped solidly by NO NANNETTE NO into SHANGHAI
SHAMROCK, established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn and came under increasing pressure
from the eventual winner to the outside and was placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch displaced from command and
weakened to the finish. MARTINI'S AMICA bumped at the start by OPENING NIGHT who recovered inwards from a stumble, came under hustling and
chased along the inside coming under encouragement at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. NO NANNETTE

Footnotes
HOROLOGIST was coaxed to the front, set the pace on the inside through solid fractions, extended the advantage midway through the final turn, drew off
into the stretch, was put to the crop inside the three-sixteenths, widened under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under hand ride to
the wire while much the best. GOLD SPIRIT (CHI) went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile
pole, went three then four wide on the final turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SO DARN
HOT traveled around the first turn in the two path, was urged along on the inside of a foe, raced in the two path under strong urging on the far turn, turned
into the stretch under the crop and came up empty while best of the rest. GIBBERISH broke out and bumped with THANKFUL, raced in the three path on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. THANKFUL stumbled at
the start then was bumped and forced out, spotted the front several lengths, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, was urged along at the
rear, went three wide on the final turn and failed to respond then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
