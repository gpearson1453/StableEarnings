SUE SAVY vied between foes, eased back before half a mile, bid wide on the final turn and staved off challengers through the stretch. LUCKY LORRAINE
settled at the back of field, advanced wide and closed well too late. PEACELOVENKARMA saved ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat but could not
get by. STEELY BAND forced the pace three wide early, vied through the final turn then yielded. ALONG THE WAY chased in the two path and was finished
by the three eighths pole. KINDA LUCKY broke alertly and set a pressured pace inside then came up empty in the stretch.

AULD LANGE SYNE reserved outside, advanced on the final turn, moved wide in the stretch then wore down the leader in the final furlong. AMERICAN
ROMA prompted the pace outside, moved clear near the five sixteenths but was caught late. IT'S FATE well placed just off the leaders inside, moved with
the winner and finished willingly. GOOD GOOD dropped back inside, angled out in the stretch but lacked a solid rally. FACTOR THIS IN set a measured
pace inside then began weakening on the final turn. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY was never a factor and trailed throughout. THE THREE-QUARTER
FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
JUDICIAL MANDATE set the pace off the inside, was collared into the stretch, battled back and gamely edged ahead in the final stages. HEAVEN'S GOT
FIRE rated just behind the leader inside, bid into the stretch, alternated for the lead but was outfinished. EVENT PARTY lacked speed, advanced inside and
made a gradual late gain. AWARD NOMINATED chased outside off the pace and offered some late energy. MISSION KEY dropped back at the start, made
a brief four wide bid on the turn then flattened out. BOLD LICORICE lacked speed inside and was never a factor. WHATA GUY was urged close up between
rivals to the turn and faltered. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH raced wide off the leaders down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SINGLINO quickly clear under restraint, controlled the pace, remained clear to the final sixteenth when he ducked out sharply under a left handled whip and
maintained the advantage. OMATI rated outside, moved strongly on the final turn, bid in the stretch, loomed a danger but was taken up late. KNOW IT NOW
broke sluggishly, moved four wide into the first turn, pressed the leader and flattened out. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO lacked speed, briefly closer after half
a mile then faded. LORD EDDARD STARK was taken up between foes soon after the start, inside and stopped. LUCKY BRITCHES outrun early, was
asked for run on the final turn but lacked a rally. UNCLE KEN moved close up inside then stopped abruptly on the final turn. Following a stewards inquiry
and an objection by the rider of OMATI, SINGLINO was disqualified for interference in the stretch and placed second.

ANOTHER LULU advanced four wide on the turn, took aim on the leader, leveled off late to get up in time. REMEMBER HYMN controlled the pace,
widened into the stretch but yielded late. GALILEE lacked speed outside, rallied very wide and closed well. ESTILO VARONIL pursued the pacesetter in the
two path and flattened out. RESTLESS ROCKER saved ground well behind and closed the gap without menacing. OUT OF TOWNER dropped back early
and failed to threaten. DON CICCIO raced far behind and moved extremely wide into the stretch. ENGLISH LAD bumped at the start, rushed up inside then
gave way. EDEN ROCK lagged far behind throughout.

DR BLARNEY prompted the pace outside, engaged the leader on the final turn, vied to the midstretch and edged away late under confident handling.
SHANE'S JEWEL led just off the inside, was collared midway on the final turn, dueled and continued gamely to the finish. SENIOR INVESTMENT raced
four wide off the leaders, bid wide on the final turn but was no match for the top pair. BIRD KING moved close up between rivals to the final turn and
weakened. DONTMESAWITHME dropped back early outside, bid briefly closer before half a mile then faded. HONOR THE FLEET was under stout restraint
inside for half a mile then stopped.

Footnotes
PROMISE OF JOY quickly clear, repelled a challenge on the turn, widened in the stretch and was geared down late. CATIRUSIA dropped far behind then
advanced extremely wide into the stretch. TIME SENSITIVE inside early, angled out on the turn, moved back inside rallying in the stretch. DIVINE CHOICE
went after the winner on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. ENOUGH KISSES raced wide on the turn and was never a factor. MISS JASSER lagged
far behind then passed fading rivals. WRONGFULLY ACCUSED broke slowly, rushed inside then gave way. MONKEY ON MY BACK was urged close up
inside to the turn and retreated. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE lacked speed, raced outside and faded. MISS SVENGAIL dropped back early and was always
outrun. SUMMER SWEETHEART saved ground in midpack then gave way readily.
