RHYTHMIC showed speed from the inside and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and prevailed. SAN NICOLA PRANCER stalked the early leader,
was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. DONT WAKE THE BEAR tracked the early leaders
and had a good position on the turn but had no late kick. TRICKERATION was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch was no real threat. SPARKISHA was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
FLECK was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. STARDUST KITTEN stalked the
early leader, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but failed to hold. OUR PETUNIA set the pace and had a clear lead
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. JACK'S MEMORY broke poorly and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
LOUEMMA tracked from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. SHANGHAI KIMMY
was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and with the lead from the five path in mid stretch prevailed. CLASSY N' SILENT set the pace and had a
clear lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and had nothing left. LOST CORSAGE stalked the early leader and had a good position on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. QUEEN LICIA was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path
at the top of the stretch had no rally. TWOCANKEEPASECRET was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but was no threat.
WHATSWRONGWITHYOU was up close early but chased on the turn and failed to fire.

Footnotes
VINYASA was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up in time. KLASSY DELIGHT set the pace and
had a clear lead on the turn but from the four path through the stretch was caught late. I'M A GINGER was in touch, hustled along on the turn and was up
for show. TWICK was in range and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. MAHONE BAY was off the pace, trailed
the field on the turn and was never in contention.
