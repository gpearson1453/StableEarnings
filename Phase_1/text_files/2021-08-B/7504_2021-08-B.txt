Footnotes
MUSICAL RIDE asked to chase the open length leader from her outside post, settled in down the backstretch to maintain open lengths on the rest of the
field, advanced to challenge late on the turn and grinded to the front at the eighth pole, holding safe under a drive in the final sixteenth. SHES THE NORTH
inside two rivals in midpack chasing the top pair, stayed on the fence to look dangerous in midstretch but no match for the winner, picking up the place spot
in the final seventy yards. ARRIVISTE off the pace while two to three wide throughout, rallied from having one beat on the far turn to gathering momentum in
the five path down the lane, finding her best stride in the final sixteenth to garner the show spot while widest. CON THIEN sprinted clear to an open length
lead, held to the stretch but tackled by the winner and headed at the eighth pole, losing further positions in the final seventy yards. FIONNUALA broke in
and bumped a rival at the start, settled in midpack, was three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly down the stretch without threatening. MOONLIT
SILENCE bumped hard by a rival at the start, three wide the entire trip, rallied into range in midstretch while drifting out and hung in the final sixteenth.
MELROSE STAR off the pace and along the rail the entire trip, mildly rallying in upper stretch before levelling off in the final sixteenth. SMARTY ILLUSION
off the pace throughout and inside, in behind a wall in upper stretch when appearing to have something to say but when space appeared no run was
forthcoming. CARPE HORSESHOE sat between rivals in mid pack throughout, began to drop back midway on the turn and retreated further in the stretch.

SMALL TALK forced the issue on the backstretch, bid into the far turn, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a drive. MALIBU EDGE stalked the
pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining late. AZZURRO bumped with STAR CHAMBRER leaving
the gate, was rated in striking range, saved ground on the turns, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. DESERT EAGLE, in mid pack early, was
hustled two-wide and from the rail on the far turn while racing at the back of the pack, chased into the stretch and rallied. STAR CHAMBER, bumped at the
start, settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. SPIKE stalked the pace, fell back under a ride on the far turn
and lacked a rally. FROSTY BREEZE, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. MOONQUEST
set a pressured pace, was joined on the far turn, was no match and retreated in the stretch.

Footnotes
CORELLI off the pace early and along the inside, had one beat into the far turn, rallied in behind the leaders in the two path turning for home, angled out
and found a seam outside the pacesetter at the eighth pole, drove by soon after to a clear lead and held a safe margin to the wire. ENGLISH CONQUEROR
settled in midpack, was shuffled back to trail on the far turn, closed two to three wide outside the winner late on that bend, tipped out to the eight path
turning for home and closed relentlessly, but the winner's preferred trip presented an insurmountable advantage. BELICHICK stalked the leader throughout
while under a hold, the rider high in the saddle, bid midway on the far turn and had the lead turning for home, headed by the winner at the eighth pole and
ran on gamely to hold the show spot late. THEREGOESJOJO chased along the inside, came out to the two path late on the far turn, angled out to have
dead aim on the leader in midstretch but couldn't match the close of the winner who passed to his inside and his rally stalled in the final stages. PRIMO
TOUCH was three to two wide chasing on the first turn, stayed three wide on the far turn to loom outside the leaders into the stretch but could only run
evenly down the lane without threatening. PEACE OF EKATI led until midway on the far turn when pressed and headed by the eventual show finisher,
staying game until midstretch when retreating. EONS sat along the fence in midpack early, advanced up the rail in behind the leaders into the far turn but
had no response when asked to continue his run. WOODBRIDGE hit the gate hard at the start and trailed, circled up three to four wide to look menacing on
the far turn but ran out of gas and retreated down the lane.

Footnotes
BOARDROOM raced three-wide in mid pack, closed four-wide late on the turn, drew even with the leader at the 1/4 pole, led at the top of the stretch, drove
clear and held sway under a hand ride. OUR SECRET AGENT settled off the pace, chased hard angling from two to four-wide on the turn then rallied
gamely outside. AMALFI COAST broke a step slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished gamely between
rivals. GOLDEN VISION broke slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to two-wide on the turn, moved back to the rail at the head of the
stretch, rallied, but leveled out in the late stages. HELL N WILD stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied determinedly but
could not sustain her drive. FIDUCIARY (GB) raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn and was all out to no avail in the stretch. TOFFEN
led quickly, set a reserved pace, was hustled late turn and passed at the top of the stretch then faded.
