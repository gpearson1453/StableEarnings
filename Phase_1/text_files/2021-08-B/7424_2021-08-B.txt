SHUMWAY was rushed to the lead then inched clear after a half and drew off in the stretch. BEHOLD DE FLAME pressed the pace from the two path and
lacked the late response. KITTEN'S BULL raced in the middle of the pack saving ground from the two path and finished well. BACKCHATTER was
forwardly place in the three path and tired. FIRE TWO POINT O was unhurried early and trailed throughout.
