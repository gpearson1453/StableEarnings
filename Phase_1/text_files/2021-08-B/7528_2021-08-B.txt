Footnotes
MARKITOFF set the pace, continued on top into stretch run, dueled in deep stretch with TORRES DEL PLAINE, dug in gamely from the inside and
prevailed. TORRES DEL PAINE stalked the early leader, bid two wide into the lane, dueled with the winner in deep stretch, dug in gamely and just missed.
RESIDENT LIBERAL rated through early stages, hustled up between foes around the far turn then stayed on two to three wide in the lane. MINT GAME
settled through the backstretch, launched a bid turning for home, raced in range but needed more for impact. UNCLE ARMANDO tracked the early pace,
hustled up three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. STRINGFELLA settled and saved ground through early stages, roused inside to two wide in the
lane and lacked a needed rally. LYRICAL GANGSTER raced inside in range, saved ground into the lane and gave way mid-stretch. SURVEY (IRE) raced
off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into the lane and never threatened. FORMAL TREASURE raced four wide around the first turn and had no
response.

INHALATION (GB) was off a step slow at the start then steadily edged up closer, ranged up three wide in striking distance at the furlong marker, came
under a strong hand ride and edged away. A SONG FOR ARCH prompted the early pace, moved up and took over the lead in the upper stretch then got
overtaken late by the winner. BLESSED ARION raced up close inside around the turn, moved up in striking distance at the eighth pole then yielded. LOVE
YOU MUCH raced in range around the turn, hustled along three wide in the lane and produced a mild bid. ROBEY'S BOY raced in the last flight, was ridden
along into the stretch and had a mild improve. POWELL saved ground around the turn, angled out a path and failed to move on. JEOPARDY JAMES raced
in the last flight through early stages and lacked a needed rally. FACTORINO set a pressured pace, got collared in the upper stretch and gave way.

LARIMAR raced outside in the second flight, launched a four wide bid in the upper stretch, challenged HENRYS CRAZY TRAIN for the lead, dug in under
pressure and drove clear. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN vied three wide late on the turn, edged away to the lead, fought back when challenged by LARIMAR but
could not move on with the winner late. TRUE ATKA was ridden along four wide around the turn, urged five wide into the lane, secured show then drifted out
wider late. PHANTOM SHOT saved ground around the turn, shifted out five wide turning for home and lacked the needed response for impact. TALE OF V
K raced off the early pace, chased wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. PRETTY EDGY chased in range near the inside around the turn then gave
way. SMOOTH AS GLASS vied between rivals around the turn then tired in the drive. LA BRODY was ridden along the outside and lacked a needed rally.
BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB vied inside around the turn then faded in the lane. PALMGIRL chased two wide around the turn then faltered in the lane.

CORDMAKER settled nicely tracking the pacesetter through early stages, given cue three wide in the upper stretch, responded gamely and kicked clear.
MCELMORE AVENUE rated off the top trio through the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, hustled along four wide at the head of the lane,
sustained a steady bid and secured second best. ROCK ON LUKE hopped at the start then quickly took over the early lead and set the pace, roused for
more turning for home, stayed on top then got collared by the winner near the furlong marker and weakened to show. CARAMEL CHIP stalked the early
pacesetter, was ridden along two wide around the turn, launched an inside bid in the upper stretch, raced in contention then flattened in the final furlong.

contention and secured a share. CASH ON FIRST tracked the pace through early stages, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, raced in close
contention then gave way in late stages. SLIP SLIDING AWAY vied outside SECOND ROW CENTER in the first turn, battled on through the backstretch

by the top pair. HEIRESSALL tracked the pace inside, hustled up three wide in the upper stretch and sustained a even bid in the final furlong. TIPSY GAL

Footnotes
VINCENT VAN GOGO stalked in third, steady gain in the stretch, just up in final strides for the win. DECISIVE TRIUMPH stalked in second, drew clear at
the top of the stretch, missed at the wire. YANKEE DOODLE BOY traveled in fourth, finished evenly. GOSTISBEHERE settled in fifth, ridden on the final
turn to challenge, then went one paced in the stretch. HE'LL DO was never a threat. ANIMAL KINGSTON was unhurried early, then never a threat. BE
SOMEBODY traveled in the three path off the rail, then never a threat. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY had the lone lead till the final turn, gave way when
challenged and dropped back. MY OWN LANE lost touch with the field and was eased. Internal fractions omitted.
