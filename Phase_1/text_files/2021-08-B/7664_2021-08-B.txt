ARGENTIC (FR) settled through early stages, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, dug in under pressure and finished clear. DOVER CLIFFS
raced inside through the backstretch, waited patiently around the far turn, lacked a clear path in the upper stretch, shifted out four wide in the final furlong
and gained second best. BIRDSNEST PARTY tracked the clear leader through early stages, moved up to challenge for the lead leaving the final turn, vied
to the furlong marker then failed to be a match for the winner and weakened to show. ROUGH NIGHT rated off the early pace, launched a bid around the far
turn then evened out in the lane. GUNSLINGER (IRE) quickly established the early lead, drew off through the backstretch, met bid late on the far turn, vied
in the upper stretch then gave way. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE was unhurried, saved ground and failed to move into contention. DOTHAT DANCE settled

response and finished clear. VOLADOR was unhurried through early stages, sat patiently around the final turn, responded four wide in the upper stretch,
finished with response and gained place. LAPULGA stalked the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid late on the far turn, sustained a
steady bid in the lane and got edged out late for place. DREAMINOFDASIES settled inside through early stages, tipped two wide and launched a bid at the
five sixteenths pole, roused three wide in upper stretch then flattened out in the final sixteenth. MAGIC FINNISH raced off the pace, went two to three wide
into the lane and never threatened. OBLIO'S WISH stalked through the backstretch, roused along the rail around the far turn then gave way.

the head of the lane and gained three deep past the furlong marker. SUMMER SPLASH raced off the top flight, shifted out wide for the drive, raced in
contention but needed more for late impact. BUSTOFF raced up close three wide around the turn, stayed on to the furlong marker then weakened late.
LITIGANT set a pressured pace, vied turning for home, battled on past the eighth pole then faded late. KADRI forced the early pace, vied at the head of the
lane, battled back past the eighth pole then faded. CARAMEL CHIP saved ground around the turn, briefly edged up closer in the upper stretch then gave
