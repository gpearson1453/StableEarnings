Footnotes
CAPTURINI dueled inside of TRIPLET past the eighth pole and drove clear in the final sixteenth. EMPEROR'S SONG stalked the duel three wide, was
one-paced while continuing on the left lead, switched over to the right lead leaving the sixteenth pole and was just up for the place. TRIPLET dueled outside
of the winner and weakened late. TREASURED NIKKY tracked the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER chased the
pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. RAIN OF BLESSING saved ground off the pace, angled three wide turning for home and never threatened.
COMMISSION failed to menace while racing two wide. FIVE K KITTEN hopped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. BORDEAUX LEGACY
hit the starting gate and was outrun while racing four wide. RUBYINTHESTARS played no factor while racing three wide. CENTRAL PARK GIRL trailed in
the two path.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL bobbled at the start to no ill effect, grabbed the lead and moved inside, rated along widening the margin bit by bit for six furlongs, and
faced no dangers through the stretch mostly shown the crop and mildly hand urged. I'M A COCO PEBBLES chased outside the winner from the start, could
not cut into the margin under a drive on the turn, and ran on second best. LOVIN LIVIN pursued the leaders three wide, and was one-paced through the
lane. TEN PIN ALLY moved out four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed response. MISS ITALY was no factor inside. LIESEL bobbled at the start,
showed speed inside for a half-mile and retired. CACTUS KITTEN showed little three to four wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG
FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CREDIBILITY settled off the pace along the inside, bid two wide near the three-eighths pole, took the lead leaving the five-sixteenths pole, battled between
foes in upper stretch, repulsed a bid from BLIND EYE near the eighth pole and edged away. BLIND EYE tracked the pace inside, steadied near the
seven-sixteenths pole, tipped out soon after, came three wide into the lane, reached near even terms outside of the winner in midstretch but was turned
back. GLOBES prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside of the winner around the turn and weakened in the
lane. CREATIVE KID shied out and had the rider lose the right iron nearing the first turn, regained the iron near the three-quarters pole, raced two and three
wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. HASHTAG NO WONDER saved ground off the early pace, swung four wide near the three-eighths marker and
never threatened. POWER G was outrun inside. FEDERAL OFFENSE played no factor while racing two and three wide. CORPORATE AFFAIR set a clear
pace while getting out around the first turn and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
ORIENTAL PARK set a pressured early pace along the inside, shook off challengers turning for home and widened under a drive. VANCOUVER D'ORO
moved out to the four-path approaching the stretch, could not menace the winner but outbattled REGAL HOLIDAY for the place. REGAL HOLIDAY pressed
the pace outside, came five wide off the turn and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. REGIO saved ground throughout, and could not gain through the
stretch on his left lead. RAYO pressed ORIENTAL PARK from outside, got shaken off into the stretch and gave way. EL POLICIA was fractious unseating
the rider coming on the track, and did so again behind the gate, lagged far back for three furlongs, and improved through the stretch on the far outside.
PRAYIN ON CURRENCY was slow into stride, and never reached contention. GUS K was devoid of speed to the stretch, and passed tired horses inside.
PANORAMA TRUCK faded steadily outside. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN showed brief speed outside, and tired. PATANEMO was never close while racing wide.
WOW RUN tired after three furlongs.

Footnotes
HARPER BE GOOD bobbled, broke in and bumped PRESSLY'S HOPE at the start, lagged far back early, began to improve position around the turn two
wide, shifted a bit wider rallying into the stretch, caught RUFA RED KNOT from outside with a sixteenth to go and edged sway. RUFA RED KNOT set the
pace inside, shook off MISS CENTRAL after a half-mile, stayed on her left lead shortening stride past the eighth-pole and could not hold off the winner.
LULI'S DANCER raced four to five wide around the turn, and finished evenly on her left lead. UNCAPTURED GRACE was outsprinted early, saved ground
improving position after a half, but could not gain through the last eighth of a mile. BABY BLUE raced far back three wide early, and passed only tired
horses. HAD A NICE WEEKEND was outrun inside. KISS UPON A STAR raced three to four wide, and tired after a half. MISS CENTRAL pressed RUFA
RED KNOT from outside for a half, and faltered. PRESSLY'S HOPE got bumped by HARPER BE GOOD and steadied back at the start, and never got
close. TSAYONARA SLEW broke slowly and was always far back. I SAID HEY was finished early inside. ROUGH ENOUGH hit the left side of the gate at
the start, raced three to four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
LUDINGTON disputed the pace between foes in the three path to upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging, was headed in midstretch, fought on
gamely inside of MY MANE MAN and prevailed. MY MANE MAN prompted the pace in the four path, reached even terms outside of the winner in upper
stretch, battled on outside through the lane and just missed. ANOTHER DUKE raced in range in the three path and finished evenly to gain the show. OLD
TIME REVIVAL set the pace in the two path, yielded the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, battled on inside of the winner to midstretch then weakened.
HARD LIGHTING raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the lane. IRISH HONOR chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid.
REBELDE failed to menace while racing two wide.

MADEIRA WINE set an even pace inside for a half-mile, picked up the tempo fending off TWIRLING GRACE around the far turn, dug in gamely through a
long drive and had enough to hold on. FORBIDDEN DREAM was outrun for six furlongs inside, moved out in the stretch, finished fastest outside but ran out
of ground. LOVE MY JOB tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, loomed outside MADEIRA WINE with a furlong remaining, stayed on her left lead
and was outfinished. TWIRLING GRACE pressed MADEIRA WINE from outside all the way, and weakened through the last sixteenth of a mile. BAROLA
turned in an even effort racing two wide. CHAMPINA was bumped into STEVIELYNN by DREAMING OF AUDREY at the start, and saved ground to no
avail. DREAMING OF AUDREY broke in bumping CHAMPINA into STEVIELYNN, and faded after six furlongs inside. CALIDAD broke a step slow, and
never factored. STEVIELYNN got bumped by CHAMPINA at the break, and showed little at the back throughout.

Footnotes
BRACCIO DI FERRO set the pace in the two path, repulsed a bid in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. SMALL REASON raced off the pace four
wide, made progress in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold second. DIVERT broke in a tangle to get away well last, raced off
the pace inside down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, shifted further out for the stretch run, continued on the left lead and rallied for the
show. HIERRO was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the stretch.
GREYZER was up close inside and faded in the lane. GODS BLESSING played no factor while racing two wide. KLEON was outrun inside. GEGE
CONQUEST hit the starting gate then bumped with HIERRO at the start, chased the pace three wide and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ELDON'S PRINCE bumped with FULTON STREET at the start and was off a step slow, advanced slowly but surely through the opening stages, ranged up
four wide outside the leaders approaching the stretch, took over after straightening away for the drive and widened the advantage under pressure.
WINGING IT cleared to the early lead, rated along near the inside for six furlongs, was no match for the winner into the stretch, drifted out and held the
place. FULTON STREET bumped with ELDON'S PRINCE at the start, was under a firm hold behind WINGING IT heading to the first turn, remained inside
tracking from close range, attempted to squeeze through on the fence inside WINGING IT at the top of the stretch but lacked sufficient clearance, got
through into the stretch and did not have enough. UP HER SLEEVE pressed WINGING IT from outside, lodged a bid between horses coming to the
quarter-pole, then faded through the stretch. FAST N STEADY steadied along the rail first time through the stretch, and never made her presence felt.
VLADISLAV broke two lengths slow, and never became involved. ONWARD AUSTIN raced near the inside for six furlongs, and dropped far back. AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF FULTON STREET AGAINST WINGING IT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
CATCHING FISH vied inside SEA TRIDENT, got the best of that dispute and edged clear leaving the far turn, and widened under a drive. POCO CHARLIE
got bumped by KRAMDEN after the start, advanced around the far turn three wide, finished willingly and was up late for the place. SEA TRIDENT vied
outside CATCHING FISH from the outset, could not match strides into the stretch and was outfinished for second. KRAMDEN broke outward, was corrected
and veered back in bumping POCO CHARLIE, went along near the two-path on the turns, and lacked a bid. CALABASH raced forwardly inside early, and
had no closing response. BUFFALO MAX broke two lengths slow, and never factored inside. POSEIDEN was never prominent. EASY STRIDE steadied
inside ANDREW THE BULL leaving the first turn near the back, and remained outrun. PLEASE SIT DOWN hit the right side of the gate at the start, and was
never close. ANDREW THE BULL was always outrun.
