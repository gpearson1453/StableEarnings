HEROS vied for the lead along the two path, tracked inside on the turn, challenged from the rail a furlong out, battled to no avail but held the place.
THERESA'S BOY well placed along the three path, challenged between a furlong out and finished with interest. OLIVER WITHA TWIST unhurried along the
three path, angled out in the lane and then lacked needed late response. COMPETITIVE HERO two path on the turn, appeared to be waiting leaving the
five-sixteenths pole, eased out for room and then failed to fire. BLIZZ lagged back, saved ground and failed to gain. BUSS THE BELL broke on top, dueled
early, cleared three from the rail on the turn and then was done in upper stretch. FUSILLI jostled in the chute, saved ground and tired.

appeared to have a chance a furlong out and hung. TRIGGER PULL well placed along the two path to the top of the lane, asked inside and failed to fire.
CASPER JOE volleyed for the lead along the three path into the backstretch, two path after that and was done into the lane. CHAPPY'S BREEZE saved
