Footnotes
NEEDABETTERJOCK never far back throughout, roused into stretch dug in gamely and won the head bob on the wire. MY PAL DAL good position inside to
far turn, rallied through the stretch and outgamed to the wire. CHANNEL STUFFER was off tardy with a wide trip throughout, altered course in mid stretch
with no late gain. HESITATION BLUES quick to the lead outside, set pace to stretch but weakened late. DEVILISH TAIL chased pace to the half, gave way
readily from that point. RAULITO raced between horses on the backstretch and never menaced.

LOVER BOY awkward start, behind leaders to turn, rallied to cruise away. RAF close up inside to the stretch, rallied thru the lane, angled out late for place.
FINAL DELIVERY good position to the turn, three wide run, battled hard, outgamed. REWARD THE MIRACLE quick to the front, pressured to the half,
faltered late. PULL ME BACK broke awkward from gate, back to the turn, no late response. ALLGRIT broke awkward, widest into stretch, no factor outside
with a broken whip. LINEMAKER brief speed between horses, gave way readily into turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO SOMETHING TRIPPING
THE BEAM EARLY.
