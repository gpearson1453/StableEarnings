Footnotes
TRUTH PREVAILS tracked clear leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn and into the stretch, took aim on leader and
responded to urging to get up in the late stages. WINDANSEA away well and sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered stretch
clear and let inside the final sixteenth, drifted in late to meet inside rallying rival and was unable to hold off rival. AT THE MARGIN tracked leader two wide,
continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the three path, proved no match for the top two and save show under steady urging. PROMNESIA tracked
leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide om the turn, lacked needed response when asked and finished up one paced. FOR MY
BROTHER stumbled at the start, settled into a stalking position along the rail and continued along the rail on the turn, asked in the lane and had a very mild
response. BALLET ROYALTY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to produce any rally in the lane.
