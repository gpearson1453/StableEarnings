Footnotes
PHILLIP JUSTIN set a contested pace, held well into the stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. STORM THE FIELD attended the pace, remained in
contention for the stretch run and stayed on well. TEQUILA saved ground, was angled off the rail into the stretch and managed a mild rally. VANDRING was
outpaced while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and made no impact. PRAIRIE SQUALL stumbled at the start and was never involved.
COMEGETSOME retreated. COME ON RICO fell at the half mile pole and was vanned off. FOLLOWING THE STEWARDS, CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
AND MADE NO CHANGES.
