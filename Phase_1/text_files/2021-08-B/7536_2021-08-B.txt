close up outside then faded through the stretch. TOP SHOTTA lacked speed and weakened steadily. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN was injured in the paddock
and ordered a late scratch on the advice of the track veterinarian.

wide, pursued the winner and weakened. EIGHT DANZAS lacked speed wide, bid closer on the turn then flattened out. XENATOWN earned a narrow lead
early and began fading on the turn. CRIMSON LILLE dropped far behind and was never a factor. MISS CONSTRUE broke slowly, chased outside and
faded. SUMMARY JUDGMENT was urged close up between foes early then stopped abruptly. IRISH JUMPER chased far back throughout. PRINCESS
TOISHMA dropped back early and trailed throughout.

E T'S DEUCES WILD dueled along the inside then edged away through the stretch driving. HARBOR CROSSING vied outside alternating for the lead then
yielded late. DR ZRADA chased inside, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but went evenly. RICKIE'S MELODY broke in a complete tangle then
rallied well without menacing. WHISTLING FOOL settled wide off the dueling leaders and retreated. WISEMAN'S SECRET raced within range down the
backstretch and faltered. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT lagged far behind wide then passed fading rivals. REIGNING CHAMPION raced just off the pace three
wide and stopped. ORACABESSA saved ground and was never a factor. SUNSHINE TOMMY dropped back after the start and was always outrun. MISSED
THE BUS lacked speed and was far back throughout. PAID THE PREACHER chased extremely wide down the backstretch fading.

through the stretch. DARLING DONNA advanced to contention between rivals then raced inside through the stretch. LA CIENEGA raced five wide down the
backstretch and continued willingly. ARDEAN raced off the leaders wide and lacked a rally. HALLIGIRL was urged close up wide and weakened. HOLD ME
CLOSER made a menacing move extremely wide on the turn and the stretch. SNAPPY RIDE saved ground then steadied retreating in the stretch.
PRINCESS EMMA JO broke slowly and was always outrun. TIME ALTERING was eased back between rivals in the opening quarter and trailed.

Footnotes
CHRISATUDE advanced inside on the turn, angled out rallying into the stretch and rallied clear driving. STONEGATE lacked speed, moved wide into the
stretch and closed well. UNCLE ERNIE vied inside, moved clear on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. IMAGINE THIS chased wide, was put to
urging on the turn and finished willingly. DANZAFIED dropped back outside and passed rivals without menacing. NORTHERN EXPRESS lagged far behind
then passed fading rivals. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL prompted the pace three wide and faded after half a mile. TANKINATOR forced the pace in the two path
and gave way. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE was hard ridden outside off the pace and faltered. STAY HYDRATED stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
GO FOR THE KILL was a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

DON'T CALL ME MARY forced the pace outside, continued close up, was asked for run on the turn, bid into the stretch, hooked the pacesetter and edged
clear. CHUB WAGON broke alertly and set the pace under moderate urging, moved easily on the turn, was collared passing the eighth pole and continued
gamely while unable to hold off the winner. CINNABUNNY advanced between rivals into the far turn and continued well without threatening the top pair.
KAYLASAURUS lagged far behind, rallied wide with some energy while no menace. HEY MAMALUKE broke awkwardly, moved up inside then faltered and
was eased in the final yards. I'M THE TALENT prompted the leaders three wide down the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON stalked the pacesetter outside, edged to the front near midstretch and gamely held off pair of closers. GOLDEN CANDY settled
off the leaders, swung wide into the stretch and closed strongly too late. PRINCE OF RAIN dropped back early, advanced wide, bid extremely wide in the
stretch with a late surge. MIDNIGHTCHARLY lagged far behind then closed the gap late along the inside. FINAL SHOT hustled to clear advantage to the
stretch and weakened. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS chased off the pace and continued well while no threat. BRILLIANT CHASE raced very wide down the
backstretch and failed to menace. MIDTOWNCHARLYBROWN lacked speed and was never in contention. DREAMS UNTOLD stalked the pace three wide,
made a brief bid on the turn then faded. JOHNNY RITT was urged just off the pace outside then stopped after half a mile. THISCATCANJUMP displayed
poor action, lost contact with his field and was eased.
