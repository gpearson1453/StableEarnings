Footnotes
HAPPY HOUR BOBBY broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and
held the late challenge of NORTH ARM BAY under firm right handed encouragement. The latter angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing
through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch while being roused to advance and continued willingly to close the gap on the
winner nearing the wire. ROAD TRIP was roused from the break to gain terms prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn but couldn't
match that foe and gave way midstretch. HUNTER JUMPER, off a step slowly, switched outside rivals in early stages, continued four wide, then five wide to
upper stretch but had no closing response. MINNESOTA RED angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but steadily faded
into upper stretch. HONEY'S SUPERMAN broke slowly and passed tiring rivals. SMART OXIE was rated off the second flight along the inside and steadily
retreated into the lane. TAHKODHA KNIGHT tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, shifted in entering the turn to lodge a brief
three wide bid nearing the lane but quickly emptied out in the drive.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN was rated off the second flight racing to the first turn, steadily gained contention outside a rival racing through the backstretch, shifted out
four wide nearing upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, quickly took charge, then kicked clear under firm handling. MITHQAAL was rated
off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted out three deep after a half while moving to terms with the leaders, pressed the issue in that
path on the far turn to upper stretch and continued with a grudging effort to prevail for second. BIG FALCON ROCKET angled inwards racing to the first turn
to prompt the pace outside a rival, pressed the issue between foes through the backstretch into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while just
missing for second. CAMPS BAY settled last to the far turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final
kick. BOURBON WISDOM was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide in upper stretch but had no closing
bid. JIMMY'S MARCO sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside foes through the backstretch into the
far turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SHE BEGAN AGAIN ducked out at the start while getting away slowly, was settled last racing to the turn, gathered momentum leaving the turn to split foes
three wide racing through upper stretch, angled inside the pacesetter to challenge for command nearing the sixteenth marker and wrested the advantage in
time under steady handling. ORNAMENTAL IRON, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shook clear racing into
upper stretch, drifted out under left handed pressure leaving midstretch and couldn't contain the winner. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR tracked the leaders outside
rivals in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. M AND M GIRL tracked off the
first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. BENTLEY'S DREAM, forwardly placed
three wide tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, steadily faded into the lane. GIPSEY SORCERESS, under pressure in early stages while tracking
just off the first flight inside rivals in the opening quarter, dropped out early. EREBUNI bobbled slightly at the start, was urged along the inside to set the
pace in early stages, disputed the issue inside a rival into the turn and gave way racing through the stretch.

Footnotes
COME ON SWEET PEA was rated well off the leaders a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained contention shifting outside foes leaving
the midway point of the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and edge forward
under firm encouragement. JEWEL AZUL, reserved along the inside in the opening half, drew into contention shifting off the inside nearing upper stretch to
bid between foes, altered course sharply in upper stretch while angling to the rail and continued willingly inside foes to challenge for command while not
quite matching terms with the winner late. SAILING ALONG, forwardly placed three wide between foes racing to the first turn, was urged to challenge while
being fanned four wide into upper stretch and weakened between foes late. IMMINENT THREAT settled last racing to the far turn, angled outside rivals in
upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position five wide late. TRENDY NEVE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a
contending position, angled to the inside on the backstretch to track off the first flight to the far turn, shifted out to bid between foes in upper stretch but
flattened out in the closing stages. LITTLE MISS BELLE, in touch between foes prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into
the far turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering the lane and quickly gave out. HOWMUCHISTOOMUCH, urged
along the inside dictating the pace into the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn and gave way.

STITZY, angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance while pulling a bit, gained position inside a rival
racing into the far turn, tipped outside the leader nearing upper stretch while readily advancing to challenge, then wrested a clear advantage in the closing
stages under firm handling. MY BOY LOLLIPOP, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, gathered momentum while swinging out five wide nearing
upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to close the gap while gaining the place honors. PAPA RIZZO sped clear of the field racing to the
first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin through the far turn, resisted the winner's bid racing past midstretch but weakened late. IMA HARLEY
TOO tracked the leaders three deep off the second flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch to gain some position inside foes and
finished evenly late. REAL LUTE tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the lane but had no
closing bid. MESA SKYLINE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. LAST PROMISE tracked off the second flight
inside foes to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. COPPER FIDDLE, forwardly placed tracking outside the pacesetter to the backstretch,
emptied out racing into the far turn. TEDDY TIME trailed throughout.

REDOUX, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch tracking the leaders out of striking distance, made a steady advance three deep
after a half to gain terms with the leader on the far turn, took over from that foe racing into upper stretch and edged away late under pressure. UNBRIDLED
SHOES, roused from the break to dispute the pace inside rivals racing into the first turn, dueled inside a rival into the backstretch, edged clear after a half to
set the pace into the second bend, resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved only second best. HAVEN'S JOY broke outwards bumping
INCRIMINATION, was collected to track off the first flight just off the inside to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn disputing third outside a
rival into the lane and narrowly prevailed for a share late. COMPELLUS, a bit reluctant to load, settled last while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch gaining some position into the lane but was outkicked for third. INCRIMINATION, bumped at the start, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival
racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half. R DEJA VOO flashed brief pace three deep pursuing the leaders into the first turn but emptied out early.
