FLY SWEET SKY pressured the pace dueling abreast rival through the turn then down the stretch extending clear in the final yards. NINJA sent hard to
make the early lead would duel inside of rival through the turn then down the stretch ceding grudgingly in the last yards. PUNKSTER stalked the pace laying
close through the turn angling out to the three path mid stretch weakening under a drive. BEEBE'S BEST BET faded on the turn. I HAVEWHATIT TAKES

BEND THE KNEE sent clear set the pace holding daylight through the turn saving ground to upper stretch widening late on the inside. HOPES AND
PRAYERS went evenly through the turn rallying inside the eighth pole coming on to save place. NEVER FOREVER slow early lagged to upper stretch
giving a mild rally to move up late. HELLO MY HALO chased the pace through the turn extending on the inside down the lane tiring late. GLOBAL QUEEN
COCO played no factor. EL A VADER was never involved. ECLIPTICALS VISKI chased through the turn fading into upper stretch. PROUD ADDY gave way
abruptly on the turn.
