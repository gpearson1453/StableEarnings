Footnotes
AIN'T EASY chased along the inside, tipped out at the three-sixteenths, drew alongside with a furlong to go and kicked clear under hand urging. INFINITE
EMPIRE tracked outside a rival early on, went between on the turn then four wide into the lane, tipped out at the top of the stretch and bested the rest.
BENEDICT CANYON vied for the lead between foes up the backstretch, remained close up three deep on the turn, chased three wide into the drive and
kept on to earn the show honors. KEYCHAIN GIRL off a bit slow to begin, checked off heels early, went up to take the lead past the seven-sixteenths pole,
cleared into the stretch, lost command inside the eighth pole and flattened to fourth. MIRASOL vied between foes early, pressed the leader on the turn, and
weakened in the late stages. BELLE CHERIE vied three then four deep early, chased the leader five wide into the stretch and weakened. BOOZE RUNNER
bobbled at the start, was in tight and steadied at the seven-sixteenths, angled to the rail to save ground on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
RED VALOR went up to press the pace from inside, took over past the three-eighths, cleared around the turn, drew away leaving the turn and upper stretch,
then was kept to task through the final furlong and held safely. SELF TAUGHT lagged behind early, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch,
moved back to the rail in the drive and rallied to prove second best. P R RADIO STAR showed early speed three deep, could not keep pace with the top trio,
angled to the rail on the turn, moved off the inside in the lane and finished evenly. MAJOR CABBIE settled off the pace, went three then four wide around
the turn and improved position. SMILEFORME attended the pace four deep up the backstretch, went three deep into the turn, chased outside a rival and
four wide into the stretch and weakened. SPEED PASS away quickly to grab the lead, set the pace under pressure from both sides, lost command past the
three-eighths pole, chased the winner three wide into the stretch and weakened. BUTTERED NOODLES chased up close five deep then four deep into the
turn, exited the turn five wide and faded.

Footnotes
EVENING SUN (GB) settled off the pace, bid four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead in upper stretch and held well in the closing moments. ONE
FAST BRO reserved early in mid-pack, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail for the far turn, lacked room around the bend, lacked room again
and checked at the eighth pole, gained a clear path and rallied for the place. DOMINANT SOUL stalked the pace in the two path, bid three deep at the
five-sixteenths, put a head in front shortly after, vied three deep into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and got edged for the place. MEMO DADDY
(CHI) got shuffled back at the start, traveled near the back of the pack, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths, raced three deep on the second bend
then five wide into the stretch, put in a mild late bid but lacked the needed late punch. UNCLE ADDOUMA unhurried in the beginning, made a mild bid five
deep at the five-sixteenths, could not match strides with the leaders around the turn but kept to task through the lane and finished willingly in deep stretch.
OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, tipped out to the two path on the far turn and needed to find more in the final furlong.
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR pressed the pace or chased outside the lead in the early going, vied between rivals on the far turn, three wide into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. MOHAWK KING (IRE) set the pace on the inside, got headed at the five-sixteenths, lost command but fought back through
the turn and into the stretch and weakened in the lane.

FORBIDDEN KINGDOM set the pace near the inside into the turn, showed the way in the two path into the drive, remained clear into the furlong grounds,
drifted out a bid late under left-handed urging and prevailed. KAMUI got knocked into rival at the start, up close early outside the pacesetter, navigated the
turn three to four wide, drifted in and brushed rival just path the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely three deep to the wire. RHETORIC stalked the pace from
inside, driven two wide into the stretch, look to rally between but got brushed and crowded just inside the sixteenth pole, then stayed on gamely between
foes and missed the place. PORTSMOUTH chased three deep early, outside a rival on the turn, drifted five wide into the lane and lacked further response.
THE MET veered out and bumped rival at the start, chased in the two path while losing the ground on the turn and faded. THE KEY IS UNITY knocked into
rival at the start, trailed early, went three wide into the stretch and never made an impact. BEEF WINSLOW raced off the pace early, went four wide into the
turn, five to six wide into the stretch and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KAMUI FROM SECOND TO THIRD
FOR DRIFTING IN AND INTERFERING WITH RHETORIC IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH.

Footnotes
SUBCONSCIOUS bumped with inside rival at the start, vied for the lead first time through the stretch, cleared into the clubhouse turn, gained pressure at
the seven-sixteenths pole, shook free into the stretch and drew away. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) raced near the back on the inside, split foes at the
five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane and rallied for the place. BARBWIRE shifted in entering the stretch the first time, raced in mid-pack off the rail,
was driven two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane and gained the show. LONE SCOUT rated on the inside early then moved out on the backstretch,
bid three deep with seven-sixteenths remaining, vied with rivals through the far turn, chased the winner three wide into the stretch and flattened out to fourth.
TULSA TORNADO stalked on the inside to the stretch, remained along the fence in the lane and finished evenly. OFFLEE NAUGHTY settled off the pace,
went two wide into the drive, steered out in the stretch and offered a mild response. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) bumped with rival at the start, raced in
ranged off the rail, navigated the far turn three to four wide and lacked the needed bid. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR traveled between foes early then moved
inside, saved ground to the lane and never found the needed response. AFFABLE vied for the lead first time through the stretch, ceded command and
switched off the inside to stalk the pace, bid outside at the seven-sixteenths, applied pressure through the final turn, lost contact into the lane and
weakened. HULK pulled early between runner first time through the stretch, traveled in the two path then three wide on the second bend and could not rally.

between first time through the stretch, traveled near the back of the pack off the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
PRIVATE MISSION prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the three-eighths, took over midway around the turn, cleared rival with a quarter mile
remaining, then drew off under strong hand urging and coasted to the wire in the final strides. I'M SO ANNA stalked the top pair off the rail, came three wide
into the stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. FOREST CARAWAY traveled in range early off the rail, entered
the stretch four wide and was along for the show. LISETTE coaxed from the gate, chased from on the inside then two wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. LADY MYSTIFY set the pace under pressure from PRIVATE MISSION, raced on even terms with that rival at the three-eighths, lost command midway
around the turn, chased the winner past the quarter pole, weakened in the lane, and bled following the race. DAY PLAN trailed early on, went around a rival
on the far turn, entered the stretch three to four wide and failed to menace. JEANNE B traveled off the pace through the early stages and tired.

Footnotes
MO FORZA broke in and bumped rival at the start, allowed to settle early on, angled four wide leaving the second bend, rallied outside the top trio, drifted
inward in deep stretch and got up. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT closest in pursuit from the two path on the clubhouse turn, applied pressure up the backstretch,
chased the leader two wide through the far turn, drew alongside in upper stretch and struck the front at the eighth pole, led through the final sixteenth and
got caught in the closing moments. HIT THE ROAD stalked the top pair early, took aim three wide into the lane, finished well but got crowded late halting his
momentum. NEPTUNE'S STORM sped to the front from inside, gained company on the backstretch, led clear around the far turn, tested again in upper
stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining and yielded late. COUNT AGAIN off a bit slow and bumped by MO FORZA at the start, saved ground into
the lane and was not a factor.

GOING GLOBAL (IRE) tracked on the inside then moved to the two path, went between runners on the final turn, brushed rival entering the stretch, rallied
outside the top pair and drove clear. CLOSING REMARKS stalked the speed on the inside, waited for room in upper stretch, tipped out to find room to run
and finished well for the place. FLUFFY SOCKS tracked between foes off the pace, spun four wide into the lane and put in a mild late bid to earn the show
honors. FEATHERS (IRE) stalked in the two path then outside a rival, bid alongside the leader on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, fought between
runners into the furlong grounds and faltered late while staying on for a minor award. MADONE settled early on the inside, tipped out into the lane and failed
to find more in deep stretch. JAVANICA sped clear to establish the front, controlled the pace through the early going, challenged around the far turn,
maintained a short lead into the stretch, fought with a pair of foes to the furlong grounds and weakened late. IVY LEAGUE chased off the inside our outside
rivals, driven three wide into the stretch while getting brushed at the three-sixteenths, then flattened out in the late stages. SOARING SKY (IRE) off slow to
begin, trailed at the rear early, swung four to five wide into the lane and could not make an impact. TETRAGONAL (IRE) raced widest leaving the chute then
angled in and tracked outside a pair of rivals, dropped back on the final turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TRIPOLI away quickly from inside then ceded the lead to TIZAMAGICIAN, chased along the inside then shifted to the two path on the far turn, bid outside
into the lane, cleared the runner-up nearing the eighth pole and was kept to task to the wire. TIZAMAGICIAN vied for the lead early then inched clear first
time through the stretch, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged into the lane, relinquished command in upper stretch but stayed on and was clearly
second best. DR POST settled off the pace, went four wide into the far turn, exited that bend six wide and rallied to best the rest. SHERIFF BROWN lagged
behind in the early going, saved ground into the drive, moved out in the lane and summoned a mild rally. INDEPENDENCE HALL raced up close outside the
leader through the early stages, chased the top pair three wide into the stretch and flattened out. EXPRESS TRAIN was in tight between runners into the
first turn, traveled off the rail to the stretch and lacked a rally. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) tracked the pace in the two path, went two wide into the far turn, four wide
into the stretch and weakened. CUPID'S CLAWS tracked outside a rival, went four to five wide around the second bend and weakened in the stretch run.
MAGIC ON TAP chased off the rail, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT settled off the inside, came four wide into the lane, drew alongside mid-stretch and drove past. MASTER PIECE (CHI) raced near the back of
the pack, traveled off the rail, exited the final turn five wide, closed well but was too late. ACCLIMATE sped clear to take control, set all the pace to the
stretch, remained clear to the furlong grounds and got outkicked in deep stretch. UNITED tracked in the two path, waited for room leaving the final turn,
lacked room in upper stretch, rallied three wide then angled in with a sixteenth remaining and missed the show. RED KING traveled in mid-pack early,
steered to the inside then came two wide into the drive, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear past and kept on through deep stretch. SAY THE
WORD pulled a bit around the first turn, angled to the inside, pulled again on the clubhouse turn, remained along the inside to the lane, lacked room from
upper stretch to the sixteenth pole, found room late and finished willingly while running up on heels at the wire. ARKLOW unhurried in the early going,
steered out on the far turn, entered the stretch six wide and finished willingly in the furlong grounds. CROSSFIREHURRICANE was off slow to begin,
traveled off the pace early, on, went three wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch and raced between rivals in deep stretch. AWARD WINNER
forwardly placed in the early stages while angling down to the two path, chased two wide into the lane, bothered by UNITED angling in near the sixteenth
pole and weakened. MEDIA BLITZ away quickly from inside, stalked the pacesetter through the early stages, coaxed around the final turn, bothered by rival
near the sixteenth pole and weakened inside. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS was put in tight quarters briefly on the first turn, stalked outside a rivals, took aim
three wide leaving the final turn and faded.
