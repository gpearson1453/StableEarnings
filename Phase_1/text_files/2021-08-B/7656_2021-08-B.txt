TEXAS GANO unhurried early advanced quickly on the far turn vying eight wide down the stretch surging in the last yards to win clear. AMICUS BRIEF
tracked the pace rallying into upper stretch bidding between horses in the six path ceding to wide rival while salvaging place. STOCK CHAIN stalked the
pace rallying to clear at mid track in upper stretch weakening under outside pressure. BRADLEY'S COWBOY sent clear set the pace through the far turn
then faded along the inside down the lane. EL DUQUE far back early played no factor. U S S COSTLY tracked the pace to the far turn then wilted into upper
stretch. GOLDDIGGER'S DREAM lost action on the far turn being pulled up at the head of the lane walking off.

Footnotes
CASK stalked the pace laying close through the far turn looming outside the leader in upper stretch firing to win going away in the four path. ARCTIC ICE
hustled up early pressed through the backside wresting a narrow lead on the far turn digging in from the three path down the lane proving no match for late
running rival while holding well. CENTRE STREET stalked the pace losing ground to upper stretch giving a mild bid in the seven path. WINNING FORMULA
brushed the gate then bumped rival shortly after, hurried to the front pressured the pace dueling through the far turn wearing down the final eighth.
MAKINDREAMSCOMETRU slow early circled out to upper stretch finishing evenly eight wide. BLIND JUSTICE moving evenly off the pace raced seven
wide down the lane. VOYANT set a pressured pace dueling on the far turn wearing out along the rail the final eighth. J J THE BOMB was bumped steadying
shortly after the break. NOONTIME TRAIN was always outrun.
