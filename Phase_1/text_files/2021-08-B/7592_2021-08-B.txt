PRINCESS SHAKIRA was well placed on the inside then angled out three wide to prevail late in the drive. IMA FINAL DE BUY set the clear pace and was
caught late. WRINKLED ROSE was placed in the middle of the pace on the inside and made a late rally for the show. KURIOUS KENNEDY stalked the
pace and made a late bid. SYLVIA'S ROCKET was forwardly place in the three path and faded in the drive. SASSY SAPPHIRE saved ground on the inside
and improved position. MUWAAN MAT trailed the field early and passed tiring rivals. MAGIC MOMENT was not a factor. LG SHEZA RANDOMCAT pressed
the pace from the inside and gave way. QUEEN LANA has an awkward start and was not a threat. CHIRON ECLIPSE failed to menace.

ALWAYS A TIZ was rushed to the lead to set a clear pace and kept to task in the drive. SASSY SETA pressed the pace from the inside early to be clearly
second best. MILLI STARR vied for the lead early from the two path and flattened out. MY MEADOW was unhurried early and made a late rally to just miss
show. INTOXICATING KISS chased the leaders while racing five wide and failed to menace. FEELS RIGHT was allowed to settle then advanced slightly
and faltered. DUSTY SKY was never a factor. SHE'S THE BOSS tracked the leaders while racing four wide and tired.

Footnotes
COLLUSIONIST was allowed to settle off the leaders on the inside then angled out at the head of the stretch and closed willing to just get up for the win.
ONE STEP AWAY was hustled to the lead and battled JAZZY JUSTIN from the two path then drew clear at the eighth pole but was caught late. JAZZY
JUSTIN bobbled at the start then challenged ONE STEP AWAY for the lead from the inside and faded in the stretch. BURGAMEISTER was one paced
throughout. YOUNG PHILLIP raced in the middle of the pack from the two path and weakened.
