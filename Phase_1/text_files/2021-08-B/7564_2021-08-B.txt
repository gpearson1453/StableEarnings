head of the lane, was no match for the winner but dug in gamely to capture second best. CONCLUSIVE steadied after the start, raced off the early pace,
launched a five wide bid at the head of the lane, moved up into closer contention then got edged out late for place. JESUIT chased in contention around the

PETITION PRAYER sat back in early stages, given cue turning for home, kicked in five wide at the head of the lane, rallied along the outside and finished
clear. HIGH ARABIAN tracked the leader around the turn, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, took over the lead in the upper stretch, stayed
on with response but could not hold off the winner in late stages. LANFRANKOPHILE raced in contention in the early going, hustled up inside around the
turn, tipped out a path at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and lasted for show. ISTHATYOURHARLEY was off a step slow at the start, raced off
the pace, angled out late on the turn, shifted out wider for a clear path at the eighth pole and gained position. EVANGELINE ALLONS saved ground around
the turn, urged inside in the upper stretch, edged closer at the eighth pole then gave way. CABRA CHICA raced near midpack, hustled along three to four
wide in the lane and had no late kick. GORMAN raced in pursuit in range around the turn, sustained a two wide bid in the upper stretch then flattened out.
JACKKNIFE broke on top, angled in and set the pace then got collared in the upper stretch and faded.
