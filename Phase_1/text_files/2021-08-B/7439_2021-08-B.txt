Footnotes
THE MEAN QUEEN (IRE) jumped well while well placed outside in the two path, made a bid near the last fence, raced outside of a foe under his own power
on the final turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. BALTIMORE BUCKO
(GB) went straight to the front, jumped outward while setting a clear pace, struggled some under pressure over the final fence, vied inside of the winner
under urging on the last turn, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match but gamely held the place. FRENCH LIGHT (FR) raced in the two
path under a hold, was bumped after clearing fence six, dropped back while in tight between horses into the final turn, shifted three wide under urging late
on that bend, chased along the outside fence in the stretch and just missed the place but was clear for the show. CITY DREAMER (IRE) saved ground off
the pace, struggled over fences five and six then bumped with a foe, steadied between horses into the fourth turn, saved ground into the stretch and came
up empty. RECENT REVELATIONS (IRE) was bumped after landing over fence one and forced into another foe, went three wide towards the rear, dropped
to the two path early on the final bend and failed to respond. GIBRALFARO (IRE) jumped reasonably well while saving ground throughout and also failed to
respond. REDICEAN (GB) was late jumping fence one then slipped badly upon landing, stumbled severely and awkwardly, struggled jumping especially
over fence five, stumbled landing over fence seven and faltered. A SILENT PLAYER (IRE) was bumped after landing over fence one, settled towards the
rear and also faltered.

Footnotes
FREE ENTERPRISE led briefly after breaking on top, conceded the front to CREATE AGAIN and settled two to three wide in closest aim of that rival,
advanced through the turn to latch on in tandem with EASY SHOT midway on the turn, took over command inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the inside and gamely held on to prevail. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL hustled from
the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge
inside the final furlong but was ultimately bested at the end. CANTRELL HILL chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide for home, offered up a mild bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. EASY SHOT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide
advancing through the turn to latch on the top pair when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. CREATE AGAIN
hustled from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, came under urging three furlongs from
home, yielded the front just inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MONSHUN was away alertly from the outside post then went clear, was challenged briefly at the half-mile pole then easily shook off that foe, controlled the
action while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when shaken up into upper stretch and drew off under a brisk hand ride before being placed
under a lighter hand ride in the final few strides while much the best. MORNING MATCHA broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched
to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and finished willingly while second best. POUT lost her footing some at the
start but broke with the field then was hustled, chased the early pace, moved up outside the leader to make a brief bid with a half-mile to run, chased two
then three wide on the turn and weakened. SEA PINES broke in and was off a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn
then moved to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LOVE UNLIMITED stumbled severely at the start and was off slow, spotted
the front several lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. LOCKSTEP was asked leaving
the gate then moved out early under urging, dropped in to save ground on the turn and came up empty. FIFTYSHADESOFRUN was hustled from the start
then chased the pace, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and retreated. G MONEY LIV broke a half-step slow,
was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back four then five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BLEWITT broke out at the start under coaxing and bumped VILLAINOUS, showed the way in hand inside before coming under light coaxing down the
backstretch, tipped to the two path through the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a flanking pair and held well to the
finish rebuffing the runner up to the wire. DARK STORM a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild kick but was ultimately repelled to the finish. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY chased along the inside
coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then came under tepid handling
inside the eighth pole approaching the sixteenth marker and was flashed the crop to the right side through to the finish and was along for the show honors.
VILLAINOUS lost his hind footing getting away awkward from the gate, then got bumped by BLEWITT, who broke outwards, chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung five wide for home and improved position by tired rivals. KUMAR three then two wide through the first turn,
raced two to three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, began to fade through the latter portion of the turn,
swung four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. HEAVY ROLLER four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and weakened.

drew off under a mild hand ride to win handily. PRINCESS TERUKO moved up on the outside to press the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped
back under urging at the five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch then came under the crop and safely secured second while no match for the winner. SHINE

Footnotes
MISS DOMINA hustled from the gate, dueled from the four path with CROWDING OUT to her inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and knocked
heads through the bend coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside for home, shook off CROWDING OUT nearing the eighth
pole and edged clear to the finish kept to task. CROWDING OUT dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, chased the winner home safe
for the place honors. SAND AND SEA chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly well clear for the show honors to be along best of the rest. VENUS OYZO broke awkward and was bumped at the start by ARCH OF FIRE, chased
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch and passed tired foes in the drive. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES coaxed from the start, chased four wide down the backstretch, briefly tucked to the
two path into the turn before then tipping three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. LET THEM EAT CAKE chased
along the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and tired. ARCH OF FIRE broke in at the start bumping VENUS OYZO, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
BEFORE YOU showed good speed, set the clear pace while off the inside, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, was roused three wide into
the stretch then drifted in at the three-sixteenths, remained well clear under a left-handed crop while still on her inside lead into the final sixteenth and
maintained a safe advantage while shortening stride under steady urging. CADEAU DE PAIX moved in while urged along off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, came off the rail into upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong and secured the place while no match for the winner. BAYSHORE FOXES was
urged along while chasing the pace, raced inside to the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
kick but was clear for the show. TARGETED RETURN broke in and hit the gate, settled on the outside under some urging, came under stronger
encouragement in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. RAFFINITY was ridden along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn,
moved off the rail late on that bend, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. APRIL ANTICS broke out then dropped back after the start, fell well
behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail late on that bend then swung seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. AIR
CAVALRY was urged along on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHI TOWN LADY stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up outside under urging, chased three wide on the turn,
rallied into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead under a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. POPPY
FLOWER disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside that foe on the turn, shook clear into the stretch then came under a
right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, drifted out while being collared near the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while
clear for the place. KNEESNHIPS broke a step slow, was urged along towards the back, went four wide on the turn, came eight wide into upper stretch and
improved position to get the show. STAND UP COMIC was urged along on the outside, raced between foes leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the
two path, was driven four wide into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick and missed the show.
DERRYNANE broke a half-step slow, settled towards the back, entered the turn between horses, went three wide on that bend, swung seven wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CHARLEE O was hustled from the start, chased the early pace then dropped back late on the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and came up empty. FLIP MY ID settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. CARTEL QUEEN was urged along on the inside, dropped back along the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed
to respond. FULMINATE disputed the pace on the outside of the runner-up then in the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging,
dropped back while floating six wide into upper stretch and faded.
