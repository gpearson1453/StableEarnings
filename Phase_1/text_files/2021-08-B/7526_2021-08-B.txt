stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. PURE ELEGANCE was away slowly and settled in mid pack,
rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. CULATELLO was off slowly, stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the
turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final furlong. SILENT GHOST forced the pace into the turn, chased to the stretch but leveled out in the

into the stretch, was gaining but was outkicked late. PEACE SEEKER forced the pace into the turn, stalked two-wide and chased through the stretch. LADY
GRACE raced in mid pack along the rail, was hustled late turn and finished all out between foes. TAPPITTY TAPPITTY, away slowly, settled off the pace,
closed to mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but her rally stalled in mid stretch. ROYAL WEDDING vied briefly then stalked the pace,
was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. QUEEN'S SPEED, away slowly and off the pace, trailed on the turn and while still
showing interest through the stretch, did not menace.

Footnotes
LUCKY CURLIN settled off the pace, on hold between rivals three to two wide on the turn, moved in behind the leaders in upper stretch awaiting room,
shifted out to a seam at the eighth pole, engaged the leader at the sixteenth and got by in the final seventy yards. ESKIMINZIN chased the open length
leader, had dead aim on that one in upper stretch, rallied past at the sixteenth to get the front briefly but could not match the energy of the winner and
settled for the place. SIR SEAMUS opened a clear lead, held it until the sixteenth pole and stayed on gamely to win a head bob for the show spot. WILD
MEDAGLIAD'ORO chased along the rail, came off the fence in upper stretch but lost his path when the hole closed, went back to the rail and was
outnodded for the show spot on the wire. LOOKIN TO STRIKE broke out at the start, settled in midpack three wide on the turn, rallied and fanned into the
nine path at the top of the lane and closed widest to best the balance. WEDGEWOOD broke in at the start and was inside three rivals at the back, got a
dream rail run into the stretch but could only inch up at the end without threatening. ROARING FORTIES sat on the rail in midpack, came off the rail turning
for home with an impending rally but had to go back to the fence near the eighth pole, stalling from that point. LAPOCHKA off the pace early, came four
wide around the turn and fanned into the six path turning for home, closing mildly down the lane. SILENT JIMMIE off the pace early, moved up three wide
on the turn and fanned into the six path turning for home, his rally stalling at the sixteenth pole. NEVAEH'S DREAM sat in mid pack, came two to three wide
to loom outside the eventual place finisher at the top of the lane but ran out of run in the final sixteenth. DUN DRUM chased three wide on the turn, moved
into contention outside the eventual place finisher turning for home but ran out of run in the final eighth. SOLIDIFY began sluggishly and was always in the
back of the pack. ENTRY TO HEAVEN chased four wide early, came three to five wide on the bend and the rider was up in the saddle in the final furlong
when obviously no bid was happening.

Footnotes
DR. GREEN bumped with TOURIST'S DREAM at the start, settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch,
rallied determinedly and was just up, driving. BLUE MAX pressed the pace early then stalked on the turn, closed three-wide late turn, led in deep stretch but
was caught on the wire. MORE CHANCES stalked the pace, was steadied while a little rank early backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then
rallied gamely. TOURIST'S DREAM broke outward and bumped DR. GREEN, raced in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, rallied gamely but weakened
late. ARQUEBUS moved clear through the first turn, set the pace, quickened on the far turn but gave way in deep stretch. MAGIC SPIN raced in mid pack,
was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished gamely. ARAFAT bumped with AFLEET
EDDIE leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn and showed interest in the stretch. EXPO had speed then stalked the
pace, closed and forced the issue into the far turn, chased to the stretch but evened out in the late stages. DELIBERATE was rated off the pace, circled
three to five-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly outside. AFLEET EDDIE, bumped at the start, settled in striking range, was hustled three to five-wide on
the far turn then finished gamely in vain. NORTHERN CONQUEST hopped leaving the gate, raced in mid pack but dropped back three to five-wide on the
far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE tracked the early pacesetter while racing off of the hedge down the backside, commenced her bid as they approached the 3/8ths pole,
poked her head in front at the top of the stretch and proved best through the stretch run. SEASONS raced between foes down the backstretch, stayed
covered up around the turn, angled out for a clear path at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. SPEIGHTSTOWN SHIRL stalked the pace, raced
three-wide through the turn, remained contentious well into the stretch and chased gamely to the wire. PERSEVERANCIA raced near the back on the inside
in the early stages, advanced up the inside into a stalking position late on the turn, was in contentious at the top of the stretch and chased in vain.
MaSSPELL raced widest down the backstretch, was three-wide on the turn, angled into the four-path turning for home and offered no rally. I GET IT trailed
the field in the early stages while just off of the inside, angled to the five-path at the top of the stretch and never threatened. SWEET SOUPER SWEET set a
reserved pace while saving ground, was clear midway around the turn, began to take pressure turning for home and emptied out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MUTAMAKINA (GB) stalked the headstrong leader throughout, wouldn't go away despite a quickening pace on the far turn, engaged that rival in upper
stretch and got clear at the three sixteenths pole, needing the wire late to hold off a phalanx of closers inching up on her outside. ETOILE (FR) sat in
midpack while three to two wide on the first turn, was on hold on the rail on the far turn, darted through on the inside of rivals turning into the stretch and
angled out at the three sixteenths, closing inside two foes down the lane but ran out of real estate, settling for the place. MERVEILLEUX broke out and
bumped a foe at the start, off the pace and in the two path until midway on the far turn, angled out turning for home floating some rivals wide, closed
doggedly down the stretch to grab the show spot. COURT RETURN off the pace, circled three to four wide on the far turn, fanned out into the eight path
turning for home and closed well the length of the stretch while widest. BLAME DEBBIE chased the two leaders along the inside, was in range turning for
home but her mild close was not enough, outkicked by others. ALNASEEM (GB) had her head up at the start and was pinched back, recovered quickly to
lead while somewhat rank, sped it up around the far turn but couldn't shake the winner, lost the lead in the stretch and retreated. AFLEET KATHERINE was
bumped by a rival at the start, chased outside down the backside, was to the flank of the place finisher midway on the far turn and fanned out to the six path
turning for home, no response from there.

a drive but needed the wire. RIPTIDE ROCK, pinched back after the start, trailed, closed two to four-wide on the final turn, had one beaten at the top of the
stretch, rallied widest with authority and just missed. H C HOLIDAY settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, was
awaiting room and steadied approaching the top of the stretch, angled out and rallied gamely. MUNNYFOR RO raced in mid pack, encountered traffic at the
top of the stretch, found a path although she was bumped between rivals then closed steadily. KEEP GRINDING settled in mid pack, closed three and
four-wide on the far turn, loomed dangerous at the top of the stretch and was game to the final 70 yards. AVOMAN raced in mid pack, came two to five-wide
on the far turn, was in range at the top of the stretch but was buffeted about then herded inward near the 1/8th pole leveled out in the final 16th. HARLAN
ESTATE raced in mid pack, was in tight turning for home, was behind the leaders upper stretch and his rally stalled in the late stages. HADDASSAH was
rank early and under strong restraint, stalked from the rail, bid inside the winner leaving the turn then faded from mid stretch. TIDAL FORCES settled in mid
pack, angled from two to five-wide on the far turn, loomed dangerous outside rivals at the top of the stretch. was laying in and tired in the final 16th. DANCE

Footnotes
SILENT POET stalked the early leaders, bid three wide late on the turn, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch and had a clear advantage by the eighth
pole, holding safe to the wire while kept to his task. ADMIRALTY PIER trailed into the stretch, shifted out to the widest path in upper stretch and after a
momentary failure to change leads did so and closed resolutely to make a game of it late. CARAVEL insisted on the lead from a rival, stayed in the two path
around the turn, was challenged by the winner in upper stretch and could not match that one's determination, losing the place in the final stages but hanging
on to the show gamely. CITY BOY advanced three to four wide into position on the turn, was fanned out into the five path turning for home and had dead
aim on the front but could only inch up in the final stages for a minor award. HONEY WON'T was taken back from midpack to off the pace, appeared to have
something to say on the turn when moving up without urge but could only close mildly down the lane to the wire. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) led early, allowed a
rival the front so as to stalk that one from the rail, bid inside top stretch but could not sustain his run and faded in the final eighth. OLD CHESTNUT was
devoid of early speed, advanced smartly two to three wide on the turn and out in the six path at the top of the stretch but stalled in the final furlong. TURNED
ASIDE sat on the rail in midpack, was in behind the leaders on hold late turn, could not quicken when room appeared down the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET SERENADE was rated off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied smartly and swept to the lead in deep stretch, driving.
ADMIRING led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear late backstretch, held her lead, was engaged a furlong out, held that one off but was
passed by a late runner in deep stretch. FASCINATION was away slowly but quickly gained position, pressed then forced the pace, bid a furlong out, was
unable to wear her rival down and was passed by the closer in deep stretch. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) steadied leaving the gate, stalked the pace, came
three-wide through both turns, chased into the stretch but leveled out in the late stages. CONFIDENT settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the
far turn and was all out through the stretch. WHO SAYS settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished under
a determined drive. PROTECT raced from off the pace, was hustled rail and two-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. CANDY GARDEN
stalked the pace from the rail on both turns, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. SECRET DELIGHT hit the gate at the break and was
rated off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally. COASTING AWAY, in mid pack early, raced three-wide on the first turn, chased
four-wide on the far turn then flattened out in mid stretch.

Footnotes
MR. DIFFLEY was taken back at the start, trailed on the far turn angling from the rail to four-wide, came extremely wide turning for home and closed
resolutely to get up in time. DESOLATOR rode the rail on the turns, angled out upper stretch, closed inside the winner but was no match. MY SEA
COTTAGE (IRE) raced in mid pack came three then two-wide through the first turn, bid three-wide on the far turn, led at the top of the stretch but lost the
lead a 16th out and stayed on gamely for show. WAVE BABY pressed the early pace, stalked on the backstretch, bid between foes turning for home but
faltered late. LAKE SHORE DRIVE dropped in behind the leaders, angled out two and three-wide to loom on the far turn but leveled off in the final furlong.
SEE FOREVER raced three-wide from off the pace on the first turn, sat outside the eventual place finisher on the second turn before rallying mildly down
the stretch. MUCHOKOVA was steadied hard along the rail under the wire for the first time, advanced inside into range on the far turn but could not quicken
in the stretch. DANFUSI led into the far turn, stalked and hounded by a rival, was headed at the top of the stretch then retreated down the lane.
TORONTOTORO was three-wide near the rear of the pack on the first turn, dropped back and trailed on the far turn and was never contentious.
