DANCIN IN DA'NILE showed brief speed then forced the issue, chased into the stretch, bid in the final 16th, dueled, a battle which involved some bumping
with LUCKMAN and prevailed under good handling. LUCKMAN settled at the rear, closed along the rail on the turn, bid in the final 16th, bumped with
DANCIN IN DA'NILE and was outfinished. BE LIKE CLINT held a short early lead, moved clear late turn, was caught in the final 16th and gave way
grudgingly. MORNING THOUGHTS settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. STEALTH MISSION settled off the
pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. RAPPER ZAPPER broke inward and settled off the pace,
was hustled two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. HAYROLL forced the early pace, stalked to the turn then backed away and lacked a rally. A CLAIM
OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ON LUCKMAN AGAINST DANCIN IN DA'NILE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL 16TH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SOUPER LEGACY slightly stumbled and made contact with a rival at the start, sat second well back of the open length leader, closed the gap on the turn to
be in range, bid at the eighth pole and had the lead nearing the sixteenth marker, held a diminishing margin to the wire over the closing place finisher.
READY FOR THE LADY sat outside two rivals down the backstretch far back of the open length leader, stayed three wide while moving up on the turn and
swung into the five path with momentum turning for home, continued to close but ran out of real estate, gaining on the winner to the wire. DIAMOND CITY
cleared off quickly, held the front until challenged at the eighth pole and headed at the sixteenth pole, hanging on easily to the show spot. DANIEL SUN was
between rivals and off the pace, hustled on the inside midway on the turn but could only inch up late without threatening the top three. BILL NEEDLE hit the
side of the gate at the start and trailed, did not put in a rally while failing to change leads in the stretch. POINT TO THE STARS broke out and bumped a
rival at the start, settled inside two foes off the pace down the backside and faded midway on the turn.

Footnotes
BAKSHEESH was next to last late on the backside, advanced willingly two to four wide on the turn and tipped out into the five path turning for home, closed
relentlessly to get the front at the eighth pole and widened late with authority. THATSITTHATSALL chased along the inside, dropped back a tad before
rallying two to four wide into contention by the quarter pole, drove by the leader for a brief advantage at the eighth pole but was immediately collared by the
winner, no match for that one but clearly second best. PROUD SPEAKER off the pace early, was advancing smartly early on the turn but steadied in traffic
and was shuffled back, re-rallied nicely to be in behind the winner in early stretch but could only inch up down the lane to garner the show spot late. EXIT
STAGE RIGHT came up inside the early leader to press while under a hold, stayed on inside in contention into the stretch but slightly steadied nearing the
eighth pole and did get by the tiring early leaders in the final stages. SWINGING MANDY stalked the leaders outside, dropped in behind the leaders at the
top of the stretch and levelled off while laying in the final furlong. ALLPAIDUP pressed early before clearing off to lead after three-eighths of a mile, held the
front until headed at the eighth pole, tiring in the final sixteenth. FOREST B clear early before allowing a rival the front, stalked that one and bid for the front
at the quarter pole but could not get by, faltering in the final furlong. ONEOFTHEMGIRLS off the pace before rallying three wide on the turn but could not
sustain it and faltered in the final furlon. GORMLEY GIRL off the pace early, came three wide onto the rail in the turn but could only pass a few tiring foes
down the lane. FUN COOL settled in midpack early along the inside but dropped off the pace into the turn and was never a factor. DAZZLING DIVA was
three wide chasing early but dropped back midway on the turn and could not recover. GRANDE BELLA was slow to begin and trailed throughout.

THERE'S NO JOE held a short early lead, shook clear into the turn, was hustled along then widened in the stretch and finished under a hand ride. LAST

chased three then two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. PRICELESS WILL stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn,

settled off pace, moved to the rail, saved ground on the turn but never reached contention. TIMMINS hopped leaving the gate, was hustled two-wide and
from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and flattened out in the stretch. SUMMER SUNSET settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on
the turn but lacked a rally. ULTIMATE ANSWER ducked out at the outset, forced the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace.
SECTION TEN dueled, dropped back under a drive on the turn and had no response in the stretch. WICKED CRAZY stalked the pace, dropped back early
turn and trailed home.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S DESTINY stalked the pace, chased hard and angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, had command a furlong out and held under a drive.
GORGEOUS KITTEN settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn then rallied gamely outside. VICTOR'S DESTINY broke outward
and was steadied, showed speed and set the pace under pressure from ANOTHER, dueled with that one on the turn, gained a short lead at the top of the
stretch but was passed by a stalker with a furlong on tap and chased to the end. ANOTHER forced the pace, dueled on the turn, was headed slightly at the
top of the stretch then was passed by the eventual winner a furlong out and gave way. COURTLY MANNER broke alertly, stalked the pace, was hustled
three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide through the turn, was unable to
threaten in the stretch but did show some interest. HEYDON'S CASE settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out in the final
16th.
