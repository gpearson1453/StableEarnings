Footnotes
NO OBLIGATION dueled to turn, backed off, came again much the best. NOT NOW RAND good position to turn, not enough in the stretch, best of rest.
PLATINUM MAC pace to the half, gave way but held the show spot. TRAMORE BAY raced evenly, lacked late response in the stretch when needed.
REVANS REIGN never menaced. RENATO through after half, dropped back. R UNCLE WILLIE steady fade back.
