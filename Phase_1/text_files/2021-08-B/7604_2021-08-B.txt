Footnotes
MOLLIES HOPE grabbed the lead at the break, rated along inside to the stretch, and stayed clear under pressure. CAPETOWN CANDY saved ground on
the turns in striking range, got steered out bumping into DOLCE APRILE at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly to get second. STRAIGHT TO GO was
outrun early inside, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied on the far outside to pick up the show. DOLCE APRILE bumped with ALRIGHT
ALREADY at the start, prompted the pace outside MOLLIES HOPE, got bumped by CAPETOWN CANDY at the top of the stretch, and weakened. YES I'M
SPITEFUL raced three wide on the turns, and tired in the stretch. TEA'S DREAM was reserved early two wide, moved inside and came up empty when
roused. VLADISLAVA spotted the field a couple lengths at the start, and never factored. ALRIGHT ALREADY bumped with DOLCE APRILE at the start,
went along between horses in the second flight, and tired after six furlongs. RACHEL DREAM broke slowly and was always outrun. UNBRIDLED CHROME
showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
GEOSCIENCE set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, switched back the left lead near the sixteenth pole and held well clear. SUPER Q
settled off the pace while racing two and three wide and stayed on to gain the place without threatening the winner. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA saved ground
off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. DR. ROGER pressed the winner two wide and tired in the drive. LINGUIST
was outrun inside. SUPER TRIPLE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. COMPASS CAY played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
DOMINEER broke to the lead, showed the way near the inside early, and stayed clear through the stretch while drifting out steadily. LEVY LAND gave
chase three then four wide around the turn while ridden along, and did not have enough to seriously menace outside the winner. JOST SAYIN lagged far
back for a half-mile, and gained belatedly inside the top two finishers. DISTINCTLY BLUE bobbled slightly at the start, saved ground in pursuit to the turn,
moved off the rail past the three-eighths, and stayed on to midstretch before weakening. GRACE'S DRAMA shifted out four wide late on the turn, and could
not gain on the far outside through the lane. SHEZA HANDFULL was outrun throughout toward the inside. SPECIAL COUNSEL chased early between
horses, and could not keep pace around the turn under a drive.

ROMANTIC TALE dueled two wide throughout and edged ahead in deep stretch. LA URBANA dueled inside of the winner throughout and gave way
grudgingly. MY LITTLE NANY chased the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. SEA SONG chased the pace three wide,
angled in upper stretch and faded. BREEHAZEL chased the early pace widest, angled nearing the lane and lacked a closing bid. MAGNA COLORS trailed
inside.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MO stayed close early inside, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, went back in a path and wrested command inside CREATIVE
CHOICE coming to the furlong grounds, and drew off decisively under a drive. CREATIVE CHOICE bumped with CAPTAIN at the start, tracked in the clear
outside the early duel, ranged up three wide to challenge with five-sixteenths remaining, poked a head in front at the quarter-pole, could not withstand
MYSTERY MO soon after straightening away for the drive, swapped back to his left lead into the final furlong and stayed clear of the remainder. CAPTAIN
bumped with CREATIVE CHOICE at the start, settled in midpack four wide to the stretch, and improved outside for the show while not a threat. MENELIK
vied for the lead outside A P ROCK for better than a half-mile, and weakened turning for home. MUTAKAAMIL was no factor three to four wide. PROUD
CONTENDER was outrun for a half, came into the lane rallying in the three-path, then flattened out while attempting to lug in past the furlong marker and
was not asked for much after that. LUCKY MAN brushed the left side of the gate and spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, and faded steadily after
a quarter-mile. A P ROCK vied early inside MENELIK, and was finished after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MS BIG SPRING sped clear early, showed the way a bit off the inside for a half-mile, came into the stretch in the three-path, and held sway while drifting
out. INCLUDE THE BEAST chased between horses, moved inside turning for home, loomed a threat through midstretch, could not reach the winner and ran
on clearly best of the others. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE saved ground in pursuit of the leaders to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing bid. KATNISS
KAN broke two lengths slow, lagged well back to the stretch, and improved for the last major share without threatening. BLESSED BEAST was outsprinted
to the stretch two to three wide, and had no rally. K'S RUNNING FREE broke a step slow, gradually shifted off the inside to the four-path around the turn,
and could not gain. MIZ CHAPLIN chased four wide to the stretch, and faded steadily on her left lead. DRILL'S VALENTINE was four wide into the turn, and
moved inward dropping far back to the lane.

Footnotes
VOW ME NOW advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail from there and held clear
under left-handed urging. LIGHT FURY saved ground in range, advanced two wide around the far turn, finished willingly outside of the winner, was turned
back by that foe but was well clear of the rest. SASSY BUT SMART steadied along inside for a half and stayed on inside for the show. CUESTION DE
TIEMPO bumped nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace, steadied near the five-eighths pole, advanced two wide around the far turn but lacked the
needed stretch rally. KROY tracked the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. GEMONTEER was bumped between foes nearing the first
turn, raced off the pace two and three wide, steadied near the five-eighths pole and never threatened. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR had his head turned at the
start and broke in a tangle to get away several lengths behind the field, saved ground well back and made little impact. FREEDOM MATTERS was bumped
into the first turn, raced three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PICKING UP PENNIES brushed with FAMOUS GENT at the start, controlled the pace in the two-path for a half-mile, drifted out through the stretch and
remained well clear. JOSHY JAK raced four to five wide around the turn, finished willingly and overhauled PALADIO from outside to get second. PALADIO
saved ground from the outset, cut the corner rallying into the lane, then weakened through the late stages. ABSOLUTE GRIT raced three to four wide
around the turn in range, but faded through the drive. OH STEVE shifted out five wide approaching the stretch near the back, and made no progress.
BOLDNESS pressed PICKING UP PENNIES from outside for a half, and tired. FAMOUS GENT brushed with PICKING UP PENNIEDS at the start, got
outpaced around the turn two wide, and dropped back steadily in the stretch.

Footnotes
COMMANDER GRACE hit the starting gate, trailed in the two path while frequently on heels to upper stretch, angled out, split rivals nearing the eighth pole,
surged outside and was up in final strides. CIDSTAYINURLAINE bumped with SUNDANCE PEAK at the start, raced in range inside, angled three wide near
the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, steadily gained through the stretch, took the lead late but was overpowered by the winner in the final
yards. DEFENDANT set a clear pace inside, led to deep stretch and yielded late. SYLLABUS was off a step slow, saved ground off the pace and had a mild
stretch gain. SENORITA SALSA failed to menace while racing three wide. KIZZY chased the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. JULIE
BIRD (IRE) played no factor while racing two wide. SUNDANCE PEAK was bumped at the start, stalked the pace two wide and tired through the final
furlong. DRIVING WIND played no factor while racing four wide.
