Footnotes
KIERLAND tracked the clear top two leaders through early stages, came under right handed pressure and angled out turning for home, roused forward into
striking distance, dug in racing in the three path, steadily edged up closer then drew clear. GOLDEN SPEAR raced outside off the top two clear leaders,
launched an outside bid heading into the lane, raced four deep in range in the final furlong and got up late for place. MIDNIGHT SWAP broke on top and set
the early pace, vied for the lead inside of KING LEONARDO around the far turn, battled on with a slim lead into the final furlong then weakened in deep
stretch. KING LEONARDO stalked the leader through the backstretch, vied with MIDNIGHT SWAP around the far turn, stayed on in aim into stretch run
then weakened near the sixteenth pole. FREDDY SOTO raced off the pace, went three wide into the lane, moved to the inside under pressure and failed to
move on. QUINTO SOL stumbled at the start, was hustled along entering the far turn, failed to sustain bid and retreated.

CIRCLE AWAY raced in the back then picked up the pace late on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady urging, switched
in a few paths and drew clear. ZONIC was ridden along the outside around the turn, went four wide into the lane, angled in near the eighth pole, advanced
into close contention but could not reach the winner. SHACKLED pressed the pace through early stages, took over the lead in the upper stretch, got collared
for the lead in the final furlong and got edged out late for place. SEATTLE COUNCIL raced in range around the turn, went five wide into the lane, drifted out
wider and kept on evenly. SIMMARDSTRIKE was forwardly placed three wide around the turn, stayed on with response to mid-stretch then flattened out.
PLEA BARGAIN set a pressured pace around the turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
CHELSEA WALL was allowed to settle off the pace in early stages, began to edge up closer midway around the far turn, hustled up for wide into the lane,
roused forward into striking distance, dug in under steady pressure and forged ahead. WHAT DOES IT TAKE stalked the pacesetter through the
backstretch, moved up to race near equal terms late on the far turn, hustled along three wide into the lane, raced in close contention but could not move on
with the winner late. BALLYHOO PRINCE broke on top and set the early pace, continued with a narrow lead over WHAT DOES IT TAKE late on the far turn,
dug in on top with a furlong left to run then got wore down late. NORDIC RHYTHM rated off the top trio through early stages, roused three wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. IMAGINE NEVERLAND lacked speed, raced outside and had no response. ZACAPA CENTENARIO stalked the leader through
the backstretch then faded midway midway around the turn.

Footnotes
MCCAIN quickly cleared on top and angled closer to the inside, set the uncontested pace through the backstretch, roused for more at the head of the lane,
stayed clear on top then began to weaken in final stages and held late under a driving finish. KITTEN'S SPA tracked the pacesetter through early stages,
launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, stayed on determinedly through the lane and was getting to the winner in final strides. RECONVENE
stalked the early pace, was ridden along the outside around the turn, failed to respond and dropped back.

Footnotes
CHAMBO rated not too far back in early stages, began to pick up the pace along the outside near the five sixteenths pole, swung six wide into the lane, dug
in determinedly under pressure and got up late. SMALL FIELD set the pace around the turn, saved ground and widened advantage into the lane, stayed on
with response but could not hold off the bid from the winner in deep stretch. LUCA DREW THE ACE raced near midpack, hustled along four wide into the
stretch run, sustained a steady bid through the lane and prevailed for a share. BLOKE raced in range around the turn, hustled up two wide at the quarter
pole, shifted out wider with a furlong left to run and failed to kick on. MY COMPUTER raced off the early speed, went five wide into the stretch run and had a
mild improve without threatening. GLEAMING SWORD was forwardly placed in opening stages and chased the leader around the turn, stayed on with
response past the furlong marker then came up empty in late stages. RAGING WHIRLWIND raced off the pace, went three to four wide into the lane then
angled inside and failed to move on. SPRITZER raced in contention through early stages then failed to keep pace and gave way in the lane. LOVER
RODOLFO showed brief response then weakened.
