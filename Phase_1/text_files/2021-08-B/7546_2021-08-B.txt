POWER HOUSE was hustled from the inside, had a slim lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. ROMANTIC BLISS stalked
the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. PRINCESS FABIANA was unhurried early and
raced evenly from the inside on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. KOZY KAT was away alertly and forced the pace on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. GOSUDARINA was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch failed to fire.

Footnotes
MACHISIMA was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. CURT'S ANGEL was in mid pack and
was roused from the inside on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. NATURAL HABITAT was off the pace
and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was well back, trailed the field on
the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. QUIET ASCOT showed speed from the inside and dueled on the far turn but
had nothing left. KECAMEIFYOUCAN set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty.
HIDEY HIDEY was away alertly and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact.

CHEEKY PINT stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was kept to task. CAPOEIRA was
unhurried early, had a mild gain on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished well. THE ADRIE FACTOR set the pace and had a clear lead on the
far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. FEATURE CREATURE was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. NAKED ILLUSION was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch had no late kick. CRUMLIN QUEEN tracked from the outside and had a good position on the far turn but weakened. VANA GRAND forced the early
pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. GRAZARION was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
