Footnotes
EMPIRE G was a bit stubborn to load, rushed up the inside after initial strides and took over a slim lead, widened advantage entering the turn, saved ground
into the lane and stayed sharp under steady encouragement. WOODSONG'S CASTLE raced in contention along the inside around the turn, cut the corner
entering the lane, tipped out a path wider near mid-stretch, sustained a steady bid and fished second best. LADY CINCO DE MAYO raced up close in
opening stages, hustled along three wide in pursuit into the lane and stayed on for a share. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL raced in range around the turn, was
ridden along two wide between foes in the upper stretch then evened out in late stages. SIGNS OF JEALOUSY gave chase four wide around the turn then
faded in the lane. DOWN UNDER THUNDER lacked early speed, raced two to three wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
WIDGET FACTORY took over the lead heading into the first turn, set the clear pace through the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, roused for
more at the head of the lane, had more left in the tank and kept clear. SWING YOUR SWORD hustled up out of the gate, got outpaced for the lead and
tracked the clear pacesetter through the backstretch, closed the gap late on the far turn, roused two wide into the lane but could not reach sharp winner.
BRILLIANT IDEAS raced three wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, moved up the inside then angled out midway around the final turn,
hustled up three wide in the lane and gained a share. BURN THE SHIPS raced two wide around the first turn, hustled up in pursuit around the far turn,
saved ground into the lane then flattened out. COMPROMISO raced off the early pace, angled out around the far turn, raced three wide into the lane and
lacked the needed response for impact. THE EXCEPTION was unhurried in early stages, was ridden along five wide into the lane and failed to rally.
GOLDEN APPEAL rated off the clear pacesetter through the backstretch, urged inside around the far turn then gave way in the lane. GOOFY BOY raced
two to three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, went four wide into the lane and never threatened. PRINCE VALESKI rated off the early pace,
went four wide into the lane and had no late response.

Footnotes
HERETODAYGONMANANA tucked inside around the first turn and tracked the pacesetters through the backstretch, edged up closer then slipped through
along the rail late on the far turn, quickly cleared command and finished going away. CEDARS BULLS EYE rated off the early leaders, was ridden along
four wide around the far turn, stayed on with response in the lane and gained second best. MOONLIT SHADOW pressed the pace through the backstretch,
remained in aim into the far turn, was no match when the winner took over but churned on two to three wide in the lane and prevailed for a share. WALK A
FINE LINE saved ground around the first turn then raced off the early speed, moved up closer along the inside in the upper stretch but failed to sustain bid
and gave way. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE hustled up out of the gate and held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch,
got collared by the winner late on the far turn and weakened. ARROWWOOD raced three to four wide around the first turn, was unhurried through the
backstretch, stayed outside into the lane and failed to rally. JUBA'S HOUSE was in pursuit off the top two leaders through the backstretch then began to
weaken late on the far turn.

STAR OF NIGHT raced midpack going by the wire for the first time then went three wide around the first turn, raced in contention then launched a bid for
command near the quarter pole, moved up to engage BRIDGING THE GAP for the lead in the upper stretch, vied to the final sixteenth then dug in gamely
and drew clear. BRIDGING THE GAP raced in aim for the lead around the first turn then seized command entering the backstretch, set the pace then
hustled up near the inside around the far turn, spun out two to three wide heading into the stretch run, vied inside of STAR OF NIGHT inti the final sixteenth
then failed to be late match for the winner. SEE YA MANANA angled inside after the start, rated through early stages then picked up the pace with three
furlongs left to run, was ridden along around the far turn and sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane. THE BETTER ONE raced off the pace
through the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the far turn, gained closer contention then evened out. AZZURRA tracked the early pace, hustled up
along the rail around the far turn then flattened out in late stages. STOWE ANGEL raced off the pace, chased four wide into the lane and failed to kick on.

retreated.

Footnotes
AARON'S TAP angled inside after the start, came out a patch and hustled up in steady pursuit, roused along the rail around the turn, advanced into closer
contention then edged by GOLDEN KEY in the deep stretch. GOLDEN KEY got bumped at the start then sprinted out to a clear early lead, held firm around
the turn then hustled up two wide in the upper stretch, stayed on with good response but could not hold off the rail bid from the winner in deep stretch.
LAUGHING CAT chased the pace through the backstretch, hustled along two wide around turn, continued in contention three wide through the lane and
secured show. HYPOTHESIS raced off the early speed, was ridden along the outside in the lane and improved position. ROCKET APPEAL raced in pursuit
near midpack, hustled up two wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane. COMMAND THE CAT checked along the rail in opening stages, dropped
back and lacked a needed rally. TRIPLE BAD steadied not long after the start, raced off the pace, went four wide into the lane and failed to kick on.
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN was forwardly placed behind the leader then tired in the drive. FREEDOM IS RINGING raced near mid-range then steadily
weakened along the inside.

Footnotes
DOOR BUSTER was away in good order and forwardly placed inside around the first turn, stalked the top two leaders through the backstretch, waited
patiently for a clear path around the final turn, slipped through along the rail in the upper stretch, quickly cleared on top and widened under steady pressure.
C V'S POWERPAK was off slow at the start, remained unhurried and angled inside to save ground, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, angled out
midway around the final turn, set down four wide in the drive, raced in close contention at the sixteenth pole but could not kick on with the winner. JACKS
SISTER JILL sped to the lead at the start and set the pace through the backstretch, held on top around the final turn, battled on two wide in the stretch run
then had no closing response left in reserve. THELADYISTRUE raced two wide around the first turn then tracked the pace in range through early stages,
launched a bid near the quarter pole, hustled along five wide into the lane and lacked the needed surge for impact. MADY ROSE positioned two wide
around the first turn then gave chase up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the final turn, swung five wide turning and lacked a needed
rally. SHUTUPN'KISSME was forwardly placed around the first turn, battled on three wide into the stretch then tired in late stages. JAMESTOWN ROAD

Footnotes
LADY ROCKET was restless in the gate and popped open the gate, was away in good order and assumed command after initial strides, set the pace
through the backstretch thenvied for the lead around the final turn, lost the whip in the upper stretch, stayed on gamely from the inside, turned back the bid
from LANDING ZONE and finished clear. LANDING ZONE fanned four wide around the first turn, was forwardly placed and tracked the pacesetter through
the backstretch, moved up to engage LADY ROCKET for the lead around the final turn, vied two wide into upper stretch, could not move on with winner in
late stages but stayed on and just lasted for place. QUEEN NEKIA raced two to three wide around the first turn, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
launched a three wide bid around the final turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane, just missed out on place and finsihed clear over the rest. LIKE A
PRO was unhurried through early stages, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, hustled up three wide into the lane and improved position without
threatening. DECO STRONG chased the top trio through the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the final turn then flattened out. DAZZLE
ME raced off the pace, went two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. AVA'S CHARM was forwardly placed around the rn, showed early response
then steadily weakened. MARY'S JEWEL raced in contention along the inside around the first turn, saved ground to the final turn and steadily faded.

around the final turn, cut the corner into the lane, responded sharply under left handed pressure and pulled away. AWESOME GERRY chased up the
backstretch in range of the early leaders, headed in pursuit three wide entering the final turn, was no match for the clear winner in the lane but stayed on
with response and held place. HELIUM raced three wide around the first turn then sat off the early pace, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, stayed on
five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and just missed place. SWILL was unhurried out of the gate, rated off the early speed
then headed in pursuit late on the backstretch, steadied slightly nearing the quarter pole, ran on two wide into the lane then evened out. SCARRED angled
inside nearing the first turn, raced near midpack along the inside through the backstretch, went two wide into the lane and lacked late response. MOONLITE

range three wide around the fianl turn then failed to sustain bid into the lane. HEMP was forawrdly placed in striking range of the pacesetter, stayed on

contention then tipped outside of R ADIOS JERSEY turning for home and stayed on with response for second best. ALLWORTHY raced off the early pace,
hustled up around the far turn, went four wide into the lane, finished with response and gained show. CARAMEL SWIRL was forwardly placed in early
stages, launched a two wide bid for command leaving the backstretch, sustained a bid around the final turn then flattened out in the lane. MISS LESLIE

threatening. FABRICATE bobbled at the start, raced in the back, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, steadied inside late on the final turn, shifted out
three wide in the upper stretch and failed to move on. STREET LUTE tucked inside around the first turn, rated in range through early stages, launched a bid
near the quarter pole, stayed in contention around the final turn then gave way in the lane. COMPETITIVE SPEED raced off the pace, went two wide into
