Footnotes
NILES CHANNEL bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the turn, began a bid between horses nearing the three sixteenths pole, was forced to alter his route at the eighth pole when the hole in front of him
closed, and gained ground quickly on the rail to get up late. WILL YA WIN SUM dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn, swung wide and began a bid entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside and was caught late, the best of the rest. AGAVE KID bumped with the
horse to his inside leaving the gate, dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, raced evenly in upper
stretch and was outkicked from there. MANGO TREE raced off the pace in the early going, came around the turn in the two and three path and passed tiring
horses in the stretch. THREE AMIGOS (FR) dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle between horses in
upper stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. FRONTIER CHARLIE hopped up leaving the gate, chased the frontrunners on the inside in the opening
stages, moved up to press the pace between horses headed into the turn, raced in the two path from there and tired entering the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THERE IS NO SPLIT FOR THE OPENING QUARTER OF A MILE OF THIS RACE.

Footnotes
ZARMAE was keen into the first turn to prompt outside of CACHACO, led approaching the thirteen sixteenths and soon cleared, saved ground on the lead
through the far turn, held off POWERFUL MAN in upper stretch and drew off when driven midstretch. POWERFUL MAN came inward in the opening strides
and bumped TOM'S LAST GENERAL, chased near the rear through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, rallied up the rail around the far turn,
loomed in range into the lane, proved no match for ZARMAE from upper stretch, and chased on under a drive while drifting out. DOM CAETANO (ARG)
soon trailed, continued at the rear in the three path on the turn, shifted inside while driven in upper stretch, and passed inside of tiring horses while drifting
out. TOM'S LAST GENERAL was taken back early after bumping between horses in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse and
the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CACHACO was reluctant to load, was bumped
lightly by TOM'S LAST GENERAL in the opening strides, cleared briefly into the first turn but was soon confronted by ZARMAE, took pressure from that foe
to his outside around that bend, was headed by that foe near the thirteen sixteenths, tracked him down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn,
proved no match into the lane and emptied out between horses.

JUST BEN dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive.
MAGA COUNTRY raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and improved position down the lane while drifting in slightly near the eighth pole. CHOCOLATE BUNNY hit the gate leaving it, recovered to
track the frontrunners between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, raced into traffic and switched to an outside path near the eighth
pole and finished evenly from there. MUNCH dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn,
and gave way in the final furlong. BLOOMING GARDEN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the turn, and was outkicked on
the rail in the stretch. CHISLER was reluctant to load, broke poorly well behind the others, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to make up some
ground while racing in the two path around the turn and was not a threat. KING ZION raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path, began to drop back entering the stretch and continued to tire from there. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO
THE START OF THE SIX HORSE, CHISLER. ADDITONALLY, A TRAINERS OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE TRAINER OF THE THIRD PLACE
HORSE, CHOCOLATE BUNNY ON THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER, MAGA COUNTRY. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SAN STAR tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was asked into the lane and rallied, engaged outside of LUSCIOUS
midstretch, wrested the lead from that foe near the sixteenth mark and cleared. LUSCIOUS was sent clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn,
continued clear into the lane, was engaged midstretch by SAN STAR, reluctantly ceded the lead to that foe approaching the sixteenth, and kept on second
best. JOAN'S WAY broke outward, chased four wide toward the rear early, continued patiently in the four path on the turn, rallied four wide from upper
stretch, and got up for show between horses despite drifting out late. STACY ATTACK settled near the rear early, advanced to midpack into the turn,
chased in the three to four path around that bend, swung out five wide into upper stretch, rallied while drifting out, and was narrowly outkicked for the show.
MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start and broke outward, chased the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, continued
to pursue those two while racing in the two to three path on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair in upper stretch, flattened late and lost the show.
SHE'S SO CALI chased midpack down the backstretch, was relegated toward the rear while saving ground along the turn, swung three wide into upper
stretch, and lacked the needed rally while drifting out. FOX ABLE CHARLIE chased the leading pair inside of MISS HIGH N MIGHTY down the backstretch,
continued to chase on in the two path on the turn, and came up empty inside horses in the lane. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN settled near the rear three wide early,
continued between horses in the two to three path on the turn, and offered no rally. GOSHEN GIRL settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, and
offered no bid in the lane.

Footnotes
WILL KNOWS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter
pole, and gained ground on the outside to pull clear late. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, came around the turn in the two path, split horses and came through a tight hole coming into the stretch, gained ground between horses and was
caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. GUMWRAPPER pressed the pace in the early going, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the far turn,
continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late. NYOMAN broke a bit slowly and trailed the field up the backstretch on the outside, raced in the three
path around the turn, and improved position on the outside in late stretch. SOUTHSIDER dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, began to drop back entering the stretch and continued to fade from there. ROAD GAME chased the frontrunners on the outside up the
backstretch, began a mild bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and tired in the stretch.

GREEN MO'STER on the far turn and set a pressured pace around that bend, was also engaged by BENELUX three deep approaching the quarter, vied
inside of that foe into the lane, battled on past the eighth pole, could not hold BENELUX at bay from near the sixteenth and chased on second best.
BARLEEWON chased midfield through the clubhouse turn, continued patiently toward the rear of a well-strung field down the backstretch, improved in the
three path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, sustained his bid and got up for show in the final sixteenth. GATE CREW chased the leading
pair, took closer order inside of BENELUX while racing in the two path on the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch, chased on while no match for
