Footnotes
JUST PLUNGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off and was kept to the task. YADI hopped at the start,
looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. LEXATOGA tracked the pace well back, saved
ground through the turns, came through inside, then flattened out and held the show. NO TIME TO YAWN mid pack, saved ground through the second turn,
bid three wide into the stretch and got up for a share. BAHAMIAN PARK well placed and outside, held position through the second turn, then weakened in
the lane. MONTRICHARD was no factor. BETTER TAPIT was never involved.

A COTSWOLD VILLAGE well placed and outside, pulled to contention down the backstretch, gained a short lead on the two path through the turn, then
drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. ON BASE broke a step slowly from the gate, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane, then had a mild gain for the place. SCIENCE TO WIN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. PAWNBROKER well placed, gained position three wide into the second turn, held position through
the turn, bid into the lane and flattened out. DALLIANCE set the early pace off the rail, angled in and and lost some ground through the turn, then faded the
final furlong. CLAW well placed and inside, steadily lost ground and was eased over the wire.
