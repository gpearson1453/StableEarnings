dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. SHARP'S MISSION took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead, came
under pressure at the three eighths pole, raced with the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and just held on for second.
SUZIE Q SONDE rated close off the rail, started a bid at the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, finished well and just missed second.

while weakening on the far turn. LADY SPARROW stalked two deep then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back into the far turn and
weakened. CHOPRA saved ground. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BLACK STEEL took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and
held well with steady stretch handling. SUSPIROS stalked two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, was no
match in the lane but held on for second. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the
far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third and was gaining on the runner-up. BUZZHOUND saved ground just off the early pace, started a bid nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased outward into the lane and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GOOGLE IT became a
bit edgy in the gate and rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened on the
far turn. SCOTTISH MAN was not a factor. BURN THE SHIPS stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the
start of this race.

Footnotes
VOLNAY took an immediate lead to rate the pace inside, drew away past the three eighths pole and steadily increased her lead under a strong hand ride.
COLETTE'S SPIRIT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, proved no match for the winner and
settled for second best. FORT ZANNA saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and came along
for third mid-stretch. LOOKIN BACK stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
then flattened the final furlong. CHOSEN MISS saved ground racing well back then bid mildly approaching the three eighths pole. BOTTLE COURAGE
rounded the opening turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. OHH BEEHAVE rounded the first turn about the four
path and was not a factor. LANDYNONTHEMOON raced close off the rail the first turn then faded readily through the backstretch.

KALENJIN was hustled along near the rail to take the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail, drifted in the upper stretch but dug in to
the challenge of AT THE HALF mid-stretch and held on well, while the latter, chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, came inside the drifting winner
leaving the eighth pole and threatened mid-stretch, but relented later yards. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION chased off the rail, rounded the turn about the three
path and just lasted in third. UNDENIABLE TOUCH chased, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly outside. GARY DOING BIZ gave
chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more.

FIRE DOWN BELOW stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested the turn at a close disadvantage but drew to even terms
into the stretch, took the nod toward mid-stretch, raced clear from the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. PROTA rated a short lead inside, came under
pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met into the stretch, gave up the nod toward the sixteenth
pole and relented later yards. HOBE SOUND stalked from the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn and was along
for third later yards. CAPE LOOKOUT stumbled to his nose leaving the gate then rounded the opening turn in the five path, raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and ran evenly down the lane. HAN
SENSE rated close inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. AUTS
REVOLUTION rated just off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though,
weakened in the five path of the far turn. CASTLE BOUND rounded the first turn in the four path and raced well back.
