Footnotes
SHATTER ME was sent along early to set the early pace, was challenged by rivals nearing the quarter pole, dug in and held gamely through the stretch run
to be clear late under strong handling. TEXAS REWARD was allowed to settle early on, made a steady advance around the far turn, raced five deep into the
upper stretch and finished well to be second best. SPIRIT OR SPITE stalked the early pace down the backstretch, made quick three wide to challenge the
leader near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. ORIGINALY FROM DOT pressed the early pace and weakened in the lane while racing two to
three wide. CREATE A STORY was off slowly, raced towards the inside and had no late rally. TRINNI SUNSET dropped back in the early stages, raced four
wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.

THE AURELIA FACTOR stalked the early pace while racing near the inside, was coaxed along nearing the quarter pole, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole, dug in inside the eighth pole and proved best under strong encouragement. LIANA SUSQUEHANNA was allowed to settle off the early
pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, took aim on the leader nearing the eighth pole but couldn't get by to be a game second place finisher.
CULTURAL MANDATE dueled with Yeyetzi down the backstretch and weakened through the stretch run. YEYETZI dueled for the early lead and gave way
the final eighth of a mile. STATUS ASTHMATICUS was slow early on, raced five wide into the upper lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SWING was unhurried early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, moved up near the rail in the stretch run and finished well to get up
under strong encouragement. CHARGIN STORM stalked the early pace while racing near the inside, moved four to five wide into the upper stretch, raced
heads apart with Mobeatyabad at the eighth pole, dug in late but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages to finish second best. MOBEATYABAD
showed good early speed and weakened in the drive while racing four deep. ARRIVEDERLA was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, raced
four wide around the far turn and had no final winning bid. YABBA DABBA DUDE pressed the early leader from the inside and gave way the final eighth of a
mile. MR. ROUNDTREE dropped back early and failed to respond.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked the top pair while racing near the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide into the upper stretch, dug in late while
racing between rivals and just got up under all out pressure. DR. FERBER was allowed to settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and finished gamely to just miss. DREAMING OF CARATS sprinted clear in the early going, was rated down the backstretch, dug in but
gave way grudgingly in his final strides. RUNNER was unhurried early on, raced four to five wide through the lane and had no late rally. GALILEAN MOON
dropped back early, moved up five wide near the quarter pole, raced widest through the lane and had no response. DAMIR bobbled slightly at the break,
tracked the leader while racing just off the inside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

SEANOW was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early stages, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths pole and finished well to just get up in his
final strides under all out pressure. REDEEM EDDIE showed good early to set all the pace, raced just off the inside through the stretch, dug in late and just
missed in a game effort. ACE NINE NINE was slow early on, moved up along the inside through the stretch run but had not enough for the top pair.
ARCADIA CALLS was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. KING NEKIA was off very
slow, raced four deep near the quarter pole and never was a factor. MY BOY LENNY stumbled at the break, stalked the pace from the inside and retreated
through the lane.

Footnotes
SPLENDID VIEW stalked the early going, moved up three to four wide through the lane and finished well to draw clear late under strong handling. SEVEN
YEARS LATER stalked the pace, took command through the far turn, raced clear at the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages. HIGH
FRONTIER was allowed to settle early on, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. HOLD THAT GHOST was allowed to
settle off the pace, raced three deep through the drive and had no final winning bid. HOLIDAY CONNECTION stalked the early pace, moved up five wide
near the quarter pole and had no late response. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT pressed the pace from the inside and gave way. MISS ARTSY NOUVEAU was
off a step slow, rushed from the inside to set all the pace and tired readily in the stretch.
