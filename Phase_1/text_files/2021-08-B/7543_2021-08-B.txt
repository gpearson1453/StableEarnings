Footnotes
CAPTAIN DRAKE broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a clear advantage to the far turn, widened the advantage under firm
encouragement into the lane and was taken in hand once the issue was decided. LORING PARK, unhurried in early stages racing four wide to the
backstretch, continued three deep tracking the leader from just out of striking distance racing into the far turn and prevailed for the place honors late while
losing ground to the winner. TWILITE LIASON, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, steadily faded between foes
racing into the lane. EDGIE REGGIE tracked the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn while dropping into last and
had no late response.

Footnotes
LORD DRAGON, a bit slow into stride, was prompted to terms with the first flight three wide entering the backstretch, lost some ground to a rival racing into
the far turn, but continued with a steady effort to close the gap and prevail in time between foes under firm handling. BEAT THE HEAT settled last near the
inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position between foes on the far turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and produced his
best stride late to close the gap on the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. TIN BADGE, in touch with the pacesetter between foes prompting
that rival racing to the backstretch, took over on the far turn to go clear nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. DRAMA CHORUS, urged
to gain the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival to the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. GIANT
PAYDAY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn.

SPEEDY ENOUGH broke readily, tracked off the first flight dropping just out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out four wide advancing on the
leaders in tandem with a rival racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed
encouragement. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was rated off the first flight shifting off the inside racing to the turn, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to
bid for command three deep between foes nearing the sixteenth marker but couldn't match the winner's kick. SUMMER FIREFLYS, urged to the lead along
the rail, set the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival racing through the turn to upper stretch, was
headed nearing the furlong marker but continued well enough to regain some position in late stages while prevailing for a share. THE CHAMPS KID angled
inwards while being urged to prompt the pacesetter racing into the turn, gained the advantage between calls racing into upper stretch but faltered nearing
the sixteenth marker. BIRD FEATHER settled last along the inside early and never gained contention. I CINC EYE LUV U angled to the inside tracking off
the second flight racing to the turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

FRIENDLY AND KIND broke readily, conceded the lead to stalk just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing into the first turn, came through along the rail to
prompt the pacesetter on the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing the far turn, moved away to a clear advantage leaving the midway point of the far turn
on her own courage and came under hand urging through the stretch to maintain a safe advantage. NORTH OF EDEN tracked just off the pacesetter
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep while being urged to challenge for command racing into the far turn, couldn't match the
winner's kick but edged a rival for the place honors. SNEAKY DIANNE tracked off the first flight under rating along the inside to the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued with interest while being outkicked for second. SATTERSFIELD was urged to gain the lead from between foes racing
to the first turn, dictated the pace off the rail into the backstretch, briefly dueled for command between foes when challenged racing into the far turn but gave
out entering the stretch.

Footnotes
NORA'S LEGACY broke sharply from the gate, dictated the pace traveling on the inside throughout, prompted with right-handed encouragement past the
furlong marker and prevailed on the wire. WITHHERBOOTSON pressed the pace two wide in the early going, bid for the lead nearing the three eighths, lost
touch briefly with NORA'S LEGACY but was gaining in the final sixteenth and finished willingly to the wire. FLASH FLOOD settled on the rail, shifted out at
the quarter pole and had no late kick. ICYWILBURNYEH was slow into stride, tracked the pace three wide during the opening half, bid in the same path on
the far turn and failed to sustain the momentum in the stretch while weakening to hold on for a minor share. TEMPLES MON CHERI was off slowly and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PRINCE RAMA angled over to the inside to track off the early pacesetter, continued to travel well positioned through the bend then shifted out at the furlong
marker and edged by foe in the final yards under steady right-handed pressure. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY was hustled out to a clear lead down the
backstretch, led the field into the stretch then was put to steady left & right-handed pressure in the final furlong but was outfinished in the last yards.
GOLDEN GULLEY tracked the early pace just to the outside of the leader bid three wide nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. MAY WE
ALL was a bit slow into stride, moved up quickly to split foes at the half, slowly angled out four wide on the bend but had no late kick through the lane and
settled for a minor share. WATER PATROL was allowed to settle midpack on the outside, swung out five wide off the bend and had no late gain in the
stretch. GONE A LIL LU HU lacked early speed in the early stages and failed to menace in the stretch. HOT ARTIE bobbled shortly after the break then was
steadied off heals nearing the eleven sixteenths pole and proved no factor late.
