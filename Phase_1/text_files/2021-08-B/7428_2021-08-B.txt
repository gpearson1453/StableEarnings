Footnotes
AUDACIOUS ANTOINE rushed to the front, stayed clear while ridden out to wire. SUNSET AT MALLORY pressed and chased winner throughout, no match
late. CARDINAL BIRD unhurried to the turn, flew wide into the stretch run to be along for the show spot. MANDATORY MASK raced evenly while lacking a
late response in the stretch. LINE OF GOLD close up outside to turn, weakened in the stretch run. WATERBOY off slow, raced back to turn, improved
position only. WINE TIME pinched back start, never menaced. SIR NUISANCE never factored. BANE dropped far back.
