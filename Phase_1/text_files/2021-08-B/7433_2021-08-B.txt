Footnotes
SAVING ARGUMENT moved up to show the way past the wire the first time, dueled along the inside the middle half, shook off the other speed in the
second turn, responded when confronted by the runner up nearing midstretch, held that foe late in a determined effort. SANDBAGGER AL bumped at the
start, raced in mid pack early, advanced along the inside into contention late in the final turn, shifted out and tried the winner from the outside past the
furlong marker, could not get by to be outfinished in the late going. MUSICAL MAN unhurried early well out in the course, continued to be outrun up the
backstretch, dropped inside far turn, improved while saving ground into the straight, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. COCO'S
MAN void of speed, remained back into the far turn, raced in the two path through that bend, also improved position while not a serious threat to the top pair.
MISS JENNY'S HALO within striking distance, came up empty the final furlong. KISS OF THE WOLF bumped with the runner up at the break, set or forced
the pace for almost six furlongs while well wide, gave way in the drive. EASY TO MISS in mid pack for a half, faltered. MY TY FU PEG remained always
back. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

home, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept to task with a left handed crop. SOUTHPINE GIFT prompted the pace while racing three wide,
proved no match for the winner in the drive, narrowly gained the nod for the place. QUALITY PRODUCTION settled off the pace and the inside, came into
the stretch just off the inside, roused, long drive for the place spot, missed. OUTLAW X. pressed the winner from the two path for five furlongs and
weakened.l. CLEVER RACER broke out, remained back in failing to threaten while racing four wide. SUCH also broke out at the start, trailed throughout in

winner backstretch and through the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. CHARLIE G rank while racing in some traffic
first turn, chased the top two into the lane, finished up best of the rest. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN raced in the second flight while off the inside, closest to the
top two far turn, had little left for the drive. PORT O' CALL last away, saved ground to no avail in failing to menace. SPEEDOFTHESPEED forwardly placed

Footnotes
UNDERDOG broke with the field, fell back to race in the second flight, on the outside in the turn, four wide into the lane, outside bid past the furlong marker,
drew clear under pressure. NO QUARTER in the second group while racing toward the inside, moved closer with the winner exiting the turn, challenged
inside that rival and between horses with a furlong to run, proved no match late, clear for the place. THIRSTY WIND last away, remained unhurried up the
backstretch and through the turn, switched out for the drive, along for the show with a mild rally while not a threat to the two pair. CAPE TOWN WILLY
dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed as the top two were challenging approaching midstretch, could not match that pair to the wire,
caught late for the show. CAN IF I CAN broke out, chased the dueling leaders for a half and then faltered when the real running began at the head of the
lane. BIG BOSS MAN alternated up front closest to the inside for four furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
KIKI KAT lacked speed for three furlongs , came six wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, closed with good resolve while remaining widest through
the straight, just up for the dead heat at the wire. ROCKETT MAGIC off a step slow after breaking in the air, raced back early as a result, advanced four out
to five wide through the turn, set down for the drive, late bid between foes, dug in late go gain part of the win in a game effort. PRAYERS SAVED back off
the pace, raced between horses through much of the turn, cut the corner to reach the front well inside the top two, challenged with a furlong remaining, took
over, outkicked by the top two late. LA LA LATTE lacked speed, improved into the lane also while saving considerable more ground than the top pair,
dropped to the rail nearing midstretch, flattened out in the final furlong to finish up evenly. KASEN'S SISTER broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the
inside, slightly larger advantage into the straight, weakened when confronted soon after. MISS LINDA LOU settled in mid pack outside, came four wide and
between horses into the lane, angled in then lugged out past the furlong marker, lacked a closing kick. KIM'S PARRAIN within striking distance early, fell
back in the turn, failed to muster a rally. LA LOLA vied up front while between foes for three furlongs, gave way in the drive. HONOR AND RESPECT with
the pace three wide for three furlongs as well, stopped through the lane.

SOUL SONG broke well, showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn, kicked out to a larger advance when straightened for home, under a left
handed crop inside the furlong grounds, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire. NATEALYZE in the second flight off the inside, three wide through
the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, determined for the palce. FIFTY PROTECTION last to leave, raced back, four wide into the lane,
rallied, not enough for the place, clear of the others. YES BAB lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, improved position slightly in the run to the wire
without posing a serious threat. RUN AWAY SON closest to the winner for five furlongs off the inside, caved in the final furlong. HUFFS TAZ A BOO failed to
menace while saving ground. WHISKEY'S GONE steadily faded while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
BECCA'S ROCKET tracked the pace from along the inside, briefly waited while in traffic through the second turn, steered out three wide into the lane,
lodged a late bid between foes, dueled late, gained the nod at the wire. WATRUGONNADOKAREN stalked the pace three wide, continued to race forwardly
in the three path through the final turn, four wide into the straight, challenged late outside the winner, dueled the final sixteenth, narrowly missed the nod
while edging clear for the place. TECATE TIME last away, lacked speed, improved inside of some traffic into the lane, lodged a brief bid inside the top two
just inside the furlong marker, flattened out late when unable to match the top two. TOURRISTA closest to the leader, took over from that one midway on
the final turn, showed the way through upper stretch, vied between horses inside the furlong grounds, also weakened in the late going. GREAT IN RED
lacked speed, came five wide out of the final turn, lacked the needed response. KIDDO TOWN broke alertly, clear through the first turn, continued to show
the way up the backstretch, weakened when headed in the final turn. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE was never a threat. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL

Footnotes
GRACESSPECIALTOUCH broke alertly, set the early pace, dueled into and through the turn, shook well clear when straightened for home, kept to task.
CANDY'S PARADE raced in the main body outside, four wide out of the turn, rallied to finish willingly and be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner.
HOLY WAR headed up the second flight just off the inside, moved closest to the winner just inside the furlong marker, also proved no match for that one,
caught late for the second spot. FLOWERS APRIORITY moved up after the start to duel outside the winner late on the backstretch and through the turn,
first to blink into the lane, continued to weaken the final furlong. NOT ENOUGH BLING went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. AMELIA'S
ANGEL off a step slow, remained always. SHANGHAI HETTY steadily faded. APRIORITY LADY off a step slow, trailed throughout.
