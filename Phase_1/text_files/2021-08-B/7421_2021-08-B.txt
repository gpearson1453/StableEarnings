through mid stretch and won as much the best. THE DRAKE never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path and got up for second. SAN RULER stalked
the pace and went evenly. DOBBYS SOCK broke in front, set the pace into the far turn then weakened in deep stretch. TAPNGO failed to menace.

brushed and just missed hanging on. VALEROSO chased the early pace, dropped to the rail entering the turn, drifted out late and went evenly. DIAMOND

Footnotes
POMPEY'S RULE unhurried early, closed fast four wide to engage the leader entering the stretch, battled the balance of the trip and proved best in a stiff
drive two wide between rivals. BUBBA settled along the rail into the far turn, altered course five wide nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide to make the
lead in deep stretch and just missed hanging on. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER stalked the pace for a half, slipped through along the rail to make the lead
entering the far turn, set the pace into the stretch, dueled along the inside late but was outfinished. BOBBIE'S DERBY BOY far back from the start, passed
tiring rivals. FED XMAN chased the early pace from the four and five paths then gave way on the second turn. CLEAR WONDER close up for six furlongs,
stopped. WAR DOCTOR made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for five furlongs then stopped.

win going away. TURING MACHINE stalked the pace along the inside, advanced into the stretch and finished clear for second. PROMISES FOREVER
made the lead soon after the start, set the pace under pressure in the four path for five sixteenths, had speed into the stretch then weakened. BUYWON
GETWON vied for the early lead four wide and failed to respond. EXTRA SALSA pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened.
DREAMINOFJUSTICE void of early speed, was never close. NICE RIDE was through after a half.

LITTLE BITA SMOKE away alertly, set all the pace, drew clear late and jumped tracks nearing the wire. BRILLIANTBENNY pressed the pace three wide
and finished second best in the five path. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL never far back, loomed boldly along the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out then
back in and failed to sustain that bid. WESTERN HOPE bobbled then was in tight between horses at the start and failed to menace. VOLUME OF TRUST
well placed, faded in the stretch HAPPY TAKEOVER was no threat. JIMMYJEAN pressed the early pace along the inside and was through after a half. DUE
TO A TOTE MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS DECLARED A NON-WAGERING EVENT.

CHACO SPIRIT broke inward, was allowed to settle, slipped through along the rail entering the stretch, made the lead, drifted to the five path and won under
right handed urging. REBOPPER unhurried early, rallied late along the inside and finished clear for second. BREEZY MONEY stalked the pace into the
stretch, loomed boldly three wide then leveled off. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO chased the pace into the stretch, offered a bid four wide near the furlong marker
then came up empty. GRAND DEAL was outrun. OSBIN drifted out to the ten path at the start, quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace while getting
rapid fractions into the stretch then tired.
