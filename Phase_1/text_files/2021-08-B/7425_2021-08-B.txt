EXPRESS PERMISSION contended two wide, drew off for a clear lead entering the second turn and extended his lead to finish much the best. DEPUTY
KNIGHT was unhurried early, put in a steady effort to earn place and was no match for the winner. HIGH FLYIN TIGER bumped after the start, was never
far off the pace and had nothing left for the drive. RULING THAT STORM bumped after the start, saved ground, failed to contend and distanced the field.
MAGIC HUSSAR was through after a half, stopped and distanced the field. Hand timed.

MYSTIC REALITY pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch and drew clear. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE saved ground,
angled out for the drive and closed well late. REDACTION raced in the back, rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and finished well. CALL
WAITING set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and faltered near the sixteenth pole. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was never far back, offered a mild
bid only and failed to menace. SHE THINKS IM HOT failed to threaten in an even effort. Hand timed.

CHECK AND RAISE settled off the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, got up near the eighth
pole and drew off. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD vied to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and was no match late. ALBANY FRONT set a pressured pace,
faltered mid stretch and held safely for show, clearly best of the rest. INCLUDE HOO lacked a bid in a wide trip. CATS TOUCH stumbled at the start, raced
wide and lacked a response. RED CLEM was through early and stopped. Hand timed.

MATSON settled off the pace, rallied into the turn, assumed command between horses, drew clear and held under urging. PRIVATE JOKE raced mid pack
inside, shifted out for the drive, bid, hung late and finished second best. PLEASE DO TELL advanced to the second turn, challenged three across, swung
out, fell back and lasted for show. RUN FOREVER was hustled along the rail to set the pace with a clear lead, tired on the turn and faded. SMILING MATT
was outrun in a wide trip. JEN LORS LEGACY was through after a half and steadily dropped back. DELICIOUS was not a factor. Hand timed.

WRIGHT WINGED led throughout and held safely while kept to task. TWITTERATI raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn and didn't have enough
late. A CARD SHORT bobbled at the start to be away slowly, advanced inside on the turn and closed well to get up for show. BLACKBERRY LISA was
never far back, put in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. FAITH IN EXCESS was outrun in an even effort. BEAUTY BLACK broke out, pressed the
pace to the turn, fell back and faded. SINCERE WARNING stalked the pace to the turn and gave way. LIEUTENANT MARGIE was not a factor. The
