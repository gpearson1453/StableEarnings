Footnotes
FOOT RUB LOVE pressured the pace through the turn wresting a short lead in the four path upper stretch angling out to meet a late challenge answering
the call. WHAT A TART ranged up to bid three deep on the turn looming outside of rivals in upper stretch extending late only to be denied. LEA ME ALONE
hustled early inside dueled to put a head in front on the turn battling into upper stretch coming a bit short in the two path. FLORESITA chased the pace
through the turn fading into upper stretch. WOODY'S REWARD was always outrun.

pace through the turn angling four wide in upper stretch surging at the winner from the outside late. JOVIAL JOHN pressed the pace dueling along the
inside to upper stretch weakening late. STREET EDGE pressed the pace dueling between horses into upper stretch fading under pressure. ANYWHERE
ROAD slow early played no factor. BULLY DANCER raced mid pack tiring to upper stretch. BOB MAN sluggish early played no factor. ROARING OCEAN
was never involved. EARS UP gave way on the turn.
