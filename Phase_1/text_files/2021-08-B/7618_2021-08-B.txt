Footnotes
ELECTRIC RIDE showed early speed then dropped back a bit to stalk the pacesetter, bid outside leaving the backstretch, took over midway around the
turn, cleared approaching the quarter pole, put to strong hand urging leaving the bend, drew off in the lane and coasted home the last sixteenth.
VALENTINA GHADA stalked two wide through the turn, could not make any headway on the winner but stayed on for a clear second. MISS MATTIE B
brushed with rival at the start, went three deep into the turn, drifted in a bit at the eighth pole and lacked a bid. CAPTAIRE raced in range outside rival, took
the turn three to four wide and weakened. SEVEN EXES brushed with inner rival in the beginning, lacked early speed, navigated the turn five wide and was
not a factor. GRITTY GIRL was hard to load behind the gate, sped to the front and set the pace early, gained company leaving the backstretch, lost
command midway around the turn, chased the winner into the stretch and gave way.

turn, took over in upper stretch but got outkicked by the winner. MAGIC TIGER pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the quarter pole, held a short

moved out in the stretch and finished evenly. EQUIPO A broke in, set the pace under pressure from outside, lost command leaving the turn and weakened

BLAME IT ON ROSE stalked inside a pair of rivals to the turn, went for the lead when WE ALL AGREE lugged out on the turn, dueled leaving the bend,
cleared rival in upper stretch and drew away. BARSABAS stumbled a bit at the start, went four wide into the turn, angled in a bit then moved back out four
wide leaving the turn, rallied and gained the place. WE ALL AGREE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, lugged out on the turn, entered the stretch
seven wide, came back on in the stretch and gained third. CITY OF CHAMPIONS chased the speed three deep, carried six wide on the turn, dueled with
BLAME IT ON ROSE leaving the bend, lost touch with that rival in upper stretch and got edged for the show. PRINCE HUSSAR stalked between rivals
early, got carried five wide by WE ALL AGREE on the turn, angled back to the two path leaving the bend and could not rally. CUTE IMPACT tracked off the
inside, drifted out a bit then angled in on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked further response. IM STILL THIRSTY broke out a bit but was
quickly corrected, raced two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED WE ALL AGREE FROM THIRD TO FIFTH FOR LUGGING OUT AND INTERFERING WITH PRINCE HUSSAR ON THE TURN, COSTING
THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

LITTLE LILIANA dueled for the lead inside pair of rivals, cleared in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth, then drifted out late and was able to hold on.
KALON bumped with TONY ANN early, angled out and came four to five wide into the stretch, closed fast and got up at the wire. TONY ANN bumped
KALON early, stalked the speed on the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, came back to the rail in the lane, altered out from behind LITTLE
LILIANA midstretch, tried to put in a late run but lacked room and checked in the closing moments. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) raced up close between the top
pair, chased those rivals into the turn, traveled two wide then angled to four path leaving the bend, chased through the final furlong and needed to find more
late. TIERGARTEN came away slow, raced outside a rival at the back, went three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and improved position.
CHANTAL broke slow from the far outside, angled to the inside on the backstretch, exited the turn two wide and could not offer the needed response. DANI
MO was off slowest to begin, trailed on the inside and never made an impact. OPTIMAS stalked off the rail, went three to five wide around the turn and
weakened. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE dueled for the lead three deep up the backstretch, battled outside rival around the turn, and faded in the lane.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH LITTLE LILIANA DRIFTED OUT AND BOTHERED TONY ANN LATE, TONY
ANN WAS NOT COST A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
COLT FICTION dueled for the lead between rivals, inched ahead past the half-mile pole, carried a short lead into the stretch, drifted out through the lane
and brushed FASHIONABLY FAST and held gamely to the wire. FASHIONABLY FAST vied for the lead four deep early, kept the pressure on COLT
FICTION through the turn, got floated out and brushed in the stretch and continued gamely to the line. I GOT NO MUNNY vied for the lead three deep early
on, chased three then four wide on the turn, could not threaten the top pair in the final furlong but kept on willingly for a clear third. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE
chased on the inside then two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane but failed to threaten. TIGER DAD stumbled at the start, went up to duel from
inside, could not keep pace around the turn and weakened in the drive. FRATELLI threw his head as the gates opened then hopped, took the turn three
then four wide and failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT FRATELLI CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE
START BY THROWING HIS HEAD AS THE GATES OPENED AND THERFORE IS CONSIDERED A STARTER. THE STEWARDS ALSO REVIEWED
THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN COLT FICTION AND FASHIONABLY FAST AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH COLT FICTION DID DRIFT OUT AND
MAKE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH FASHIONABLY FAST, IT DID NOT ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY set the pace near the inside, saved ground into the stretch, roused with a furlong to go and remained clear with a tap of right-handed
urging late. SWISS SWOO (IRE) broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased on the inside then two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and held
second. GATES OF HEAVEN bumped leaving the gate, bumped with JAZZ HANDS repeatedly early, checked off the heels of that rival then altered in pat
the seven-sixteenths, saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly for the show. JAZZ HANDS off a bit slow to begin, bumped repeatedly early, ran up
behind rival and clipped heels past the seven-sixteenths, lacked room leaving the turn, angled to the inside and kept on for a minor award. THE HULK (GB)
bumped both sides at the start, went three deep on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and could not rally. CROSSWORD forwardly placed behind the
leader outside a pair of rivals, chased four wide into the lane and never rallied. SEA TO SUCCESS brushed inner rival at the start, raced in range outside
foes, took the turn four then five wide and lacked further response. MINSKY (IRE) raced up close between rivals, exited the bend three wide and weakened.
HONORARY DEGREE got bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside, angled out in the stretch and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT JAZZ HANDS CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS BY RUNNING UP BEHIND A RIVAL AND CLIPPING HEELS PAST THE
SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ROCKEFELLER went up to vie for the lead from inside, carried a short lead into the turn, cleared midway around the bend, coaxed into the stretch, drew
away then held safely in the final stages. PEC TACULAR chased outside a rival from off the pace, angled five wide into the lane, finished well and proved
second best. CABO SPIRIT raced in range between foes, angled in on the turn and saved ground to the stretch, then was along for the show. ENCODE
tracked the speedy trio three deep, angled four wide leaving the turn, kept on through the final furlong and filled out the superfecta. SOUTH STREET came
away to a slow beginning, traveled two then three wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and improved position. DURANTE vied for the lead between
foes, pressed the winner into the turn, chased two to three wide leaving the bend and weakened. UNION TRAIN was off slow to begin, raced off the pace,
driven two wide into the lane and failed to menace. HIDING THE BRICK away quickest from the gate, vied for the lead three deep up the backstretch, failed
to match strides around the turn, chased three wide into the drive and weakened. GET BACK GOLDIE angled in to chase along the rail into the turn, exited
the bend two wide and faded.

Footnotes
FRIAR'S ROAD stalked the leader from the two path, moved out on the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew
off. LUVLUV pulled and was hard to ride while between rivals in the early stages, advanced four wide on the final turn, rallied in the drive and bested the
rest. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS stalked the pace on the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and went between rivals, then got outkicked for the place honors.
LURE HIM IN broke out and bumped at the start, raced four then three wide around the first turn, traveled three deep in mid-pack, driven three wide into the
stretch and finished evenly late. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR moved to the inside early, angled out leaving the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, steered
out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally. LIBERAL (IRE) established the front quickly, controlled the pace up the backstretch, met bids around the far
turn, fought into the stretch and gave way. FARQUHAR got bumped leaving the gate, pulled a bit first time into the stretch, was closest in pursuit through the
early stages, put in a mild bid past the three-eighths pole, could not sustain the momentum around that turn and weakened. KAZAN (IRE) traveled outside a
pair of rivals at the back, angled in on the backstretch, angled back to the three path on the final turn, came out in the lane and could not rally. ROCKS AND
SALT settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out then back to the inside in the lane and lacked a rally. ME AND MR. C tracked
between foes in mid-pack, dropped back on the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
GINOBILI away quickly from inside then steered outside BRICKYARD RIDE, prompted the pace outside the leader, took over nearing the five-sixteenths,
cleared around the turn, drew away in upper stretch and held safely. C Z ROCKET unhurried in the beginning, took the turn three then four wide, finished
well outside FLAGSTAFF and edged that rival for second. FLAGSTAFF settled off the rail early on, advanced outside rivals five wide into the turn, angled in
a couple paths and was put to right-handed urging leaving the turn, failed to find the needed response in the final furlong and got outkicked for the place.
EIGHT RINGS stalked the top pair in the early stages, entered the turn three wide, shifted to the two path around the bend and kept on for a minor award.
CLASSIER traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn three wide, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. HOWBEIT broke out,
chased two wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and weakened. MO MOSA got bumped by SURFING STAR in the beginning, raced off the
pace, entered the turn along the inside, angled three wide around the turn and failed to menace. SURFING STAR bumped outside rival at the start, steadied
between rivals shortly after then was steered to the inside, trailed along the fence into the stretch, came out in the lane and was never a factor. BRICKYARD
RIDE ran off prior to the start then brought back to be reloaded. sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, set the pace with GINOBILI alongside, lost
command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, started to weaken on the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
U. S. DANGER dueled for the lead early outside a rival, cleared around the clubhouse turn, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, continued well
clear into the stretch and held under left-handed urging. VIKING PLUNDER checked early inside a rival first time in the stretch, angled out leaving the turn,
rallied late and kept gaining to the wire. I'LL STAND TALLER left the chute four wide, angled to the rail nearing the clubhouse turn, went outside a rival with
a quarter mile remaining, chased the winner through the final furlong but could not find more. CARMELITA'S MAN broke awkwardly, traveled two wide then
moved inside, went two wide into the lane, three wide in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. COOL YOUR JETS angled in leaving the chute,
moved inside first time through the stretch, remained inside the tipped out and split foes in upper stretch but could not rally. TREVOR T tracked in the two
path, came four wide into the lane, moved out five wide in upper stretch and could not rally. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS raced three wide early then moved to
the two path, exited the far turn three wide, four wide in upper stretch and also failed to rally. ZIP NOW sped to the front but was tossing his head and hard
to ride early, dueled into the clubhouse turn but was still rank and ceded the control, chase the pacesetter up the backstretch, saved ground into the drive
and faded. SINGLE ME OUT raced well off the rail into the stretch the first time, moved down to the two path while outside a rival, trailed a bit off the rail into
the stretch and had little left. REFUSE tucked inside early then a bit off the rail, raced off the rail on the backstretch, was eased around the far turn, pulled up
mid-stretch and walked off.
