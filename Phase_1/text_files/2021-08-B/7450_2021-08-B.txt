Footnotes
SONDE AFFAIR was bumped outward at the break then saved ground, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and steadily progressed off the rail
on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. TINA'S SONG took over leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the pace
inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, was met leaving the eighth pole then relented the final sixteenth.
CREATIVE SPLENDOR broke awkwardly, rated close about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then
dueled through the stretch for third. CASTLE'S TUFFY rated close off the rail the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, but bore out on the far
turn and flattened the final sixteenth. HOLY GLITTER was forced out at the break then dropped well back while saving ground, started a bid toward the five
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, though, showed little further. SISTER JOANN broke outward to make contact with Sonde Affair, ran four
wide on the first turn then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, faded into the far turn. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI stalked two deep, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the start of this race, though, found no actionable
infraction.

far turn near the rail, dug in through the lane and finished well while gaining on the winner. LONGSTORYLUCY settled back off the rail the first turn, picked
up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, raced outside into the stretch and finished well to take third
later yards. SAILING ROCK stalked off the rail, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then flattened inside the
eighth pole. MABEL rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced
three wide on the far turn, then flattened through the lane. RUN ON ENERGY stalked three wide the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
raced close two deep into the far turn, then weakened the final furlong. MACKENZIE'S STAR steadied early then settled off the pace in the two and three
paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadied off the heels of Sailing Rock approaching the quarter pole then weakened off the rail
on the far turn.

TOY TIGER was hustled to the front approaching the three eighths pole and rated the pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled
through the lane. TWO STEP SALLY chased and raced off the rail on the turn, then settled for second best. I B NASTY came away sharply with a brief early
lead then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, but flattened stride into the lane. JACK'S RUCA gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little further in the lane. WICKED WISDOM gave chase inside, though, never factored.
TIMEISGOLDEN dwelt at the break and raced well back.

in the five path of the far turn, left the turn outside and finished evenly while gaining on third. COUNTRY MAGIC saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the

Footnotes
CHARITABLE SPENNY took over at the mile marker and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the stretch. MOONLIT NIGHT rated close about the three path then bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. NORTHERN RIDGE rounded the first turn in the three path and settled
back leaving the second turn, started a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and was along for third inside the eighth
pole. JEFFERY SCOTT saved ground, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. RIP THORN raced in
the four path on the turns, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. ELLIE'S LIL MAN stalked the earlier pace two deep,
challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the backstretch, though, faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
BECOMING SMITTY rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, took the lead past the eighth pole and was all
out to last. DEPUTY JAMES rated just off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path, angled five wide into the stretch to get around the drifitng Winter Is Here, dug in to take second
in later yards and just missed. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the turn,
tried to squeeze through inside MINDYOURPSANDQS leaving the turn, angled outside that one past the eighth pole and nudged him for third the final
stride, while the latter, saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the turn near the rail, then nipped from third under the
wire. MIKI rounded the opening turn in the five path then settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the
far turn and finished well. WINTER IS HERE took over and angled to the inside past the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving
the half pole, raced clear off the rail on the far turn but drifted toward the head of the lane, continued close to mid-stretch but weakened the final sixteenth.
ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN raced in the four path the opening turn and was well off the pace leaving the turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the five path then weakened the final sixteenth. MINI BOLT steadied at the start and raced well back saving ground. ROCKET COLONY stalked
the pace two deep then challenged leaving the half mile pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter and faded on the far turn. LET'S GET STARTED
raced in the five path the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, checked sharply approaching the
quarter and gave way in the four path of the far turn.
