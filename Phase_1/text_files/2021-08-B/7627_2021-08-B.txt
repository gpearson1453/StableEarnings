Footnotes
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET showed good early speed to set all the pace, held a clear margin inside the eighth pole, dug in late and prevailed under all out
pressure. ICE OR FIRE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole,
closed in gamely late and just missed. HULA KING was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide around the far turn and showed good late interest.
KLAY NATION dropped back early on, moved up two to three wide through the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. C'MON JENNA pressed the early
leader while racing just off the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. HARDY CHISEL settled off the early going, raced towards the inside and had
no late response.

SUMMER APPARITION was allowed to settle early, made a steady advance around the far turn while racing near the inside, swung out four to five wide into
the upper stretch and finished well to be clear late under strong handling. QUICK TIME (GB) stalked the pace, moved up four wide four wide at the three
sixteenths pole but couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to be second best. LADY MOHICAN showed good early speed to set all the pace and
weakened a bit through the stretch run. LADY DOC was slow early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL
was forwardly placed early on, raced three to four wide through the lane and failed to sustain a bid.

DYNASTY OF HER OWN showed good early speed to set all the pace and prevailed late under all out pressure. TIP TOP GAL stalked the early pace,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and closed gamely to just miss. WARM SUMMER was allowed to settle early on, moved up two wide around the far
turn, raced near the rail in the stretch run and showed good late interest. DRAW ME dropped back early on, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and
had no final bid in the drive. TIZ FAKE NEWS raced up close early on, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and tired.

pace, raced for wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. SUNSET DRAGUNN stalked the early pace, raced three wide past the quarter pole,
angled in through the stretch to race near the rail and had not enough in the drive. SLAM DUNK SERMON dropped back early, raced four deep in the lane

Footnotes
SHERILINDA showed good early speed from the outside to set the pace, dug in late and held gamely under strong encouragement. SILK ROAD SALLY
stalked the early pace, moved up four wide through the lane and got up for the place position late. TOTALLY NORMAL stalked the pace along the inside
and finished willingly to the wire. STARS OF BLUEGRASS tracked the leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit in the latter stages. MADE IN
KAROO was slow early on, raced three wide around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. BORN TO REIGN stalked the pace, raced four wide into
the upper stretch and had no late winning bid. GOOD TIME DOLLY dropped back early and failed to respond. NORTHERN ROSE dropped back early,
raced four to five wide through the upper lane and failed to menace.
