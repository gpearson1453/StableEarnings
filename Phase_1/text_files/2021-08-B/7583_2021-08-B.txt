Footnotes
LOVE THAT WARRIOR stalked the dueling leaders in the three path, advanced to challenge into the stretch, dueled the final furlong while remaining
outside, was fully extended to prove narrowly best. EL WARD dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate for the advantage into and through the
final turn, briefly garnered a larger advantage into the lane, was joined by the winner soon after, dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end to narrowly
miss. AMBASSADOR HOUSE broke on top, dueled up front for three quarters closest to the inside, weakened through the stretch. DATSWHATILIKE last to
leave, trailed throughout in showing little. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE broke back off the early leaders, dropped inside and moved up to contest the pace onto the main track, held a slim lead turn, drew
out steadily through the lane under a hand ride to win ridden out. HICCUP lacked early foot outside, four wide through the turn, rallied down the middle of
the strip to earn the place, no threat to the winner. SHADY MONKEY broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, allowed the winner the inside when
onto the main track, vied with that one into the turn, proved no match in the drive, weakened a bit in the final furlong to be outkicked for the second spot,
saved the show. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH in hand early out of the chute, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. MR LEO forwardly placed for
a half, had little left for the drive. VALIANT DEFENDER last to leave, trailed while well wide up the backstretch, dropped toward the inside turn, remained
back in failing to rally.

CADILLAC RIDGE off a step behind the others, moved up steadily the opening furlong to be a forward factor on the outside into the turn, continued to
advance and challenged late in the bend, showed the way into the stretch, edged clear then held the runner up at bay the final furlong under a steady right
handed crop. TURF DANCER off the pace well out in the strip, came four wide for the drive, got closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little more with
that one while remaining well out in the strip, clearly second best. LUCKY LINDA broke on top, dueled early closest to the inside, began to weaken after a
quarter. SAKURA ALEXA dueled up front early in the two path, put the other speed away midway on the turn, was joined by the winner soon after, also
weakened when headed by that rival late in the bend.

Footnotes
MONZZA broke sharp, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, called on for some run midway the turn, shook off the other speed entering the stretch,
held the runner up at bay the final sixteenth under steady handling. BUBBA SMACK away in good order, fell well back off the pace in the run up the
backstretch and into the turn, advanced three wide late in the bend, angled sharply toward the inside, finished up willingly to be well clear for the place while
unable to reach the winner. FUNNY ACTOR moved up top pressed the winner in the two path, remained on equal terms with that one through the turn,
proved no match in the drive nor contain the runner up, salvaged the show. HESACALENDARBOY forwardly placed for a half while three wide, weakened in
the stretch run. IDE B STRANDED last to leave, void of speed in trailing much of the way, four wide out of the turn, picked off only a single tiring rival in
making minimal impact. PORQUE SI in the second flight closest to the inside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
LIVELY LEA away with the pack, slight encouragement to clear through the first turn, rated in setting a comfortable pace in the run up the backstretch,
salted away nearest pursuer turning for home, steadily increased advantage through the lane under steady handling. GRAND ISLE GIRL closest to the
winner early, fell back the middle half, came back for the runner up spot without threatening that same rival for the win. NON BINDING pressured the winner
up the backstretch and into the far turn, had little left for that one or the runner up in the drive, comfortably saved the show. GRACE FOREVER last away
but still broke with the field, trailed, picked off a tiring rival while never dangerous. BALOOK early move to race closest to the winner the middle four
furlongs, gave way in the second turn. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CYBER SNEAKER never far back while racing off the inside, advanced and took over when straightened for home while in the three path, drew well clear
under intermittent urging. US SECOND CUTE PIE bumped lightly at the start to be last away, void of speed in trailing for a half, began to move turning for
home and finished willingly with her belated rally to be clear of the rest, not a serious threat to the winner. VELLEITY bumped at the start, raced in mid pack
early, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest. PADIOLI bumped then bobbled just after the break, recovered to race forwardly early, took over to be
clear in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner turning for home and faltered when headed by that rival. MSCHITCHATTOUR broke out, bumped
PADIOLI, steadied, raced back and never menaced. SUNDAY'S GIFT closest to the early leader, continued to chase into the far turn, began to retreat soon
after, steadily faded through the lane while drifting out. BEAR THE MOMENT broke out, bumped VELLEITY, was straightened to race forwardly early,
stopped in the drive and jogged in late.

Footnotes
VENN in the second flight early along the inside, continued to track backstretch, shuffled back while continuing to save ground far turn, patiently handled,
slipped through along the inside to challenge into the lane, edged clear past the furlong marker and continued to slowly increase advantage under steady
handling. BEAUREGARD made an early move to press the issue late on the first turn, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, held a slim advantage
while being asked along late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, proved game for the place. BAYOU JAM void of speed, continued
to lag in the second turn, behind traffic late in that bend, continued to wait in upper stretch, got clear late and finished willingly to be getting to the runner up.
HALF OURS N STORMY within striking distance off the inside, advanced and challenged on the outside three to four wide turning for home, flattened out in
the run to the wire. ZION showed the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half, continued to vie far turn, had little left for the stretch run. STANDING
MAN bobbled and broke in to be last away, back early, closer before a half then began to gradually weaken thereafter. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT in mid pack
early, moved a bit closer while in the five path and widest turning for home, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. OPENING QUARTER MILE

Footnotes
LEYTON'S HIPPIE forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back after a quarter, steered out when beginning to advance out of the the turn, engaged the
leader from the outside with less than a furlong remaining, wore that rival down in a determined effort. TIGARD BABES dueled early off the inside, continued
to alternate through the turn, shook off the other speed to be briefly clear past the furlong marker, responded when challenged by the winner and proved
stubborn to the end. SHACK PARTOUT within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing response to finish up best of the rest
while not a threat to the top two. CRESCENT CITY CAT away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink, continued to weaken in the
drive. EXTRAPOLATOR last away, trailed while moving outside, raced four wide through and out of the turn, failed to muster a closing kick.
