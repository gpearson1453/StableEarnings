Footnotes
KENNEDIE SKY was pinched back at the start, trailed for a half, closed steadily two wide, made the lead past the furlong marker, drifted under left handed
urging and edged clear in the final yards. HEATHERFROMPHOENIX set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, was headed, regained command
nearing the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. FRIDAY stalked the pace four wide and went evenly. DARING
chased the pace four and five wide and lacked the needed response. WOLF EYES pressed the early pace two wide, put a head in front before a half, set
the pace into the far turn then came up empty. VELVET SAMI saved ground and was through after a half.
