drew alongside at the three-eighths, moved clear past the five-sixteenths, tested into the stretch, relinquished the lead outside the eighth pole and
weakened late while staying on for second. MITIGATION vied five deep into the first turn, taken back and angled in on the first turn, chased three wide into
the lane and went evenly late. TALKATIVE GAL bobbled a bit at the start, vied between foes into the first turn then pressed the pace from outside, was all
out through the far turn while losing ground and weakened in the late stages. BRIMAGE off slow and forced in at the start, settled at the back early, raced
two wide early then moved out on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and failed to menace. I'M A GIRAFFE vied along the rail into the first turn,
set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, got headed at the five-sixteenths pole and gave way inside. HAUTE LADY vied three deep into the
clubhouse turn, chased the top pair off the rail into the backstretch, eased on the far turn, coasted through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
ME B BUBBA T trailed early, advanced outside on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, rallied and got up
late. AMERICAN GREAT bumped leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, bumped between foes and lacked room behind the leader in upper
stretch, gained a clear path, then put in a late run and gained the place. PRINCE ZIGGY raced near the back of the pack early on, trailed three to four wide
into the stretch, steered widest in the lane and closed fast to earn the show honors. FIRE POLISH bumped both sides at the start, stalked in the two path
then moved up to duel into the far turn, held a narrow lead with a furlong to go and got outkicked in the final sixteenth. TIZ TACT TOE set the pace in the
early stages, dueled with FIRE POLISH on the second bend, lost the lead in upper stretch and stayed on while being overtaken. CIRCUMVENT stumbled
and bumped leaving the gate, tracked in the two path, got bumped on both sides in upper stretch and continued willingly between rivals in the late stages.
MOORE STREET WISE (IRE) bothered at the start, raced in mid-pack on the inside, bumped with outside rival in upper stretch and lacked room through the
lane, never gaining an opening.

Footnotes
ANMER HALL stalked the top pair early on, went three wide into the stretch, bid outside at the top of the stretch, dueled through the final furlong and was all
out to prevail. TREBBIANO dueled for the lead outside of TOWN BOY, put that rival away into the stretch, battled with ANMER HALL through the lane and
was outgamed in the late moments. LAW ABIDING had early speed then dropped back leaving the backstretch, angled out in the lane and put summoned a
mild late bid. RIVIERA CHAMP traveled off the pace, angled out into the stretch and improved position. CON ON THE RUN showed early speed from
outside, chased the top pair off the rail, went four wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. FROST ALERT coaxed along early, was in
tight along the inside, steadied at the five-sixteenths, continued in tight after, stayed along the inside into the lane, angled out in the stretch, and could not
rally. HYDRO FROST tracked off the rail, angled in on the turn, steered out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TOWN BOY dueled from inside, fought back
into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND AVENUE chased the top pair from outside early, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled with CATBERNAY on the turn and into
the stretch, fought through the lane and dug in to edge clear from the runner-up. CATBERNAY dueled for command early outside HALF RIGHT, put that
rival away at the five-sixteenths then met the challenge from CUMBERLAND AVENUE, held a short lead into the stretch, fought into the furlong grounds and
yielded grudgingly. TRIBAL WAR CHANT came away awkwardly at the start, chased the speed outside rivals, went four wide into the lane and was along
for the show. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA raced in range off the inside, entered the turn two wide, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. BLACK BELT stalked the top pair along the rail into the turn, exited the bend two wide and weakened. RAYRAY dropped back early, trailed three
wide into the stretch and made no impact. HALF RIGHT dueled for the lead along the inside, lost contact with five-sixteenths remaining, tired and was eased
to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HEAR MY PRAYER away quickly in the beginning, tracked BULLETPROOF ONE through the turn, bid outside with a furlong to go, got brushed by the
runner-up mid-stretch and proved best late. BULLETPROOF ONE sped clear from outside, crossed over to the two path, led a bit off the rail into the drive,
drifted out and brushed midstretch and went gamely to the line. RAYMUNDOS SECRET tracked the pace outside a rival, went two to three wide into the
lane, drifted in late and gained the show. RAKASSAH (IRE) stalked the pace on the inside, moved out in upper stretch, came back inside and finished
evenly. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) unhurried in the beginning on the inside, came off the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. CANDURA raced at the back
outside a rival, entered the lane two wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOUCHDOWN BROWN tucked inside early, moved off the rail leaving the first turn, went between on the backstretch, driven three wide into the stretch,
closed well and overhauled the runner-up. ATOMIC DROP sped clear and angled in around the first turn, inched away on the second bend, collared at the
sixteenth pole and settled for second best. HAPI HAPI stumbled at the start, lagged behind early, angled out on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch
and got up for the show. WILDER THAN MOST stumbled badly at the start, angled from the five path down to the two path around the first turn, continued
two wide into the stretch and got edged for the show. FLY THE SKY bumped from inside at the start, raced off the rail then outside a rival, three deep at the
five-sixteenths and weakened. WILSON MONK broke out and bumped rival at the start, was a bit hard to ride early on, coaxed along the rail through the far
turn and came up empty. CLUB CAL tracked off the rail, three deep at the four furlong marker, went four deep on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DEL MAR FLASH reserved in the early going and angled down to the two path, came out on the far turn, entered the stretch four wide, rallied four deep in
the final sixteenth and got up in time. AGREETODISAGREE raced three wide around the first turn, came four wide into the stretch, drew alongside the
leader past the eighth pole, led briefly late but got outclosed by the winner. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) tracked outside a rival, took aim three wide into the
lane, grabbed the lead in upper stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. LADY EMILY went two wide around the first turn, exited the far turn three wide,
rallied between in the stretch then inside a trio of rivals and lacked the needed late punch. ST HELENA hopped a bit at the start, steered in early, saved
ground into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. MIND MELD tracked the pace on the inside, two wide into the lane, moved back
to the rail in the drive and could not rally. EMMA'S DANCE was closest in pursuit in the early stages, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, cleared rival leaving
the turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened out. CHASINGSERENDIPITY broke a bit slow from outside, settled well off the pace, traveled outside
rivals on the backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, five wide into the lane and was not a factor. FRISCO FRILLS sped to the front and angled to the
rail on the clubhouse turn while opening up a comfortable lead, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside with five-sixteenths remaining,
could not keep up past the quarter pole, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.
