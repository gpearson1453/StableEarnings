RACING RIVER away alertly and eased of the dueling leaders entering the first turn to enjoy a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, shifted four wide into the lane, and closed determinedly to get up in time. BLACK METAL broke
sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BABY GRAND in the run down the
backstretch, assumed command soon after entering the final turn, and gave way grudgingly in the closing strides to just miss. MACHINE unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and passed a tiring rival while finishing four wide in the drive to garner a share. BABY
GRAND dueled for the lead from the outside of BLACK METAL entering the backstretch, continued to chase that rival into the final turn, but began to fade
leaving the turn, and had little to offer late.

ANAAMY away alertly and rushed to the lead from along the rail in the run to the turn, saved ground through the turn while turning back a challenge from
AMANDA, and had enough late to turn back another challenge from that same determined foe. AMANDA broke sharply and chased the leaders into the turn
while racing one out from the rail, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive while gaining late to prove clearly second best. KIKI MY STAR chased the
leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, was no match for the top pair, and finished three wide in the drive to hold on for a share. JERSEY
POINT lacked the early speed to contend in the run to the turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished with some late interest from just off the rail in
the drive. COUNTRY COWBOY away well, but was unable to keep pace with the leaders in the run to the turn, raced one out from the rail through the turn,
and finished four wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact.

SMART LAD broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rain in the run down the

away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn from
the outside of SMART LAD, and tired slightly late while drifting four wide in deep stretch to garner a share. CHASE THE SUN tracked the contested pace
while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the
rail in the drive to get up for the place. BOLD AS BRASS stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch,

Footnotes
FRANKIE MACHINE away well and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the contested early pace, began to advanced smartly soon after entering the
backstretch, took control approaching the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and was outfinished late while holding on for a share. BAKTURA broke
sharply and stalked the dueling leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied
two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. FINDING WAYS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken approaching the final turn, and faded over
the final furlong. FREE FOR SURE settled off the early contested pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid
three wide entering the final turn, was no match for the winner entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best.
MCMURPHY dueled for the lead from the outside of FINDING WAYS through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide through the
second turn and into the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on that rival midway to the final turn, and steadily retreated. SET TO SHINE settled well off
the fast early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time well off the leaders in the run down the backstretch,
mounted a sharp bid four wide through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane and quickly drew off as much the best. FORT LANGLEY
unhurried early while trailing the field through the stretch the first time, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
TIZ MEOW broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of EUROPEAN entering he first turn, continued to battled with that rival through the final
turn, got the better of that pace rival late, and held off a late surge by DAKATI to prevail. DAKATI chased the leaders three wide entering the first turn,
before settling into a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide
entering the lane, and closed determinedly to just miss. EUROPEAN away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from the inside of TIZ MEOW in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, continued to battle for the lead to mid stretch, but
was outfinished late. MARTELLO chased the leaders four wide into the first turn, before dropping into a stalking trip three wide entering the backstretch,
dropped to the rail midway down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
COUNTESS CAT broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, pressed the leader two wide in the run to the final
turn and through the turn, and closed willingly two wide from between rivals to prevail. GOLD POST away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to just
miss. CERTIFIABLE stalked the leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped
three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss. SNOWSHOES settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the first turn, was carried
extremely wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. MUD POET
unhurried early and settled at the back of the pack entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest
one out from the rail in the drive. SOUTHERN LASS away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. BLUEBERRY HONEY was off to an awkward start, and trailed the field early, moved up from along
the inside entering the first turn, then drifted five wide entering the backstretch, while forcing SNOWSHOES extremely wide, rallied four wide into the turn,
but had little left for the final furlong. MANDY MAGIC settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the first turn, steadied briefly leaving the turn when
BLUEBERRY HONEY drifted into her path, began to drop back soon after entering he backstretch and had nothing to offer late. A stewards inquiry into the
start of the race, in particular to BLUEBERRY HONEY, resulted in no action being taken.

HIGHWAY BOSS settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering he final turn,
tipped three wide leaving the turn, and assumed command soon after straightening for home, and held WICKED FORTITUDE safely at bay late under
steady urging. WICKED FORTITUDE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in deep stretch to get up for the place in a solid effort. THE CHANCES R broke sharply and
pressed the pace from the outside of AVE'S IN COMMAND entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival through the
final turn, put away that foe leaving the turn but was quickly overhauled by HIGHWAY BOSS, and was outfinished in the closing strides. APPELLANT away
well, but was taken in hand and dropped back to trail while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and
finished four wide in the drive. AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but weakened in the stretch drive.
