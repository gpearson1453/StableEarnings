TW SKIPPING STONES vied inside to the turn, drew clear and extended the lead while under urging. EL PATRON JET vied two across, fell back entering
the stretch, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. SOLEROCKER stalked the pace, rallied three wide on the turn to loom a threat, fell back
and finished evenly. MANCUSO AT THE MIC veered out at the start, raced close to the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, dropped back and leveled off.
TIGER'S SONG broke slowly and trailed the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
GOLD TREASURE saved ground, bid off the rail, closed steadily and wore down her rival to get up late. PRIVATE JOKE vied inside to the second turn,
drew clear, led past the sixteenth pole and was outclosed. VICTORY LANE was unhurried early and trailed the field, advanced around the turn, bid six wide
and closed well to earn show. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE settled off the pace in a good position, was roused on the far turn, had nothing left and faded through
the stretch. SUCCESS RATE vied two across to the second turn, tired and gave way. ZERO SUM GAME was not a factor. Hand timed.

CHEROKEE PAPOOSE was reluctant to load, dueled throughout and proved best in a long drive. SPEEDY GIGI was squeezed at the start, moved up
inside, challenged leaving turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. SARAH'S STAR was void of early speed, finished well and
got up for show. FICTIONAL pressed the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. TWIRLY GIRL showed speed to the turn and gave way.
FICETY LADY broke in, raced in the back and lacked a bid. Hand timed.

KING LEBRON vied to mid stretch and drew clear. THIRTY SECONDS OUT pressed the pace while racing inside, bid willingly to contend and was no
match late. OUTLAW BY NATURE raced mid pack inside, angled out for the drive and closed to get up for show. MY FUNNY GAL raced close to the pace,
lacked the needed late response and was caught for third. MY EXPRESSION vied to the turn, dropped back and faded. BLUES RAPPER failed to threaten
in an even effort. BAJA BRIDGE vied to the turn and gave way. BLOWIN SMOKE was not a factor. SHE THINKS IM HOT trailed the field. Hand timed.
