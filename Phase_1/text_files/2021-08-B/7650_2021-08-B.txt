SPEEDY TRIP showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and held gamely through the drive to be clear under steady handling. AMITY
HARBOR stalked the early pace from the outside, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished second best. SCRATCHY APACHE stalked the early
going while racing just off the inside, moved up three wide between rivals in the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. SMOKE STACK was forwardly
placed to lay up close early on, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. ADD ON was allowed to settled in the
early stages, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. VASO was off slowly and trailed throughout.

C'MON MAN stalked the early pace, moved up two wide around the far turn, angled out four wide through the stretch and finished well to be clear under
strong handling. NUESTRO ENGREIDO pressed the early leader from the outside, raced two to three deep through the drive and couldn't hold off winner to
finish second best. VINNIEBOB vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. IL BELLATOR stalked the early going from
the outside, made a steady advance towards the leaders around the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
SLOOP JOHN B was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. INSTIGATE was off a step slow, raced four wide
past the quarter pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
WHOA NESSIE tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing just off the inside, took command into the upper stretch, shifted in near the
eighth pole, forced Going to Shabooms to take up and finished well late to be clear under strong encouragement. IMPERIAL CREED stalked the early pace,
moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. REV REE stalked the early going, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole,
raced between rivals while racing two wide in the drive and had not enough late. GOING TO SHABOOMS showed good early speed to set a uncontested
early pace, took up near the eighth pole and weakened a bit late. Stewards reviewed the stretch run and ruled no change. WIND TARTARE (FR) was
unhurried early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. YANGTZE RIVER settled off the early pace, raced towards the
inside and had no response.

ELUSIVE VIRTUE showed good early speed and drew off to be well clear late under steady handling. COJO was hustled along to lay up close early on,
raced two to three wide but was no match for the winner. COLONEL MIKE dropped back early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and raced along
for third place through the drive. EL CHARRO CHAMP stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four deep through the lane and had no final winning
bid. SOUL PRODIGY dropped back early on, raced three deep near the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and never was a factor. THELUTEISMINE
stalked the the top trio early, raced towards the inside and had no late response. LOOKIN FOR GOLD was slow early, raced six deep near the three
sixteenths pole and never was a factor. TIME IS GONE failed to sustain a bid.

FRIDAY'S AT SHADY was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack early, made a steady advance around the far turn, raced five deep near the three
sixteenths pole and finished gamely to get up under strong encouragement. POUR ON THE COLE was forwarded placed to lay up close early on, raced two
deep through the stretch drive and finished willingly to the wire. DUB TOWN stalked the early pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, waited
near the three sixteenths pole and made a good rail bid through the drive. RUNKERRY showed good early speed to set the early pace from the outside and
weakened a bit in the latter stages. BUILDER threw his head early as being attempted to be rated down, stalked the early going, raced four wide near the
eighth pole and had no final winning bid. GALLANT WARREN settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. ARCH PRINCE
hopped at the break, settled to the back early on, raced six deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. RIVER ROSE stalked the early pace, raced
four dep near the quarter pole and never was a factor. THE LITTLE H MAN failed to respond. The photo finish was manually inputted and confirmed by the
stewards.

QICK QUACK QUO was allowed to settle early on, made a good bid nearing the quarter pole, raced three to four wide through the stretch run and got up
under all out pressure. SPECIAL MISSION showed good early speed to set all the pace, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. ROBIE pressed the
early leader, raced two while racing between rivals in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. CLASSIC PRESENCE was unhurried early, raced
three deep near the quarter pole and showed good late interest. STORMY THUNDER stalked the early going, raced towards the inside and had no final
winning bid. DIAMOND DATA raced six wide around the first turn, settled off the early going, was five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.
POGO raced four deep around the first turn, stalked the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CASTLE DONOVAN LAD was reluctant to load,
