Footnotes
LADY MAGNA pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, took over entering the stretch and
held her margin to the wire. WINNING QUALITY hit the gate leaving it, settled in behind the leaders to run between horses up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. SACRED STORM tracked the leaders
on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly.
TAPALONG hopped up leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and faded on the rail in the final furlong.
REND LAKE BABY stalked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while drifting out to the three path around
the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
NAUGHTYNAUGHTY was placed on the lead, saved ground on the turn while clear, opened up slightly more when pushed along in upper stretch, went to a
brief drive near the furlong mark, and remained clear while hand ridden late. SIMPLY COMPLICATED stalked outside and just behind the leader down the
backstretch, tracked the pacesetter while positioned two wide on the turn, continued to chase the leader while driven from upper stretch, could not reel her
in but kept on evenly late to prove second best. ANGIE'S REVRAC chased the leading pair down the backstretch while under a tight early hold, chased in
the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. MY BACK PAGES floated out in the opening strides, settled at the
rear, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive near the three eighths, raced into the lane in the three path, drifted out slightly under a
continued drive, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
SWEET N SASSY was reluctant to load, veered sharply inward in the opening strides but was corrected before hitting the rail, was outsprinted to the lead by
CLEVER KITTEN, switched two wide approaching the half, bid between horses on the turn, led approaching the five sixteenths, cleared into the stretch,
kept on while drifting out and ultimately held sway to the wire. OEUVRE chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the four to five path on the turn,
took closer order from near the three eighths, bid three wide into the lane, chased the leader under a drive, improved inside of her late but could not catch
her in time. MODERNISM broke inward and hit the gate, settled at the rear early, improved in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane,
kicked on well in the final furlong and narrowly missed the place. JOURNEYIST settled near the rear outside of ISLE OF GRACE early, was urged into the
turn but continued toward the rear in the five to six path around the bend, came into the lane six wide, rallied willingly into the final furlong but was outkicked
for the show. ISLE OF GRACE settled near the rear inside of JOURNEYIST down the backstretch, chased in the two to three path on the turn, swung into
the lane in the four path, lacked the needed kick to challenge the leaders but passed tiring horses in the final furlong. LAURA'S CHARM attended the pace
three wide, was in range in the four path on the far turn to the five sixteenths, began to weaken approaching the turn for home and faded two wide in the
lane. CLEVER KITTEN was reluctant to load, broke sharply yet inward, sent clear early, set the pace down the backstretch, took pressure approaching the
turn, was headed by SWEET N SASSY nearing the five sixteenths, proved no match and faded inside.

Footnotes
POWER THROUGH dueled for the lead from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear approaching the three sixteenths pole, and
held off a late closer under a drive. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN raced between horses in the middle of the pack in the early going, raced in the three path
around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and continued to gain to the wire. DASTARDLY DEEDS stalked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and was outkicked in the final furlong. HE'S WILD raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, ran into traffic with a furlong to go, found room and improved position in
late stretch. MOMMAS BOY OTIS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and weakened
further in the final furlong. DREAM ATTACK raced off the pace between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground mildly
between horses in late stretch. THE LAST FACT chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
weakened in the stretch. DASH TO THE CASH hopped up leaving the gate, raced inside at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile,
saved ground around the turn and was never a threat. B G ATTACK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn
from the three and four path and faded down the lane. GOOD YEGG was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch
and around the turn and was never a factor. MEDAL KING veered in leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three and four path and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM tracked the leading trio, continued in range two wide on the far turn, swung into the lane into the five path under a drive, and rallied four wide
well enough to get her nose on the wire in the final jump. SMACK was fractious in the gate, prompted the pace outside of NORTHERN ALLIANCE, raced
keenly while racing just outside the leader down the backstretch, encroached outside the pacesetter while racing in the three path on the far turn, headed
her near the quarter, kicked clear approaching the furlong pole, kept on under a drive but was caught in the last stride. WINDY CITY GIRL was anxious in
the gate, settled at the rear early, rallied three wide around the far turn, floated into the lane in the six to seven path, sustained her rally and gained with
good interest to the finish. ZANDREA'S tracked the pace in the pocket through the clubhouse turn, continued just behind the leading pair down the back
straight, saved ground through the far turn, was driven for a bid inside of NORTHERN ALLIANCE into upper stretch, was outkicked by SMACK approaching
the furlong pole, but continued to chase willingly to the wire. NORTHERN ALLIANCE soon led inside, set the pace while prompted by SMACK, took
increased pressure from that foe while leading in the two path on the far turn, was headed near the quarter pole, raced into the lane between horses in the
leading flight, and flattened out approaching the furlong mark. EYE ON THE FINISH was fractious in the gate, settled in second last, was pushed along
while saving ground around the far turn, offered no rally, and had no further response when driven in the lane.
