Footnotes
MO AND GO broke in the air, close up along the two path, took the rail midway on the last turn, appeared to be blocked into the stretch, eased out, asked,
gained and got the job done. ARMANDO'S TEAM unhurried five wide early, began to gain four wide on the last turn, drifted in nearing the furlong marker,
responded and was along in time. KINGFISH forced out midway on the first turn by TRY'N SMART'N UP, four wide after that, five wide into the lane and
rallied. BLOOD MOON gained six wide up the backstretch, challenged midway on the last turn, battled in the lane and faded. ENGINEERS REPORT
contested the lead along the rail, battled inside in the lane and faded. CLASSY PAPA forced the issue along the three path, lodged a bid into the lane,
appeared to be blocked in upper stretch, jostled while between rivals, took up sharply and lost all chance. BUC'S INVESTMINT well placed four wide, three
path on the last turn and tired. TRY'N SMART'N UP bore out midway on the first turn bothering KINGFISH, rushed up along the fence up the backstretch,
took up at the half mile pole and dropped out of it on the last turn. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no change.

Footnotes
THIS CAT CAN FLY in hand along the three path, two path into the last turn, began to gain into the lane, reached leader a furlong out, battled and under
pressure proved best. CHOWDA away best, vied for the lead along the rail, kicked clear on the last turn, was collared a furlong out, battled inside and
finished gamely. RUN FOR BOSTON lagged back along the rail, gained inside into the lane, altered out late and finished with interest. I LOVE JAXSON in
hand four wide tracking the leaders up the backstretch, three path into the last turn, angled wide and tired. CORAGESCONTENDER fractious in the gate,
four wide after a half to the top of the lane and tired. DANEBURY contested the lead along the three path and was done on the last turn.

Footnotes
FED FEVER in hand along the three path, gained on the turn, eased out, reached the leader in gear and drew off. STONE HEART tracked along the three
path, took charge in the lane and then finished well to best the rest. DREMAS BOY broke slow, gained four wide into the lane and made a late wide bid.
TAKE YOUR PLACE well placed four wide early, three path between nearing the quarter pole and weakened. NO ENTIENDO saved ground and then
altered out late while never in it. MARGARITA SUNRISE set the pace, was hooked and gave way. HOARD trailed without mishap.
