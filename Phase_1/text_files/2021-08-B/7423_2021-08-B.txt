Footnotes
WIN LIKE COACH P settled at the rear racing outside, was forced to go six to seven wide on the turn, unleased a furious late rally to drive past. DESERT
GHOST set the pace racing off the rail, was challenged by an outside foe nearing the five-sixteenths, dueled inside that one but in the two path, held that foe
at bay but was outkicked by the winner. DANI'S CAT stalked in the early stages, moved up three to four wide on the turn to duel for the lead at the
five-sixteenths, was held at bay in the lane. NOWORRIESTODAY was forwardly-placed chasing inside, saved ground on the turn, came out for the drive,
was no match but kept on for the minor award. MARIA'S TOWER shifted in early, went two to three wide on the turn and ran on evenly. WONTONTOMATO
was mid-pack near the inside, came out four wide by the end of the turn, failed to rally. HEMATITE was off the pace early, went five to six wide on the turn
and failed to rally. SPICEY SECRET was coaxed forward, chased three to four wide, came up empty. BRILLIANT BEAUTY failed to threaten while racing
inside. LETHAL ENTITY broke through the gate, raced toward the rear four to five wide, failed to menace. CANDY CARMA broke a step slowly, moved up
close to the leaders while moving out early on the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, faded.

Footnotes
SILVER PONZI was very lightly bumped at the break then coaxed forward to set the pace, saved ground on or just off the rail, edged clear into mid-stretch
and held off a late challenge. DIABOLICAL MIGHT chased from outside early, went four to five wide on the turn, had a lot to do in the stretch, gained
steadily but ran out of ground. JOHNNY'S BANDIT shifted in early, tracked two to three wide on the turn, carried on evenly. REGGIE J contended early,
went three to four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. SANTIAGO'S TOWER bumped an inside foe lightly at the break, chased
inside on or just off the rail, failed to rally. MORE FIREWATER bumped a rival and steadied at the start, moved in to go three to four wide on the turn, ran
on. RIO SAND DANCER was off the leaders early, went four to five wide on the turn, failed to make a bid. SEVEN ROONEY was bumped at the break, went
five to six wide on the turn and was never a threat. BRIEF WHO was floated six to seven wide on the turn outside a rival, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, was
unable to menace. TRUST MANDO raced two wide into the turn, shifted six wide by the mid-point of that bend, was not a threat. SIXTH GEAR broke a step
slowly and steadied at the start, went two wide on the turn, was not a factor. BANISTER was outrun racing two to three deep.

Footnotes
RINESHAFT was urged forward after the start, pressed the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn contending for the lead, edged clear under
steady handling. LITIGATOR set the early tempo, was then challenged by an outside rival while going on or just off the rail through the turn, was outkicked
but clearly second best. JUGGLES pursued the leaders from outside, went four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DAN WHO switched out up
the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, swung out seven deep turning for home, improved position. NEXTPORTOFCALL failed to rally after
going three to four wide on the turn. MR LEVI CANYON broke outwardly then was taken hold and shifted in after the start, went two wide on the turn, failed
to rally. AGRONOMO shifted in heading up the backstretch then to the rail entering the turn, saved ground but came up empty for the drive. LOPIN JOE
saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn, shifted in about the three-sixteenths but lacking room altered back out at the furlong marker, failed to
make a bid. BESITOS CRIMINALES broke awkwardly, was along the inside heading into the turn but forced to alter outside a rival, went three to four wide
on that bend and was not a threat. BEHOLD'S HOTTIE switched out early, went four to five wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
OUR SOARING ANGEL broke outwardly, went five wide on the turn, exchanged a very light brush in mid- to late-stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and
edged past. OVERTIDE set the pace under early pressure, saved ground on the turn, led till a sixteenth out, was outkicked but saved the place.
DANCINSTARDUSTLADY was forwardly-placed outside the rivals chasing four wide into the turn, made a mild bid between foes and exchanged a very light
brush in mid- to late-stretch, had no extra. BELLA Y SOFIA settled off the pace, went three to four wide through the turn, had much to do in the stretch but
was flying late. SINGING ARROW angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground along the inside through the turn, ran on mildly. BOSSY BABY had brief
foot chasing the leader, went two to three wide on the turn and weakened. BETTER DIALHOMME failed to rally after going five wide on the turn. FI FI
D'ORO advanced past a few rivals three wide on the turn, flattened out. K J'S MARK shifted in early, came out three wide on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
RIVER JUMPER set the pace inside facing some pressure, drew clear into mid-stretch, held safe. AMY'S HONEY moved out three to five wide on the turn,
was gaining in deep stretch but too late. ZONNA stalked the pace three to four wide, shifted inside a rival past the quarter pole, went evenly in the lane.
CAROLS BOUTIQUE settled well back, went two to three wide on the turn, improved position in the stretch. LITTLE PET KITTY was widest going five to six
deep on the turn, ran on mildly. OUR NATIVE ANGEL moved in from five to four wide on the turn, shifted in two deep in upper stretch, weakened. PASSION
RIDE failed to threaten while saving ground. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER pressed outside the winner two to three wide, drifted five wide into upper stretch,
gave way. IM COMING OVER chased briefly, was eased and walked off. FOLLOWING TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AUTUMN TOUCH was reluctant to load, stalked from outside, moved four wide to make a bid, took a narrow lead in the stretch, lugged in late and edged
away. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL stalked the pace, moved to a narrow lead three wide at the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in the stretch, fought on, was
forced in late and outfnished. PASSION BELLE saved ground inside, fought for show honors. LATENITE SLEWZY shifted in early to go two to three wide on
the turn, was outfinished for third. OUR TIME TO SHINE chased, lost ground on the turn, shifted out from two to four wide on that bend, kept on in the lane.
DIXIE JEN went five wide on the turn, needed more late. MS HIGHSPEED went five to six wide on the turn, passed tired rivals. THE TIME'S RIGHT broke a
step slowly, went two to three wide and failed to threaten. POW WOW was urged forward, set a pressured pace inside, gave way. REBEL RYETTE pressed
from outside two wide, came up empty. CURL chased three wide, steadily retreated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF SHOULDABEENACOWGAL AGAINST AUTUMN TOUCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SEEKARAP advanced outside rivals heading up the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn, drifted in through mid-stretch while dueling, prevailed.
FLAXY LADY went four to five wide on the turn, was carried in through the stretch dueling with the winner but was outfinished. SHUG'S BEST set the early
tempo then vied for the lead on or just off the rail, lost ground on a rival on the turn but kept on in the lane. SUZY Q saved ground inside, faced a little bit of
traffic in mid-to late-stretch but kept on well. PINK SKY pressed the early pace, moved clear early on the turn, weakened in the stretch and was not
persevered with late. SHESAPACKINPUNCHES lacked early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, passed tired rivals. NOBODY KNOWS WHO chased
early, went two to four wide on the turn, came up empty. DONNA WHO broke a bit awkwardly, went two to three wide on the turn, was not a threat.

Footnotes
MOSTLY CLOUDY got away alertly, set the pace from off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, drew clear and held sway. BUMBLEBEE was off the
pace early, went four to six wide on the turn, rallied for place. LOTTA GUSTO lacked early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, gained late. BULLY
RIDE chased three wide, dropped back losing ground but kept on in the late stages to share show honors. W F RIP TIDE chased early, raced on or just off
the rail through the turn, needed more. TESTING THE WATERS went in the two path on the turn, came out a bit in mid-str, ran on evenly. FULL SUN failed
to threaten after going three to four wide on the turn. MR. FEARLESS saved ground to no avail. YOU BUG ME was up close chasing early two wide, moved
out five wide on the turn, came up empty. LESTER'S MEMORY chased the eventual winner from outside four wide, faltered and faded.
