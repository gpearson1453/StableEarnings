SELLING OUT well rated rallied on the far turn taking aim outside the leaders in upper stretch powering clear in the four path. NOBODY MOVE gained on
the backside dueling to put a head in front on the far turn edging clear on the inside in upper stretch digging in from the two and three paths being
overwhelmed late. IZAPICKLER advanced to pressure on the backside dueling abreast rival on the far turn, extending between horses in upper stretch
would wear out. BLAME THE KIDS slow early played no factor. WE WILL SHINE was never involved. SKY PILOT hustled on the early lead was spent
entering the far turn.
