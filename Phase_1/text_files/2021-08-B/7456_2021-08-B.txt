Footnotes
GROOVY HUEY tracked the leader from inside, came out on the turn to be three wide at the quarter pole, struck the lead a furlong from home, edged clear
then held. RED HURRICANE was forwardly-positioned early, went two wide on the turn, came out in mid-stretch, gained slowly but steadily on the leader
but needed more. SUPER HUNK sped clear early to dictate terms from off the fence, raced in the two path on the turn, weakened in the lane. IMAGINARY
RIDE chased the leader from outside going three to four wide on the turn, weakened. JERSEY JOE failed to rally after going four to five wide on the turn.
ROCKS A BLACK SUIT steadied at the start after breaking in a bit, went five to seven wide on the turn and failed to threaten. KEEP IT ROLLIN was urged
from the break but lacking speed, shifted out midway on the turn coming five wide to the quarter pole, was never a threat. LEA COSTA ME was carried out
from three to seven wide on the turn and failed to rally.

CATS BLAME settled last but one near the inside, came out a bit late on the turn, had room three deep in mid-stretch, struck the lead in late stretch and
held off a late challenger. PULPITS FOX settled at the rear, went three wide into the turn swinging seven wide out of that bend taking the overland route,
drifted out a bit in the stretch but gained steadily and slowly. BAYTOWN MACCA chased three to four wide between runners, weakened. VROYSKY cleared
the field and shifted in, set a pressured pace on or just off the rail, weakened. LEGAL WEAPON switched out early, chased from outside going four to five
wide on the turn, faltered and faded. BAD BEAT moved up outside the pacesetter to press from between runners two to three wide on the turn, faltered and

Footnotes
ALL CHROME settled mid-pack, went inside a rival but three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit more turning into upper stretch, hooked up inside
DELBERT TOO in late stretch, dueled with that one and prevailed. DELBERT TOO switched out abruptly at the half, went four to five wide on the turn
coming seven deep into upper stretch, dueled outside ALL CHROME late but missed. TRUST N PRAYER settled last but one early racing off the inside,
went three to five wide on the turn swinging six to seven wide into upper stretch, then shifted in several paths before coming back out, was gaining but too
late. MASTERCLASS raced outside the winner early going four to five wide on the turn, drifted out in upper- to mid-stretch and ran on. ILIKEROLLIN stalked
the pacesetter from outside, went three wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch and was clear but was simply outkicked late. DESERT REWARD shifted in
heading up the backstretch, tracked inside then came off the fence on the turn, weakened. ROAD TO HEAT went to to three wide on the turn while in a bit
tight early on that bend, angled six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. DIGGER'S GOLD stumbled badly at the start, trailed well back early, went two to
three wide on the turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. STORMIN TEXASON set the pace from off the rail, gave way in the stretch. ZEN YETI tracked the
leaders two wide into the turn, shifted nearer the rail on that bend, came up empty. LEADING PROSPECT was mid-pack along the inside early, steadied on
heels about the seven-sixteenths and was not a threat. PER RULING #2021-ZIA-92 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, ALL CHROME
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
