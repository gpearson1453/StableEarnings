the inner rail leaving the turn, gave way. TRIP TO CAIRO bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
TOP BOSS , away alertly, was well rated three wide tracking the leader, responded soon into the lane, moved to engage with a furlong remaining, struck the
top near the sixteenth pole then drew clear under a drive. FORCED , bumped at the break, corrected and moved clear under rating, was nursed two wide on
the lead, came under pressure in upper stretch, ceded to the winner a sixteenth out, faded but managed to hold down the place. OFFICER APPEAL stalked
inside, eased out in the drive and rallied mildly under steady hand encouragement. LIFESPAN broke a step slow, settled well back while saving ground,
steadied off heels in upper stretch, angled out past the three sixteenths and closed steadily. CHARLIE POTATOES , off the pace while two wide, circled four
wide into the stretch but failed to respond. I'VE GOTTA PLAN broke inward and bumped with FORCED, straightened and moved up three wide, chased to
the three eighths then retreated.

MS HEADLEY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and was under brisk urging from the eighth pole until inside the sixteenth pole where she
was allowed to relax. EIGHT OAKS , two wide on the turn, chased the winner and held the place. CALYPSO GHOST , two wide on the turn, eased out to
the three path in upper stretch and failed to rally. FAMILY FORTUNE circled the turn, was four deep entering the stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and
lacked a rally. BUSTIN HEARTS , along the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch, weakened. ARBUTUS raced along the inner rail around the turn
and was not a factor. GRECIAN DANCER , outrun, drifted wide in upper stretch.

SMART ENTRY , well back early, was under asking off the rail past the half mile marker, came three wide into the stretch, worked between rivals past mid
stretch, sustained under right handed asking, forged to command late and was going away at the wire. MY DREAM GIRL settled in the clear while saving
ground, advanced inside past the five sixteenths, eased out soon into the lane, rallied under pressure, swithced to her left lead when alongside the leader
with a sixteenth to go, gained a slim lead late but could not contain the winner's charge. EMPTY NET cleared soon after the break, set the pace towards the
inside, was under a drive maintaining the advantage past the eighth pole, dug in when confronted, dueled to late and faded. LOVE MY CAT saved ground
off the pace, eased out in upper stretch, advanced between foes near the sixteenth pole but wasn't good enough. CHARLIV stalked inside under rating, took
up serious chase when easing out past the three eighths, remained a presence past mid stretch then flattened out. PAU HANA lost ground four wide,
pursued to the quarter pole and gave way. BOB'S LADY tracked the leader, was under pressure leaving the three eighths and faltered. HONOR THE TAB
was outrun.

UNSHAKABLE U , fractious in the gate, was off a step slow when breaking inward, recovered and was urged to the front, went clear and set a rated pace
towards the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling past mid stretch, switched over to her left lead with about a
sixteenth remaining then held firm. MO NORMAL stalked the winner two wide, was put to serious asking nearing the quarter pole, gave willing pursuit but
failed to gain in the final furlong. RUNAWAY MONET dropped in heading to the first turn and rated forwardly, eased out under pressure in upper stretch and
churned on to make a mild comeback. RONA rated in the two path while not far back, chased to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, failed to kick on
past the five sixteenths and gave way. BROADWAY MELODY , three to four wide stalking the winner, was under pressure into the far turn, lacked a
response then gave way through the drive.

Footnotes
JOHNG rated close up in about the two path, spied the dueling leaders while being coaxed along past the three eighths, shifted out four wide in upper
stretch, made a grinding run under right handed asking, leveled off to his best stride when switching over to his correct lead a sixteenth out, sustained and
got up in the final yards. BROKER'S REWARD , three to four wide under a light hold stalking the pace, moved up three deep to entertain the pace leaving
the far turn, dueled into the lane, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner. MY BOY PADDY , bumped
around and in tight at the break, dropped off the early pace while removed from the rail, worked his way between runners into the stretch and kept on
willingly to gain a share of the show. MONSTER MASON , between rivals early while tracking the pace, moved up to apply pressure nearing the half mile
marker, gained a slim lead between foes near three eighths, sparred into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. ANTIPOISON came in at the
break and bumped with a rival, was under a snug hold behind foes past the seven eighths, stalked to the far turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths
and gave way. FAVORITE IMAGE sped clear early, dropped in to set the pace, took pressure past the half mile pole, failed to kick on with leaders past the
five sixteenths and faltered. B DETERMINED came out at the break and bumped with MY BOY PADDY, saved ground and in range to the five eighths, had
no response leaving the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
PET'S NIGHT showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to mid turn, gained a clear lead entering the stretch, drifted out a bit in upper stretch then dug in
tenaciously late to prevail. THE BIG MOZZ stalked the duel down the backstretch, eased off the rail mid way on the turn, came into the lane four deep and
rallied. BURGESS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and passed tired foes. CANHERUN , three deep disputing the pace down the
backstretch, chased the winner through the stretch and weakened. DIRTY DIRTY showed brief speed in the two path and gave way on the turn.
