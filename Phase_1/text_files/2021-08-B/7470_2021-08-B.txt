Footnotes
ROB THE TREASURE tracked close up on the inside, waited for room while saving ground on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between
rivals, finished willingly and edged away for the win. TALE LIGHTS set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dug in gamely on the rail in
the stretch run and finished well to earn the place spot. AGELESS ARTIST raced off the pace inside, moved up between horses on the far turn, came three
wide into the lane, rallied outside and was outkicked late. MOON UNIT ZAPPER stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened. RACHEL
CAROLINE settled off the pace outside a rival and failed to threaten. HOT LITTLE NUMBER raced off the early pace, then stalked three wide, chased three
wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and tired. SIMPLY SMASHING was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. PAGE
ELEVEN was off slowly to an awkward beginning, raced off the pace inside and gave way on the far turn.
