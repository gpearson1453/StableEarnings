MEMORIAL GUARD matched strides for the lead two wide into the turn, made the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace and
finished full of run under right handed urging to win as much the best. POWERFUL MOON stalked the pace into the turn, offered a bid three wide and was
no match while holding on for second. THE FALCON trailed early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the six path. O'HAIRE went evenly. UNCLE
CHARMING failed to menace. ALWAYS SPECIAL away alertly, battled for the lead along the inside into the turn, had speed until mid stretch then was used
up.

BIG STOCK WINNER prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the five sixteenths pole, edged clear, set the balance of the pace,
drifted out from the four path to the eighth path under left handed urging and just lasted. FOREIGN sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace
along the inside into the turn, dropped back then came on again late and just missed. DIVOLUME allowed to settle, shifted out to the five path entering the
stretch, was forced outward through the final stages and was steadily gaining on the top pair. DYNAMITE CLOUD stalked the pace and went evenly. EL
MEZCALITO failed to menace. PIPER DESERVED IT trailed. THE RIDER OF DIVOLUME LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.
