STORYBOOK FARM saved ground, advanced outside turn, finished well to take over late, drew out. ZENHI forced pace outside, short lead into turn,
opened up mid turn, gave best stretch, was no match for the winner late. CRIMSON BOW well placed outside, lacked rally. REALLY LUCKY, between
horses early, off rail turn, finished evenly. HALO'S PHENOMENON trailed early, advanced mildly widest. CRANBERRY CREEK had inside speed under
pressure, lost lead into turn, gave way mid turn. CRAFTY PIE, well placed inside early, dropped back turn, faded. SOMERSET PRIDE, wide early, off rail
turn, showed little.
