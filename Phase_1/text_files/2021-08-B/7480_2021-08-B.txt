Footnotes
GRAY ADMIRAL switched outside the leaders under mild restraint, advanced to apply pressure three wide on the turn, struck the lead by the
three-sixteenths, drew clear under steady handling. UNION BROTHER began to advance on the turn moving out from two to four wide on that bend, took
aim at the lead but was no match while second best. CAIRO KING tracked the pace from inside, dropped back a bit into the turn, saved ground on that
bend, angled five wide in upper stretch and secured show honors. JUST CALL ME KEN failed to rally after improving some three to five wide on the turn.
KONA COAST attended the pace from inside, applied some pressure late on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch coming out a path or so and
weakened. OL' DRUNK DADDY raced outside foes four to six wide on the turn and was not a threat. SHANGHAI MIKE cleared and shifted in, set the pace
two wide into the turn with pressure inside and out late on that bend, faltered.

Footnotes
PEACEOUTYOURHONOR was bumped at the break but recovered to move forward inside to dictate terms facing pressure from outside foes, saved
ground on the turn, edged clear into upper stretch, drifted in and out just marginally in late stretch and held. TRICKESSY was in tight at the start, tracked
just off the pace then between foes into the turn going two wide, lost ground into mid-stretch, kept on late but missed. RED CLOUD EXPRESS was bumped
at the break, pressed the pace from outside three wide into the turn, had no extra in late stretch. OUR LAST ROSE was bumped into a rival at the start,
settled just off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turn, drifted out through the stretch and needed more late. BINALLOVERDRINKEN was bumped
into a rival and bothered at the break, thereupon angled in content to race off the leaders, saved ground on or off the rail through the turn, lacked a bit of
room in late stretch and had no late kick. NOTHIN BUT CLASS broke in sharply bumping and bothering rivals, went five wide through much of the turn
before angling in past the quarter pole, failed to menace. GOLDEN GODDESS lunged inward at the start bumping a rival and losing the rider, walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GOLDEN BAND was brushed repeatedly late up the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, took aim and under stout urging got up late.
WHEREDOESTHECASHGO got away alertly and set the early tempo before HOLLYWOOD HENRY moved through inside to take charge, was thereupon
content to sit just off that rival, applied pressure three wide on the turn, further pressure in mid- to late-stretch, kept on for the place but was outkicked by the
winner. HOLLYWOOD HENRY moved forward not too long after the break to set the pace inside, continued under pressure along or just off the rail through
the turn, lugged out a bit in upper stretch, was outkicked late. HOLD ME ONLY tucked in behind the leaders leaving the backstretch, tracked two to three
wide on the turn, came out five wide turning for home and ran on. STORMIN FAST was inside the second group off the leading pair, saved ground through
the turn, came out three wide past the three-sixteenths then back in as a rival in front drifted out. COURAGE N ORDER saved ground inside but failed to
rally. WEST DAWN brushed an outside rival repeatedly late up the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and came up empty.
