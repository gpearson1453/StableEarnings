Footnotes
DUNE D'ORO stalked from the rail, angled out into the lane and won driving outside. STORMCHASER quickly went to the front securing position just off the
rail, took pressure leaving the backstretch, moved clear and was run down late. EZEKIEL angled out to track from the five path, shifted to the two path
nearing the three sixteenth marker, rallied in close quarters through stretch and earned show honors. WEEKEND WIZARD trailed the field, lodged a rail bid
and edged out. BACKSTREET BOBBY pressed the pace racing three to four wide, was unable to move on with STORMCHASER then was bumped and
flattened. THISDEWARSFORYOU attended the pace from between foes and stopped.

Footnotes
HUMBOLDTSTRONG stalked the pacesetters from the four path, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole, and remained clear to the wire. MARACOCA'S
DREAM chased three wide through the backstretch, launched an all out bid into the stretch but was unable to reach the winner. I'MAMUDDERTOO
squeezed leaving and passed tiring rival. SANDY BEACH reluctant to load, broke into SMOKEDYA leaving the gate, dueled outside of AMBER RIDGE to
the three eighths pole, was quickly overtaken shortly after and stopped. HARDMEDAL COUNTESS saved ground inside and lacked a bid. AMBER RIDGE
contended the pace from just off the rail, was unable to keep pace with the field and gave way. SMOKEDYA got loose behind the gate when loading,
bumped away and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HEREVERYWISH raced at the back of the pack leaving the chute, saved ground on rail, began bid nearing the quarter pole then split rivals at the head of
the stretch, edged off then remained safe driving. BAINE THE BULL tracked wide through the backstretch, lodged a four wide bid leaving the backstretch
then gained an short advantage over I'MANIMPERIALGIRL into the lane and was run down mid stretch. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL set a pressured pace from
the rail, was overtaken near the three eighths pole, re-rallied inside and yielded. BREACH OF CONTRACT sat mid pack while three to four wide, dropped
back in the far turn and rallied late inside. BIG AND FLASHY pressed from the three to four path and lacked a closing response. CALEDON SUMMER
tracked wide and faded outside. ABERDEEN ANNIE sat in range outside and tired early.

Footnotes
WAR GIANT settled in the three path, saved ground along the rail through the far turn, lacked running room near the three sixteenth pole then found room
between foes into the stretch and prevailed under a late drive. EDDYSHAK was under a snug hold leaving the chute, lugged out through the backstretch,
came five wide into the lane and was out finished. ZICATELA dueled through the backstretch inside of WALKTHELINE, responded to pressure into the
stretch and was worn down deep stretch. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE carried wide in the backstretch, raced three wide through the far turn, angled out in
stretch and finished with energy. COMMON KNOWLEDGE settle off the early pacesetters from the four path, drove four wide at the quarter pole and failed
to threaten in drive. WALKTHELINE broke sharply to lead the field into the backstretch, took pressure outside of ZICATELA and had nothing left in reserve
in the stretch. RED CHOCOLATE lacked serious bid. MR. KALYPSO raced wide through the backstretch and was outrun.
