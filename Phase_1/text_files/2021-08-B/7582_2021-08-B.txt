GORDY'S RULES was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the
lane. MONSTRODAMOUS tracked the winner from the inside throughout and failed to gain on that foe in the drive. MOJAVE pressed the pace of the winner
while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. TIZ MANNY chased the winner while racing five-wide and gradually weakened. NORSKI lagged
early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

NORTHWEST RAIN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. LT. BULLITT chased
the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but clearly second best. LAGO DE ORO was off slow, raced unhurried early,
moved three-wide through the turn and was up for the show. OUR HY ROLLER was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and lacked the
needed late response. LUKE'S PLACE was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out late and did not threaten.
COWBOY CAUSEWAY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FORTUNE'S FREUDE was taken back at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
was up in the closing strides. QUEEN BREEZY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to
run, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner from over the top. MISS IMPORTANT was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and finished with good late energy. SIGRID'S GOLD broke out, chased the pace of BELLA'S BACK while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive.
BELLA'S BACK sprinted to a long early lead and weakened through the final furlong. LADY CAMPBELL was away in good order, was pulled up soon after,
lost rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SPITTIN IMAGE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the half and again nearing the
quarter and held gamely to the wire. OH MARVELOUS ME tracked the winner from the inside, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained
a brief lead but could not hold that rival safe in the drive. SWAMP SOUFFLE showed no early speed, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late
energy. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, led and
gave way through the final furlong. BIG ENDEAVOR settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. FOREST
FIRE raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and was eased through the lane.

extended to hold the off the closing SMASHING SUCCESS to prevail. SMASHING SUCCESS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled
out in mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner late. LINCHPINS WAKE was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. SOUTHERN VENTURE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting
the pace and gave way through the final furlong. BEE EINSTEIN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late.
WHATA FLIRT broke out, raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHELBY R. was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. SALTY NUGGET was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not
