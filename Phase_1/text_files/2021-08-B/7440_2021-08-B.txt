SPEEDY MOBILE chased the pace two wide into the far turn, was forced wide while being bumped outside the leader entering the stretch, dug in gamely
while drifting inward under right handed urging and proved best in a stretch long drive. NOBLE BEHAVIOR away alertly, set the pace near the inside, drifted
out bumping the winner entering the stretch, matched strides the balance of the trip while being bumped late and forced inward and just failed. VIGO vied for
the lead along the inside into the stretch then faded. ADANO stumbled at the start and trailed.

and finished with good courage. IMMACULATE HEART closed some ground late in the seven path. CAN SHE SCOOT pressed the pace from the five path
and faded late. MISS SURPRISE had good early speed and faded late. DAMA LEONA was no factor. MY VICTAURUSECRET was outrun. OUTRAGEOUS

TILL THEN stalked the pace near the inside into the far turn, shifted out to the five path past the quarter pole, dropped inside the drifting leader at the top of
the stretch, dug in late and was along in time. UYEDA chased the leader through the first turn two wide, angled out three wide after a quarter, circled rivals
to make the lead on the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, remained in control until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. OFTEN
ENOUGH hopped at the start, was allowed to settle then rallied determinedly three wide through the stretch. SUPER VISION set the early pace along the
inside, was headed briefly after a quarter while getting slow fractions, regained command, set the pace into the far turn, chased the leader into the stretch
and faded, late. DEER CREEK ROAD was no threat. GILES raced in the five path through the clubhouse turn, surged three wide to make the lead after a
quarter, prompted the pace into the far turn, had speed into the stretch then gave way.
