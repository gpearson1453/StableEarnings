Footnotes
MAJOR GENERAL bumped lightly with a foe at the start but broke very fast, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while inside
foes on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, lugged inward in upper stretch, moved out under left-handed pressure while remaining
on his inside lead into the final furlong, was bumped by BOURBON HEIST while that foe posed a major danger at the sixteenth-pole, fought on his inside
lead to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BOURBON HEIST bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then steadied, moved out then
was urged along on the outside, tucked into the two path with a half-mile to run, angled four wide under urging at the five-sixteenths then was driven five into
the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining on the leader coming to the sixteenth-pole, bumped with that foe while on even terms
for the lead at that point, vied outside of the winner to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. FAN THE FIRE was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground in dead-aim of the leader on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner under a right-handed crop into the stretch,
moved out in pursuit of the winner inside the three-sixteenths, shifted further out around the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked but clear for the show.
JUDGE DAVIS lost his footing one stride from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, moved forward in the four path on the turn, made a bid
outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. TRIPLE ELVIS broke a bit slow then
brushed with a rival, was urged along off the pace, started the turn in the two path, angled five wide at the five-sixteenths then came six wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. GILDED AGE broke a bit slow, was ridden along towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn, moved off the rail around the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NAPA VALLEY reared at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many
lengths, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.. RAYMOND broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside then in the
three path on the turn, was urged along between horses passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and folded.

ZAINALARAB chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take over at the three-sixteenths
and edged clear under a drive to prevail. HALO CITY saved ground at the tail of the field growing detached early on, came under light coaxing half a mile
from home, tipped out to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors. PRIMACY two to three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. PORTILLA chased three wide in
closest aim of the leader before advancing to latch on at the three-eighths applying pressure to the front for the first time, knocked heads through the latter
portion of the bend cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, seized narrow and briefly command straightened away, got collared at the
three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. DIAL ME UP established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under
pressure and tucked closer to the rail at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the
front straightened away and tired.

HANDLE THE TRUTH coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside in the clear down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn and faced brief
kickback from SASSY BELLE before being in the clear once more, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the stretch outside the top trio and surged late arriving on the scene to just get up on the wire.
TELLAPERFECTTALE broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back ESCAPOLOGY in tandem with BONANA FANNA FOE, then had that rival come
inwards and got bumped by her and in turn bumped MARIA'S GIFT into DECREED, chased two then three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, rallied to engage the top pair a furlong out battled latched on taking command inside the sixteenth marker,
led nearest to the finish and was nailed on the line. KNOW IT ALL RED coaxed from the gate, raced four paths off the inside in aim of the leader, tucked to
the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through
the stretch taking narrow and brief command a sixteenth out before being headed inside that station, fought on to the finish. SASSY BELLE brushed the off
side stall at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, briefly tucked three wide into the turn before advancing on the front stoutly
along the outside under a firm left grip, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and got out through the latter portion of the turn to spin eight to nine
paths into upper stretch, drifted out despite correction through the stretch under a drive ending up near twelve to thirteen paths off the rail in the center of the
course while keeping on to the finish. TANGERINE DREAM crossed to the three path when establishing the front and showed the way in hand down the
backstretch under some pressure early on from DECREED, tucked inside through the turn coming under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing and took
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat stubbornly clinging to the lead until collared a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages.
BONANA FANNA FOE broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back ESCAPOLOGY in concert with TELLAPERFECTTALE, continued inwards
bumping that rival into MARIA'S GIFT and in turn DECREED after the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun
three wide for home and made some headway through to the finish. DECREED coaxed from the gate, got bumped just after the start by MARIA'S GIFT due
to pressure from BONANA FANNA FOE, showed brief speed coaxed along the inside, faded through the latter portion of the turn and cornered just off the
inside for home and weakened. ESCAPOLOGY got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start getting steadied out
and conceded four to five lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered no kick. MARIA'S GIFT hustled from the gate, got bumped after the start by
TELLAPERFECTTALE due to pressure from BONANA FANNA FOE and in turn bumped DECREED askew in the hind end, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.

TIERGAN went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused leaving the backstretch, chased four then three wide on the final
turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, took the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong
urging. TOO EARLY broke out and brushed with a foe then was hustled, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace on the inside
of CHIC N WILBUR, was asked with a half-mile to run then moved out a path, chased in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rail under a drive into
the stretch, kept on under vigorous urging to the wire and safely secured the place. MATTY'S EXPRESS was hustled to the lead, set an uncontested pace
on the inside through solid fractions, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside
the three-sixteenths and weakened but was far clear for the show. SIX PERCENT was asked leaving the gate, dropped from the three path to the rail on the
first turn, settled at the rear, moved out of last at the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and was no factor. CHIC N WILBUR
brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped back
three then four wide on the far turn and capitulated. GOOD OLD BOY went four to five wide on both turns and faltered then was eased in the final furlong
but walked off.

THE IMPORTANT ONE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure early on from BIG Q before shaking that
rival off readily half a mile from home, tucked inside through the turn patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, then drew off
under a drive to the finish. BETSY BLUE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home, proved no match for the top one while improving position for the place honors. BEAUTIFUL KAREN three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. FAIR REGIS chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened. KINKY SOX coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG Q hustled from the gate, pressed the pace
along the inside briefly to the half mile pole before being shaken off, chased inside through the turn, continued along the inside at the top of the stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
MY PRANKSTER broke in and brushed the gate, moved out while chasing the pace from third, went three wide on the turn, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole, shook clear under the crop in the four path into the stretch, drew off while still on his inside lead until the furlong marker, swapped to the proper
lead at that point then widened under a solid hand ride to prove much the best. SEAL BEACH was coaxed along on the outside, moved in outside the
half-mile pole, came under stronger encouragement in the two then three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch under the crop and safely
secured the place while no match for the winner. FROMANOTHAMUTHA was hustled from the start then darted in early, disputed the pace on the inside of
COGBURN, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and tired but was clear for the show.
COGBURN displayed good speed, contested the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, lost the lead while dropping closer to the rail outside
the quarter-pole and capitulated. SOUTHERN SENSE broke in at the start, raced well back in the field, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn,
swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RESERVE CURRENCY broke in and hit the gate, raced well back on the outside, went four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. SKATE TO HEAVEN broke and hit the gate, bumped with TRIUMPHANT ROAD early, moved out
while ridden along, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. TRIUMPHANT ROAD broke in at the start,
bumped with SKATE TO HEAVEN early, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. BELLINGER was last away then slow
into stride, raced at the back with his head held high in the air, went two to three wide for most of the turn, bore out late on the bend and faltered.

IDENTITY POLITICS bumped at the start by GOLANI BRIDGE, who broke out a step, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out to swing four wide into upper stretch getting nudged by CHARLIE FIVE O as he went on by as that rival looked to tip out, took over
command just inside the three-sixteenths, edged away under a drive, dug in kept to task to prevail safely on the wire. EL SOBREVIVIENTE four wide in
pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place
honors. CHARLIE FIVE O led early on before chasing inside from just off the pace, tipped to the two path through the turn, swung three wide for home and
attempted to tip out to the four path nudging IDENTITY POLITICS to no avail and was forced to be taken in hand in behind RESPECT FOR ALL, angled in
to the two path and had RESPECT FOR ALL drift inwards and was steadied in tight between that rival and THERISASTORMBREWEIN just inside the
three-sixteenths before being roused on through, then improved position for the show honors. GOLANI BRIGADE broke out at the start bumping IDENTITY
POLITICS, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, stayed one paced, then weakened in the
late stages under tepid handling. AMERICAN RULE coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced to stack outside the top pair, swung six wide for home and weakened in the drive.
RESPECT FOR ALL hustled from the gate, prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took over narrow and brief
command inside the five-sixteenths between foes, spun three wide for home, drifted in at the three-sixteenths brushing and placing CHARLIE FIVE O in
tight and weakened. THERISASTORMBREWIN hustled from the gate, showed the way under pressure from the two path, tucked inside through the turn,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front and tired.

MALATHAAT stumbled at the start, recovered to settle four paths off the rail past the stands the first time before going three then two wide through the
opening bend, tipped out five paths off the rail down the backstretch patiently handled in mid pack, came under light coaxing just inside half a mile to go and
continued five wide through the far turn advancing outside rivals to be just off the leaders continuing five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
and was brushed by ARMY WIFE coming out slightly under a near side crop before taking command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear under a light
drive to the finish to prevail. CLAIRIERE got placed to a rating hold and tucked to the rail just after the start racing in a bit tight to the inside of MARACUJA
before being taken under a hard hold off the heels of that rival with one mile to go as that foe tucked in front, rode the rail behind that rival through the turn
before tipping out three wide down the backstretch, got given some rein to work with into the far turn while otherwise in hand and patiently handled, came
under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home just prevailing for
the place honors over a rival at the end. ARMY WIFE forwardly placed three wide past the stands the first time and through the first turn, raced four paths off
the inside down the backstretch and into and through the far turn coming under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, advanced on the front and
swung four to five wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, dug in under threat coming out slightly under a left side crop and brushed
with MALATHAAT nearing the eighth pole before conceding the lead to that rival inside that station, then ran on to be bested for the place honors in the final
jumps while well clear of the rest for the show honors. WILL'S SECRET coaxed from the gate, got rated along the inside early on before tipping to the two
path midway on the first turn, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch and into the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, weakened in the final eighth. PLAYED HARD coaxed from the start, established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside into the first turn before taking briefly to the rail midway, tipped back to the two path down the backstretch patiently handled slowing
the pace a tad before being given some rein as WILL'S SECRET latched on to the outside, came under light coaxing half a mile from home and came under
increasing pressure through the latter portion of the turn before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened
away, then weakened through to the finish. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL eased off after the start settling briefly inside, tipped out two then three wide through the
stretch the first turn before going three then two wide through the first turn, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through
the far turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three to four wide at the head of the stretch and was unable to make an impact. MARACUJA away
to a stutter step start, tracked just off the inside in mid pack, tucked inside placed to light coaxing half a mile from home, came under urging at the
three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
PERFECT GRACE broke out at the start, settled comfortably on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, cruised to the lead into the stretch then moved
clear while shaken up a bit and drew off under a mild hand ride to win handily. RHOMBIQUE was reluctant to load then broke a step slow, was urged along
off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
INGRESS was coaxed along while following the leader, chased in the three path on the turn and tired while best of the rest. GOOD TALK stumbled at the
start, moved up under urging to take the lead then went clear, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and capitulated. EPONA BAY broke a
step slow, was taken up briefly outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.
