TINDER DATE pressed outside the early leader, was brushed on the backstretch, was brushed and carried out around the final turn, ran clear in early
stretch and widened under urging. KATY THE CAT wasn't far back, made a run in the three path into the stretch then flattened out. BRYNBELLA made the
early pace inside the winner, bore out into that one on the backstretch and final turn then faltered. JANE steadily faded. TEACHER DRAMA became
fractious in the gate just as the doors opened, left far behind the field and never caught up. BIRD TYCOON was briefly close to the leaders then stopped.

swung wide into the stretch and gained late between rivals. BLEZNIATKA fell back early then made a late run outside. MUSICAL TIMES was bumped
leaving the gate, came out two wide on the turn and made up ground between rivals. YOU CANT CATCH HER tired inside. VISITING ANGEL became
