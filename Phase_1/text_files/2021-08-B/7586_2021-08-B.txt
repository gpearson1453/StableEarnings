PERFECT HIDEAWAY was well placed outside, bumped with GOLD RUSH KIZZIE early on the backstretch, dueled two wide through the final half, was
switched to right hand whip in the stretch while trying to lay in and was narrowly best after a long hard drive. TIPSY CHATTER ran out while moving clear
into the first turn, dueled inside the winner through the final half and just missed in a game effort. SWAN POINT wasn't far back along the rail for over six
furlongs, swung wide into the stretch and continued evenly. MALDIVES MODEL was shuffled back from between rivals entering the first turn, rallied three
wide into contention on the final turn then flattened out. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE was close up early, bumped with the winner early on the backstretch then
stopped.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S DREAM stalked outside, moved two wide to command midway on the turn and was clearly best in hand. KIRK'S GIRL moved clear midway on
the backstretch, stayed inside and was clearly second best. SEEKING THE THRONE was slow early, made a run along the rail around the turn then
flattened out. DRIVER'S LICENSE broke slowly, lagged early then outfinished tired ones. HERE I COME wasn't far back outside early then stopped.
TARA'S Z VA was no factor. BIG AGNES briefly chased, stopped and was eased up.
