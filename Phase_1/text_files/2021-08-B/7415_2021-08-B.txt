SANAWAR tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides. QUAGMIRE away alertly and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn while racing one out from the rail, and battled determinedly through the lane, but was nipped in
the closing strides. EUROPEAN away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with QUAGMIRE through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the
drive to garner a share. TIZ MEOW broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. YOU DON'T OWN ME tracked the leaders three wide entering the
backstretch, struggled to keep tabs with the filed entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

PORTER GENT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. HOME RUN GUY broke sharply and
pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn and into the stretch, was
unable to match strides with the winner late, but battled gamely to hold the place. COULTERBERRY away well and was taken in hand and dropped to the
back of a compact field entering the backstretch, launched his bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three
wide in deep stretch to just miss the place. DRILLER tracked the leaders through the first turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through
the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. AT ATTENTION stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, but began to fade midway through the turn, and had little left for the drive.

WE'RE IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the inside of
ATOMIC HAZE in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and was all out to fend off that stubborn rival late to prevail. ATOMIC HAZE broke
sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, and battled determinedly two wide in the drive to just miss, while proving easily second best. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while racing along the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and while no threat to the top pair, finished willingly from along the rail in
the drive to garner a share. JUVEE TOO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn,
and failed to make a late impact while finishing two wide in the drive.
