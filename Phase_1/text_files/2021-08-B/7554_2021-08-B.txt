held the show. BROKEN LOVE allowed to settle, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. DINNER

SAN COSTANTINO set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. THE PENINSULA allowed to settle, moved up
two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then drifted in under right land urging and edged up for the place.

placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild late gain. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY never far
back, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. OVER IT well placed, steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
SAMURAI ZIP rated close up, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. GOHARA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest.
MR. CAT mid pack, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. FLY FRIENDLY SKY allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up for a share. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE well placed and inside, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and ran evenly the final furlong. BLACK TIE EVENT improved position. HERACLITUS mid pack,
saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly. WHISKEY DASH was no factor. GOLDEN EMPEROR rated
back in the early going, looped three wide through the turn and had no stretch rally.
