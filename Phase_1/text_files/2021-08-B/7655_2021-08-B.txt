SPEAKING pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the turn, responded when roused in upper stretch, took charge, pulled way under some urging
and cruised home in hand. ON THE COME UP set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, was no match for that rival, then well clear for
the place award. ONE TIME WILLARD chased close up outside, raced four wide on the turn, finished evenly and bested the others. THERE ARE NO
WORDS chased on the rail, lacked a rally and finished evenly on the rail. FOREVER CHOCOLATE raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had
no rally. ALPHA COMPANY chased outside, raced three wide on the turn and tired. CASSATION was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, inside on the turn
and did not factor. JUST CHECKING IN was outrun.

PICKIN' TIME chased three wide early, bid four wide on the turn, dueled, led into the stretch, drew clear, drifted out a bit in front of GOLDEN BROWN at the
sixteenth marker and dug in gamely to the finish. GOLDEN BROWN chased close up inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled, angled out at the top of the
lane, rallied, altered course slightly behind the winner and continued gamely to the end. DR. DOYLE raced off the pace, moved up two or three wide on the
turn and rallied outside in the stretch run. BROTHER CHUB chased between rivals, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, dug in and was outkicked. OUR MAN
LUKE raced off the pace inside and had no rally. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL set the pace, dueled between rivals on the turn and faded. WALLERCITO was in
the hands of the assistant starter when the gates opened, then outrun after. After a Stewards' Inquiry, WALLERCITO was declared a non starter for
wagering purposes due to the incident at the gate. A Jockey Objection by the rider of GOLDEN BROWN against the winner was dismissed.
