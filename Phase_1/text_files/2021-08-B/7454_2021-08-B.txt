Footnotes
POPPY'S GIRL prompted the pace along the rail for six furlongs, checked while lacking racing room at the quarter pole, angled out four wide at the top of
the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack, surged late and was along in time. FRIDAY trailed into the far turn, circled her field to make the lead
past the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. MISS OVER THERE hopped at the start, inched closer between horses two wide on the second
turn then leveled off. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace until mid stretch then weakened.
ANTHONY'S GIRL with the second flight three wide, lacked the needed response. MOR BREEZE away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide into the
second turn then gave way.

Footnotes
MOVES LIKE ALI broke in full stride to set all the pace while getting rapid fractions and widened at will into the stretch to win as much the best under a
strong hand ride. MAKE THE CALL stalked the pace three side and finished second best. BIG OHIO was squeezed at the start, outrun early then found his
best stride late. CHARLEE'S MAGIC with the second flight two wide, failed to respond. REANIMATE drifted in at the start, prompted the pace along the rail
early then weakened in the stretch. INTO THE OUT was bounced around between rivals then squeezed at the start causing his rider to check then was no
threat. POWERS OUT bore out at the start bumping rivals then was no factor. SWEETNESSNCHARM also bumped and squeezed at the start, suffered a
catastrophic injury before the half mile pole and was euthanized.
