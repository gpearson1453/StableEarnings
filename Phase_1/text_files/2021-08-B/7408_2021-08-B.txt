LANGARA opened up into the first turn, turned back a bid from MCKAGUE into the final turn, opened up into the stretch, dug in determinedly when asked to
hold safe in the drive, making the final start of his career a winning one. MCKAGUE tracked LANGARA from just back and off the rail, made a bid into the
final turn, was turned back, kept coming through the stretch to make it close at the wire. PURRSIBILITY stalked off rail, advanced for show. BEAR ME A
MOMENT stalked inside, lacked rally.
