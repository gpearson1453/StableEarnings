Footnotes
MR. BRIGGS was asked for speed leaving the gate, raced inside two foes while on even terms for the lead into the first turn, was wrestled back to last while
placed in crowded quarters against the rail on that bend, moved out entering the backstretch then was taken up briefly when FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY came
out shortly thereafter, settled on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, ranged up three to four wide on the final turn, took the lead with a
quarter-mile to run, remained on his inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead while inching away and drew clear under
steady handling. CITY MAGIC was hustled from the start, raced between foes in the two path into and early on the first turn then dropped to the inside,
showed the way with company to his outside, was asked along the rail midway through the final turn, came under the crop outside the quarter-pole then lost
the advantage to the winner and proved no match while clear for the place. FINGAL broke a half-step slow, went three to four wide on the first turn, moved
up quickly at the seven-eighths, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under the crop and tired. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was rated while three then two wide on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch then
moved out, was asked near the half-mile pole, came up empty on the final turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
MAKIN MY MOVE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside down the backstretch under some pressure
to the inside from a pair early on through swift splits, tucked to the two path half a mile from home shaking away and made her way to the inside with
seven-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and went clear under a light drive, then got geared
down through the final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no doubt. SILVER FIST coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader between foes to her inside
in the two path down the backstretch, came in slightly and placed TRINITY TITOLI in tight along the rail just inside the half mile pole brushing with that rival,
got placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths now in pursuit of the shaking away leader through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while keeping on through to the finish on her left lead. TRINITY TITOLI lunged slightly at the start and came under coaxing, chased forwardly
placed along the inside prompting the leader early on in tandem with the aforementioned foe, got put in tight and was brushed along the rail just inside the
half mile pole by SILVER FIST when shaken off by the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened while just preserving the show honors. SUCCULENT struck the near side stall at the start, then steadied as BELLS ON HER TOES came
outwards and conceded five to six lengths to the front, chased three then two wide detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four to five wide for home and passed tired rivals just missing for the show honors at the end. EMPIRE LILY coaxed from the gate, chased four then
three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. BEAUTIFUL BANKS bobbled at the break, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. BELLS ON HER TOES broke out at the start forcing
SUCCULENT to be steadied in behind, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SCOCCIATORE bobbled slightly at the start but came out with the field, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, shook clear
coming to the quarter-pole then extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths,
drew off under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand ride to the wire while much the best. MARKET ALERT was
corrected at the start with a quick tug of the left rein, raced inside of SCUTTLEBUZZ under urging, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch, dueled with NEW YORK'S FINEST for the place and gamely earned that position while no match for the winner. NEW YORK'S
FINEST stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field on the outside, dropped from the four path to the two path at the
seven-sixteenths, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch then moved out more under a drive, dueled with MARKET ALERT for the place and
was denied that position while well clear for the show. SCUTTLEBUZZ was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the
turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch then was carried out around the three-sixteenths and capitulated. ALPHALFA was hustled from the start,
disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths, dropped
back into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
HOOPLA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn patiently handled until set
down spinning just off the inside for home, then drew off under a drive to prevail. MY COUSIN RICH broke out at the start bumping RICKY'S REVENGE,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and kept on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and
along second best. BLAME IT ON BRUTUS chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. RICKYS REVENGE broke a half a beat slow and was bumped at the start, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, got shaken off spinning three wide for home and tired. PRIVATE CODE broke out at the start and was corrected, then got
carried out eight paths off the inside by RECIDIVIST who was tipping out to ease and then pull up and was unable to clear that rival until the five furlong
marker, then tucked four wide inside that station before going three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide
for home and made no impact. RECIDIVIST broke in at the start and was corrected, came under coaxing and shortened stride losing his action a sixteenth
after the start, got guided outside and carried PRIVATE CODE with him despite being taken hold of and attempting to ease off so that rival could tuck in
front and was able to accomplish that with five furlongs to go, got placed to a protective hold and was eased up before being pulled up outside the half mile
pole, then was subsequently vanned off. Please note that RECIDIVIST ran for purse money only.

Footnotes
ACHILLES HEEL was hustled from the start, established a forward position on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, took the lead late on that bend,
dropped in while shaking clear at the top of the stretch then came under a right-handed crop along the rail at the three-sixteenths, responded well when
switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under strong urging. RESILIENT COURAGE jostled with a rival at the
start, moved out while off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. EXCURSIONNISTE
bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up early, settled in the back half of the field, raced inside early on then then moved to the two path under
urging around the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the
proper lead and was along for the show. SUNDAESWITHSANDY bumped hard with KINGHAM HILL early, settled just off the pace, went two then three
wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came in under a left-handed crop nearing the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick then lost
the show. KINGDOM ON PAWS settled on the far outside while towards the back, went five wide under urging on the turn and failed to threaten.
AMALGAMATOR was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, went three wide under urging on the turn and was no factor.
KINGHAM HILL jostled with an opponent at the start, bumped soundly with SUNDAESWITHSANDY early, settled just off the pace, was asked while inside
on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole then chased three wide into the stretch and came up empty. MAKART bumped with a rival at the
start, chased the pace on the outside, went three then two wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faltered. WHISKEY GENT was hustled to
the lead, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging and stopped then was
eased in the final furlong but walked off.

LA DRAGONTEA (GB) settled unhurried two to three wide near the rear of the field patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, angled
out six wide into upper stretch circling rivals and rallying to take command straightened away for home, edged away under a drive to the finish kept to task.
SISTER OTOOLE three wide past the stands for the initial time, tucked inside through the opening bend before tipping out three wide down the backstretch
allowed to trail the field early on, went three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper
stretch, ran on to chase the winner home willingly for the place honors. FLIGHTY LADY (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path
through the far turn and was set down angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages while
clear for the show honors. CAT'S PAJAMAS just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, got let out angled four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. HERE COMES JACKIE attended the leader to the outside from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) in a bit tight at the start, raced just off the inside briefly before
tipping three wide through the first turn advancing to settle kindly under rating perched in closest aim of the top pair, remained patiently handled and on hold
through to the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch, the rider sneaking a peek to the outside into upper stretch and was never encouraged
through to the finish while being intermittently flashed the crop to the right side in retreat. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN established the front and showed the way
under rating along the inside and under the watchful eye of HERE COMES JACKIE to the outside, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, cut
the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired.

GIMME SOME MO went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the final turn, took
the advantage outside the quarter-pole, bumped with ROAD TO SUCCESS into upper stretch, battled outside that foe under a left-handed crop, swapped
back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and proved best while placed under a hand ride in the final strides. ROAD TO SUCCESS went to the front,
showed the way on the inside, was asked with seven-sixteenths to run, vied inside of the winner while along the rail on the final turn, lost the advantage
outside the quarter-pole, bumped with the aforementioned opponent into upper stretch, battled against the rail while directly inside that foe into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished late while clear for the place. LOKOYA ROAD was last to commence then bumped the hindquarters of a rival, saved ground
on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged inside early on the far turn, shifted three wide around the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch
and improved position for the show. CHASE TRACKER dropped from the two path to the rail on the opening bend, was well placed just off the pace, chased
the leaders while moving from the inside to the two path on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. SCOTTY went two to three wide
for most of the first turn then shifted four wide, settled on the outside, was coaxed along passing the nine-sixteenths, went four wide under urging early on
the far turn, dropped to three then two wide later on that bend and failed to respond. MOONLIGHT NOW was rated while four then three wide on the first
turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the far turn and also failed to respond.
SCOTTO was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, angled to the rail early, was taken up while rank in tight quarters against the fence on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and faltered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

inside a furlong out, fought head to head to the sixteenth marker and was bumped as FULL COURT PRESS came out slightly inside that station and was

Footnotes
AVERLY JANE displayed excellent speed and quickly sped clear, was challenged briefly at the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action while inside on the
turn, extended the advantage late on that bend, drew off under her own power into upper stretch, was shaken up outside the furlong marker and widened
under a mild hand ride to win handily. PURE PANIC was hustled from the start then hesitated when BAYTOWN WARRIOR came in a bit early, chased the
pace while loosely between horses, moved closer leaving the backstretch, pursued the winner in the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under
the crop and proved no match while able to secure the place. OVERBORE lost his footing at the start and was last to commence, raced on the outside while
ridden along, went three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop coming to the furlong marker and just got up
for the show. GOLDEN BELL chased the solo leader on the inside of two foes, gained to make a brief bid at the seven-sixteenths, pursued the winner in the
two path through the turn and tired. CATCH THE SMOKE bumped with foes on both sides at the start then jostled with those rivals, was urged along
towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
BACKNTHEWOODS broke out and bumped with a rival then jostled with that opponent. settled under some urging, was put to stronger encouragement in
the two path on the turn and came up empty. BONUS APPRECIATION broke in and bumped with an opponent then jostled with that foe, was urged along at
the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. BAYTOWN WARRIOR broke fast from the outside post, chased the
pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faded. BARONE CESCO settled off the pace, was urged along
while inside on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SWEET MISSION crossed to be just off the inside soon after the start, tracked the front from the two path briefly taken in hand off the heels of MALIBU
ANTHEM just outside of six and a half furlongs to go, remained patiently handled and tipped out three then four wide through the far turn placed to light
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command nearing the eighth pole and went clear under light
urging inside the eighth pole, then finished ears pricked under her own power prevailing comfortably on the wire. DEAREST KITTEN coaxed from the gate,
established the front and showed the way three then two wide through the first turn before taking to the rail into the backstretch, remained in hand until
placed to light coaxing inside the half mile pole looking to shake away, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under growing threat and floated out three
then four wide when collared by the top one near the eighth pole, proved no match for that rival while keeping on clear for the place honors. SALINO coaxed
from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped to the two path near the three-eighths pole, spun two to three
wide for home and weakened while along clear for the show honors. MALIBU ANTHEM hustled briefly from the start, chased two to three wide through the
opening bend, then chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader knocking heads with SALINO to her inside, came under coaxing three wide at the
three-eighths, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. NEVER CONTENT (IRE) four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to
four wide coming under coaxing midway on the far turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. LITTLE NUTTER raced along the rail through the
first turn and was briefly taken in hand along the inside just outside six and a half furlongs to run, chased inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and trailed.
