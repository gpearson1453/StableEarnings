SELF AWARENESS sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and increased his advantage through the stretch while under urging. NATTY BEAU
chased the winner in a willing effort. SING A VERSE lacked speed, raced inside horses through the stretch and passed tired ones. SAM AND SY , three
wide both turns, passed tired foes. PERUVIAN DANCER , bumped at the break, raced three wide on the far turn and was not a factor. ENANO ASTRAY ,
along the inner rail down the backstretch, weakened through the stretch. NEW YORK ONE bore in on rivals leaving the starting gate, chased the winner for
a half mile then gave way. JUSTICE OF WAR , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, pulled up approaching the far turn and was vanned off.

JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT showed speed outside horses, entered the turn in the two path and steadily drew off through the stretch. MY LOVELY GIRL ,
steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out entering the stretch and rallied. PAISLEY SINGING , off last, rushed up outside
horses mid way on the turn, had aim on the leader entering the stretch and tired. MADAM MEENA bumped with GOT YOUR NUMBER mid way down the
backstretch, steadied and drifted out entering the turn, circled and failed to rlly. OUR DIAMOND GIRL , steadied behind MADAM MEENA entering the turn,
was not a factor. GOT YOUR NUMBER bumped with MADAM MEENA mid way down the backstretch, moved up along the inner rail, came out and checked
when in tight quarters inside the winner entering the turn then dropped back. An objection by the rider of GOT YOUR NUMBER against the winner for
alleged interference entering the turn was not allowed. An objection by the rider of OUR DIAMOND GIRL against MADAM MEENA for alleged interference
entering the turn was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run into the turn but no action was taken.

SOCIAL EQUALITY , off poorly, trailed early, angled to the four path entering the backstretch, advanced outside horses, bid for the lead leaving the far turn
and narrowly prevailed. MONYINTHEBANKSEY showed speed along the inner rail, dueled entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. TALES OF
SARATOGA , always well off the inner rail, stalked the pace for six furlongs and weakened. PRINCE OF CAPS , a forward factor in the two path early, gave
way on the backstretch. SUPPORTING ACTOR was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOOL YOURSELF , four deep the first two turns, gained command entering the backstretch, angled to the rail approaching the far turn, repelled a challenge
turning for home and drew off. AWARD WANTED stalked the pace, advanced outside the winner to challenge for the lead entering the final turn, failed to
sustain the move and was best of the others. TAYLER'S CHROME , always well off the inner rail, lacked the needed rally. ROCKSTAR GIRL lacked speed,
steadied lacking room leaving the final turn and failed to be a factor. EVIL WOMAN showed speed along the inner rail and tired. BUTTER PECAN ,
unhurried behind horses early, failed to be a factor. FOGGY DREAMS showed speed inside horses and gave way. MIT MAZEL , checked in close quarters
entering the first turn, gave way approaching the final turn and was eased.

Footnotes
CYNERGY'S STAR stalked the early pace, advanced three deep leaving the backstretch to gain a short lead, opened up a bit in upper stretch, lugged in
near the sixteenth pole and held sway. SLAATS lacked speed under patient handling, raced in the three path between horses leaving the far turn and
rallied. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , never far back behind foes down the backstretch, eased out, moved up four deep turning for home and flattened out. UP
FOR THE CHANCE showed speed along the inner rail, battled to the stretch then weakened. BANDFROMTHEBAR , a forward factor outside horses for a
half mile, gave way on the far turn. LOCAL MOTIVE , outrun, pulled up leaving the backstretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MALIBU CIRCLE bumped with CHICO CON ALEX leaving the starting gate, rated inside horses, advanced along the inner rail around the far turn, eased
out in upper stretch, closed and took the lead late. FORE ON SEVEN stalked the pace, was well placed in the two path on the far turn and finished gamely.
FEROCIOUS STORM opened up along the rail on the backstretch, was still in front entering the stretch and gave way. SUPER SCOOBY lacked speed, was
no factor and passed tired rivals. FRANCIS X. , three wide the first turn, saved ground the far turn and was not a factor. CHICO CON ALEX bumped with the
winner leaving the starting gate and was no factor. RAEFORD , a forward factor inside horses to the stretch, gave way. NOW I'M BROKE , three wide both
turns, chased the pace and gave way.
