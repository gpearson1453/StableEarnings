and weakened through the stretch. TAMIAMI raced three wide off the leaders and lacked a solid bid. LEFTATTHEALTAR trailed to the stretch then passed
fading opponents. MISS CONSTITUTION moved four wide off the pace and faltered. CORBALLY stumbled badly at the start, rushed up inside and stopped.

THE BIG BLUFF prompted the pace three wide then wore down the pacesetter through the final eighth. WEIGHT OF GLORY set a clear pace inside to the
final furlong, continued gamely but was outfinished. BURN AND TURN was urged close up between rivals, loomed a threat but could not get by. EDDIE'S
CHARGE lacked speed, angled out on the turn and had no response. JACK GAVE BACK shuffled back early, raced wide and was no factor.
CONQUISTADOR SHOW raced close up between rivals and faded into the far turn. EXPLAIN broke sluggishly, rushed up inside then stopped abruptly.

ABHAILE set a pressured pace inside then pulled away on the final turn and remained safe driving. MARIANNA QUEEN settled inside, advanced after half
a mile, angled out in the stretch and was second best. CONGAREE ROSE dropped back outside and got up for the show award late. AMERICAN MONEY
was outrun while saving ground and never menaced. SPECTACULAR NOW reserved close up, bid three wide to contention then faded. YELLOWSTONE
GIRL pressed the winner outside for five furlongs and gave way. VISITING ANGEL lunged at the break then trailed throughout.

KOLOHE PRINCE settled outside, edged to the front into the stretch and edged clear. SOPHOS squeezed through at the top of the stretch, was roughly
bumped about, recovered and rallied. MOUNTAIN TREE moved clear inside on the final turn, was bumped soundly from his side losing his balance at the
top of the stretch. TEMPTING THE TIGER dropped well behind then passed rivals without menacing. DON'T RECALL was close up inside early, faded
before half a mile then came again. DREAMING THOUSAND hustled to the front early, dueled for half mile and gave way. RACEHORSEINARED dropped
back early and was always outrun. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident at the top of the stretch but the result was allowed to stand.

SINASHACK controlled the fractions inside, widened on the final turn and remained well clear driving. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN lacked speed, raced wide
and made a gradual gain through the stretch. DONZI saved ground throughout, was asked for run on the final turn but flattened out. GO SKIPPY GO
pursued the winner outside and continued willingly to the finish. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then caught a fading rival late. FOX IN THE FOG
dropped back inside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SHESALITTLE EDGY close up inside, bid to the front when ready at the quarter pole and drew away eagerly in a brisk hand ride. LOVE IN HER EYES
lacked speed, split foes rallying on the turn and closed well. EXCITABLE LADY saved ground off the leaders, moved out in the stretch and proved empty.
INCOMPARABLE broke very slowly, chased inside throughout rallying. PHILADELPHIA BELLE forced the pace outside to midway on the turn and gave
way. EMPRESS DEONA led in the two path, bore out on the turn and retreated. IMPERIAL MOON chased wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
THE CRITICAL WAY dueled three wide throughout, alternated for the advantage and outgamed rivals from both sides in a blanket finish. BATTLE STATION
chased four wide, moved closer at the top of the stretch, dropped back briefly then surged late just missing. FRANCATELLI vied between rivals and battled
gamely to the finish losing the head bobs. SO STREET settled behind a wall of pacesetters then made a gradual gain in the stretch. AMBLIN MAN dueled
along the inside, was clear briefly into the stretch and continued willingly. BORRACHO was urged close up between rivals, faded into the stretch but finished
well. WHERE YOU WAS trailed to the stretch then closed gap without menacing.
