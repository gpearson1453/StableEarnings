Footnotes
SPARKLE BLUE rated off the top trio in opening stages, moved up three wide to challenge for the lead near the three eighths pole, vied outside of AMAZON
QUEEN around the turn, shook free in the upper stretch, held a slim lead past the furlong marker, turned back the bid from SOFT TOUCH and finished
clear. SOFT TOUCH was a bit awkward at the start, tracked the leader racing inside through early stages, launched a three wide bid turning for home, raced
in striking range with a furlong left to run but could not reach SPARKLE BLUE and settled for second best. AMAZON QUEEN stalked the early leader,
moved up near the three eighths pole and matched strides with the winner around the turn, could not maintain equal terms in the upper stretch and gave
way. TIPHARAH had early speed then retreated after the half, galloped in and walked off.

Footnotes
MASTERING BELA settled through early stages, advanced four wide near the three eighths pole, cleared on top heading into the lane and stayed sharp
under steady urging. TILSA rated off the second flight in early stages, picked up the pace along the inside midway around the turn, angled out turning for
home, launched a three wide bid, was solid in response but had to settle for second best. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL tracked the pace between foes, was
ridden along the outside late on the turn, roused five wide into the lane and secured show. PIE KILLER was forwardly placed near the inside, angled out and
hustled up three wide into the lane then gave way. MICK'SBESTBETYET raced in the back, went five wide into the lane, angled in a couple paths under
pressure and failed to move on. TAR HEEL PALACE set the early pace, got collared late on the turn and retreated. SISTER SECRET LEE was forwardly
placed then emptied out around the turn, galloped in and walked off.

on the turn, was ridden along the rail then angled out three wide and captured place. SWIFT DANCER sped to the lead at the start, continued on top then
raced near equal terms with the winner around the turn, was no match for rival in the upper stretch, stayed on near the inside and held show. LEOVILLE
was stubborn to load, chased the top two leaders around the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane, drifted in a path under left handed urging and got
edged out for show. PLAYING GOLD showed response in opening stages then steadily retreated. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES was off slow at the start and

BIG RINNE tracked the pace near the inside, angled out and ridden along near the five sixteenths pole, roused forward to duel outside of THOMAND PARK,
battled gamely and prevailed under a driving finish. THOMOND PARK set the pace through early stages, saved ground into the lane, came under attack
from BIG RINNE in the upper stretch, dueled gamely from the inside and just missed. QUICK ENOUGH stalked the pacesetter around the far turn,
continued two wide in contention at the head of the lane then failed to sustain bid and gave way.

HIDDEN CONNECTION raced outside a rival in contention around the turn, given cue for more at the head of the lane, responded willingly, quickly took
control, tapped a few times, pulled away then finished in hand. OCEAN SIZE picked up the pace four wide around the turn, sustained a solid four wide bid
but had to settle for second best. DIA DE SOL raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide in the upper stretch, came out a path under pressure,
stayed on and prevailed for a share. CHARDONNAY chased two wide in contention, went two wide into the lane then gave way. MISS MIDNIGHT quickly
grabbed the lead, stayed clear on top around the turn, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch and weakened. HELIACAL RISING hustled along in
pursuit, raced in contention then went five wide into the lane and had no late response. ALEXA'S DREAM steadied in early stages and faded. TIZ NENA
raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response.

STRIDE rated not far off the pace, raced near the inside then angled out turning for home, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, got by ON SPOT
near the sixteenth pole and finished clear. ON SPOT set a pressured pace along the inside, dug in for more at the head of the lane, stayed on with response
then got worn down by the winner in late stages. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA pressed the pace through the backstretch, remained in aim around the far turn,
hustled up three wide into stretch run, angled in under pressure and stayed on for a share. SAVAGE SAILOR stalked three wide through early stages,
hustled up three to four wide into the lane, failed to keep pace and gave way. HIGH STOCK was not too far back in early stages then retreated midway
around the far turn.

WITTY BANTER settled nicely while in of the early leaders, was ridden along three wide at the five sixteenths pole, hustled up three wide into stretch run,
roused forward to challenge WOLVERETTE for the lead, matched strides briefly then drew clear. WOLVERETTE stalked the pacesetter through the
backstretch, was ridden along midway around the far turn, went two wide into stretch run, took over the lead from SAVED AT THE WIRE, came under attack
from WITTY BANTER in the final furlong, briefly matched strides then failed to move on with the winner. SAVED AT THE WIRE cleared on top and angled
inside, held firm around the far turn, got collared by WOLVERETTE in the upper stretch, stayed on under pressure and lasted for show. EASY'S FINAL
ROSE tracked the pace along the inside, went five wide into the lane and just missed show.

Footnotes
PECULIARITY sped to the lead at the start, set the pace around the turn, went two wide into the lane and pulled away from the field while being ridden out.
DANCING IN FIRE raced off the early speed, swung wide into the lane and rallied for place. SASSY MELLY chased in contention around the turn, stayed on
four wide into the lane and prevailed for a share. BOBBINI hustled along and raced in range around the turn, went four wide into the lane then angled in two
wide and needed more for late impact. NANIE'S TREASURE bobbled at the start, hustled up along the outside around the turn and lacked a needed rally in
the lane. DIVA GAL was ridden along three wide around the turn, hustled up four wide into the lane and never threatened. SEVEN O SIX UNION raced near
mid-range, hustled along two wide into the lane and lacked late response. PREGOLYA RIVER raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, angled out
in the upper stretch and failed to move on. JAENT chased in range around the turn then faded in the drive.
