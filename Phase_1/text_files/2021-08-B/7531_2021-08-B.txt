Footnotes
ABOVE THE LINE was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. SUPER DUPER was
hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. EASY ACCESS was off the pace and gained
ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. RIVER OF PEARLS was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. ESSA STAR was in touch and roused from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of
the stretch had no response. STEPITUPSTEPHANIE showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. MILWAUKEE GEM was
well back and showed little in a dull effort. NUDGENUDGEWINKWINK was in mid pack and saved ground on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

CASSIE'S RAINBOW forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. PLAY IT SMART was
unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. LOADED ONCE MORE was off slow and dueled on
the turn but was all out through the stretch. CHALDEA settled off the pace and saved ground on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
needed more. LAXMI was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. STARONTHEHORIZON
set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

on the far turn and angled out at the top of the stretch but needed more. CAUSE FOR ALARM was off slow and had the lead on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch gave way. KEEP GOING was up close but chased on the far turn and was no real threat. ICE CHALLENGE was off slow
and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact. LOQUACIOUS was off slow and showed nothing in a dull effort. SAN NICOLA BREW was in range but
