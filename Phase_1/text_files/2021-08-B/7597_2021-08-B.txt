Footnotes
KUORA (PER) traveled off the pace and angled to the inside first time through the stretch, shifted out with a quarter mile remaining, came three wide into
the stretch, rallied to the front past the eighth pole and drew away. ZABAVA settled outside a rival, stayed off the rail to the stretch, rallied and got up for
second. LOUD LOUD MUSIC pulled a bit early first time through the stretch, tracked the pace on the inside then moved to the two path, struck the front with
a furlong remaining but was overtaken soon after and got edged for the place late. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) unhurried in the beginning, steered to the inside,
went outside a rival on the far turn, got forced out at the three-sixteenths pole, improved position but failed to threaten. SO MUCH HAPPY away quickly to
take control, set the pace early on, padded the lead on the far turn, lost command with a furlong remaining and weakened in deep stretch. RUNWAY
DREAMER settled along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch and lacked a rally. LAVENDER (IRE) off slow to begin, trailed on the inside, saved
ground to the lane, got blocked behind a tiring TOO MUCH HEAVEN and checked hard in upper stretch, altered to gain a clear path and could not regain
momentum. TOO MUCH HEAVEN pulled early first time through the stretch, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, lost ground around the bend and faded in
the lane.

Footnotes
HOUSE LIMIT raced up close early on, bid outside the leader on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, took the lead near the eighth pole, battled through the
final sixteenth and proved best. STUDLY PERFECTION set the pace through the early stages, responded when challenged from HOUSE LIMIT, had the
rider lose his whip in upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. CONQUEST COBRA tracked the pace from inside, advanced up the backstretch, came
three wide into the lane and bested the rest. PRESS BRIEFING sat off the pace outside a rival early, exited the far turn four wide, kept on for a minor award
but never threatened. KENZOU'S RHYTHM angled to the two path early, traveled along the inside into the far turn, entered the stretch a bit off the rail and
never responded to urging. T BONES TRICK raced three wide into the first turn while outside a rival, checked approaching the three-eighths pole, stayed off
the rail into the drive and never made an impact. JAN'S RESERVE trailed early on, went three deep past the half-mile pole, entered the lane four wide and
failed to menace. FAST AS CASS tracked off the inside, dropped back while tiring on the far turn, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
OVIATT CLASS was in tight and steadied between foes entering the first turn, split foes around the second bend, ranged up four wide into the lane, took the
lead at the eighth pole, and drew away. FLYING DRUMMER jumped out to an early and angled over to the inside, dueled with CLAMPETT to the outside,
inched ahead at the four furlong marker, cleared at the three-eighths, asked when challenged at the five-sixteenths, held command through the turn and
upper stretch, relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. BAROSSA stalked the top pair off the rail, bid outside at the
five-sixteenths, dueled into the stretch and faltered in the final furlong. CARBONITE went three then two wide on the first turn, chased in range early on,
coaxed on the far turn and weakened. DERECHO DANDY took the first turn five then four wide, continued four wide through the second bend and lacked a
rally. CHARTER OAK settled along the inside, moved off the rail but lacked room and checked at the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide leaving the turn and
could not rally. ASTRONOMER raced off the pace early on, exited the far turn four wide and came up empty. CLAMPETT pressed the pace from outside
then went up to duel for command, continued to apply pressure to the far turn, lost contact at the three-eighths and tired. BRIGHT LEAF traveled six wide
into the first turn, angled down to the four path, went three wide into the far turn and lacked further response.

JACK SPROUT traveled along the inside then shifted to the two path on the far turn, reeled in the leader mid-stretch and outkicked STEAK AND CHEESE in
the final sixteenth. STEAK AND CHEESE broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled two wide then moved to the inside, angled three wide on the
second bend, rallied alongside JACK SPROUT in the stretch and got outkicked in deep stretch. GOOD BYE PUTIN trailed early, went outside a rival, angled
in on the second bend, summoned a mild rally but could not threaten the top pair. AVIGALE (IRE) broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, established
the front early, widened leaving the backstretch, continued well clear to the eighth pole but weakened in the final furlong. MY INDY raced two wide around
the first turn, went four wide on the far turn and improved position. SILENT MUSKETIER tracked outside a rival off the pace, angled to the rail on the far turn
and lacked further response. MEADWAY brushed from outside at the start, unhurried on the inside, tipped to the two path on the second bend, angled out in
the stretch and was never a factor. HAMMERING LEMON bumped in the beginning, was closest in pursuit in the early stages, chased along the inside into
the lane and weakened. CONSTANT CONFLICT went three wide around both turns and failed to menace.

MISS BIGLY pressed the pace from between rivals early, dueled around the far turn, led into the stretch, lost command with a furlong to go, battled back in
deep stretch and edged the runner-up under right-handed urging. PAIGE ANNE set the pace on the inside under pressure, dueled with MISS BIGLY on the
second bend, lost the lead into the stretch, battled back to regain the lead at the eighth pole, battled through deep stretch and got outkicked in the closing
moments. HARPER'S GALLOP chased outside the top trio, continued four wide to the lane and lacked a needed bid. FIRST STAR had speed outside the
top pair, lost ground on the far turn and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
GREGORY'S PRIDE chased the speed along the rail then tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside at the eighth pole, took over midstretch and held well
under urging. GO ON angled to the inside to track the pace, steered out on the turn and came four wide into the lane, put in a late run but was not enough.
SAI CON (FR) cleared early and moved to the inside, set the pace next the rail to the stretch, held a short lead with a furlong to go and yielded to the top
pair. AURELIAN MAN chased off the inside then outside a rival, went three wide into the drive and finished evenly. SECRET WEAPON traveled off the pace
and steered to the inside, moved to the two path around the turn, came back to the rail in the drive but needed to find more late. EAGLE CHIEF sat off the
pace, took the turn to wide, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. MARINERS WAY chased widest early then maneuvered down to the two path, stayed
in that lane to the stretch and weakened. TIZ THE TALE broke slow and dropped back to spot the field several lengths, angled in to save ground on the turn
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DONCIC set the pace under a hold early, steered down to the two path, inched away on the inside through the turn, roused in upper stretch, powered away
in the drive and coasted home in the final sixteenth. BORKAN chased on the inside into the turn, moved a bit off the rail around the bend and bested the
rest. SAFE COMBINATION bobbled shortly after the start, tracked three deep into the turn, driven three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. ME MACHO
trailed early on, raced along the inside into the turn, angled five wide around the turn, summoned a mild response and rounded out the superfecta. PICK
YOUR BID broke well then became rank early, was hard to ride again into the turn, stayed inside then two wide into the stretch and never rallied. PROUD
VETERAN came away awkwardly, raced in range four wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide and failed to respond when called upon. MONEY BACK
chased outside rivals up the backstretch, navigated the turn five then four wide and weakened. DREAMED IT was off slow to begin, raced between rivals
then three deep on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. SIROCCO turned his head and was off a bit slow at the start, went up to chase
behind the leader, between foes into the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.
