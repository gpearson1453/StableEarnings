COMFORT ME NOW was allowed to settle early towards the inside, eased out by the quarter pole and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and drew off to
prove much the best under a drive. TUF INTENSITY was reserved early and advanced four to five wide on the turn and finished willingly to be clearly
second best. HUCKLEBERRY HILL set the pace while racing off the rail and was headed leaving the turn and weakened, bested rest. WARRIOR'S
REMARK was settled back towards the inside and came six wide into the drive but offered no rally. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE was bumped at the start, was
settled and then chased the pace three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. A LITTLE IRRADIC pulled and was hard to handle on the inside on the
first turn, then tracked the pace on the backstretch and was weakening on the turn, clipped heels by the quarter pole and stumbled causing the rider to fall
off, walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUN AROUND THE QUARTER POLE BUT AFTER REVIEW THE RACE WAS
LEFT AS IS.

Footnotes
AMICABLE was rated along towards the inside but not on the rail, then eased out on the turn to make a four wide bid, gained a short lead leaving the turn,
but was passed by the furlong marker then dug in and came back to get up late under a drive. HUMBLE WARRIOR was settled back and raced four to five
wide on the backstretch, made a five wide move on the turn and gained a short lead past the furlong marker but hung once he hit the front, clearly second
best. JUST PHIL tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command then came up empty in the drive, bested rest. PABLO'S
SUN was reserved early in between horses, advanced three wide on the turn but lacked a late rally. AIR PAYNTER was reserved on the inside to the half
mile marker, then angled out five wide to the three eighths pole, then moved in to be three wide by the quarter pole, swung wide for the drive, to pass the
tiring rivals. EXPRESS MAIL was well placed early and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command then weakened. MONEY MAN BRYLAN was
allowed to settle early while three wide and tired. BONNIE BILL was rank and wide on the first turn, then moved to the inside to set the pace and stopped.
