Footnotes
GRIS TORMENTA broke out at the start, raced in the middle of the pack, moved up, four wide around the turn, made a bid down the stretch five wide and
drove clear. FURKA PASS challenged for the early lead, took the advantage at the head of the stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was best
of others. LITESTER broke out, raced within contention, took the lead at the head of the stretch, couldn't match strides with the top two, but held on for
show. MISS JANA bothered at the start, racing near the back, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LINDOLA'S GAL pressed the early pace, weakened,
finished inside and was no threat late. LOTS OF GOLD went to the front, saved ground around the turn and faded. ROADSIDE GIRL broke in, raced evenly
near the back and was no threat. EVIE'S REWARD forced out at the break and was never close. QUEEN KINLEY forced in at the start and never mounted
a bid. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

BIG TINY void of early speed, moved up, five wide around the turn, made a wide rally and was going away at the end. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS went to the
front, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. SAINT KENNEDY raced within striking distance, came around the turn
four wide, made a bid, couldn't match strides with the top two, but was best of rest. G KATE pressed the pace, faded and finished evenly. CAUSE SHE'S
