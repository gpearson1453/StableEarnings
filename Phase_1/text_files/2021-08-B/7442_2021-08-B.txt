Footnotes
SATIATE raced in the two path around the first turn, opened up an easy lead while racing up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path
and held off a closer in late stretch. BALLYBRACK LASS chased the leader from the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, raced in the two path around the far turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, and gained ground steadily throughout the
stretch, but could not get by the winner. KURINGAI was brushed and pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch off the pace on the inside, made a mild bid while saving ground around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. LITTLE CHICK trailed
the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SENSE OF SELF tracked the leading pair while slightly keen early, edged closer to the leading pair pas the eleven sixteenths, stalked them in the four to
five path on the far turn, engaged the leading pair in earnest past the three eighths, took the lead outside of GOOD MONGOLIA and LADY BREXIT
approaching the furlong mark, and drew clear under a mild drive. LADY BREXIT tracked behind the leader through the clubhouse turn and into the
backstretch, raced a bit keenly down the backstretch, encroached outside of GOOD MONGOLIA past the five eighths, prompted two wide on the turn and in
upper stretch, had no answer when SENSE OF SELF raced past near the furlong mark, but dueled outside of GOOD MONGOLIA to the finish and got the
place bob. GOOD MONGOLIA cleared into the clubhouse turn, was engaged by LADY BREXIT to her outside past the five eighths, continued on a narrow
lead inside of that foe around the far turn and into upper stretch, was headed by SENSE OF SELF near the furlong mark, proved no match for that one,
continued to duel for place inside of LADY BREXIT but lost the bob for place. WATCHIN THE WHEELS settled at the rear inside, took closer order down the
backstretch, chased just behind the leading trio in the two to three path around the far turn, was driven into the lane and had no rally.

LIPLINER broke quickly, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch,
and drew off down the lane. MANHATTAN LEGACY trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the
turn, began a bid between horses passing the quarter pole and gained ground on the inside down the stretch, while never threatening the winner. RANK
AND FILE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, could not go
with the winner entering the stretch and was caught for the place after drifting out in late stretch. LION LOVE raced off the pace on the outside in the early
going, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. CHARLO chased the leader up the backstretch on the inside, saved ground
around the turn, and tired from there.

Footnotes
DRESSED raced at the inside of the tracking flight around the clubhouse turn, chased at the inside of a tight main pack down the backstretch, settled back
into the far turn, swung out near the three eighths and bid five wide, vied outside of MISS Z from the quarter, cleared approaching the furlong pole and
prevailed under a hand ride while drifting out. CHACALOSA tracked the pace between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, raced
two wide in the tracking flight around the far turn, came into the lane between horses with the leading flight, proved no match for DRESSED past the furlong
pole but chased on best of the rest. MISS Z cleared to the lead while racing keenly into the first turn, continued on the lead down the backstretch and while
saving ground through the far turn, vied inside of DRESSED in upper stretch, proved no match approaching the furlong pole, flattened in the final eighth but
held the show. LADY CLARE settled two wide in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn, raced at the rear down the backstretch, began to improve
approaching the far turn, raced in the three path around that bend, swung out into upper stretch, improved position outside of foes, stayed on with good
interest in the final furlong and missed the show. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE settled near the rear early, lost position after being bumped by FORCE OF
INERTIA while approaching the far turn when that foe floated out, raced at the rear in the four path on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and passed
tiring horses. FORCE OF INERTIA broke a step slowly, raced at the inside of the rear flight through the clubhouse turn, improved to join the rear of the main
group down the backstretch while racing between horses, floated out and bumped ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE while racing down the backstretch, advanced to
race four wide in the tracking flight around the far turn, proved no match for the leading trio into the lane and weakened. CHINKARA tracked the leader three
wide through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the pace down the backstretch, was pushed along three wide between horses in the tracking flight on
the far turn, stopped past the three eighths and was not persevered with in the lane.

nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch, pulled clear in the final furlong and held off a late closer to save the win. AND WON raced in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to improve position while racing around the far turn, entered the stretch in the
three path, gained ground steadily down the lane and ran out of ground before the wire. DRIVER DAN was reluctant to load, urged to lead right out of the
gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in late
stretch. ANDREAS raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from
the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong. MCHENRY raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and came up empty from there. FORT RIDGE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded on the rail in the stretch. MAXIMUS IMAGE

Footnotes
RADIANT CASTLE settled toward the rear of a strung-out field through the clubhouse turn, rallied into the backstretch, joined outside the chasing flight near
the five eighths, sustained his bid three wide on the far turn, led approaching the five sixteenths, drove clear in upper stretch and continued to improve under
a drive while kept to the task to the sixteenth. ROAR OF THE LION soon trailed, was unhurried to the half, regained touch with the field while racing in the
four to five path on the far turn, sustained his circling bid in a menacing manner approaching the quarter, could not match RADIANT CASTLE from upper
stretch, but kept on with interest and outfinished UPHAM for the place. UPHAM settled in second last, began to take closer order past the five eighths,
continued to rally in the five path around the far turn, was driven in range two wide into the lane, proved no match for RADIANT CASTLE from upper stretch,
chased on but was outfinished by ROAR OF THE LION for place. WHITE MIST chased at the middle of a strung-out field early, improved to chase the
leading pair outside of DANCIN NICKY for the backstretch run, improved position in the four path on the far turn, but could not sustain his rally past the
quarter pole and weakened. DANCIN NICKY tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase well behind the leading pair down the
backstretch while racing inside of WHITE MIST, was outkicked by foes rallying from behind him while racing in the two path around the far turn, and drifted
out in the lane. VENETIAN DREAM was asked for early speed inside, vied inside of AZRAEL around the clubhouse turn, hounded inside of that foe down
the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, was headed by RADIANT CASTLE approaching the five sixteenths, and emptied out inside. AZRAEL vied
outside of VENETIAN DREAM around the clubhouse turn, set the pace down the backstretch while prompted by that same foe while well clear of the rest of
the field, dueled two wide around the far turn as other foes began to take closer order, stopped approaching the five sixteenths, and was not persevered
with in the lane.
