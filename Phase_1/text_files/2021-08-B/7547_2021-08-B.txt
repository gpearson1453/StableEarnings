Footnotes
QUEEN'S MISSION was sent to a clear early lead, lengthened command on the bend, was put to a drive upper stretch, continued to draw away then was
allowed to coast inside the final sixteenth. PEYOTE PEGGY hesitated at the start, raced in contention from inside, moved clear for second on the turn,
fanned out for the stretch run and proved easily second best. VERRAZANO WOMAN broke alertly, was soon chasing QUEEN'S MISSION from outside then
began to fade two wide on the bend. BRING THE ZING also hesitated then broke inward, soon moved out widest and was never a factor. The quarter, half
and five-furlong fractions were hand timed.

GHAALEB'S RANGER broke on top and was hustled to a clear lead, roused again leaving the bend, put to a drive upper stretch, was kept to task until the
last sixteenth then finished ridden out. SAMARITA raced in contention just off the inside for a half mile, drew clear for second leaving the turn, moved to the
rail upper stretch and steadily pulled away for the place. MISS FOO FOO urged from outside in the early going, began to yield before finishing a half mile.

SAFE soon moved to the outside while in hand, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, rallied under a drive, took
over with a sixteenth left and began to draw off under urging in the waning yards. ROCKET MAN ATTACK shared the early lead inside LAYTON THE DAY,
moved ahead on the turn, floated out to path two for the drive, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but proved easily second best. LAYTON THE DAY
broke with ROCKET MAN ATTACK, vied for the lead outside that one, flattened out in the lane but held onto third under steady handling. SNOOZER
hesitated at the start, raced in contention from inside for three furlongs, drifted out under left-handed pressure nearing the eighth pole, lugged in when
switched to right-handed urging and finished evenly. BLEEDING BLUE also hesitated at the break, was urged along from outside but had little to offer.

CHERNYAHOVSKIY shared the early lead in hand inside MY CURBY, was let out leaving the second bend, put to a drive midstretch and kept JOHNNY
LONGBOAT at bay. JOHNNY LONGBOAT settled at the back, commenced his bid after a half mile to reach contention along the inside on the second
bend, took over second leaving that turn, threatened with a furlong left, leveled off in the late going but was easily second best. NOT CHOPPED LIVER
chased the top pair from outside and began to fade after five and a half furlongs. MY CURBY contested the pace outside CHERNYAHOVSKIY for nearly six
furlongs, drifted out entering the lane and steadily gave way.

bend, edged ahead in the lane but did not have enough left in the waning yards. AUNT STELLA broke on top, vied for the lead from inside, battled in the
stretch but began to wear down the last sixteenth. SHE'S A BIG STAR raced in contention from outside, was four wide taking the bend and failed to have a
stretch bid. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS hesitated at the break, was soon taken inside, angled out through the turn, came widest into the lane and had no late

Footnotes
TOTALLY DOVISH took the lead from inside after entering the main trail, showed the way in hand, was asked leaving the bend, moved clear under a drive
upper stretch, was all out in the late going and narrowly held on. PRANCIPANTS in contention from the beginning, waited for room just off the rail on the
turn, got through two wide at the head of the lane, rallied under a steady drive, closed well, was outnodded but easily best of the rest. LINDALOUIMAGE
well placed just outside TOTALLY DOVISH, was under a drive from between rivals on the turn, fanned out some entering the stretch, gradually yielded,
lugged in some the final sixteenth but held onto third. PALAGO boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch, failed to keep up three wide on the bend,
fanned out behind ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE into the lane, moved outside that one upper stretch and made up minor ground the last eighth. ROCK THE
BIRDHOUSE broke on top, was soon chasing TOTALLY DOVISH from outside, three then four wide through the turn, began to wear down and gradually
angled in the final furlong. DIAMOND GUCCI failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

MARLEE prominent just outside MEETMEINSTLOUIE, went for the lead two wide between rivals on the bend, battled through the lane and was bumped a
couple times as she edged ahead near the wire. LA GUERRERITA prompted the pace from between horses, commenced her bid three wide on the turn,
edged ahead approaching the last furlong, lugged in some under right-handed pressure in the waning yards, bumped MARLEE a couple time and was
outfinished. ABBMAR jostled briefly with MEETMEINSTLOUIE leaving the chute, was kept close from inside, roused into the lane, blocked upper stretch,
altered out four wide inside the last eighth, rallied the final seventy yards, came up short but was drawing off for third. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS was kept
close from outside, lost ground four wide on the bend, floated out further entering the stretch, had every chance but failed to have the needed late kick.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE jostled briefly with ABBMAR leaving the chute, set a pressured pace from inside, was challenged on the bend, fought through the
stretch but began to wear down the last seventy yards. LITTLE MOLITTA made a small leap from the gate, was hustled up between rivals, had the rail on
the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run lae. MIKE'S LADY chased, running widest of all most of the time, and had no
late bid. BURKHART saved ground and was never a factor.
