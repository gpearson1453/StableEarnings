Footnotes
JUNE GLOOM went right to the front, set the pace to the backstretch then second time, turned back SECOND BOLD then drifted out into the stretch but
held driving. SECOND BOLD tracked the winner, made a bid three wide but was turned away then dug in determinedly to just save the place. PEQUENO
MONTE was settled for a half mile, came three then four wide to the stretch and just missed second. FORT YORK chased the pace for three eighths then
dropped back and was not a factor. I'M MISTER AMERICA had no speed and was always outrun. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN bore out badly to the eight path on
the first turn and lost any chance.
