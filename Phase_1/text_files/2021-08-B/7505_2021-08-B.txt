PARTYPARTYARTIE stalked from outside, went three wide on the turn, struck the lead just outside the sixteenth pole and edged away. KATRINA CLASSIC
cleared under some coaxing and shifted in to set the pace two wide, was outkicked. MAX A MILLION RSS was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders
inside, fanned six wide through the turn and gained late. SPECIAL WINGS was bumped at the break, shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn pressing from inside but had no extra. ROLL ON CHARITY was very hard to load then a little fractious in the gate, bumped the inside foe at the
start, switched outside, went four to five wide on the turn and was not a threat. R ALLIE bumped a rival at the start, was mid-pack three wide and had no
rally. BRANDISTYLED saved ground to no avail. SPANKEY THUNDER was in pursuit four wide on the turn then faded.

Footnotes
SLAMMED stalked the leader early, took closer order on the turn going three to four wide on that bend, struck the lead near the three-sixteenths and kicked
clear. COUNT THEM AGAIN set the pace from off the rail in the two path into the turn, was no match for the winner but held the place.
PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN was outside foes off the early pace, went six then five wide on the turn, drifted out a hair in upper stretch, kicked on mildly to
secure show honors. LET IT ROLL shifted in leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, evened out in the lane. SHUGS CHARLIE
tracked from inside, lacked the needed late kick. GRACEANNE raced wide going six to seven deep on the turn and passed tired rivals. FLIGHT SONG was
inside a rival five then four wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and had no rally. DEVON'S CHOICE switched out at the seven-sixteenths, went
three then four wide on the turn, came up empty in the drive. MOVIN ON broke a half-step slowly, moved out from two to four wide on the turn and a bit
wider into upper stretch, failed to make a bid. SEXY BIKINI MODEL stumbled at the break, went in the five path on the turn and had no rally. PEGGY B
FAST raced on or just off the rail and came up empty. ATTILA'S TATTLE broke a step slowly and was consequently in a bit tight at the start, went three to
four wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
BAYERN TO BE WILD settled mid-pack, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, took aim and drove past in the final sixteenth. FLICKERING LIGHT
exchanged a bump at the break, shifted out entering the gap, edged closer four wide on the turn, made a bid in mid-stretch, was no match for the winner but
secured the place. MO GEE took over the lead after the opening furlong and shifted in once clear, set the pace two wide, was challenged in upper stretch,
dueled through mid-stretch and kept on. ME AND JACK switched out after clearing the gap, went three to four wide on the turn, very briefly lacked room in
behind foes in upper stretch then ran on mildly. LINCOLN COUNTY KID pursued the leading pair three wide and failed to rally. KICK IT led for the opening
furlong then continued to track shifting in to the rail, saved ground and came up empty. JEDI WARRIOR exchanged a bump at the start, raced well back
alongside a foe going two to three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TOX was mid-pack early, raced two wide and
came up empty. OFF THE WAGON broke inwardly just a bit, saved ground on or off the rail and was not a threat.
