Footnotes
GRAMERCY tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path while racing around the turn, took the lead
entering the stretch and drew off down the lane under a hand ride. STOPSHOPPINGAMY chased the leaders on the outside through the opening three
eighths of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. FIELD
LETTERS raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, trailed the field up what remained of the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and was outkicked late. MARY OF BETHANY stalked the
frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, made a mild improvement of position in upper stretch and was
outfinished from there. LADY ATLANTIC led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and tired on the rail in
the final furlong. U CAN DO IT raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
MY MY MUNNY broke sharply, tracked well behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, began a bid past the half, swept to the lead in the three path just
past the three eighths, quickly opened up, ran on under a drive midstretch and always held safe. MAID OF HONOR raced between horses near the rear,
continued patiently in the three path on the turn, began to rally into the lane, split horses at the three sixteenths, continued inside under a drive through
midstretch, and gained to the finish while gradually drifting out late. PERFECT DIVA chased midpack down the backstretch and in the four to five path on
the turn, continued four wide into the lane, improved three wide into the final furlong under a drive but was outkicked for the place. SHARP HERO tracked
the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, proved no match for MY MY MUNNY, and
flattened out between horses in the final furlong. JOAN'S WAY raced inside foes near the rear early, came into the turn between horses as HOSTILE
PRINCESS began to improve inside, chased in the four path around the far turn, swung out five wide into upper stretch, and chased on evenly late.
COLOROFACLOUD raced three wide near the rear early, was relegated to the rear into the turn, raced in the four to five path around that bend, came into
the lane in the three path and lacked the needed rally. HOSTILE PRINCESS stumbled badly at the start, settled at the rear early, began an inside bid past
the five eighths, chased midfield in the two path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and weakened. FINE COTTON was hustled inside and sent
clear, set the pace while well clear, carried a diminishing lead in the two path on the turn, was caught just past the three eighths, and faded inside.

Footnotes
DANVILLE was bumped soundly between horses in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, began to edge closer from past the five eighths, continued
to improve inside around the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, sustained his rally under a drive in the lane, and got up inside the sixteenth mark.
PACKED HOUSE came in and bumped DANVILLE in the opening strides, cleared into the clubhouse turn, opened up further down the backstretch, kept on
well clear in the two path on the far turn and into the stretch, went to a drive midstretch, but could not hold off DANVILLE in the final sixteenth. TORNADO
BOY chased at the middle of a stretched-out field early, took closer order between horses on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, dropped inside in
upper stretch, rallied with good interest inside, and outfinished a foe for the show. POLICY OPTION raced two wide in the rear flight early, settled in second
last around the far turn, began to edge closer past the five eighths, continued to improve three wide around the far turn, swung out into the six path and was
driven in upper stretch, responded with a rally but was outkicked for the show. DOLLAR BLUE chased well behind the leading pair, saved ground around
the far turn while still well behind that duo, was urged inside into the lane while proving no match for PACKED HOUSE, and flattened out three wide late.
BATTLE CREEK settled at the rear of a well-strung field, took mildly closer order in the three path on the far turn, was driven two wide in the lane and lacked
the needed kick. TWO COOKIE RULE came in during the opening strides and bumped DANVILLE, chased in closest range of the leader but still well behind
him, continued to chase in the three path on the far turn, floated in to the lane five wide between horses and weakened.

of the pack, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground between horses in late stretch. OVERPRAISE saved ground around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, and flattened out late. GIANT'S FORREST
raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, gained ground coming into the
stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. DARK WOOD (IRE) raced in the two and three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, gained mild ground in late stretch and was not a threat. SMILING SILAS raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and tired between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TEMPER TANTRUM stumbled badly at the break, chased midfield, took closer order to the leading trio down the backstretch, bid three wide around the far
turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, shifted three wide midstretch, found his best in the final sixteenth and caught FIRST MASAMUNE in the final fifty
yards. FIRST MASAMUNE stalked two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, attended the pace two wide around the far turn, took the
lead approaching the quarter, cleared through midstretch, kept on under a drive but was caught in the final fifty yards. RED FLAG ALERT chased midfield,
took closer order as the pack contracted down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, and rallied under a
drive. WAR CHEST tracked the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn, continued in the pocket down the backstretch and around the far turn, was
driven two wide into the lane, kept on with interest but was outfinished for the show. ONE WAY HOME raced keenly while clearing to the early lead, carried
a diminishing advantage in the two path on the far turn, was headed by FIRST MASAMUNE nearing the quarter pole, began to lose position while racing
under a drive inside in upper stretch, and weakened late. BARLEEWON trailed through the opening half mile, took slightly closer order in the two to three
path around the far turn, floated six wide into the lane, was forced further out when MKAR THE FAST came out in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses.
CAPT. MAESTRI was off a bit slow, settled near the rear inside of MKAR THE FAST, saved ground around the far turn while still inside that foe, was driven
three wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. MKAR THE FAST settled near the rear outside of CAPT. MAESTRI, continued two wide toward the
rear around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, pushed BARLEEWON out when coming out further in upper stretch, and faded.
