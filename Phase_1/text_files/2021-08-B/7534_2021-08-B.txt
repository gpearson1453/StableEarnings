HEREWECOMETOGETYOU lacked early speed, made a late bid, rallied down the stretch and got up in time. SABER RUN raced within contention, drifted
in down the stretch, bumped DIABLO CAT and was outfinished for the win. CUSTOM BOBBY'S pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, drifted out
down the lane and proved no match for the top two. BERNIE SPECIAL was an early factor, came around the turn three wide, checked down the lane,
getting in tight quarters and faded. SUGARLAND EXPRESS raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. MY PAL MATTIE void of early speed and
was outrun. DIABLO CAT went to the front, drove clear, was bumped and checked down the stretch after getting in tight quarters on the rail and dropped
back. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. ALSO THE JOCKEY OF #4 BERNIE SPECIAL LODGED A CLAIM
OF FOUL AGAINST #2 CUSTOM BOBBY'S FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALLIFIED #5
