Footnotes
POINT OF HUMOR intent on the lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun three wide for home, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. NO BURN hustled from the start, chased four then three wide
before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing on the leader, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to be along
well clear of the rest and second best, then got pulled up after the finish appearing to be having heat issues and was attended to by the veterinarian and
subsequently walked off under his own power. UNCLE SKEETS hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide for home and weakened. CALL HOME chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch
and tired. NAPOLEON COMPLEX five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, went four wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. VALUE CHAIN coaxed from the start, crossed directly to the rail and chased
along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CASALSA was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of a foe, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker
and was fully extended to prevail. U. S. STEEL bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the outside of the winner then pressed that foe, vied in the
two path on the turn, spun three wide under pressure into the stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed
crop in pursuit of the winner just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. QUICK RETURN chased the pace from third,
dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then came under the crop, remained on his inside lead while chasing to
the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. FOREST SPIRIT bumped with an opponent at
the start, settled near the back under some urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch then drifted further out and failed
to threaten. TALLAJ was ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, dropped back while still on his inside
lead into the final furlong and failed to respond. EXTREME FORCE ran-off with the rider during the warm-up, was pulled up by the outrider along the outside
fence after running off for over a half-mile, showed no speed under urging from the start, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and was no
factor.

Footnotes
POCKET SQUARE (GB) bobbled at the start, tracked inside early on before tipping to the two path midway on the first turn settling unhurried just off the
inside, remained patiently handled until given some rein to work with three furlongs from home, began a steady advance and swung four wide into upper
stretch, getting roused straightened away, rallied to overthrow the leader just inside the eighth pole, then drew clear to the finish to prevail. KEY BISCAYNE
lightly coaxed from the gate, raced two to three paths off the rail past the stands the initial time before briefly tucking in behind BRAMBLE BAY into the turn
along the inside, tipped out to the two path soon after and settled in closest aim of the leader before advancing to latch on that rival half a mile from home,
steadily whittled away at the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive between foes to the eighth pole before running on to win the battle for the place honors. BRAMBLE BAY established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in
under threat from a pair and was displaced from command just inside the eighth pole, dug in battling on with the aforementioned foe but was ultimately
bested by that rival for the place honors while safe for the show. HUNGRY KITTEN broke out a step at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and improved position by a rival while making no late headway on the front. HOGANS
HOLIDAY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide at the head of the stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
DIGITAL FUTURE broke out a step at the start and traded a bump with ONE THE DEAN'S LIST, raced inside briefly before tipping out to the two path
shifting out BECKENBAUER to the three path settling just off the pace tracking the front, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter
pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in tussling with the runner up holding a narrow advantage and
came inwards steps from the wire under a right sided crop to prevail by a neck. FIRST LAW three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path
and advanced on that rival latching on to press the issue with three-eighths to go, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive between foes a
furlong out, fought on inside the top one to the finish shying in steps from the wire as that rival came inwards. KAWHI ME A RIVER struck the near side stall
at the start and broke towards the top despite it, tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch, was under a light drive in behind COOL
QUEST gaining clearance along the hedge inside that rival intermittently while unable to catch the seam, paused briefly a sixteenth out as COOL QUEST
came slightly inwards before being able to move through the lane late running on to get up by a head for the show honors. COOL QUEST lightly coaxed just
off the inside down the backstretch showing the way, tucked inside through the turn coming under increasing pressure to the outside, got coaxed along at
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared a furlong out, dug in getting outfinished in the
late stages. PARTNER'S HOPE got bumped at the start by BECKENBAUER breaking inwards, then got pinballed between that rival and ONE THE DEAN'S
LIST for two more bumps before being pinched out between rivals conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered no response. BECKENBAUER broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe before
pinching that rival out in tandem with ONE THE DEAN'S LIST, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for
home and weakened. CANYOUHEARMENOW chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths and tired. ON THE DEAN'S LIST broke inwards
brushing the near side stall before trading a bump with DIGITAL FUTURE and then ricocheting off that rival to bump PARTNER'S HOPE in concert with
BECKENBAUER before squeezing that rival between back, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home
and made no impact.

SARATOGA CHROME angled in early, became keen under restraint nearing the first turn then came out four wide into that bend before dropping to the
three path, settled near the back on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed
crop, closed strongly into the final furlong, drifted in while coming to the leader approaching the sixteenth-pole and bothered WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE then
got up under a continued right-handed crop to prevail. WATERVILLE bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn
in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, went three wide early on the final turn, was roused while moving four then five wide later on that bend,
rallied outside into the stretch, closed fast to take the lead while moving inward just inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then
was overtaken while able to get the place. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE settled off the pace while saving ground, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, came
under the crop after turning into the stretch, moved out behind the leaders while gaining at the furlong marker, chased on the inside of the winner, was
forced in at the sixteenth-pole then steadied and finished willingly but missed the place while clear for the show. PREPOSTEROUS brushed the gate at the
start, moved in near the back, was rank into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was reserved towards the back, raced inside to the two path on
the final turn, was asked late on that bend then came under the crop in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SOLIB went to the front, set the pace in hand
while on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths and gave way.
OAK LOVES A FIGHT moved in early, was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved off the rail outside the
quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and weakened. SWEET SUGAR BABY was hustled from the break, rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked the
pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, moved to the three path while chasing late on that bend, dropped back into the
stretch and tired. FALSE HOPE went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside, came under urging while three then four wide on

settled on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, dropped to the rear in the three path on the far turn and failed to respond.

and was no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SARATOGA CHROME, ALLEGING
INTEFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH-POLE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, SARATOGA CHROME WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND

SERVE THE KING (GB) just off the inside tracking the loose pair out front, took closer order with the rest of the field on those rivals into the far turn, got set
down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge taking command a sixteenth from home, dug in gamely to fend off a rival to the
finish. RY'S THE GUY came under brief light coaxing from the gate and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn and into the stretch the first
time, had CONVICTION TRADE take over past the stands and tracked that rival just off the inside in closest aim well clear of the rest through the second
turn, took closer order on the leader into the far turn as the rest of the field closed in from in behind, grabbed command just inside the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, battled on to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. FANTASIOSO
(ARG) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to secure
the show honors. SHAMROCKET just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper
stretch and kept on one paced to the finish. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route at the quarter pole and tipped out to the two path straightened away, then weakened in the stretch. RED KNIGHT
mostly two to three wide in pursuit with the exception of down the backstretch when five paths off the rail, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths three
wide, bid four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. CONVICTION TRADE off last, advanced three wide outside rivals into the first turn to be
forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader, went five paths off the inside through the stretch the initial time taking over with nine furlongs to run, showed
the way with a sole rival in striking range as the rest of the field grew distant, came under light coaxing into the far turn as the field took closer order and
RY'S THE GUY advanced outside, yielded the front five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. Due to a teletimer operator
error the split for one mile and a half was unavailable.

Footnotes
UNICORN SALLY dropped back on the inside early, was reserved while saving ground, came under urging on the final turn, swung four wide into the stretch
then moved further out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. ALBA'S STAR showed early speed and went to the front, was
taken in hand and conceded the lead when SKY KITTEN advanced on the outside, became rank at that point and tugged hard at the bit into the first turn,
followed the leader in the two path, moved closer on the final turn, took the lead while asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a right-handed crop into
the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop while clinging to an advantage into the final sixteenth, drifted out and bothered MY CANDY GIRL late and
was denied while able to get the place. JOQULAR went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two then three path,
was roused inside the five-sixteenths then swung five wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid between foes late and just
missed while able to get the show. KITTEN'S ROMANCE was reserved while saving ground, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out near the
sixteenth-pole then had her path taken and finished willingly. MY CANDY GIRL moved in on the opening straightaway, rounded the first turn in the two path,
was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was asked four wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final sixteenth, checked
when ALBA'S STAR came out late and just missed the superfecta. JAZZY LADY broke a step slow, went two to three wide on the turns, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and improved position. GIGGLE FACTORY was reserved in the two path, came under urging inside the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. WICKED AMBER was caught four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide
on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. TWO CENT TOOTSIE
was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside, was taken in hand while off heels outside the quarter-pole then roused shortly thereafter, moved out inside
the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. SEEKING REVENGE went two to three wide on the turns, swung five wide into the stretch then quickly moved further
out and was no factor. SKY KITTEN reared at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside to take the lead before
the first turn, dropped from three to two wide on that bend, opened up a sizable advantage, vied inside on the far turn, spun into the two path entering the
stretch then was headed before the three-sixteenths and faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF MY CANDY GIRL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
ALBA'S STAR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW,
ALBA'S STAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE LATE IN THE STRETCH
