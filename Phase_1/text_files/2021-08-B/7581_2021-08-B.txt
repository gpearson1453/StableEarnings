Footnotes
PETER D led in the two path, moved clear on the turn then eagerly widened in hand through the stretch. LOOSE ENDS lacked speed, advanced wide and
finished with good energy. DONTFORGETTOBLINK broke a bit awkwardly, advanced inside then tired late. CRABS N BEER went after the winner on the
turn then proved empty in the stretch. NEIGH DUDE prompted the pace along the rail to the far turn and began fading. WINE TO ROSES raced outside and
weakened steadily. ROCKY DICE lagged far behind throughout. ABENDEGO made a brief bid inside on the turn then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ATTA KID well placed inside the dueling leaders, angled out to secure room into the stretch and was up in time with a late surge. UNCONQUERED SPIRIT
set a measured pace, inched away on the final turn then battled very gamely to the finish. SHENDAM (FR) reserved in the clear, advanced swiftly into the
stretch, loomed a danger but was outfinished. LUDICROUS MODE dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. BULLDOG CONNECTION
prompted the pace three then two wide and was finished on the final turn. AFFLUENTIAL lagged far behind throughout. SEA AND SAND pressed the pace
in the early stages then stopped abruptly. MAKOTO was taken under a firm hold early and was always far back.

Footnotes
BATTLEBUS controlled the fractions, widened into the stretch and remained well clear under steady handling. WICKED FINN pursued the winner
throughout and could gain little. RIDE EM settled well behind, made a menacing wide bid on the final turn and flattened out. ANDREZ CONQUIST chased
within striking range outside but lacked a rally. I AM THAT I AM saved ground close up, was asked for run on the final turn but proved empty.
CENTERFOLDPROSPECT rated outside, rallied closer into the stretch then faded. PIANZI moved inside off the leaders and weakened steadily. OXBOW
PIONEER dropped back wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
REBEL EMPIRE well placed off the dueling leaders, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under moderate pressure. NO SABE NADA dropped back
at the start, moved inside rushing to contention, angled back wide in the lane with a mild rally. UNDER THE RADAR lacked speed inside then advanced
outside through the stretch. MERCURY TEN raced off the pace, drifted wide on the turn and faded. STEVETHEVANDRIVER led in the two path to midway
on the turn and gave way. STORMY BONNIE forced the pace inside to the turn then faltered badly. KICK ROCKS KID was fractious prior to the start then
always outrun.

Footnotes
SHE'S DANCING chased outside, angled in advancing on the turn then drew away eagerly through the stretch under moderate coaxing. MAGGIE'S BID
moved with the winner on the turn, remained outside and was up for the place. ABOVE THE LIMIT quickly sped clear, was collared near the top of the
stretch but continued willingly. QUALITY TOO SPARE dropped far behind early then split foes with late energy. SPECIAL FREEDOM raced wide and closed
well without threatening. MOUNTAIN LILLY pursued the loose pacesetter, angled out in the stretch and faltered. MAP THE MOMENT was taken up
between rivals in the opening quarter, chased inside and tired. RAPIDAMENTE raced well behind throughout. TIKTOKNAWAY chased inside and stopped
abruptly.
