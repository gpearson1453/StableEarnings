slow, lagged back to quarter pole, angled out for the drive and was coming on too late. GO STELLAIRE no speed to the turn while taking the inside route
throughout and finished well in the late going. SAMOA dueled early on, chased to the stretch but gave way readily. QUEEN OF CORONA flashed brief
speed but gave way with little resistance. LADY MAUKETTE dueled early on, chased to quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run.
