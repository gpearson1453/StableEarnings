Footnotes
PEAK OF CHIC broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, held sway on a widening margin to upper stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement. WILLSHERWONTSHE, urged outside a rival prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't gain even terms but
prevailed for the place honors. EMERALD PRINCESS broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the stretch and finished evenly while
outkicked for second. FADED ROSE switched out early tracking off the second flight and continued evenly into the lane. INCLUDEANATTITUDE settled last
along the inside early and failed to menace. ROOMANTICS CHA CHA tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside and faded early.

J P WARRIOR angled to the inside tracking off the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch but continued
with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and hold a safe margin to the end under firm handling. KID FROSTIE, reserved last while angling inside,
saved ground to upper stretch gaining contention, briefly awaited an opening racing in hand to midstretch, then altered course four wide in the closing
stages and finished with interest to close the gap on the winner. IM A COWBOY TOO broke outwards bumping AUBEY RIDGE, was righted to dispute the
pace inside a rival racing through the backstretch to midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. AUBEY RIDGE, bumped at the start, was righted to gain
terms prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, dueled between foes through the stretch and weakened late. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN was urged to gain a
position outside a rival in the second flight but gave way after a half.

CRIME SPREE broke readily, attended a rival's pace under light rating through the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the bend to take over midway
through the turn and widened his advantage under firm encouragement. RYE HUMOR, off slowly, was settled last racing to the turn, angled out four wide in
upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors. YESTERYEAR angled to the inside tracking off the second
flight racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch steadily gaining position inside foes but was outkicked for second. PUBLIC SAFETY
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. EL CENTENARIO angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter
racing into the turn, tipped out in upper stretch but quickly came up, empty. SEATTLE SEE YA was urged inside rivals setting the pace on a narrow
advantage on the backstretch, was headed midway through the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out. TEQUILA TIME,
FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, WAS SCRATCHED PRIOR TO THE START UPON ADVICE OF THE TRACK VETERINARIAN.

ACCORDING TO ASPEN was rated stalking the first flight a bit off the inside, made a steady advance to challenge for command racing three deep into the
far turn, then kicked away through the lane under firm encouragement. DREAMING BIZ, caught in tight quarters at the start, tracked just off the eventual
winner along the inside to the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for second. MISS BROOKSIDE settled last
while angling to the inside, came around a tiring foe in upper stretch, then shifted back to the inside late to edge a rival for a share. SHE B GLAMOROUS
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was caught three deep through the far turn to upper stretch and finished evenly late. DOUBLE BEE STING
broke outwards, was urged along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. TEMUJIN LADY
was urged forcing the pace outside a rival to the backstretch and gave out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
PLEASE THE COURT tracked the leaders from out striking distance in the three path racing to the turn, made a steady advance in that path racing to the
stretch to challenge for command leaving the furlong marker and prevailed in time under firm handling. NICE WORK sprinted clear of the field through the
backstretch, set the pace bit off the rail to upper stretch, resisted rivals to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. DEVIL'S TEETH broke out bumping a
rival, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, steadily advanced to challenge for command between foes late but was
outkicked by the top pair. PAROLEE tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, made a mild gain advancing between foes leaving
midstretch but was steadied avoiding tight quarters late. JERRYS PRIDENJOY broke awkwardly, was bumped at the start, switched out four wide while
coming under pressure to advance but had no rally. BEYOND STREETSMART settled between foes in the last flight and never mounted a serious
challenge. MASTERFUL STRIDE tracked off the second flight along the inside and faded into upper stretch. RONNIE CLOUD settled along the inside, then
dropped out of tight quarters midway through the backstretch.

OFF SIXES, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace, pressed the issue racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage midstretch and edged
clear under firm encouragement. ZORICH sped to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command through the far turn into upper
stretch but proved only second best. WATER PATROL gained a position just off the leaders along the inside racing into the first turn, was held up avoiding
traffic midway through that bend avoiding MY COWBOY nearing the backstretch, shifted to the inside racing into the far turn, was prompted to gain position
splitting rivals shifting off the inside nearing upper stretch, shifted three wide entering the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share.
FORMIDABLE FORCE, shuffled back avoiding traffic racing through the first turn, switched outside foes while being prompted to advance racing through the
far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with some late interest while being outkicked for a share. TAPSOLUTE, caught four wide racing
through the first turn while being prompted to contention, lodged a brief, three wide bid racing into the far turn and faded into upper stretch. CANDY
WOMPUS, caught wide racing to the backstretch, offered no closing bid. DANZ A REBEL worked his way to the inside racing into the first turn, was held up
avoiding tight quarters nearing the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress inside foes racing into the far turn but came up empty entering the
lane. MY COWBOY reared at the start while breaking well behind the field, angled his way sharply to the inside while pulling his way to contention inside
foes racing to the backstretch but emptied out early. BANKROLL BEN, urged in pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes racing into the first turn,
emptied out early.

MACHO RAPIDO, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn, was roused to repel a rival's challenge to
go clear leaving midstretch and drifted out late while widening the margin. PASSTHECAT, urged between foes prompting the pace to the far turn, proved no
match late. SILVER DASH, pinched back out of tight quarters at the start, switched out racing through the first turn while moving to regain contention
exchanging contact with ROVERTON entering the backstretch, shifted to the inside racing into the far turn to make a brief bid nearing the lane but lacked
the needed final kick. TALENT AND TRICKS, reserved near the inside in early stages, split foes racing through the far turn and continued with interest to
gain position between foes in the closing stages. ROVERTON, forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch, was bumped racing past the five
furlong marker, continued in pursuit of the leaders to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. READS LANDING was prompted to make brief
progress racing four wide to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. GONE CRUISING settled outside foes to the backstretch and proved no
threat. EVER ON COWBOY angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking off the first flight but retreated early.

Footnotes
BRAHMS IS WHO was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch, edged away to a clear advantage nearing upper stretch, then turned
back a challenge from CRAZY GOOD leaving midstretch to prove best. The latter, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace, conceded some
position midway through the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the turn, moved to challenge for command in upper stretch but proved no match
late. LAURA N LUKAS tracked off the first flight inside rivals through the backstretch into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well enough
to gain a share. SHE APPEALS HOLY, caught six wide in the opening stages, continued evenly four wide into the lane. DANZIG STAR angled inwards to
force the pace three deep, then outside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. RABBIT TWENTY TWO tracked off the first
flight four wide between foes in the opening stages and faded early. BEEMER BRIDGETTE raced five wide between foes in the opening stages and soon
dropped out.
