stretch. RUNNING ROY came in at the break then engaged in close chase, came out a path to make light contact with HELLO CARLO at the eighth pole
then dueled clear of that one inside the sixteenth pole, while the latter, chased through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn, was brushed lightly
at the eighth pole then ceded second mid-stretch. BOSEY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. SUN OF SILVER chased
toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. COLONIAL ROAD came away slowly then gave chase outside then raced off the rail on the

Footnotes
JACOB T raced with the early pace two deep then stalked from the seven eighths pole, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn in
the three path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and just held on. HAPPY CHAMP settled off the pace inside, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and ran
in the three path of the far turn, finished well to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. FEISTY AND SASSY rated the pace inside, was
pressured for run leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. RAVIN'
MAVEN settled back about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then rounded the far turn still in the three path while passing rivals.
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced well back from early contention, bid nearing seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride in the three path of the far turn.
MELDON raced off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened near the rail on the far turn. OWL RUN
saved early ground racing well off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little
in the lane. WISH IN THE CASTLE raced in the three and four paths and never factored.

Footnotes
ELLIES LIL CASTLE set a pressured pace then moved clear past the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the turn, was kept alert to late stretch then
taken in hand nearing the wire. JUST ASK ME engaged in close early chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch for second.
FOR WHAT pressured the pace, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. WOODSONG'S CASTLE gave chase and
rounded the turn about the three path, though, showed little in the lane. TAPTAP gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and
had little left. COOK THE BOOKS bobbled leaving the gate then gave chase while saving ground. TEST ME I DARE U broke a step slow, angled to the
outside to give chase then raced in the four path of the turn. NINETY PROOF broke a step slow and was not a factor. MISS ORA LEE gave chase toward
mid track and was not a factor.

improved in the five path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. FRENCH NOUGET tapered in and took the lead into the first
turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail from that point and dug in under steady
stretch encouragement to outfinish MAE SAI PRINCESS, but was caught the final yards, while the latter, settled off the early pace off the rail, challenged at
near even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn two deep at a close disadvantage, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
SPUN EAZY settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
ran evenly down the lane. DAMISELA stalked inside entering the first turn then checked while boxed in leaving the nine sixteenths pole, resumed the effort
toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. ADIOS HILLARY settled just off the pace in the four path,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. POLISHED COPPER saved early ground racing well
back, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, angled out into the lane but could only improve her

Footnotes
TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled
three wide into the stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to take over the final yards. THUNDERINREADYRICK entered the first turn in the six
path then took the lead approaching the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, contested the advantage nearest
the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was caught in the final yards. CHAMPSTER saved ground just off the early pace, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. DOC JORDAN saved ground off the pace, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. CATFISH settled well off the pace
about the three path the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved position in the six path of the far
turn and ran evenly in the stretch. MY BOY STRYKER settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn just off the rail and showed little in the lane. CRISTIANO BOY saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch.
WEAVINTHEBLOCKS raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. MEGALODON'SREVENGE angled in to take the lead nearing the first
turn, was caught approaching the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, though, faded at the rail on the far turn. AZURE FIRE raced well back.
