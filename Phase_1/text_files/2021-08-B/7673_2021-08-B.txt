SING ALONG SUZY led early, was headed leaving far the turn and fought back gamely along the inside in the stretch under left-handed urging to prevail.
AUTUMN ASPEN chased while three wide, moved to the front entering the stretch and stayed on well. NO BILLS void of speed, commenced a bid on the
far turn and showed mild late interest. CAMCORDIA was angled off the rail on the first turn and failed to threaten. CHARMING FLIRT never menaced.
SHOOT ME STRAIGHT forced the pace and weakened.

Footnotes
KAUAI stalked the pace, took over on the far turn, forged clear in the stretch and was all out in the late going. CHACHA REAL SMOOTH settled well,
commenced a bid on the far turn, rallied while three wide in the stretch and was gaining rapidly at the finish. NET GAIN void of speed, advanced on the far
turn and passed tired ones. SHWEET PERSUASION led early, was headed on the far turn and dropped back in the stretch. MINECRAFT MANIAC never
menaced. GREEDY CREEDY was always outrun.

Footnotes
DRILL'S LI'L MAN settled well, lodged a three wide bid leaving the turn and kicked clear readily in the stretch. TRUE SAINT reserved early, commenced a
bid on the turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch. WARRIOR'S LULLABY forced the pace, remained in contention for the stretch run and came up
empty late. DATA STORM set a contested pace, was headed on the turn and gave way. GETTININTOMISCHIEF was always outrun. SUN SQUALL chased
while three wide and lacked a rally. BIG BARREL showed little interest.
