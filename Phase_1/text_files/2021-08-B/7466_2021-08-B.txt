Footnotes
VISION OF THE KAT was allowed to settled off the early pace, moved up to challenge nearing the three eighths pole, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and finished well to get up under strong handling. PULPIT SINGER showed good early speed from the to set all the pace, was challenged nearing the final
turn, dug in late but couldn't last. TAKES A VILLAGE pressed the early leader, moved up four wide while racing between rivals into the upper stretch and
kept on willingly to the wire. CALIFORNIA COMET was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and had not enough in the drive. SLIGHTLY broke
awkwardly, dropped back early, raced far back and was eased up on in the final stages. Slightly walked off the track under her own power.

WHERE'S FRANKIE was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early stages, moved up two to three wide around the far turn through the stretch and
finished well to be clear late under steady handling. LADY CHROME stalked the top pair early on, raced near the rail around the far turn into the lane and
finished second best. NAMORITA stalked the pace, moved up to make a four wide bid but had not enough late. KAYLA'S COWGIRL was sent along to set
the early pace weakened a bit in the latter stages. BARBELLO (NZ) dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.

SECOND BOLD showed good early speed and held gamely to be clear late under all out pressure. JUNE GLOOM was off slowly, moved up along the
inside around the far turn through the stretch and got up for the place position. PEQUENO MONTE raced up close early on, raced three wide and kept on to
the wire. FORT YORK was rank, drifted out around the first turn, settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late bid. KEEN
JAMES stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, was two to three wide in the lane and failed to respond. I'M MISTER AMERICA broke in
the air, stalked the pace and tired.

Footnotes
SHENANDOAH STAR showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. PHANTOMS BOOK was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up three to four wide but couldn't get by the winner in the drive to finish second best. GREY ABBEY settled
off the early going, raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. SAN JUAN STORM was allowed to settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide
and had not enough in the drive. CHIQUITA PIQUITA stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. WAHASHA was slow early, drifted
five to six wide around the first turn, was five wide into the upper stretch and had no closing bid. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA was getting out around the first turn
and never was a serious threat.
