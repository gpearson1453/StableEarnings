within contention, came around the turn four wide, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place. MO MONEYHONEY raced near the back in the
beginning, made a steady gain and finished willingly. MISS PRONOUNCE pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and weakened.
MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA was an early factor, came around the turn three wide and faded. LUCKY LILY BE dueled for the early advantage and made a
steady retreat. BLISS LA VIE raced near the back and was never a factor. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. PER RULING NUMBER 24970, FORT PIKE WAS

was no match for the top two. THISGUYCANFLY vied for the early lead, came around the turn three wide and weakened. DIXIELAND MUSIC pressed the
early pace, raced four wide around the turn and faded down the stretch, while finishing wide. CIROC O CLOCK void of early speed and was never a threat.

sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was caught at the wire for second. BOGEY lacked early speed, moved up, within contention and hung
down the stretch. MEGA MAX raced near the back, finished four wide and was no factor. MORE THAN BLESSED pressed the early pace and was finished
early. BRAVURA CREEK was an early factor, dropped back and was no threat late. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
