Footnotes
ANNIE ROCKS broke awkwardly, in hand along the two path, angled to the three path midway on the last turn, four wide into the lane, reached the front in
gear and drew off as clearly best. TUXEDO LEMON broke slow, unhurried saving ground, gained inside into the lane, chased to no avail but bested the rest.
SOCIAL MOBILITY never far back along the three path, four wide into the lane and tired. BIG CYN contested the lead along the rail, cleared briefly nearing
the quarter pole, was collared and gave way. KATERI EMPIRE contested the lead along the three path, chased into the lane and was eased over the wire.

Footnotes
NOT A TRACE tracked along the rail, eased out into the lane, responded, gained and then drifted out through the stretch while besting FASTELLE for the
win. FASTELLE away well, set the pace along the rail, opened up a lengthy lead on the turn, remained well clear a furlong out and then couldn't last. STAR
MANAGER in hand along the two path, three path on the turn, angled out some and then was no match for the top two. COMING STORM unhurried along
the two path and then failed to threaten while inside. DESERT TONE three path into the turn, four wide out of it and weakened. LA REINE ROUGE saved
ground and tired. SECRET GAL well placed along the two path to the lane and tired. SISTER MARY MONEY hopped at the start and then showed little.

inside into the lane, eased out some and finished well. CAT GLASSES KATHY well placed along the two path into the turn, three path out of it and finished

going well at the end. BUSTIN FREE contested the lead along the rail to the furlong marker and gave way. TRACI'S GIRL bobbled at the start, three path
into the turn, four wide leaving it and tired outside. VITANZA four wide early, three path on the turn with one beat and tired.

JEMOGRAPHY broke sluggishly, in hand along the rail into the turn, took the two path into the lane, angled out, asked, gained and then drifted out through
the final sixteenths while rallying for the win. FLYING EMPEROR away on top, showed the way along the two path, responded when asked and was caught
late. TOMMY THE TORCH unhurried along the two path, asked inside and finished with interest despite no match for the top pair. HEYITSNRICOPALAZO
well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, lodged a bid on the outside and weakened. RUNNINGWSCISSORS tracked along the three
path to the turn and weakened. P J ADVANTAGE broke a step slow, saved ground to the lane and tired.

FIFTY EIGHT O G contested the lead from the outset, dueled along the rail on the turn, responded and held on stubbornly for the win. MONEYMEISTER
unhurried along the three path on the turn, angled out and rallied. FIVE STAR BUNT stumbled at the start, well placed along the rail, took the three path into
the lane, reached the leaders three across a furlong out and weakened. HAMPTONS HOLIDAY lagged back along the rail, responded in the lane and made
a late bid inside. FORECASTER four wide on the turn and made a late wide bid. CAN'TWEALLGETALONG took back at the start, two path on the turn and
made a mild bid. BLUE SKIES FOREVER saved ground and weakened. RICO CAPOTE vied for the lead along the two path to the furlong marker and gave
way. SAN JUAN DIEGO well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it and tired.
