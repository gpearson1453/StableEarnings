ORCHESTRAL mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
late. DETANGLER set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, held sway to the final furlong, then was no match for the winner and held
the place. ALFRED stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. GO HIPPO GO mid pack,
looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and ran evenly. TALK TO THE MEDIA allowed to settle, saved ground through the
turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. LEAVEITALONELARRY well placed, moved up on the two path through the second
turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. AWESOME HALO was never involved.

then drew off and was kept to the taskl. BISHI chased the pace, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, then could
not gain in the late going and held the place. TOTAL DISTRACTION never far back, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the
lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. DIAMANT mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and flattened out. GRAY'S IMAGE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened the final
furlong. MONTRICHARD passed tiring rivals. LINDA BUG well placed, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had
no rally. ALWAYS FUNNY was no factor, inside. SUPER STRIKE sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, then faded in the lane.

COOPER'S CRESCENT stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then drifted in while drawing off and lasted under steady
pressure. SURF AND TURF allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then made a steady
gain and edged up late. BOOMIN GOOSE mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late
kick. NEW JERSEY JOHN tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out the final
furlong. WAPITI WAY mid pack, pulled to contention down the backstretch, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and ran evenly in the lane. SNAP HOOK was no factor. RED HOT LOOKS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong.
