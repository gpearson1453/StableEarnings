Footnotes
MR. UNUSUAL with the pace from the start, dueled out of the chute, up the backstretch and through the turn closest to the inside, shook off the other speed
to be clear when straightened for home, steadily increased that advantage under a right handed crop. HOMELAND MESSA stalked the dueling leaders off
the inside for a half, edged closer in the three path late in the turn, could do little with the winner in the run to the wire, edged away for the place. DIAMOND
PALACE broke alertly, alternated up front in the two path for almost five furlongs, first to blink in the drive. OOPS WEDIDITAGAIN dropped inside five
furlongs out, saved ground through the turn, continued in even fashion through the lane. DISTINCT QUALITY in the rear flight while racing outside,
continued on the outside into the lane, failed to muster to rally. FLASH DANCERLUCK steadied along the temporary rail exiting the chute, trailed, never a
threat.

Footnotes
LUCKY PRIORITY away in good order, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued to do battle up front through the turn while remaining
on the rail, disposed of the other speed nearing the furlong grounds, kept to task to hold the runner up at bay late. STREAMER last to leave, trailed well
back early, began a steady advance along the inside before a half, improved position into the lane along the rail to be closest to the winner with a furlong
remaining, continued to close the gap on that one to the wire. FASHION MERIT broke on top, raced with the pace outside the winner, dueled through the
turn then could not keep up, was also no match for the runner up. GRAYFULLY in the main body early, improved a bit in the turn, lacked a further response
in the drive. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT broke back, raced rank along the inside to be shuffled back with five furlongs to run, never a serious threat.
MADELYN'S MOMENT within striking distance early outside, got out midway on the turn, fell back while very wide into the stretch and trailed home.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BAYOU back off the early pace, saved some ground into the lane when still well back off the leaders, angled out steadily in upper straight,
closed with a late surge to be in time while widest of the first flight at the wire. D'ROCK broke on top while coming in a bit, allowed the early leader to go,
chased that one into and around the turn, crept closer past the furlong marker, lodged a rail bid late, not enough for the winner late while up in the final
strides to earn the place. DESIARD sprinted clear after the start, set all the pace, continued to lead late, failed to contain the winner from the outside while
allowing the runner up the inside in the final strides, nipped at wire by that one. SHOWCASE MALL fell back soon after the start inside, continued to save
some ground inside into the turn, fell back a bit further then steered out to be four wide into the straight, improved position down the center of the course. I'M
ALWAYS LATE within striking distance for three furlongs, came up empty for the drive. ICE PEAK last to leave, remained always back in failing to threaten.
PILLAGE DA VILLAGE also failed to menace in staying back.

Footnotes
DARING DARIAN behind the early pace well off the inside, moved closer in the three path through the turn, dueled past the furlong marker, edged away
from that rival under firm handling. TIZINDY QUEEN narrowly set the early pace, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, fell back approaching the
furlong grounds, switched to the outside soon after, came again for the place while not a serious threat to the winner. OUR LITTLE GIRL broke alertly,
pressed the runner up early from the outside, dueled with that one in the two path through the turn, briefly held the advantage just outside the furlong
marker, could not match the winner late, faltered late to lose the place. ITS GLITTER TIME pressed the issue early from along the inside, fell back off the
two leaders turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing punch. TAP THE CAT remained back in failing to menace. ASUKA fell back to trail, showed
little. CIRCLEOFSOUL fell back after bobbling just after the start, also failed to threaten at any point.

Footnotes
SEMI CHARMED LIFE forwardly placed while three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk the issue in the run up the backstretch, advanced and took
over midway on that bend, clear into the stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SLOW off the pace while five wide into the first turn,
began a solid three wide advance through the second turn, dropped to the inside nearing midstretch and continued a slow advance on the winner late.
GOTTATAKEHIMTO last away, lacked speed near the back while racing three wide, two path when roused into the lane, staged a mild rally to finish up best
of the rest, not a threat to the top two. MAJESTIC SOCIETY settled in mid pack, remained back through the second turn, improved position while racing
through some traffic. JR'S SAUVAGE settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
punch. C F JOHNATHAN broke back, void of speed in trailing for almost six furlongs, passed a few tiring rivals while never a threat.
FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE broke well front along the inside, set the pace for five furlongs, gave way when headed by the winner in the final turn. WESTERN
STAR chased the leader for four furlongs and also backed up when the real running began. SILENT CRY four wide into the first turn when inside the runner
up, was finished after a half, trailed home. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

SHAKE SOME ACTION last away, raced unhurried for five furlongs, swept up into contention while five wide into the straight, engaged the leader past the
furlong marker from the outside, wore that one down in a sharp effort. PERFECT STAR also raced well off the glib early pace, saved ground, got through
along the rail to challenge in upper straight, took over, responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong to run, gave ground grudgingly to that one
in also turning in a good run. SPEEDY FELLAR raced in the second flight toward the inside, two path second turn, tipped out three wide for the drive, proved
no match for the winner, clear of the others. METROPOL went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. MAJESTIC SIGN moved up to alternate
through some quick fractions, had little left for the drive. DECEMBER SEVEN set or forced the pace in the two path through those fast fractions and also
gave way for the stretch run.

TAPIT RIGHT broke in good order, raced with the pace inside, narrowly showed the way late backstretch, headed late in the turn, dueled into the lane,
regained advantage, kicked clear. STANG IT broke sharp, vied up front three wide in the run up the backstretch, dueled outside the winner late in the turn
when holding a slightly advantage, proved no match for that one in the drive, fully extended to hold onto the runner up spot late. I'M ALL MIXED UP in the
second flight early outside, four wide when moving closer four wide far turn, briefly vied three wide late in the turn, fell back into the lane, coming back late
for the place. IBEGTODIFFER back off the early pace, mild late interest but did not have enough for the show late. RAISING THE ROOF vied early while
between the top two, fell back in the turn, continued to fade in the drive. QUEEN GIGI last to leave, trailed throughout and was never a threat.

FORESTDUNGONE broke on top, clear through the first turn, set a semi pressured pace the middle half, clear into the lane, held the runner up comfortably
at bay late under steady handling. MUCH CLASS settled off the pace, saved some ground into the lane, switched out under a left handed crop to bother an
even running GET THEM JUSTIN inside the furlong grounds, set back down when straightened up, could not get to the winner late, well clear of the others.
IZZY'S BABY BOY within striking distance while racing three wide and outside, came four wide into the straight, displayed a moderate amount of late
interest to annex the show, not a threat to the top pair. PAYDAY TOO last away, trailed for five furlongs, improved slightly through the lane without posing a
serious threat. GET THEM JUSTIN chased the leader off the inside, in the two path into the stretch when being asked, was going evenly past the furlong
marker when bothered by the runner up, fell back lose some position. LOUISIANA HERO was finished after a half, trailed home. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
BEAR TOOTH PASS broke with the leaders, fell back off the pace, raced outside, four wide when beginning to rally out of the turn, engaged the leader from
the outside with less than a furlong remaining, quickly drew clear under steady handling. ROARING QUINN broke alertly, chased the early leader up the
backstretch, advanced and took over before three furlongs, clear in midstretch, proved n omatch for the winner, narrowly lasted for the place. AMBER PASS
sprinted clear soon after the start, offered little resistance to the runner up when headed by that one midway on the turn, fell back, moved out a bit then was
coming back for the place late. GRACE'S VISION lost irons at the start, raced back early as a result, improved position with some belated interest. CAMP
HALO back off the early pace, lodged a middle move into contention out of the turn, faltered while drifting a bit in the stretch. CUSTOM FOR ALY forwardly
placed early, began a steady fade before three furlongs. G G'S WRECKINGBALL last away, trailed far back.
