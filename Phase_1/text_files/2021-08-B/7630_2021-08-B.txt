Footnotes
SISTER JOANN angled out to give chase through the backstretch, ran in the five path of the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take over the final
yards. SONDEOFF set a pressured pace from the seven sixteenths pole, pulled clear of STONES ROAD in the four path midway on the turn, was steadily
handled from the head of the stretch but gave up the lead the final yards, while the latter, pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back
midway on the turn, recovered threatening position at the eighth pole but flattened stride the final sixteenth. REAL APPEAL engaged in close early chase
inside,
rounded
the
turn
off
the
rail
and
ran

the
lane.

Footnotes
VINTAGE GIN took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and widened at the rail on the far turn, was
steadily handled to late stretch then taken in hand approaching the wire. LONGSTORYLUCY raced well back from early contention then bid approaching
the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals in the six path of the far turn and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. BUFF N stalked off the rail then
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, continued off the rail on the far turn, though, flattened the final furlong. MACKENZIE'S STAR saved ground off
the pace, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and proved empty in the lane. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY stalked in the three path
the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME settled
off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and weakened into the lane. ELLIE BEAR ran in
the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but showed little response.

Footnotes
MODERN DAY ROMANCE rated a short lead inside past the three quarter pole, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths, widened at the rail
rounding the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND raced with the pace while between horses through the front
stretch then drifted into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, was no match in the lane and flattened
later yards, though held on for second. AZURE FIRE saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn in the four path, came along for third inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the runner-up. CAYATANO raced with the pace three wide through
the front stretch but was carried out into the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the
stretch and flattened stride. HILLBILLY ROCK was unprepared for the break and raced well back while saving ground. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS raced in the
three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SALTY J J settled off the pace while saving ground the first turn, gave chase
into the backstretch then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

TALENT EXPECTED engaged in close chase off the rail, drew to even terms two deep approaching the top of the stretch and dug in under steady handling
to inch clear at the wire. PEPPA STARR set a pressured pace inside, was met at the rail nearing the top of the stretch, dueled close to mid-stretch but
relented the final sixteenth. PRIVATELY broke a step slow then angled to the outside to give chase, improved in the four path of the turn and finished well
while gaining on the runner-up. MISS GRANDSTANDER chased, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. DISTORTED SPLENDOR
broke a step slow and was not a factor. I'M A TOTAL DIVA gave close early chase inside, faded through the turn and was eased in the stretch.

under steady encouragement to share second. SWISS HORIZON hopped leaving the gate and settled off the early pace, bid into the turn, ran in the five
path rounding the turn then dueled through the stretch and got up in time to share second. SPLIT THE CHECK became a bit anxious in the gate, pressured
the pace through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but dropped back and flattened stride into the lane. DRIVEN TO
SUCCEED chased, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. HANDSOME JOANIE chased, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened

MEET MS BOBBI RAE pressured the pace and raced close two deep on the turn, dueled at even terms midway through the turn, dug in for the nod later
yards and edged clear approaching the wire. CEDAR RUN'S FIRE set a pressured pace off the rail, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, was met
midway through the turn, dug in from that point but relented in later yards. MOJO MATTERS angled to the outside and settled off the pace, left the turn
widest and finished strong to take third the final yards. SINGING HARMONY steadied on the chute and angled out to give early chase, raced in the six path
of the turn then outfinished for third the final yards. BELLA FEMMINA engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened
inside the sixteenth pole. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL chased and rounded the turn near the rail, then ran evenly in the stretch. HOLLYWOOD BROWN
pressured the early pace, steadied between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the three path then weakened. CORKY COWGIRL
chased toward the inside, was squeezed at the rail off the inside flank of Shesauptowngirl nearing the eighth pole and weakened.
