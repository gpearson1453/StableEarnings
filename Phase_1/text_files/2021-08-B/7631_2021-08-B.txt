Footnotes
COALINGA HILLS advanced along the inside, on the backstretch, had to steady going into the turn, re-engaged along the rail on the turn, in tight once
again exiting the turn, proved to be much the best rallying along the inside to get up in the late stages. THE PET led along the inside on the backstretch,
continued to lead on the turn and into the stretch in the three path, kept on gamely to lead in deep stretch, caught by inside rival at the wire in a game effort.
VIDALIA off slow and settled along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and finished up a
willing third and galloped out well. CHARMING WEEKEND pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in
range of leader and weakened in upper stretch when asked.

mild late progress while besting rest. INDI GALLE bumped by outside rival at the start, tracked leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save
ground on the turn and lacked needed rally in the lane under urging. SPEEDY LOU C stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, a bit awkward
early on the turn and lost ground, re-bid late on the turn, rider chose to stay on rail and put into a tight spot and lacked room throughout the stretch.

LUCKY ROMANO off bit slow along the inside, sent to lead and led into the turn, drifted out into the four path entering the stretch and kept to task while
staying clear. GREAT POWER chased leader along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, bid along the rail in the stretch and rallied up for
second under urging. HOSS CARTWRIGHT away best and had lead, stayed in two path exiting the chute, stayed in two path on the backstretch, which
allowed LUCKY ROMANO to be sent to the lead along the rail, entered turn two wide, floated into stretch into the five path, stayed on ok to save show.
NUTTY SIERRA chased leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, and lacked needed kick in the lane to improve.
WHATWASITHINKING chased leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to launch a bid in the lane.
