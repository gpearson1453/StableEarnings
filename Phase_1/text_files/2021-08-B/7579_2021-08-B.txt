Footnotes
NORTHERN PLAYBOY, bumped at the start while shuffled a bit avoiding traffic, was rated between foes in second flight racing through the first turn,
switched out to press the issue three wide after a half, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch and went clear under pressure. STAR OF STARS
tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and advanced inside foes to prevail for the
place honors leaving midstretch. GAINER gained terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes to upper stretch
and gave way. WHISKEY PLANK angled to the inside disputing the pace inside foes from the outset to the far turn and gave way into the lane. MY
GOLDEN BOY, rated just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, offered no rally. WHATA SHOW OFF broke inwards bumping a rival, then
was held up in tight quarters at the start, shifted out five wide racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
FORTY NINE MODEL broke sharply, was urged along the inside dictating the pace into the turn, then kept FLAN at bay through the stretch under firm left
handed pressure. FLAN was rated stalking just off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend, tipped out to bid for command nearing upper stretch
but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN tracked off the first flight between foes, continued three deep between foes into the
bend and finished evenly for a share. ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES settled outside foes in early stages, was caught four wide racing into the turn while being
prompted to advance but offered no rally. ICE POP, broke readily to gain a forward placing, was taken in hand attending the pace racing into the turn, then
steadily faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
OWN THE TOWN was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the leaders three wide midway through
the far turn to challenge for command nearing the lane, disputed the issue in a prolonged skirmish to dispatch a rival midstretch and just held the late
challenge of GRAPHYTE to the end in all out drive. The latter was settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily drew into contention
switching out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to challenge the winner in the final sixteenth while being just outkicked.
SMART CALL angled inwards to gain terms with a rival attending the pace racing to the backstretch, dueled between foes on the far turn to midstretch and
weakened late. SOVIET, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. HOLY MUCHACHO was urged
three wide into the first turn pursuing the leaders to the backstretch but emptied out early.

RUNNIN HAPPY angled to the rail in early stages racing just out of striking distance, steadily gained position inside rivals on the turn to challenge for
command racing into upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked away under firm handling. ASENA, bumped at the start, recovered
quickly to force the pace outside rivals racing into the turn, dueled for command outside the winner to midstretch but proved only second best. LATIN
NIKKITA, pulling between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing through the turn and found her best stride in late stages to close the gap on
the top pair. SKY HIGH SUSAN, urged pursuing the leaders three wide in early stages, shifted inwards nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes.
HEART ON THE RUN was urged in pursuit of the pacesetter between foes into the turn, shifted out four wide nearing the lane but had no final kick.
GHOSTED GIRL tracked off the second flight in the three path racing into the turn and offered no rally. IMPULSUS was settled well off the leaders while
angling to the inside early and failed to menace thereafter. AIKMANS CHEESECAKE, urged inside foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way
between foes into the lane. TAKING CHARGE DESI settled between foes racing to the turn and proved no threat. GRACIE WILL SMILE was off slowly and
failed to menace thereafter. STRABELLA broke outwards bumping ASENA at the start and quickly dropped out.

Footnotes
SR. BOM BON was rated off the first flight just off the inside in the opening quarter, angled to the rail on the turn, then made a steady gain to challenge for
command when presented an opening in upper stretch and edged forward under firm encouragement. GABRIEL'S LEGEND broke outwards bumping FLY
WITH CLASS, was collected, then rated along the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a
steady late bid to prevail for the place honors inside foes while closing the gap on the winner. TAPIT SAM, forwardly placed three wide between between
foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide racing into the turn, then continued willingly outside foes to gain terms with the top pair late. KOVACS
joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace three wide into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DARK SOLUTION hopped at the
start, was roused to gain terms with the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue into the turn, was taken up avoiding close
quarters at the quarter pole and continued evenly into the lane. DEPUTY LAW urged inside foes disputing the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage
on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. MODRIC, caught six wide early, soon dropped out. FLY WITH
CLASS, bumped at the start, dropped out early.

GOT EVEN SMARTER was rated out of striking distance while angling to the inside on the backstretch, steadily gained position into the lane, was hemmed
in close quarters in upper stretch, shifted out three wide to split foes leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. C DUB was urged inside
rivals disputing the pace, dueled for command into upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner but held grudgingly for the place honors.
EPIC DRAMA angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and was just
outkicked for second. SHARP ART was rated stalking just outside the first flight racing into the turn, was carried out four wide nearing midstretch and lacked
the needed late bid. TWO THE PUNCH tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing four wide to the turn and failed to menace thereafter.
FLORIDA TWO STEP, off a bit slowly, was pulling hard against firm restraint while shifting off the inside nearing the turn but failed to menace.

MARKET ANALYSIS sprinted to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the second bend, steadily widened his advantage
racing into the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. CANDY STORE settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground
on the far turn gathering momentum inside foes, switched out racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. CENTRAL PARK settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. UNLEASH THE BEAST was urged in pursuit of the pacesetter to the far turn and emptied out
nearing the lane.

STRETFORD END was a bit slow into stride then hustled to the lead between on the inside and drove clear in the lane while under steady pressure. DIRTY
DEEDS tracked the pace three wide early, commenced bid at the quarter pole but failed to sustain momentum in the final furlong and edged foe late for
second place. SQUARED STRAIGHT forced pace between foes and weakened late. MEDICINE MAN broke well, pressed for the lead and failed to sustain
pace and weakened in the lane. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA was far back throughout and proved no factor. BRASKA was tracking on the inside throughout
and failed to menace. BIZ KID showed brief speed out of the gate and gave way shortly there after.
