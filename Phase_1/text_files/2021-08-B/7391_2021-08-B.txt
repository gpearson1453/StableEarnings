Footnotes
SILIPO prompted the pace of PICKERING CIRCLE from the outside three paths off the rail, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into
upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive kept to task. JOHN'S PROTEGE bobbled at the break and
recovered outwards, then got bumped by the breaking inwards REMEMBER NORMANDY, raced briefly five to six wide and was bumped between foes and
jostled by REMEMBER NORMANDY and PAYNT YOUR WAGON five furlongs from home and was forced to steady out losing three lengths of ground and
position backing away to the tail of the field, tipped out seven paths off the inside the rest of the way down the backstretch before tucking four to five wide
through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to run on through to
the finish unable to threaten the top one while clear of the rest for the place honors. SKEPTICAL bobbled at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and weakened in the late stages. PICKERING CIRCLE established the front just after the start and
showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from SILIPO to the outside, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, took the inside
route into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. BAJA FOG struck the near side stall at the start, chased just off
the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. GOOD
SKATE broke in at the start under hustling, chased four paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path through the turn under coaxing from the
get go, swung three wide for home and tired. REMEMBER NORMANDY broke in at the start bumping JOHN'S PROTEGE solidly, raced six paths off the
inside early on leaning on JOHN'S PROTEGE and jostling that rival between foes in tandem with PAYNT YOUR WAGON before pinching that foe out,
tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PAYNT
YOUR WAGON broke in at the start under hustling shadowing GOOD SKATE who did likewise, raced five paths off the inside and came together with
JOHN'S PROTEGE jostling that rival in between in concert with REMEMBER NORMANDY and pinching that foe back five furlongs from home, tucked three
wide through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KISS THE SKY was asked leaving the gate, bumped with a rank STREET FIGHT nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled comfortably on
the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, rallied into upper stretch then made a bid outside of leading duo, took a short lead under a drive into the
final furlong, shook off two foes into the final sixteenth and held sway from the fast closing runner-up under strong handling. STREET VENDOR broke a step
slow, moved in at the rear of the field, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the back on the outside, came under urging with a half-mile to run,
went three wide on the final turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and finished with good energy to garner the place. ANSEL broke a step slow,
was taken in hand early, tugged keenly at the bit under tight restraint in the two path around the opening bend, was reserved under a hold, traveled in the
two path early on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then angled four wide outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
gained under the crop into the final furlong, chased into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. BAJ was hustled from the start, angled in while
going to the front, set the pace on the inside through sensible fractions, was challenged with seven-sixteenths to run then asked at the five-sixteenths,
fought on well under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. FLIP THE SCRIPT angled in while showing early
speed, saved ground on the initial turn, was well positioned while settling just off the pace, raced inside on the far turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, lugged in badly under heavy right-rein correction in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. STREET
FIGHT came away in good order, was taken in hand early then became rank while moving out under restraint, bumped with KISS THE SKY before the first
turn, raced in the three path on that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was
asked for his best into upper stretch, battled between horses from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and tired.
DREAM OF A DAY broke a step slow, settled at the back on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, saved ground into the stretch then was put to the
crop and failed to threaten. KING OF STING was caught four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the final turn and failed
to respond.

Footnotes
SOCIAL WHIRL tracked the pace along the inside from a loose pocket, tipped to the two path near the three-eighths, came under light coaxing near the
quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to take command among a host of challengers
just inside the sixteenth marker, dug in and held on over a pair of late surging rivals. SASSY MELISSA stumbled at the start getting away near the rear of
the field, chased two to three wide until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for
home, closed well through the final furlong and missed at the end. LITTLE DUTCH GIRL three then two wide in pursuit, came in slightly just inside the
five-sixteenths due to pressure from GINGER KITTY coming inwards from the outside and forced HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH to steady along the rail, spun
three wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the show honors in the final jumps to the wire. HERALD ANGEL four paths off the inside in range of the
front, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in challenging through the
final eighth and was in the midst of taking command a sixteenth out running on but was outfinished in the late stages. FUDDLED (IRE) just off the inside just
off the pace, tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch roused, lacked optimal clearance to the three-sixteenths, gained a clear
lane inside through the final furlong and ran on one paced inside getting outkicked in the late going. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH three wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, had a pair of rivals directly in front and to the outside coming inwards slightly and was forced to
steady just inside the five-sixteenths losing about two lengths of momentum at most before being re-engaged by the rider, swung two to three wide into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the finish. DEFY EXPECTATIONS hustled from the gate, showed the way through swift splits lightly coaxed along the
inside, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole before coming under assault by a host of flanking rivals inside that
station, dug in overwhelmed near the sixteenth pole succumbing to the pressure inside that station and backed away to the finish. FILLMORE EAST four
then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. AVA K'S GIRL brushed the
off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. GINGER
KITTY chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
SARATOGA PAL brushed with a rival at the start while off a half-step slow, dropped well back while urged along, went four then five wide on the turn,
floated seven wide into the stretch under the crop, rallied in the center of the track, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear
under strong urging. WATER'S EDGE was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of HIM SHE KISSES, vied in the two path while still inside
that foe on the turn, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed crop, lost the lead to the winner
inside the furlong marker, drifted in under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and tired while able to hold the place. DEVIL'S CODE was bumped
soundly at the start while off at the rear and slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, lugged out three then four wide on the turn, dropped in coming
to the three-sixteenths then was put to the crop, gained while chasing into the final furlong, altered course to the outside of the runner-up when that one
drifted in coming to the sixteenth-pole and flattened out while clear for the show. QUICKFLASH moved in while urged along on the outside of a foe, chased
the embattled leaders while in dead-aim of those rivals, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. HIM
SHE KISSES broke out then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside of WATER'S EDGE, vied in the three path while still outside that opponent on
the turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch under a right-handed crop and capitulated. SAMAY broke out and
bumped soundly with DEVIL'S CODE, was urged along while carried in inside of a foe, dropped back outside the half-mile pole then fell further back, saved
ground on the turn, remained on his inside while moving out outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to respond.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DEVIL'S CODE AGAINST WATER'S EDGE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
SIXTEENTH-POLE, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
WRITE THIS DOWN was well placed just off the pace, saved ground behind the lugging out leader on the turn, inherited the front coming to the quarter-pole
then was asked in the two path into the stretch, responded well in the drive and held under strong urging. NEW YORK SUPREME was bumped on both
sides at the start, bumped with foes on both sides early then steadied while squeezed back, settled towards the back on the outside, was bumped by
CANDY MONET near the seven-sixteenths, went six to eight wide while carried out by a wayward foe on the turn then floated out nine wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner on the far outside, drifted inward in pursuit of that foe around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place in a troubled journey.
ORMA broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, was taken in hand early then settled just off the pace, steadied near the seven-sixteenths, rounded
the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole then driven four wide into the stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to
her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but held the show. HAPPY HILL LIL bumped with ETHEL'S DOCTORATE at the start then bumped
again with that opponent early, angled in while last but one, settled comfortably well off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was asked for her best in
upper stretch, moved out late and improved position but missed the show. PRAIRIE TALES broke out and bobbled then was hustled to the lead, set the
pace under pressure to her outside, lugged out from the three path to the five path on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and weakened. CANDY
MONET broke out and hit the gate then bumped with NEW YORK SURPREME, bumped again with that foe early, settled off the pace, came out near the
seven-sixteenths and bumped once more with the aforementioned foe, was caught six wide early on the turn then dropped to the four path, raced behind
traffic in upper stretch, moved out significantly in the final furlong and failed to threaten. ROXEN tracked the pace on the outside while attempting to get in
behind cover, was finally able to tuck to the three path at the seven-sixteenths but came out again shortly thereafter, was carried from the five path to the
seven path on the turn then eight wide into the stretch and tired. ETHEL'S DOCTORATE was bumped on both sides at the start then checked sharply while
pinched back, spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch then angled further out in the vicinity of the
furlong marker, was fanned out wider late and failed to threaten. BLACK LICORICE broke near the back of the field, settled towards the rear, saved ground
on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and failed to rally. TOOTSIE'S SONG brushed with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, was
carried from four to six wide on the turn and had nothing left.

MIRA MISSION tracked the front just off the inside patiently handled, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go and rode the hedge through the far turn
coming under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to overthrow the leader near
the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to prevail. SIGILOSO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside
through the first turn under some pressure from DEVILS SKY to the outside, had FUTURE VICTORY range up outside when hard to handle and was
headed for command five furlongs from home before advancing to take back the front half a mile from home, showed the way through the far turn now
knocking heads with DEVILS SKY, shook off that rival cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in confronted by the top one and was displaced near the
eighth pole, ran on willingly to chase that rival home safe for the place honors. CAMP HOPE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SHADY MCGEE
(IRE) three then two wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide until tucked inside through the far turn, angled out three to four wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. TREASON broke out a step at the start and pinched back AGENT CREED in tandem with
SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals to the finish. NEVER EXPLAIN struck the off side stall at the start, raced three wide into the first turn and was spun out four wide briefly
when FUTURE VICTORY tipped out keen and off heels, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. EYES ON TARGET three wide through the first
turn, chased three then two wide coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DEVILS
SKY forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to duel with SIGILOSO through the far turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, got shaken off spinning four wide for home and weakened in the drive. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY broke in at the start pinching back
AGENT CREED in tandem with TREASON, raced three wide into the first turn and was nudged out four then five wide as FUTURE VICTORY grew eager
and rank off heels to his inside, raced four wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and weakened. AGENT CREED got pinched at the start between foes who each broke his way, went three wide into the first turn
and got nudged four to five wide, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide for home and tired. FUTURE
VICTORY struck the off side stall at the start, was in behind foes and steadied off heels with eight and a half furlongs remaining, went just off the inside into
the first turn and grew keen and rank off heels of a rival and was tipped out three then four wide nudging a trio of rivals four then five wide, went five then
four paths off the inside into the backstretch and pulled his way to the front taking narrow and brief command five furlongs from home, got headed half a
mile out and came under light coaxing into the far turn remaining four wide through that bend before spinning seven wide at the top of the lane and folded in
the stretch.

Footnotes
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE broke a step slow, moved up with five furlongs to run, was asked while inside early on the far turn, moved to the two path inside
the three-eighths, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under the crop, drifted out some into the final furlong then took the advantage and drove
clear to prove much the best. VIRADIA settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, ranged up four wide to make a bid on the turn,
took the lead under her own power at the quarter-pole then was asked shortly thereafter, drifted out under pressure outside the furlong marker and was
overtaken while clear for the place. PERSIAN QUEEN brushed with a foe near the five-eighths, dropped to the rear under coaxing with a half-mile to run,
was urged four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, moved further out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response
while along for the show. MONGOLIAN HUMOR was reluctant to load, brushed with a foe around the five-eighths, was well placed just off the pace, went
two then three wide on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, brushed with YES I'M EVIL late and just missed
the show. ABSOLUTE LOVE bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path under urging
on the turn and tired. YES I'M EVIL hit the outside of the gate and was off a bit slow, dropped well behind, moved from the two path to the rail on the turn,
passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, moved out in the stretch, brushed with MONGOLIAN HUMOR late and failed to threaten. JESSICA bumped with
a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back three to four wide on the turn, was carried eight wide into the stretch and capitulated.
SUBSIDIARY showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and
faded.

rallied in tandem with ILLEGAL SMILE to the outside offering up a good finish to get up in the final jumps to the wire and prevail. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE)
bobbled at the start recovering outwards bumping GOIN' GOOD into BYE BYE and in turn ALWAYZ LATE and causing the pressure that squeezed out BYE
BYE, chased four to five paths off the inside just off the leader, tucked three wide through the turn and was set down spinning six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to the inside of the aforementioned foe closing well to the finish but missed at the end. BYE BYE got bumped solidly at the start by GOIN' GOOD due
to pressure from ILLEGAL SMILE and was squeezed out against ALWAYZ LATE conceding four lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride,
chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch,
rallied angling to the rail near the eighth pole, rallied up the inside to strike the front a sixteenth from home, dug in and was nailed in the final jumps to the
finish. MISCHIEFFUL bumped at the start by DR B, who broke outwards, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path through the turn and steadily advanced nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command narrowly a furlong
from home, dug in under threat from a host of challengers and got displaced at the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the late stages. TUSCAN
QUEEN just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, tipped out two to three paths a
furlong out and rallied through a seam bumping with ALWAYZ LATE just inside the sixteenth marker, then had the rider flash the crop to the left side when
in tight between foes in the late stages to the finish. ALWAYZ LATE bumped at the start by BYE BYE when that foe was squeezed out between rivals due to
pressure from ILLEGAL SMILE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied getting
bumped by TUSCAN QUEEN just inside the sixteenth marker when sniffing for a seam among a host of rivals, then got steadied off the heels of the top
finishing pair nearing the finish. WINK lightly coaxed just off the inside showing the way down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, got set down
spinning three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on to the sixteenth pole before weakening in the late stages. GOIN'
GOOD got bumped at the start by ILLEGAL SMILE and in turn bumped and squeezed out BYE BYE against ALWAYZ LATE, chased three wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was outrun. LI'L TOOTSIE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. DR B broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, then broke out at the start
bumping MISCHIEFUL coming under hustling, chased three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch backing

Footnotes
MIRABELL MEI was reserved at the back while saving ground, waited briefly behind a foe outside the quarter-pole, was roused while cutting the corner into
the stretch, rallied along the rail, closed strongly to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. ALPHA BABE was reserved off the pace while inside to the two path, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, tipped out a
path further while put to a drive around the three-sixteenths, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the winner to the wire and
was denied while able to get the place. ITALIAN TWIN broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside while in hand,
made a bid in the three path on the final turn, was asked at the top of the stretch then took a short lead, lost the advantage near the sixteenth-pole and was
outfinished while clear for the place. KUBIE SNACKS went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the three path,
dropped in while asked inside the quarter-pole and improved position. FREDDYMO FACTOR was backed out of the starting gate then reloaded, saved
ground while rated just off the pace, swung four wide while roused into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. APPRECIATE
showed early speed, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied along the rail while asked on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and gave way. AMORTIZATION (IRE) was reserved in the two path, moved out
while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. COURTED showed early speed, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the
pace on the outside, vied in the two path while loosely between foes on the final turn, was asked for her best between horses into upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired. SENGEKONTACKET went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the final turn, came
six wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. SUMMER IN THE CITY stumbled at the start, was rated just off
the pace in the two path, dropped back four wide into the stretch then bumped with a foe around the three-sixteenths and had nothing left. MAZAL
EIGHTEEN steadied in the early going, lugged out a bit into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the
three path on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch then bumped with a rival around the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. ADRIATIC
ROSE dropped back in some traffic early, went two to three wide on the turns and showed little.
