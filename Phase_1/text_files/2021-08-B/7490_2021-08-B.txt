Footnotes
THE MORE I BURN broke on top and bit inward, showed the way in hand from along or just off the inside, was challenged into the second bend, moved
clear when put to a drive upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last furlong, was all out the final sixteenth between rivals and held on. NEXT TIME
YOU WIN moved to the inside early on, was kept close, put to a drive along the rail in the stretch, took over second, gradually closed in on the leader the
last eighth, came up a bit short and just lasted for the place. GRAMMAR reluctant to load, was crowded briefly at the start, pressed THE MORE I BURN
from just outside, went for the lead into the second turn, retreated some from path three entering the lane and battled back belatedly from between horses
deep stretch. UNIVERSIADE prominent from outside, lost ground four wide taking the second bend and also found best stride too late inside the final
furlong.

Footnotes
VIVA VIOLENCE brushed with CHRISTY ATTACK at the start then brushed once with STARLET WARRIOR as she vied for the lead outside that one at the
half mile marker, moved ahead on the bend, drew clear when allowed upper stretch, put to a brief drive with a furlong to go then steadily widened command
while ridden out. CHRISTY ATTACK brushed with VIVA VIOLENCE at the break, was shuffled back soon after that, swung out widest on the turn, floated
out to path four into the lane, was put to a drive midstretch and caught STARLET WARRIOR for second in the final strides. STARLET WARRIOR displayed
early speed from inside, was brushed and crowded briefly by VIVA VIOLENCE at the half mile pole, proved no match for the latter when set down for the
drive and began to wear down deep stretch. ZIP ATTACK chased from outside, followed VIVA VIOLENCE through the bend and gave way through the lane.

Footnotes
ASHLEY ELIZABETH was hustled to the early lead and the inside, began to drift out approaching the end of a half mile and was put to right-handed
pressure, gradually drifted out upper stretch despite right-handed urging, held a straight path the final furlong and kept BOOHOO SUE at bay. BOOHOO
SUE was bumped from the rear at the break, pressed ASHLEY ELIZABETH from just outside, was forced out by the latter on the bend and upper stretch,
lacked the extra needed in the late going but held onto the place. JUKEBOX MONEY fractious in the gate, broke outward when the race began, bumped
BOOHOO SUE, was steadied and altered inward, settled, picked up her pace along the rail after a quarter mile, steadily made up ground in the stretch, was
too late but caught FOXIE'S BEAUTY for third nearing the wire. FOXIE'S BEAUTY raced in contention from outside, was three wide on the bend, angled in
as ASHLEY ELIZABETH came out near the quarter pole, threatened from path two midstretch but leveled off in the late going.

HATCHET CREEK fractious in the gate, was crowded briefly at the start and taken back some when his path began to narrow from along the rail, saved
ground taking the bend, angled out widest upper stretch, responded to urging and got up in the waning yards. LAGRUE shared the early lead outside
WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE, moved ahead under mostly hand urging in the lane but lacked the extra needed from between rivals deep stretch. WILDWOOD'S
GAMBLE was hustled to contest the early pace from inside, did not relent when LAGRUE moved ahead in the stretch but failed to have the needed late kick
in the waning yards. MAGIC SPRINGS was away slowly and always outrun.

Footnotes
COUNTRY ASSETS was kept close, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, edged ahead midstretch, was all out between rivals and held on.
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN forwardly placed from outside, lost ground four wide taking the turn, rallied belatedly the last furlong but caught AMERICAN
HOLIDAY for second nearing the wire. AMERICAN HOLIDAY vied for the lead outside RUBY LEES SONG from the beginning, moved clear leaving the
bend, took the rail for the stretch run, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the late going. LIL B QUICK was away somewhat slowly, angled out on
the turn and passed outside tired ones in the stretch. MORA VALLEY was an early factor just off the inside but faded two wide on the bend. RUBY LEES
SONG displayed early speed from inside but began to fade after three furlongs.

Footnotes
ORDAINED KISS rated between rivals on the backstretch, took the advantage two wide on the bend, drifted out some as she drew clear entering the lane,
steadily opened up under a drive and was kept to task until the final seventy yards. LOUIE P moved to the outside with a half mile to go, went for the lead
outside ORDAINED KISS on the turn, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive but held her position late. MARYS LAST SONG bobbled at
the break, was prominent from inside, steadied behind rivals into the bend, altered to the outside on the turn, took over third at the top of the stretch, moved
to the rail soon after and leveled the last eighth. FLYING BUSINESS displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY rated from well off the inside on the backstretch, was let out on the bend, asked four wide leaving the turn, gained the advantage
approaching the eighth pole then drew away while kept to urging the final furlong. GONEGHOST vied for the early lead inside rivals, had the rail through the
turn, could not stay with GIRLOLAMO'GLORY the last eighth but was unchallenged for second. DR. LIECHTY contested the pace from outside for a half
mile, flattened for the drive but gained third with a sixteenth to go. WILLOW RIDGE broke well but gradually retreated from inside, fanned out to path three
for the stretch run, moved outside DR. LIECHTY with a furlong left and was closing in for the show late. SIRCORRI displayed early speed between horses
but gave way two wide through the lane.
