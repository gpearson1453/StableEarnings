Footnotes
MONGOLIAN WINDOW traveled five to six wide around the first turn, went four wide through the second bend, closed well from outside and drove past late.
IT'S A RIDDLE bobbled leaving the gate, went five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, left the backstretch outside a rival, continued outside that foe
then driven three wide into the stretch and got outkicked by the winner. PAIGE RUNNER came away awkwardly at the start, chased on the inside, saved
ground to the stretch, took over past the eighth pole but faltered late. A J ROCK dueled inside MISS KITNESS while three wide then two wide on the first
turn, cleared rival early on the backstretch then opened up a comfortable lead, urged right-handed into the lane, clung to the lead with a furlong to go and
yielded in deep stretch. COAL SHAFT trailed off the inside, came three wide into the lane and never got involved. MISS KITNESS dueled outside A J ROCK
four then three wide on the first turn, could not match strides with that rival and continued to drop back on the backstretch, eased on the far turn, coasted
through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DELTA WIND jumped out to the early lead, set the pace well off the rail then dueled with SO VERY SMART, cleared that rival near the five-sixteenths, drew
off under hand urging then put to the right-handed crop with a sixteenth remaining and coasted in through the closing moments. SO VERY SMART broke in,
chased between foes then went up to force the pace from inside, dueled into the turn, lost contact midway around the bend, saved ground into the stretch
and bested the rest. KITTEN'S KID forwardly placed in the early stages outside a trio of rivals, chased three wide into the turn, remained off the rail exiting
the bend, flattened in the final furlong and saved the show. NAN ELIZABETH stumbled badly at the start, chased between foes then two wide around the
turn, kept on for a minor award but never threatened. PIAZZETTA chased widest early, navigated the turn four then three wide and failed to rally.
SHANGHAI DAZZLER was off slow to begin, steadied off heels briefly soon after, went three wide through the turn and was not a factor. BEAUTIFUL
WORLD broke inward at the start, tracked along the inside and had little left for the stretch.

WOUND TIGHT brushed with outside rival at the start, set the pace through early stages, met bids on the far turn, cleared again at the three-sixteenths pole,
led into deep stretch and was all out to prevail. READY SOUL stalked a bit off the rail then in the two path, bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining, lost
contact with the leader into the stretch, came back and dug in late to miss. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) brushed with WOUND TIGHT at the start, traveled
along the inside, moved off the rail and went three deep into the far turn, range up four wide leaving the bend, finished well through the final furlong and
prove a game third. RED STORM RISEN angled in early, rated along the inside moving closer up the backstretch, remained confidently handled on the
second bend, moved out in the lane and rallied between foes but was put in tight quarters late halting his momentum. GALILEAN angled to the two path
early then moved inside, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, stayed inside through the lane and finished willingly. MUSAWAAT (GB) settled outside a
rival, between foes at the three-eighths pole, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SASH (GB) closest in the two path early, bid
outside at the quarter pole, could not keep up into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LILLY BABE chased off the inside, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to the front mid-stretch, dueled with the runner-up late and prevailed. MAGGIE
FITZGERALD pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader on the turn, came back in the final furlong, dueled with LILLY BABE in deep stretch
but had to settle for second best. SMART MONIQUE brushed leaving the gate, chased three wide around the turn and was along for the show. QUICK
TAKE set the pace under pressure, cleared around the bend, led into the final furlong and weakened late. ALLWINEDUP broke out, was forwardly placed
from outside, took the turn four wide and lacked a rally. SURELY SPECTACULAR fractious in the gate, bobbled while coming away quickly at the start,
chased inside to the stretch and flattened out. NEVER SWAY off slow and bumped at the start, raced off the pace, three to two wide on the turn and made
no impact. WORKIN NINETOFIVE brushed leaving the gate, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. THISONESFORBARRY broke out and
bumped rival at the start, angled down the inside, shifted to the two path on the turn and failed to menace. BIG MAMACITA tossed her head to come away
slowly at the start, tracked five then four wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
DIAMOND RANGER chased from outside then went up to challenge at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled around the turn, held a short lead entering the
stretch, kicked clear from TRY TO CAPTURE and drew off to win going away. TRY TO CAPTURE sent for the lead, set the pace early then met the
challenge from DIAMON RANGER leaving the turn, fought through the turn along the inside, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on
to secure the place. FUN COUPONS away quickly then dropped back, lost ground around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, kept to task and came
back to earn the show honors. MAD CATTER forwardly placed early on, went two wide into the lane and lacked a bid. WARFRONT FIGHTER raced off the
pace, ran up on heels nearing the three-eighths, lacked room and steadied on the turn, shifted to the two path and improved position. THANKS MAGGIO
(ARG) chased five wide into the lane and lacked a serious bid. SILVER KID was off slow and checked at the start, exited the bend four wide and churned on
to advance. CARELESS KITTEN lacked early speed, saved ground on the inside, tipped out in the stretch and failed to menace. ROCKETCENT broke in
and bumped at the start, tracked off the pace, entered the lane six wide and never rallied. CIRCLE BACK raced in range and steered down to the inside,
saved ground into the stretch and weakened. COGNAC CAT chased four deep early, outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the lane and
weakened. FLACTEM LEGACY got bumped at the start, chased on the inside, two to three wide on the turn, shifted in at the eighth pole and was eased to
the wire.

Footnotes
BELLA VITA brushed by inside rival at the start, settled off the pace, split foes on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair and
won going away. LIVINGMYBESTLIFE sped to the front from inside, set the pace off the rail, led two wide into the stretch, remained clear into the furlong
grounds, could not match the winner but stayed on to hold the place. BIG SWEEP up closest early to the outside of the pacesetter, traveled four then three
wide on the turn, kept to task through the lane but was denied the place. STELLA NOIR traveled along the inside, angled three wide leaving the turn, moved
out further in the drive and improved position. QUEENGOL broke out, raced in mid-pack early, took the turn two wide, moved out in the lane and never
threatened. MELTING SNOW stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and failed to respond when called upon. FOCUS
FIRST broke out and brushed the winner, took the turn four then three wide and failed to menace. LAST FIRST KISS traveled near the back early on,
entered the turn five wide, exited four wide and had little left. TIZ A MASTER stalked well off the rail, navigated the turn five wide and tired.

Footnotes
ROSE'S CRYSTAL was impeded and checked early, settled off the pace while off the inside, gained ground around the far turn, came four wide into the
stretch, rallied to the front at the eighth pole and drove clear. WARRENS CANDY GIRL lost path and steadied early, angled to the inside, moved off the rail
on the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, moved out in the lane, rallied outside the winner but was not enough. BELLA D shifted in and bumped rival
early, bid three deep into the lane, led in upper stretch, overtaken at the eighth pole and held the show. KEEP DANCING unhurried on the inside, went two
wide leaving the backstretch, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally to fill out the superfecta. WARRIOR'S MOON tracked outside a rival,
mid-pack up the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and faltered. BIG CLARE was closest in pursuit from inside then moved off the rail, drew
alongside leaving the backstretch, led into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. SUNSHINE BABE tracked along the inside, moved out
on the backstretch, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally after gaining a clear path. BIG MAMA SUE raced near the back of the pack early on in
the two path, went three wide into the far turn, four wide into the stretch and never made an impact. BIG STRETCH raced two wide then along the rail on the
first turn, tipped out around rival near the seven-sixteenths, angled back to the rail on the far turn and failed to menace. SHE'S A DIME sped clear early,
showed the way up the backstretch, pressured into the far turn, overtaken into the stretch and faded. LENA'S BIG DAY got bumped from outside soon after
the start, raced between rivals nearing the first turn, dropped back a bit and angled to the inside, started to weaken past the four furlong mark, eased on the
far turn, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MEDINA SPIRIT hustled from the gate, took control and set the pace under pressure, coaxed midway around the far turn, fought with a pair of rivals late on
the turn, carried the lead into the lane, shook free in upper stretch and held well in the late stages. ROCK YOUR WORLD pressed the pace from outside,
challenged past the five-sixteenths, vied between late on the turn, lost contact and drifted out in upper stretch, then finished willingly under right-handed
urging but had to settle for second best. STILLETO BOY angled to the inside nearing the first turn, raced in the two path up the backstretch, angled out on
the second bend and came four wide into the stretch, got bumped by TEAM MERCHANTS twice in upper stretch, then kept to task and gained the show
honors. THE GREAT ONE raced four deep into the first turn, dropped down to the two path around that bend, moved to the inside and stalked along the rail,
remained near the inside to the lane and gained a minor award. TEAM MERCHANTS raced three deep into the first turn, dropped back to stalk the top pair
from outside, bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining, drifted out and bumped STILLETO BOY twice in upper stretch and flattened out late. WILLY THE
COBBLER raced along the inside then moved out leaving the first turn, angled in on the second bend and never threatened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN TEAM MERCHANTS AND STILLETO BOY IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH TEAM MERCHANTS DID COME OUT AND MAKE CONTACT WITH STILLETO BOY, STILLETO BOY FINISHED
AHEAD OF TEAM MERCHANTS AND THEREFORE THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SURPLUS set the pace with company to the inside then cleared that rival into the turn, drew away into the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and
widened in the final furlong. BIG SUMMER forwardly placed off the inside, went two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and held the place.
ALIGATO shuffled between runners early, angled to the inside, moved out on the turn and exited the bend three wide, rallied in deep stretch but could not
get up for the place. ZERO DOWN tracked off the inside, went four wide into the lane and finished evenly. CRASH CORRIGAN chased in range early, took
an awkward start near the three-eighths, took the turn two then three wide and went evenly through the final furlong. SPANISH CHANNEL chased on the
inside to the stretch, lacked room from upper to midstretch, gained a clear path but could not regain the momentum. TORRID TOMMY raced off the pace
early, entered the turn three wide, went five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SOTTOCAPO tracked off the inside or outside a rival, went two wide into
the turn, four wide into the stretch and weakened. MOUNT OLYMPIC pressed the pace from inside, steadied at the three-eighths, traveled along the inside
then two wide into the lane and weakened. BACK IN ACTION off slow to begin, trailed early, angled in on the turn and was not a factor.
