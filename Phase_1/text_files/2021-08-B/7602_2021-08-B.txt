Footnotes
URBANITE settled the first two furlongs, gradually progressed from outside once on the backstretch to engage the other two on the second bend, was put to
a drive midstretch and shook free in the waning yards under a well-judged ride. FULL MAGAZINE shared the early lead from inside, moved clear on the
backstretch and took the rail, was challenged on the second turn, tried to duck in when put to the whip upper stretch then slowly yielded inside the last
furlong under a hand ride. WILD FOX was hustled to vie for the early lead, did not stay with FULL MAGAZINE on the backstretch and soon moved outside
that one for a clear path, went for the lead on the second bend but slowly wore down from between rivals in the lane.

Footnotes
BOWS N LACE encouraged to take the early lead, showed the way in hand, was let out into the second bend, lengthened command, was under a drive
through the stretch and maintained full control. G CITY WARRIOR was kept close and just outside BOWS N LACE, stayed just off the inside taking the
second turn, put to a drive leaving that bend, was no match for the leader in the lane, weaved out and back in inside the last furlong and was unchallenged
for second. BIG LUCK unhurried the first quarter mile, advanced to contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up as she fanned three wide
entering the stretch and could only gain third late. THE MORE I BURN raced in contention from along the rail for nearly five furlongs, continued to save
ground through the bend then flattened out for the stretch run. HIDDEN FIGURE was a factor between rivals for nearly a half mile then began to fade.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MAN brushed a couple times with STEALIN' SUMMER as they raced in the second flight on the backstretch, took the advantage from between
rivals on the bend, moved clear under a drive in the lane and held sway under steady handling. W W RUSSIAN GOLD settled at the back early, picked up
his pace after a quarter mile, lost ground four wide through the turn, was all out in the stretch but too late. STEALIN' SUMMER brushed a couple times with
MYSTERY MAN as he prompted the early pace from outside, moved clear for third three wide on the bend then could only pull clear for the show the last
eighth. W W TRAFALGAR was hustled to a clear early lead, overtaken from outside on the turn and flattened out for the drive. BOLD ATTACK raced in
contention just off the inside, began to fade nearing the end of a half mile, was unresponsive to urging upper stretch, eased inside the final sixteenth and
walked off.

READY SEEKER was sent to vie for the early lead, moved clear on the backstretch and took the inside, showed the way in hand, was roused again upper
stretch, put to a drive with a furlong to go and widened command. JULIAISON pressed READY SEEKER from just outside on the backstretch and through
the second bend, was under steady urging in the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the final furlong, was straightened nearing the sixteenth
marker, tried to duck in under a right whip in the waning yards but was still easily second best. NURSE SADIE moved to the outside early on, was three
wide on the second turn, failed to have a stretch bid but was unchallenged for third. DIAMOND STELLAR failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
EUGENE forwardly placed from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, commenced his bid in the lane, began to gradually drift out approaching the
eighth pole, was straightened nearing the sixteenth marker, lugged in through the waning yards but got up in time. ABOVE NIKE crowded briefly at the start,
shared the early lead outside BULL ATTACK, moved clear into the turn, stayed just off the inside, wad driven clear upper stretch, allowed to coast inside the
final sixteenth, put to a drive again nearing the wire but was outfinished. BRIANS WAY prominent between rivals, was two wide on the bend, fanned outside
EUGENE for the stretch run, lacked a significant bid but took over third as he lugged in some inside the final furlong. BULL ATTACK displayed early speed
from inside, did not keep up through the turn and flattened out for the drive. THACKER FROMM bumped then jostled with FADE FROM BLACK leaving the
chute, progressed from inside on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch and gave way. FADE FROM BLACK bumped FADE FROM BLACK just
after the break then jostled with that one while in close quarters leaving the chute, was hustled along from between rivals but gave way with three furlongs
left.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S RULE rated from inside, swung out into the bend, advanced outside FIXICO, angled back in at the quarter pole, was boxed in leaving the bend,
altered out three wide at the top of the lane, bumped FOX FREY, rallied to gain the lead with seventy yards to go and began to drew off nearing the wire.
TIZRIK broke in stride, showed the way in hand, was roused with two furlong left, under a drive through the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but
was clearly second best. FOX FREY forwardly placed from outside, bumped a couple times with FIXICO in the first quarter mile, was three wide taking the
bend, bumped and forced out at the top of the stretch, ran evenly the final furlong but gained third. KING TITO moved outside TIZRIK with four furlong left,
threatened on the turn but began to wear down through the lane. FIXICO prominent between rivals, bumped a couple times with FOX FREY in the first two
furlongs then gave way with three furlongs left.

Footnotes
HALO COUTURE gradually angled in through the backstretch, was put to a drive along the rail leaving the bend, edged ahead nearing the furlong marker
and held on under steady urging. HOMETOWN PROSPECT soon had the lead, set a pressured pace just off the inside, was challenged from outside on the
turn, battled gamely between horses through the lane but did not have enough left in the waning yards. MEXIA was steadied back from crowding leaving the
five-furlong pole, progressed three wide on the bend, angled outside SONG AND A KISS at the top of the stretch, made a strong move the last eighth, was
too late but finished on even terms with SONG AND A KISS to share third. SONG AND A KISS pressed HOMETOWN PROSPECT from just outside, went
for the lead on the turn, retreated slightly to third upper stretch and ran evenly the final furlong. ENCHILADA in contention early, began to yield two wide on
the bend. MIKAYLA ATTACK was a factor from inside on the backstretch but steadily faded before finishing three furlongs.
