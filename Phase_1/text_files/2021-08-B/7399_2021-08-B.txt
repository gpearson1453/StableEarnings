NO EXIT stalked the leaders, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path through the stretch was kept to task. WONNEFRAC was hustled
early, dueled on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. PICKHIMUPSUP stumbled at the start, trailed the field on the
turn and was no threat. J M R TURADA set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

INTRICATELY was in touch, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. CAPE DESIDERATO was in range and
raced evenly on the far turn but was no match for the winner. BADDEST BLUES was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at
the top of the stretch was up for show. CAPTURE THE RIDE was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch
finished evenly. AMERICAN DRIVEN stalked the early leader, forced the pace on the far turn and had the lead at the top of the stretch but gave way.
GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. BREAD CRUMBS had no
speed and saved ground on the far turn but was never a threat. COUNTRYSIDE DRIVE was well back and showed little while outrun. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
set the pace but was headed on the far turn and came up empty.

MISS MATILDA was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. MOLLYTARA showed speed from the
outside, dueled on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. TERMSANDCONDITIONS was in range and
roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. NANA SAV settled off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch was all out. KEYED UP was up close and a factor from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. STARONTHEHORIZON was in touch and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON KEYED
UP AGAINST MOLLYTARA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SECRET ARCHANGEL stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. MAHONE BAY was
in mid pack, roused on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. KLASSY DELIGHT was in range and raced evenly on the far
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. I'M A GINGER was off the pace, closed the gap on the far turn and finished well. FAIRY had
no speed and saved ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS hopped at the start and
moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA tracked from the inside and dueled from between
foes on the far turn but leveled off. MS SUEDOO was unhurried early and hustled along on the far turn but was no real threat. TARA EMPIRE set the pace
and had a slim lead on the far turn but came up empty. MYSTERY DAY was in touch early but chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.
