four wide leaving the backstretch and got by late. REDS LITTLE STAR led the field through the backstretch, saw margins diminish quickly with two furlongs
remaining and was caught late. CAGEY raced in closest pursuit from just off the rail and failed to threaten. CIGARILLO saved ground racing three wide and
lacked a bid. FLASHY SISTER raced four to five wide into the far turn and tired.

in time for place. TRIPLE POWER vied four wide to the turn, came under encouragement between foes and flattened out late stretch. WEDGE POND set a
pressured pace from the two path, rallied into the stretch and weakened late. SIR MIEZIE raced four wide through the turn and faded. WALKTHELINE

FIRST BASE vied for the early lead from the three path, showed the way through the turn, was kept under handling and remained clear. YNOTGIVEITAGO
hustled away, took closer order in the final turn and closed steadily late. BIG Z broke alertly then was sent for speed outside, sat just off the pace through
the turn, ducked in and lacked a needed kick. FRAN FROM PERU raced four wide leaving the backstretch and rallied late. DRAGON WING away last then
was hustled into range along the rail and raced evenly. I AM AN EMPRESS offered little. SWEAT EQUITY loaded without rider and was outrun. *POST

INTERESTING TIMES contested the early pace from the rail, gained a short advantage into the stretch and held sway. SANGRIA stalked the pacesetters
three to four wide, drove four wide at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly between foes into the stretch and missed. BABS DELIGHT sat in range while five
wide, began bid nearing the five sixteenth marker, launched an all out bid into the stretch outside and got by for show honors. FLORAL hesitated at the start,
saved ground from the rail through the backstretch, bid three wide into the lane and was outkicked on the rail. EXACTLY raced at the back of the pack and
passed tiring rival late. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE contended the pace through the backstretch, took pressure in the turn and gave way grudgingly in the
final sixteenth.

Footnotes
REGAL MAX settled in stride to led the field through the backstretch, responded to looming threat into the stretch and finished gamely. SHARP DRESSED
BEAU rated off the pace from the three path, roused at the quarter pole then moved up menacingly but was unable to reach the winner. SLEW'S BAK raced
four wide through the opening turn, began bid outside approaching the quarter pole and lacked the kicked needed. PARKING PERMIT unhurried early and
bid mildly from rail. DREADNAUGHT saved ground on rail and lacked a response when called upon. TROOPER JOHN sat in range outside, began bid in
the final turn and flattened. RAIL HUGGER reluctant to load and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EL NOBLE vied inside leaving the chute, rated just off the pace through the backstretch, drove four wide on the final turn, gained the lead into stretch and
held sway. ASTRONOMICAL hustled to the front then dueled to the quarter pole inside of ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER, kept on stubbornly along the rail but
was unable to get by the leader and held firm for second. WYE CROSS reserved early in the five path, began a wide bid nearing the quarter pole, closed
steadily outside and just missed for place. BIG AL'S VISION chased from the rail into the lane and flattened late. DOC COPE lagged early, swung out into
the stretch and closed late. HE'S CRIMSON CODE lacked a serious bid. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER pressed the pace while four to five wide, dueled
outside of ASTRONOMICAL, was unable to move on with the field with two furlongs remaining and wilted. LANNY MAC chased through the final turn then
stopped and was eased. TANNIN tired early.

Footnotes
ROMAN STEEL sent for outside speed then emerged the leader leaving the first turn, saved ground while showing the way under a snug hold, responded to
challenge from MINSKY MOMENT and prevailed under a long hard drive. MINSKY MOMENT reserved off the early pacesetters in the four path, began his
bid at the five sixteenth pole, kept on under determined drive, dug in for the last strides and just missed. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE was outsprinted
through the opening turn then tracked inside and finished evenly. STEELFORCE shifted outside leaving the backstretch and lodged a late mild bid.
MIDNIGHT SHAKE chased through the far turn then took closer order and weakened late stretch. BOLSANO gained closer order into the far turn and bid
belatedly outside. TRANG raced four wide into the first turn and rallied mildly late. STAPLETON saved inside and faded gradually along the rail. AWESOME
ANTHONY offered little.
