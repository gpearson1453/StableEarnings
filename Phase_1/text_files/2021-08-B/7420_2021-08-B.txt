Footnotes
SPANKHURST vied for the early lead on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then shook clear in the stretch, drew off and was kept to
the task. SOCIETY BOY set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the turn, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest.
PIZZA CHARLIE well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and evened out. PUNX never far
back, looped four wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no stretch rally. COUNTRY RUCKUS well placed and between rivals, angled in
and faded through the turn.

EVERY LITTLE BIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenged, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
STRAIGHT MADNESS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and closed well for the place. BABY DRAGON mid
pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. CINCO DE MANDEE tracked the pace, saved
ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. BROOKLYNS SURPRISE allowed to settle, moved to
position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened. LIL H was a brief factor.

STRETCH RUNNER well placed and outside, gained a striking position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, shook clear, then drew off
under steady pressure. PITON tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged up for the place. HEY SACH stalked the pace on the outside while pulling, gained a short lead through the turn, then weakened late and
held the show. SILVER DOLLAR CITY allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not gain the
final furlong and held a share. NOT QUITE WRIGHT mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened
out. PATHWAY TO VICTORY passed tiring rivals, widest. DEVILISH THOUGHTS never far back, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into
the stretch, steadied and had no rally. LAUGHINAGAIN was no factor. HUNTIN' THE RUT set the early pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
DAHOG tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear late. MAD
JACK allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, then closed the gap on the winner late, gaining
the place. C THE KING stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a clear lead through the second turn, drew off in the lane, then weakened late
and held the show. GOLD WING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. BIG
RIG mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no rally. THAT'S BUCKBEAK sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. DIMATE was no factor.
