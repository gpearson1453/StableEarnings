Footnotes
LOVE ON THE FLY lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore into the stretch and held PULPIT LINE safe late. PULPIT
LINE was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was gaining late. COASTAL AFFAIR tracked
the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the leaders with a furlong to run and gave way in the drive. UNCOMMONBLESSING
pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. BETHEL RIDGE broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside
and weakened after going six furlongs. LIRIO TIGRADO was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, weakened after going five
furlongs and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
THE PRESS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid in tandem with CANDY ZIP nearing the quarter,
vied with that rival and edged clear through the closing yards. CANDY ZIP stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid with the
winner nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly in a vigorous drive. SO LUCKY was away in good order to set a pressured pace,
drifted in nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. ZATTER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the quarter and lost
chance. FUZZY DOLPHIN showed brief speed from the inside, weakened and was eased through the lane.

DON'T RUB IT was pushed out soon after the start, pressed the pace of SHE OWNS THE PAYNT from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the
nine-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with three furlongs to run and held sway to the wire. SHES GOT THE POWER was bumped at the break, raced
just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position into the stretch but failed to gain on the winner in the drive.
SHE'S MY RIDE was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed closing response. ZEYNEP broke sharply then
lugged out badly through the first turn, dropped far back and did not reach contention. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT veered out at the start, rushed to vie, set
pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
FIRE ESCAPE broke sharply to press the pace of AWESOME DAZE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths
marker and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. AWESOME DAZE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was no match
for the winner after the opening quarter but clearly second best. LET IT REIGN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to
gain in the drive. CHINOOK QUICK lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a
factor. ONE OCEAN showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. SAY GOODBYE settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
FREIBURG was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore inside the furlong
marker and drew clear. DREAMER'S REALITY was away in good order to duel for the lead with ROMAN RUSH while racing three-wide and gave way to
the winner through the final furlong. ROMAN RUSH broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with DREAMER'S REALITY from the inside and gave way
after going five furlongs. MISO FAST lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TUMAC MOUNTAIN pressed the pace
while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. SALTY MINNOW lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

FINISHED MY P H D was away alertly to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off
through the lane with complete authority. ALWAYS FOR MONEY chased the leaders while racing four-wide, could not reach the winner in the drive but
finished willingly. CRIBBS broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. SLEEPY SUE lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. PRINCESS CAROLINE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and was not a factor. RATIONAL lagged early, saved ground and did not reach contention.
