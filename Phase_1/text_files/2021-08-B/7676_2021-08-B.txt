REIGN OF FIRE settled off the pace in a good position, shifted out on the turn, closed steadily under urging, got up past the eighth pole and inched clear
late. TACTICAL ATTACK dueled two wide to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly in a good effort. BOOGIE TWO SHOES was hustled along to duel inside
past the sixteenth pole, faltered and held safely for show. STEPHEN JAMES saved ground, lacked a rally and was not a threat. DADDY'S GIRL trailed while
racing outside and passed a tiring rival. ROUSING RUBBLE was never far back, went widest in the drive, had nothing left and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
HEY PILGRIM was hustled away from the gate, pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, continued willingly and wore down his rival to get up in the final
strides. ANNIE'S BOY set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was caught near the wire. RAMBLIN' MAN raced close to the pace
towards the outside of the pack and earned show in a steady effort. MYSTIC REALITY pressed the pace inside to the turn, dropped back and finished
evenly. NO SUPAH FOR YOU was never far back, saved ground, bid off the rail and lacked the needed rally. Hand timed.

LAST PUNCH led throughout and held safely under mild urging. MY CRAFTY GAL pressed the pace while racing inside, lacked the needed late response
and finished second best. OUTSIDE THE LAW raced close to the pace, went five wide entering the stretch, failed to rally and held for show.
SHESAHEATWAVE raced close to the pace, saved ground, bid and hung late. BURNADEBT raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace.
SUPAH SISTA was not a factor. KID CAT passed a tiring rival. J T'S LA NENA had brief speed only. The fractional split of 5598 was removed. Hand timed.

TICO TIME set the pace and held well under mild urging. OUR LIZZY LOU was off slowly, moved up inside, bid willingly to threaten and didn't have enough
late. RUN FOR BELLE was void of early speed, advanced to the turn, bid and came up empty. FOXY CARMELA pressed the pace to the turn, swung wide
and gave way. IN IT FOR LIFE showed good early speed while racing inside and gave way on the turn. CALIFORNIA DREAMER showed speed to the turn
swung wide and gave way. PERKY BRUNETTE lacked a bid in an outside trip. Hand timed.
