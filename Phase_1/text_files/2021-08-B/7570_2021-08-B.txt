CAT GIUMARELLO settled inside, angled out rallying into the stretch then wore down the leader late. BIG RED SEVEN stalked the pace outside, took over
on the final turn, moved clear but was nailed nearing the wire. IZA ONE reserved early in the two path, moved wide in the stretch gaining. MOLLY'S GAME
trailed early then picked off rivals without threatening. CHANCEE hustled to the front inside for half a mile and weakened. NOT IN THE MOOD saved
ground close up and proved empty in the stretch. TOWSON forced the pace outside for half a mile and gave way. ROBIN'S DESTINY lacked speed and
gave way readily.

ELITE MISSION quickly took control in hand, widened in the stretch, remained safe and was taken in hand late. CAUSE I SAID SO lagged far behind,
advanced inside and closed the gap too late. RISING STORM dropped back in the two path, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. NEW HAMPSHIRE
moved inside down the backstretch then came up empty. EXPENSIVE chased inside early and was always outrun. POP POP'S BOY forced the pace for
half a mile and stopped abruptly.

HEART OF A DREAMER moved clear inside, widened in the stretch, drifted out through the stretch but stayed safe. GOLDENLINEOF pursued the
pacesetter outside then raced evenly through the stretch. COBBLE HILL was taken up inside on the turn then came again outside. BOSTON LIGHT
advanced in the two path then flattened out in the stretch. IMPACTFUL moved closer four wide on the turn then proved empty. WEEKEND IN COURT
dropped back inside and was never a factor. STRICTLY THE BEST broke a bit awkwardly and was always far back. SHANDIAN broke alertly and led briefly
then gave way readily.

pursued the winner, vied outside and continued gamely to the finish. MYSTICAL CHARGE lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. MISS
JASSER chased outside and was never in contention. TISTAAHAL raced within striking range early then stopped abruptly.

TWIRLING LIZ dueled outside, moved clear on the turn then held rival safe late under strong urging. REITERATE steadied along the rail into the far turn, bid
wide and finished willingly. REIGNING FIRE lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and closed with good late energy. KARABESSA was urged close up
between rivals then inside and proved empty in the stretch. BEST SECRETS KEPT ducked out sharply just after the start then raced wide. BRAZILIAN BAY
prompted the pace between rivals down the backstretch and faded. BLITCHTON LADY pressed the pace near the inside and began fading on the turn.

OLDFASHIONED CLUB set measured pace inside, repelled rival, drew away handily. JONES TAXI reserved in the two path, advanced on the final turn,
mild bid. SEAT OF HONOR dropped back early, moved wide on the turn rallying. TACTICAL PLAN fanned six wide into first turn, pressed winner then
empty late. BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. WILD HAVEN lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. DRUMMER
DON dropped back inside and never a factor. BANKER'S ISLAND lacked speed and weakened steadily. SIGHT LINE pressed pace briefly then gave way
readily. KLAATU bore out on the first turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BAYLEAF sped to the front inside, repelled challenges and remained ahead throughout under a drive. SIZZLING ROMA saved ground the entire trip and
made a gradual late gain. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER lacked speed, circled field into the stretch and closed well too late. MISS DILLINGHAM offered strong
five wide rally on the turn, reached near even terms and flattened out. KAREN'S GEM chased four wide just off the leaders and proved empty. BLUNT
FORCE settled behind a wall of pacesetters and lacked a rally. BRYCE'S PHILLY prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and gave way.
FLEETERTHAN was urged close up between rivals and stopped after half a mile.

FIRST CITIZEN dueled in the two path, edged clear after half a mile and remained safe while kept to his task. OVER SENSUAL dropped well behind,
advanced wide and finished strongly too late. DOUBLEPOUR lagged far behind, swung very wide into the stretch rallying. ARRECIFE trailed for half a mile
then offered some late energy. BECAUSE I CAN vied along the rail for half a mile and gave way. UNIMPEACHABLE chased wide, made a brief bid into the
far turn and weakened. NINE TOE JOHNNY broke slowest and was never in contention. CRISTIANO'S DREAM angled inside early then gave way on the
turn. BREITHORN was well placed close up three wide but stopped abruptly.
