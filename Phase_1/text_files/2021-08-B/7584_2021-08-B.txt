Footnotes
DEJOHN took the lead shortly after the break and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested
the edge through the far turn then dug in under determined handling to hold off PRIVATE NETWORK, who drifted into the opening turn then stalked the
pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage, but was outfinished in a stretch long duel. VOLTAMOUR
stalked two deep then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch and dug in for third later
yards. INDY DEL SOL rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and raced
close into the lane, though, flattened the final sixteenth. SUN OF SILVER was carried out into the first turn and ran well off the pace leaving the turn, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, though, showed little response. R H F SPECTRE saved ground. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
COACH RUBE took a quick lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, drew off to a long lead through the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail,
was steadily handled to late stretch then taken in hand approaching the wire. DEVILISH BEAUTY settled off the earlier pace about the three path, started a
bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then held on for second. IMAGINE VICTORY rounded the opening turn about the
four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then dueled for third inside the
sixteenth pole. DEBRAW raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace from the half mile pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths, raced at
the rail on the far turn then weakened. MORALITY CLAUSE saved early ground then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the five path on
the far turn but showed little further. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE rated close off the rail the opening turn then faded through the backstretch.

LIL TOUGHMAN stalked from the three path then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, contested at even terms between horses on the far turn and
dug in under determined handling to take the nod through the final yards. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured
approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave up the edge at the rail midway on the far turn, but dug in gamely through deep stretch before relenting. NOBLE
EL SID rated close inside, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, was roughed and hit the rail past the pole, though, came back to finish evenly. BLUE
COLLAR BOY hesitated leaving the gate then settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested even
terms three wide on the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and flattened out the final furlong. WILD RUN raced off the pace inside, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. COLONIAL ROAD rounded the opening turn about the three path and showed
little response through the backstretch. WE GOT THE MONEY raced off the pace inside then faded through the backstretch. YES SIR BOB raced well back
while saving ground. Following a Stewards inquiry, there was also a claim of foul against the rider of Normandy's Empire, lodged by the rider of Noble El
Sid, although the Stewards found no warrant to the claim.
