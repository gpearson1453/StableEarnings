Footnotes
WILL TOO SHY stalked close up outside, rallied outside of WISECRACK entering the stretch, took charge passing the furlong marker, pulled away and was
in hand the final yards. WISECRACK showed good early speed to set the pace, raced well off the inside turning for home, dug in gamely and came up
second best. DIAMANTE DE ORO trailed early, came three wide into the lane, raced between foes and rallied mildly outside. D TACHYON steadied at the
start, chased inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch and was outkicked for third. RIGHT ON Q raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. POWER WOLF raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and faded. NEPTUNES REVENGE raced off the pace, between rivals on the
turn and gave way.
