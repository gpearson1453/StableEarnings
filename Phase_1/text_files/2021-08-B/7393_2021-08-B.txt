Footnotes
HICKORY HILL unhurried early, closed fast four wide through the final furlong in the eight path and was along in time. QUASAR MOON trailed, swung wide,
closed willingly and got up for second in the middle of the racetrack. UNCLE CARLITO dueled for the early lead two wide, shook clear in upper stretch then
was outfinished. GOLD SHARK stalked the pace and finished with good courage three wide. TANNERS PRIDE contested the lead along the rail into the
stretch while hard used then weakened. NANO stalked the pace from the inside and lacked the needed response.

balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out. B DUBYA with the second flight inside, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch and
rallied for second. AMERICAN CAMP with the second flight two wide, passed tiring rivals. ALFRED pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, matched
strides for the lead into the stretch and weakened late. HIGH RISK STRATEGY failed to menace. STORM PEAK away alertly, set a pressured pace along
the inside for nearly six furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
LITTLE BLAKER prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, was headed while two wide nearing the furlong marker, drifted in bumping
SPIN DOCTOR at the sixteenth pole, dug in determinedly and got back up in time. SPIN DOCTOR stalked the pace from the start, rallied along the rail to
gain a slight lead in upper stretch, was bumped late and finished gamely. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE allowed to settle, closed rapidly on the outside on the far
turn, drifted to the five path giving up ground then came on again late. SAMMY DA BULL slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late. OVER ICCE
unhurried early, advanced along the inside in the far turn then leveled off. PRIVATE DRIVE broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then
weakened. DEER CREEK ROAD was outrun. VISUAL MISSION well placed, failed to respond. PAT'S KARMA had speed for six furlongs then folded. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SPIN DOCTOR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LITTLE
BLAKER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LITTLE BLAKER AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
LIBERTY BELLE had speed from the start along the rail, waited patiently, surged through deep stretch under right then left handed urging and got up in
time. LYRICIST stalked the early pace, circled rivals four then three wide, made the lead near mid stretch and just missed hanging on in a game effort.
SECRET SARAH rushed to the lead, set the pace under pressured in the two path into the stretch then was outfinished. DARLING BELLE moved up three
wide before a half, prompted the pace into the stretch then came up empty. GRACEFUL PANTHER trailed.
