LIKE MOULIN ROUGE stalked the pace from the two path then angled out mid turn to make a bid then gained command at the three sixteenths pole and
drew off. BIG PURITY was rushed to the lead from the inside and tired after a half but was able to hold the place. BIG BEN AA chased the leaders from the
three path and made a late mild bid in the stretch to just miss the place. KD DERBY GIRL was unhurried early from the four path but was never a factor.
