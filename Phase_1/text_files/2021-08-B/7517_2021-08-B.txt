ICY CHARLIE went to the front, saved ground, drove clear down the stretch and proved much the best. DA DUE RUN RUN pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ORETTA was an early factor, racing behind the leader, weakened down the
stretch and couldn't keep up with the top two. BIRDIE CALL hesitated and hopped at the break, racing from the back, moved up on the outside around the
turn and tired late. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

AWE SHACKLE vied for the early lead, saved ground, dueled throughout and prevailed for the win. WAR COUNT challenged for the lead throughout,
dueled to the wire, was outfinished for the win and just held on for second. RUNCHIEFRUN unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the
final turn, made a rail bid and just missed getting up for second. EASTER SNAP pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the final and weakened.
FREDONIAN always raced near the back, saved ground around the second turn and was never a threat. IMMORTAL raced near the back and never
mounted a bid. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

SWEET RACHEL raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, angled out down the stretch, rallied strong and was going away at the end.
CROWN ROCKET pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. FANCY LANCY went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground and tired down the lane. CHIEF JIMBO broke slow, ducked in at the start, racing in the rear, improved position, but was
never a factor. CAYENNE FERVOR pressed the pace, raced three wide around the turn and faded. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI raced near the back, came

Footnotes
ROCKDALE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. WHEN'S TEE TIME unhurried in the early part, made a steady gain,
rallied, four wide down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. KINGPRIN raced within contention, drifted in around the first turn,
lacked a late kick and got caught for second. MR. TIN MAN challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and weakened on the inside. GINA'S
BROTHER raced near the back in the beginning, drifted out around the first turn to avoid rival who drifted into his path, made a late mild bid, but was no
factor. POINT OF DIRECTION raced near the back in the early going, ducked out, bumped rival around the first turn and was never a threat. PONTI POKER
raced within contention and faded. MORO SAVAGE raced near the middle of the field in the early part, faded and finished evenly. CHARLIE'S STAR broke
slow, raced green and was never close, distanced to wire. PUTTER raced near the back, was bumped hard around the first turn and lost rider, walked off. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS #9 KINGPRIN WAS DISQUALIFED FROM
THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FIRST TURN.

win. MOONSHINERBOY hopped at the start, racing in the back, moved up, wide around the turn, rallied outside and made a big gain. ON TILT went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground and was outfinished. DOUBLE BOGEY was an early factor, took the lead at the head of the stretch and faded. RACE WAS
