KINGSTON TIME stalked the pace looming through the turn rallying to draw even alongside rival in upper stretch gradually wearing foe down. RUBY Y'ALL
sent clear set the pace through the turn being collared from the outside in upper stretch digging in eventually ceding in grudging fashion. FLAT OUT
SMOKIN tracked evenly through the turn angling out in upper stretch moving in range lacking needed late surge. MAYAN QUEEN failed to mount a credible

ELUSIVE EYES stalked the pace rallying to hook rival on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch angling out a bit while widening late. MISTERKAPLAN
raced evenly off the pace coming four wide in upper stretch angling in to the two path while rallying late. ESTA CALIENTE slow early lost ground to upper
stretch mustering a mild rally to best the others five and six wide. DILEMMA pressed to even terms outside the quarter pole then was dispatched by the
winner in upper stretch fading late near mid track. CELEBRATED ARTIST slow early played no factor. THEARTOFCOMPROMISE flashed early speed then
gave way on the turn.
