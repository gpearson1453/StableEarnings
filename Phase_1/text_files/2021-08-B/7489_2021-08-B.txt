DOHENY BEACH inherited the lead when MOOGIE CAT bore out on the first turn then set the pace to the stretch and held driving. SNICKER'N DAN was
forced out six wide on the first turn by MOOGIE CAT, got corrected into the backstretch, chased the winner but could make no headway while an easy
second. MOOGIE CAT hustled along early but bore out badly into the first turn, was corrected into the backstretch but had relinquished any chance by that
time. MEGGY'S AMAZING had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BARBIERE settled for a half mile, bid two wide into the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held stubbornly. FOREIGN PROTOCOL set the
pace to the far turn then lugged out pushing others out with him, corrected into the stretch but was outfinished for the win. DESERT DUDE pressed the
pace, was three wide into the far turn, got pushed out to the five path to the stretch and did not rally. ENGRAM trailed to the far turn, saved ground to the
stretch but was not a threat in the drive. HONOS MAN was outsprinted early, bid three wide into the far turn, was also pushed out by FOREIGN
PROTOCOL, had his heels clipped by STRIKE IT LUCKY and did not rally. STRIKE IT LUCKY settled for three eighths, made a bid while between rivals,
was taking up into the far turn then was pushed out, crossed over and clipped heels, stumbled badly but the rider expertly held on then was pulled up in the
stretch and did not cross the finish line. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the far turn and disqualified FOREIGN PROTOCOL from
second place and made him unplaced.

Footnotes
PROJECT LOGIC hustled to the lead, angled over and set all the pace then kicked clear and was ridden out to the wire. ROYAL DANIELLE had no speed,
saved ground to the stretch and got the late nod for second. JAN'S BEST also had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then
was nipped for second. RHODYISAROCKSTAR was chasing to the second turn while off the rail and lacked a late bid. WATERFALL pressed the winner for
a half mile then was outkicked and weakened. LUCKY LARA bore out badly and was almost ten wide to the backstretch, corrected but lost any chance.
GRAYSLAND GIRL tracked the pace to the second turn then gave out.
