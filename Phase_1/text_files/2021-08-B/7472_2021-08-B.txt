Footnotes
SHE'S MO BETTER , two wide chasing the leader around the turn, drifted out a bit at the head of the stretch, gained command inside the eighth pole and
drove clear. MURPH , clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and weakened late. LOUELLA STREET , forced out by DRY WELL when that
one was forced out soon after the break, angled in and moved up, made an inside run past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on past the furlong pole and
faded. REDWHITEANDTACOS , three deep around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gradually weakened. DRY WELL , steadied when bumped
and forced out by CANDY FABLE soon after the break, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch then was taken up in tight quarters
entering the turn. CANDY FABLE , fractious during the post parade, bore out leving the starting gate, raced well off the inner rail down the backstretch,
faltered on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated to contention, dropped in and stalked around the turn, responded and bid towards the
rail entering the lane, spurted clear in mid stretch and held firm under a strong drive. LIVE AID sped to a clear advantage into the turn, set the pace three
wide under some rating, was joined from her inside soon into the lane, failed to contain the winner but kept on gamely to the wire. CASTILLEJA , bumped at
the break, was steadied off heels nearing the turn, moved up towards the rail mid turn, angled three wide into the stretch and continued with interest.
HUFFLEPUFF broke a bit slow, advanced inside early, eased back near the half mile marker, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four to five wide into the
stretch but failed to generate a solid run. TAPDANCING GIRL came in at the break and bumped with a rival, raced off the pace mid turn, saved some
ground in upper stretch but came up empty. BOUND FOR BROADWAY , three to four wide, faded.

JOSEF IS REAL , two wide on the turn, floated out a bit entering the stretch, drifted in when going clear in mid stretch then drifted out near the sixteenth
pole. LADNEEDSAHANDLER set the pace along the rail, lost the advantage in upper stretch, was lightly steadied behind the winner in mid stretch then
finished willingly. KICKSTARTER , urged down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide and failed to rally. SPEIGHTSTER RED lacked speed, hugged
the inner rail around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. An objection by the rider of LADNEEDSAHANDLER against the winner for alleged
interference in mid stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

clear of the rest. KEEPING THE PEACE stalked the winner three wide, was under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, chased into the lane then faded
through the drive. TICKER TAPE PARADE drifted out at the break, raced removed from the inside and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TREMENDOUS broke in the air, recovered and accelerated between foes soon after to take command, moved out to clear lead and set a rated pace
towards the inside, opened up after being roused left handed in upper stretch, had his rider lose the whip near the furlong grounds, kept on under steady
hand urging then was geared down in the final strides. SUPER HOUDINI saved ground while within range, dropped back some under pressure leaving the
far turn, found more to advance into the lane, angled out and came back steadily. KING ALAN , four wide early, edged up three wide and between runners
past the five eighths, gave hard pursuit three wide past the five sixteenths then came up empty through the final furlong. GREGORIA'S BAY lost ground four
wide outside runners, was ridden along around the final turn, made a slight run into the stretch, shifted in and went evenly from there. RIPPOLINO , five
wide into the first turn, dropped in to about the two path with seven furlongs remaining, edged up a bit after a half mile, chased into the lane, steadied briefly
in upper stretch then lacked a response. SANTO stalked two to three wide, was under heavy pressure leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on past the
quarter pole and gave way.

MARGIE'S HEAVEN hugged the inner rail throughout, dueled with OLIVE KAT and narrowly prevailed under vigorous rousing. OLIVE KAT disputed the
pace outside the winner and just missed in a game performance. BUNTING , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was jostled at the break, circled the turn
three wide, drifted out entering the stretch and drifted out in mid stretch. FIFTEEN ROYALS , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way.
CAROLINA ICE , no factor, raced along the inner rail and remained on her left lead in the stretch. WHISPURRING KITTEN came out at the break bumping
BUNTING, steadied when shuffled back near the half mile pole and faltered leaving the turn.

UNREQUITED LOVE eased out early, bid two wide outside the leader into the turn, dueled on slim lead past the three eighths, turned back a challenge from
MAKE IT A DOUBLE in upper stretch, shook clear under left handed rousing in mid stretch then held firm. MAKE IT A DOUBLE stalked the pace three wide,
moved up to have aim mid turn, bid outside the winner soon after, failed to match strides in mid stretch but kept on trying to the line. LADY LYNNE was
lightly steadied after the break, circled the turn four wide but lacked a solid kick. NETTI GIRL was sent clear early and dropped over towards the rail, was
joined by the winner into the turn, dueled after being headed past the three eighths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. FEARLESS
IDEAS , bumped at the break, raced off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch but lacked a late response. SUNDAY IN L B C , between rivals near the
half mile marker, gave way. RAISED WRONG had her rider lose his irons after being bumped and pinched back leaving the gate, recovered after about a
furlong, saved ground with pursuit mid turn, faded through the drive and was eased late.
