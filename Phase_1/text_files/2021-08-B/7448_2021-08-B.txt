Footnotes
COASTAL BUZZ was away in good order to set a pressured pace from between foes, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out
nearing the quarter and held TAP THE BANK safe late. TAP THE BANK pressed the pace from the inside, stayed on well in the drive, drifted in late and
finished willingly. SENOR FABULOSO lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole,
steadied when lacked racing room and lost chance. HIGH SPEED CHASE pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE RACE AND AFTER REVIEWING MADE NO CHANGE.

PIN UP LADY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out to the wire.
GOLD SUPPLY chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. BEE EINSTEIN was
off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. CLUB ROYALE pressed the pace from between
foes and weakened after going a half. SALTY NUGGET was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened.

IN THE WIND was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced from off the rail through the turn, angled in approaching the stretch, reached the fore
with a furlong to run and drew off. BESOS FOR LILY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid in tandem with
the winner in mid-stretch but could not match strides with that rival in the drive. WISHFUL WON settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in
mid-stretch and finished evenly late. DAME OF THE WEST sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened through the final
furlong. COWLITZ chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. MAYBEE A DIVA lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards to be going away
late. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO was off slow, moved up quickly to race just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. EXTRACTOR sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged nearing the five-sixteenths pole, re-cleared
with a furlong to run and gave way grudgingly late. MIRROR IMAGE settled off the leaders early, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. BALTIMORE BEECHO was forwardly placed early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. IRON ROB chased the leaders while
racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN showed brief speed, raced
six-wide through the turn and weakened.

VICENTE'S SHADOW raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was up in the closing yards. FOREVER GOLD
sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner from over
the top. FLOAT ON was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. ORCADIAN STORM chased
the leaders from the inside and stayed on well in the drive. ATTA BOY BILLY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
rally.

Footnotes
SHARK HARBOR set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off through the lane. I'M NOT GABBY broke
sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and failed to match strides with that rival in the drive. GREY POINT was away in good order to
press the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. STARZAN hopped at the start, lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. METATIGER pressed the pace from between foes early, weakened and was vanned off. NEW
EVERY MORNING stumbled at the start and lagged throughout.
