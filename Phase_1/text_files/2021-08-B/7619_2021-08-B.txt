bore out into the stretch and closed well while no threat. LA PURISSIMA dueled along the rail to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. MAMBO DANCER
angled inside on the turn and was never a factor. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA chased outside, made a brief bid after half a mile then faltered.

TINAS SHINING STAR settled wide near the back of the field, advanced wide on the final turn and edged clear driving. TERP TOWN moved behind a wall
of pacesetters, angled out in the stretch and offered a mild bid. TRUE DAKOTAN forced the pace in the two path then inside and continued willingly.
MENELAO faded on the final turn, angled wide and came again without menacing. FIVE STAR PHIL bore out into the first turn, prompted the pace wide and
tired. MAYBE IT'S TIME was carried out very wide into the first time then gave way. SWEET DREAMS BABE saved ground close up and was finished by
the far turn.

SCATRATTLEANDROLL pressured from her outside, moved clear under raying midway on the final turn then edged away under encouragement through
the stretch. SWEET SAMI D saved ground throughout, was rated early, rallied well but was no match for the winner. NO MERCY PERCY settled outside,
made a menacing bid on the final turn then flattened out. DANCER'S MELODY lacked speed near the inside, moved wide into the stretch and was no factor.
MUCHA MEZQUINA stumbled at the start and raced far back then passed a fading rival. SAILINGINTOTHEWIND bobbled at the break, rushed to
contention wide on the first turn, dueled the winner then came up empty.
