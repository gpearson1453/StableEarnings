Footnotes
ALPHA ZULU took over the clear lead around the first turn, set the pace by a comfortable margin through the backstretch, saved ground into the lane,
roused for more in the upper stretch, had more in reserve and kept clear. FLANIGAN'S COVE stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, edged up
closer around the far turn, hustled along two wide in the upper stretch, stayed in pursuit and held place. SAIGON was slow into stride at the start then
steadily moved up closer through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the lane and prevailed for a share. KITTEN TALES rated neat midpack,
roused along the inside in the lane, raced in contention near the eighth pole then flattened out. RHYTHM AND POWER settled through early stages, hustled
up two wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ROSA KHUTOR got bumped at the start, was unhurried along the inside and failed to
move on under pressure. LIKEHAIL broke out at the start, raced off the pace then hustled up two to three wide and never threatened. SILVER SULLY raced
off the pace, went four wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. ONONIMO showed early response then retreated around the far turn.

CASHABLE sped to the lead at the start, vied with rival around the turn then shook free inside turning for home, quickly widened to a clear advantage and
held firm. CUPCAKE raced in range around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, roused near the inside and dug in for place. GRAVITRON raced off
the top pair around the turn, roused four wide at the head of the lane, ranged up to CUPCAKE then yielded late. ESPERER (FR) raced in range through
early stages, was ridden along the outside in the lane, raced in contention but needed more for serious impact. FORTES raced off the pace, went five wide
into the lane and improved position. TAPIT'S RUBY hustled up along the rail around the turn, stayed on near the inside in the upper stretch and failed to
theaten. FIRST KITTEN chased near midpack, angled out around the turn and lacked a needed rally. BY THE HOUR raced two to three wide and never
menaced. LIAM'S NESSY vied with the winner around the turn then faded in the lane. MORENA DANCER raced off the pace, went wide into the lane and
failed to move on. BACHELORETTE steadied slightly around the turn and had failed to move into contention.

top still unasked late on the final turn, given cue at the head of the lane, responded gamely and finished clear. QUID stalked the pacesetter through the
backstretch, sat patiently around the far turn then launched two wide bid at the head of the lane, stayed on with good response but had to settle for second
best. ENGLISH TAVERN rated off the second flight, picked up the pace three wide late on the far turn, hustled along four wide in the upper stretch and
prevailed for a share. CANTAKEITANYMORE settled inside through early stages, cut the corner entering the lane, roused up the inside and needed more
for serious impact. SEE THE PYRAMIDS rated off the second flight, saved ground around the final turn, tipped two wide and failed to kick on. TAPWOOD
tracked the leader through the backstretch, moved up into striking range late on the final turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC
settled two wide through early stages, roused four wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. POSTERITY raced in the back, went four wide into the lane
and failed to rally. TOE CURLIN' KISS saved ground around the final turn and failed to move into contention. BIG DAVE tracked the pace through the

Footnotes
WOOTTON ASSET (FR) was allowed to settle out of the gate, secured inside position around the first turn then continued to rate off the early leaders,
began to pick up the pace mid-way around the final turn, angled out and hustled up turning for home, roused forward in the three path to the lead at the
eighth pole then kept clear under firm handling. SLICKED BACK rated a path outside the winner through the backstretch, angled out turning for home, raced
in traffic at the head of the lane, got clear along the outside and produced a solid finish. IT CAN BE DONE was forwardly placed behind the leader, was
ridden along and raced in aim at the five sixteenths pole, vied for the lead with INDIAN LAKE in the upper stretch, failed to be a match when the winner took
command near the eighth pole but stayed on with response and secured show. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) was unhurried and raced near the back of the field,
raced two wide around the far turn then shifted out four wide in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. EXPERIENCED raced off the pace, hustled up
five wide into the lane, gained closer contention then ran on evenly in the final furlong. INDIAN LAKE set the pace through the backstretch, held a slim lead
around the far turn, vied for the lead at the head of the lane, got collared by the winner nearing the eighth pole and gave way. DRAFT CAPITAL saved
ground and settled through early stages, angled out and hustled up in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. DOUBLEOSEVEN tracked the pace through
the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the far turn then failed to sustain bid past upper stretch and faded. EYE OF THE CAT steadied around
the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch, remained in range between foes around the final turn then weakened through the lane. SEARCH
FOR TRUTH stalked inside through the backstretch, remained in contention around the final turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch then came up
empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF SLICKED BACK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST WOOTTEN ASSET FOR
INTEREFERENCE AROUND THE FINAL TURN, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
