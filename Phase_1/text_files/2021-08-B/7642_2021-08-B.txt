WAGES pressed the pace, moved to challenge leaving the turn going four wide, edged clear into upper stretch, held under a drive. ABBIE'S WAY settled off
the pace, switched outside of foes into the turn going three to four wide on that bend, gained mildly. SINGING MARY set a pressured pace two wide,
weakened. OUR LAST ROSE tracked the leaders two wide, failed to rally. RITZY STORM raced outside five wide on the turn and failed to rally. DONNA
WHO broke in and steadied at the start then was urged forward to press the pace, went three wide on the turn came up empty. MCCIRCA chased briefly
inside, dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE WARRIOR was very hard to load, raced outside four to five wide on the turn, took aim and edged past late. HEAR ME ROAR dueled inside, kept
on gamely. CHARLIE DYNASTY bumped the outer rival at the start, dueled outside, yielded late. RELEASE THE GENIE broke a step slowly, settled last but
one racing in the four path into the turn, swung twelve wide in upper stretch and gained late. GO FOR THE LAUGH moved up close to the heels of the
leaders then took hold to track inside on or just off the rail, failed to rally. SUERTUDA steadied ever so slightly at the break, went three to four wide on the
turn and had no rally. RUN LIKE THE WIND bumped a rival at the start, was up close three wide on the turn, altered outside a rival five wide at the head of
the lane, weakened. SPINNING RED was bumped on both sides at the start, saved ground to no avail. CHA CHING CHARLIE stalked the leaders four
wide, came up empty. SHE'S RAINED OUT broke very awkwardly, saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CEBOLLA stalked the pace, went three to five wide on the turn, took aim and steadily edged by late. ABETEMARCO moved clear to dictate terms, shifted in
continuing to set the pace on or off the rail into the turn, edged clear again while drifting out leaving taht bend, was outkicked to the wire.
BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR switched out to track the leader, moved up between rivals into the turn, lost ground on the leader and moved out from two to four
wide on that bend, shifted outside a foe in upper stretch and had no kick. KELL'S KISS exchanged a hard bump at the start, settled at the rear, saved
ground and improved. SEVEN ROONEY was lightly brushed at the break, tracked mid-pack outside, went four wide on the turn losing ground but kept on in
the lane to improve position. HIT A NOTE exchanged a bump at the start, saved ground inside the middle pack, failed to rally. MINISTERTOMYHEART
brushed a rival at the start and slightly steadied, went three wide on the turn, could not rally in the lane. JAMIE CAN'T DANCE raced off the inside while
dropping back into the turn, went in the two to four path on that bend, was eased in the lane and walked off.
