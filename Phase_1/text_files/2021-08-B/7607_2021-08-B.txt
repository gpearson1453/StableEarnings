INVASION leaving the gate, was hard handled while trying to bear out along the inside around the first turn, bore out early on the backstretch, moved closer
on the final turn then drifted badly late. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL lagged to the stretch then passed tired ones. ROYAL'S INVASION was bumped leaving the
gate, moved to vie outside horses before a half then stopped in the lane. RINGLE BELLE angled to the inside while clear midway on the first turn, held on
for a half, stopped after five furlongs and was eased up.

HASHTAG WINNING had his head turned to the inside as the doors opened, broke well behind the field, made a strong three wide run to the front midway
on the final turn then drew out nearing the final sixteenth. SEPICATO was well placed inside, steadied when shut off while trying to rally into the far turn,
angled three wide midway on the bend, vied outside the winner into the final furlong then flattened out. BUILT THAT WAY pressed in the three path outside
the early leader then weakened. AHSAD was no factor. AUTOMATE was finished early. EYES ON ME made the early pace out from the inside, suffered a
catastrophic injury to his left front in early stretch and was pulled up.
