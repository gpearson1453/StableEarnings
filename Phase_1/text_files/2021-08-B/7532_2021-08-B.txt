TUXEDO broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to battle from the outside of COMMANDER
B through the second turn, disposed of that rival and quickly opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside, maintained his lead into the final turn,
turned back a bid from ACCEPT NO OTHER leaving the turn, and managed to fend off that stubborn rival again late to prevail. ACCEPT NO OTHER away
alertly and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time, took up the chase midway down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, to
loom a danger entering the lane, and battled willingly one out from the rail in the drive to just miss. NORTHERN KID unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. JACK DON'T DRINK settled
off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside
in the drive and just failed to hold the show spot. COMMANDER B away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time and through the second turn, began to drop back entering he backstretch, and lost touch with the
rest of the field through the final turn.

SHANGHAI DAWN away alertly and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and held the closers safely at bay to prevail. REMARKABLE GIRL broke
sharply and chased the leader into the first turn before being forced to steady midway through the turn when put in tight quarters, tracked the dueling leader
two wide in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside through the final turn, lacked room leaving the turn, eventually shifted off the rail, and closed
willingly two wide in the drive to prove second best. CATTITUDE rushed up to press the leader two wide leaving the first turn, forced the issue two wide in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the winner entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. VALUE DANCER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and showed some late
interest while finishing four wide in the drive. SILVER ARROW away well, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. HARBOUR STORM was jostled around in the run to the first turn, and clipped heels
while in tight quarters, recovered to stalked the leaders two wide into the backstretch, rallied along the inside approaching the final turn, but weakened over
the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim a foul. The rider of HARBOUR STORM lodged claims of foul against the riders
of both REMARKABLE GIRL and CATTITUDE for alleged interference approaching the first turn. After review the claims of foul were disallowed, and no
change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TIGER away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of LAUGH WITH ME
in the run down the backstretch, began to weaken entering the final turn, and had little to offer late. EYE BE SEEING YOU unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to just miss the show position. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well
and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to
garner a share. LAUGH WITH ME broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of GOLDEN TIGER entering the first turn, forced the issue from
the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just
miss. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail tipped three wide to mount his bid
entering the final turn, collared LAUGH WITH ME leaving the turn, and wore down that stubborn rival in the final strides. VOLO VELOCE stalked the early
pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final urn, and failed to make a serious late impact while
finishing four wide in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
REPRIMAND tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch to collar the
leader entering the final turn, and quickly assume command, maintained his advantage into the lane, and was never threatened late. THE KAT'S BACK
stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly two
wide in the drive to hold the place. AIRAFFAIR settled off the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, launched his bid from along the
inside entering the final turn, and closed steadily three wide in the drive to garner a share. THE VALENTINE KID settled well off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and improved his position late while finishing four wide in the drive.
WHO'S THAT away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and was
outfinished late while racing five wide in the drive. STAY ALL NIGHT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside,
dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late. BRANDON'S LEGACY settled towards the back of the pack while saving ground
at the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an impact. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the pace in the run to the final turn, was overtaken entering the turn, and faded over the final furlong.

TOBESUNNY away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn,
and closed willingly two out from the rail to take control in deep stretch and pull clear. ONE FLEET PRINCESS stalked the leader into the backstretch while
saving ground under snug restraint, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the drive,
while shifting to the two path late to get up for the place. CHEERS raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, controlled the pace in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late in a game effort. C R SUNRISE
broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, chased the leader two wide in the run to the final turn, rallied one
out from the rail through the final turn, but faded slightly in the late going. SUNGOLD BEAUTY unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the
backstretch, rallied one out from the rail from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the stretch drive. KOALA away alertly, and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
