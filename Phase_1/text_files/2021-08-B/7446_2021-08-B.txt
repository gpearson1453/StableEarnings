Footnotes
REV RITA was coaxed along soon after the break near the rail to press Aadhana in the early stages, was confidently handled through the far turn, asked
into the upper stretch and raced well clear in the drive under steady handling. BOWL OF CHERRIES stalked the early pace while racing near the inside,
moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. AADHANA bumped leaving the gate, vied for the early lead while racing
just off the inside, raced three deep past the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY stalked the early going from the
outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. DOUBLE FANTASY broke in and bumped rival then steadied shortly after losing a
considerable amount of ground at the break, raced four wide past the quarter pole and never was a serious threat. RIVER GIRL settled off the early pace,
raced five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. ESAGERARE dropped back early, was pulled up midway around the far turn and
had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
STRADARI was sent along early to show good early speed from the inside, was challenged by Season to Remember midway around the far turn, dug in
deep stretch and prevailed in a determined effort under all out pressure. SEASON TO REMEMBER stalked the pace, made a good bid nearing the quarter
pole, raced heads apart with Stradari through the stretch run and just missed in a game effort. IT'S A RIDDLE stalked the top trio early on, got bumped past
the half-mile marker, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled to the outside of the top pair and kept on willingly to the wire.. KIRSCH TRUFFLE
shifted out at the start, settled towards the back of the pack early, moved up five to six wide through the lane and had not enough in the drive. PLUM WILD
was slow early on, raced two to three wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. SHOWMETHEMAGIC broke to the outside, showed good early
speed to contend for the early lead and faded the final eighth of a mile. ISLAND LIFE bobbled at the start, was coaxed along early, raced in a bit tight up the
backstretch and bumped past the half-mile pole, then tired readily the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
A G INDY stalked the early pace, moved up three to four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. DEISE DELIGHT
(IRE) stalked the early going, lacked room near the eighth marker, angled out and closed in too late. I'M THE BOSS OF ME pressed the early leader down
the backstretch, raced between rivals in the stretch run and weakened a bit in the latter stages. NEW DRAMA was coaxed along to set the early pace from
the inside and weakened a bit late. TRIBAL BID dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive.
PISTACHIO PRINCESS was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced near the inside around the far turn and had no late rally. PLUM SEXY was
slow early, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and never was a factor. BIG PASSION dropped back early, raced three deep and had no response. OUR
LITTLE TIGER settled off the early pace, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
SOCAL RED steadied early, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch, raced widest through the lane and finished gamely while drifting in late to get up
under strong handling. MASHHAD FLATS raced four wide around the first turn, stalked the early pace down the backstretch, moved up five wide near the
three sixteenths pole, drifted in a bit late and finished willingly to the wire. BOMBS AT COCAL tossed head and bobbled at the start, stalked the early pace,
moved up six wide into the upper stretch, led at the eighth but couldn't hold off the top pair late. THIRTY FOUR COUPE showed good early speed along the
inside, continued to race near the rail in the stretch run and weakened the final eighth of a mile. EVEN STEVEN was slow early, raced two to three wide in
the drive and had no response. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT raced three wide around the first turn, tracked the leader down the backstretch, raced two to three
wide and weakened in the latter stages. FORMAL ORDER settled towards the back of the pack, raced three deep in the stretch and failed to respond. BIG
ROSIE dropped back early and failed to respond.

BUY WAVE BUY bumped leaving the gate, showed good early speed from the outside to set all the pace, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure.
PRANCE stalked the early going, moved up three wide to challenge near the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort. BASILIA was allowed to settle off
the early pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BRITTLE AND YOO was forwardly placed to lay up close early,
raced near the inside at the quarter pole, was blocked deep stretch and kept on to the wire. BESTRELLA (IRE) settled to the back of the pack early, moved
up along the inside around the far turn, lacked room repeatedly through the stretch and kept on after experiencing a troubled trip. STARSHIP SKY pulled
first time through the stretch on the inside, stalked the early pace, lacked room behind rivals on the far turn, raced four wide past the quarter pole and did not
have enough in the drive. SWEET DEVIL bumped with the winner at the start, raced up close early, was two to three wide in the stretch run and tired.

EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked under a tight hold in the the early going, awaited room just past the quarter pole, swung out three to four wide and kicked on
gamely to be clear under a steady hand ride. SECRET SQUARE tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, challenged Ten The Smart Way
nearing the quarter pole, raced in the two path through the drive and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best.
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. TEN THE SMART
WAY showed good early speed while being rated down racing on the backstretch, was engaged by rival midway on the far turn turn and weakened a bit in
the latter stages. GOTTA BE LUCKY stalked the early going from the outside, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit late.
DADDY'S GIRL pulled around the clubhouse turn, raced towards the inside and had no response.

RIJEKA (IRE) was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole, surged late and got up in his final stride under all out
pressure. MARGOT'S BOY set all the pace while racing along the inside, dug in inside the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. WARD 'N JERRY
was unhurried in the early going, made a advance towards the leaders around the far turn while racing three deep, moved up four to five through the stretch
run and finished willingly to the wire. BIG BUZZ was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole, raced in traffic nearing the
sixteenth pole, angled a bit to race three wide and had not enough. PARSIMONY tracked the early leader while racing two deep and weakened in the latter
stages. SEVEN CHARMS dropped back in the early stages, moved up three to four wide through the lane and had not enough. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO was
slow early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE raced up close early, raced three deep and faded.

Footnotes
HONOR AMONG MEN was sent along to a clear lead from the outside, shortened stride late and prevailed under all out pressure. GORDY'S BOY was
allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up three wide through the stretch run, had the rider lose his left rein briefly at the sixteenth pole, raced between
rivals, surged and missed in a game effort. TIZ VICIOUS raced up close early on, was four deep at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
PERFECTO AMOR stumbled at the break, stalked the early pace, raced four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. REVISIONIST
was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. ALARMING MOMENT settled to the middle of the pack, raced four
wide into the lane and had no late rally. HOT PURSUIT ducked in early, stalked the pace from the inside and weakened. LOVE OF THE SPORT dropped
back in the early stages, raced four wide through the lane and had no response. EIGHT MAKAR lost path when rival crossed over early, raced five to six
wide on the turn and never was a factor. CALL NINE ONE ONE was off slowly, steadied off heels soon after, raced four wide through the lane and never
menaced. PHILIPIE FAST raced far back and never threatened.
