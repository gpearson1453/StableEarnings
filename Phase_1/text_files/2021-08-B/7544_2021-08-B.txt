Footnotes
FEARLESS KITTEN tracked the pace outside foes in early stages, hustled along four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady urging and ran
down LADY TIZMO in the final sixteenth. LADY TIZMO was forwardly placed in opening stages, cleared on top midway around the turn, continued with clear
command at the furlong marker then got overtaken late. BOBBINI raced in range around the turn, swung five wide into the lane then sustained a steady bid
and gathered a share. UNTUTTABLE SPEED chased in contention around the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane then flattened in the final furlong.
TAPIZAR GIRL angled in after the start, chased along the inside into stretch run then lacked no late response. JASIRA raced in back, went six wide into the
lane and failed to make an impact. SISTER HOLLIE sped to the lead at the start, got collared late on the turn then faded in the lane.

GRAND SKYLARK rated off early speed, picked up the pace late on the turn, given cue four wide near the furlong marker, responded gamely and drove by
late. SHIKAKA raced up close along the inside around the turn, tipped out a path wider at the head of the lane, dug in and briefly gained the lead from
LOVIELEE then got outkicked by the winner. LOVIELEE sped to the lead at the start and set the pace around the turn, fought back when challenged by
SHIKAKA in the final furlong then got collared for the lead and gave way. SWEET SONG was not too far back in early stages, was put to a drive two wide
near the furlong marker and chased on evenly. ALLURING RUMBA raced up close two wide around the turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. NINA'S PATIENCE chased in range along the inside into the lane then lacked late response. MOTHERWELL raced off the
pace then three to four wide into the lane and never threatened.

LUNA BELLE tracked the pacesetter around the turn, launched a three wide bid for command at the top of the lane, took over the lead near mid-stretch and
finished going away. WINTER LOVE broke on top and set the pace, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch, stayed on with response and lasted for
place. BEVERLY'S CHARGE rated through early stages, hustled up four to five wide at the head of the lane, finished with response and gained show.
DAWNLAND raced in range around the turn, saved ground into the lane, sustained a bid in the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. HORIZON
MOON raced off the early pace, was under a drive two wide at the eighth pole and failed to kick on. RED HOT MAMA chased three wide in range around
the turn then weakened in the stretch. DIDYOULOOKATHER was never involved. MIZZEN MASTERY showed brief response then retreated.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BEE vied inside of STRIKE ME DOWN for the lead through the backstretch, battled on through the lane, dug in determinedly in final strides and
won the head bob. STRIKE ME DOWN dueled outside of ENGLISH BEE through the backstretch, battled on into the lane, fought back gamely and lost the
head bob. HAWKISH tracked the pace inside through early stages, slipped through the rail near the eighth pole, raced in striking distance then yielded late.
ANGELUS WARRIOR settled through early stages, picked up the pace late on the far turn, raced four wide in range in the final furlong then lacked closing
kick. STREET COPPER stalked the embattled pair through the backstretch, hustled along two wide into the lane, raced in contention then flattened out.
SINGAPORE FLASH tracked the pace, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, raced in range mid-stretch then failed to move on. CHEYENNE'S
COLONEL was unhurried through the backstretch, hustled along five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FRACTIONS ADDED AFTER REVIEW.

on top at the eighth pole then got edged out by the winner. MORENA DANCER broke out at the start then angled inside, lacked early speed then swung
wide into the lane and finished with good response. MY PHAROAH LADY raced near mid-range, hustled along five to six wide into the lane, came in a
couple paths and raced in range but needed more for late impact. BELLA BETTINA raced up close three wide around the turn, stayed on four wide in the
upper stretch then evened out in late stages. OUR SWEET PEA chased along the rail around the turn, cut the corner into stretch run then flattened in the
final furlong. SUPERSTASIA raced three wide in pursuit around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to move on. CASANOVA
