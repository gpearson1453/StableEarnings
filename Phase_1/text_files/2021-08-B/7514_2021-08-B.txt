FRENCHMEN STREET prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead late.
LONG BLADE broke inwardly and pushed GRAN SAMAN into FUZZY IRISH RASCAL, was up close between foes, steadied near the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled three wide soon after, bid three wide nearing the eighth pole, got to within a half-length of the winner near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked
late. EARTH set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and yielded inside of the top two. REAGAN'S HEART was off slow, raced two wide around
the turn, angled further out in upper stretch and improved position. PAGLIACCI chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. KOBE FIFTY TWO broke a bit
awkwardly, raced three wide and never threatened. GRAN SAMAN was bumped at the start, steadied near the half-mile pole, raced four wide around the
turn, angled in in the stretch and lacked a rally. FUZZY IRISH RASCAL was bumped at the start, saved ground and steadily faded.

Footnotes
ILKNUR saved ground behind the early leaders, moved out three wide for clear running past the five-sixteenths, rallied to the front from outside in midstretch
and edged clear. COMMISSIO raced three to four wide around the turn, and rallied outside to be along for the place. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED vied for
command outside SENA THE DUCHESS to upper stretch, and weakened. PROTON YOLY leaned in bumping MARIAHS CHRISTMAS early, got pulled off
and taken outside, and did enough on the far outside late to snag the last major share. SENA THE DUCHESS popped clear out of the gate, was soon
hooked from outside by ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED, vied with that rival to the stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. ALLSYSTEMSAREAGO
was finished early two wide. MARIAHS CHRISTMAS got bumped and put in tight along the rail by PROTON YOLY early, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
ALADO pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch then drove clear. TAP GOLD stalked the pace two wide,
tipped three wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. JUMP BACK JACK set the pace under pressure from the winner, fought on to
midstretch then weakened. TIME TO WISH broke out and bumped PEPPI at the start, chased the pace three wide and went evenly through the lane. PEPPI
was pinched back at the start, saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. KING FORCE bumped with PEPPI at the start, trailed in the two path,
angled widest in upper stretch and had no bid.

Footnotes
LET'S BE HONEST tracked outside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL to the turn, took over past the five-sixteenths, and steadily drew away under a drive. PAPA'S
LITTLE GIRL set the early pace inside, was powerless to resist the winner late on the turn, and ran on much best of the others. RASPBERRY BALLET
banged into the gate in the hands of the assistant starter at the break, lagged far back early, began finding stride four wide approaching the stretch, and
rallied to go clear of the remainder. SASSY MISS MARGIE posed no threat two wide. WONDER BLONDY tired inside. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR dwelt at the
start spotting the field a handful of lengths, advanced up the backstretch, but had nothing left after six furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE START FOCUSING ON BOTH TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR AND RASPBERRY BALLET, TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR WAS DEEMED TO HAVE CAUSED HER
OWN TROUBLE, WHILE RASPBERRY BALLET WAS DEEMED A NON-STARTER FOR PARI-MUTUEL PURPOSES AND RAN FOR PURSE MONEY
ONLY. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CANDYMEISTER disputed the pace outside down the backstretch, cleared off and angled in nearing the turn, set the pace along the rail and widened under
a drive. SUPER FINE raced four wide in midpack and rallied outside to gain the place in deep stretch. DESIGNED TO DAZZLE stalked the pace three wide,
could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished for the place. ARETE'S CHALICE prompted the pace two wide and was
one-paced through the lane. BRODY'S CAUSEWAY was bumped hard between foes just after the start, raced off the pace two wide, swung widest in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly. NUMERIC chased the pace two wide, was briefly in tight turning for home and lacked a rally. KUMANDRA chased the pace
inside, swung out turning for home and came up empty. STORM DREAM veered in at the start, bumping BRODY'S CAUSEWAY into VERONICUS and
played no further factor while racing two wide. ALEIDA played no factor while racing two wide. MUDSHAFT broke slowly and was outrun inside.
VERONICUS was soundly bumped at the start then raced far back inside. SAY NO MORE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THE SKIPPER TOO stumbled and broke out slamming into ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE at the start, tracked the battling threesome up front, challenged four
wide past the five-sixteenths marker, outdueled HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY leaving the furlong grounds and edged away. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY
vied for command inside T VILLE and PALIMONIUM early, could not match strides with THE SKIPPER TOO past the eighth-pole and ran on clearly second
best. THE TWINS SNEAKERS saved ground in the second flight to the turn, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, and was up for the show late. T
VILLE vied between horses up the backstretch, and gave way approaching the stretch. PALIMONIUM argued the pace outside rivals early, and faded
through the drive. HAD RIGHT broke slowest, and raced far back inside. ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE got slammed into by THE SKIPPER TOO at the break
and stumbled sharply bumping into EL ROSILLO, and was finished before completing a half-mile. EL ROSILLO got bumped by ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE at
the start, and was outrun four wide.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH set the pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the quarter pole, held clear to deep stretch, switched back to the left lead late and held safe.
SEIZE THE HAY raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole and finished well outside. NEW YEAR saved ground off the
pace, swung out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and rallied for the show. ETHOS stalked the winner two wide in the clear and
weakened in the lane. SURPRISE FACTOR chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. FARM STRONG was bumped at the start,
raced three and four wide and never threatened. KURT'S A KEEPER chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. BIG CITY RED played no
factor while racing three and four wide. MISTA DONZELLA was in range three wide and was through after a half. KICK IN THE GAS broke inwardly and
bumped FARM STRONG at the start, had some speed four wide and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
THE ICE BEAST saved ground into the turn, moved out three wide with aim at the battling leaders approaching the stretch, reached the front from outside
with a sixteenth to go and pulled away. LOST A LEGEND tracked outside DARK TIMBER up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge midway on the turn,
dueled into the stretch and brushed with that rival past the eighth-pole, and prevailed for the place. DARK TIMBER dashed clear inside with an alert
beginning, got hooked by LOST A LEGEND near the three-eighths, battled on the rail into the stretch, brushed with LOST A LEGEND leaving the furlong
grounds and weakened. FLIPPING FISH raced two to three wide around the turn, and lacked the needed closing bid. MIAMI CHROME was a step slow at
the start, and trailed three to four wide.

Footnotes
COLONEL JACKSON set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of WARP SPEED BABY down the backstretch and around the far turn, took that turn in the
two path, drew clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. BLACK LIMO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, rallied between foes
and was just up for the place. WARP SPEED BABY pressed the winner two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, could not match
strides with that foe in upper stretch, battled on between rivals and just missed second. SETTE STELLE raced three wide in midpack, was clipped behind
entering the far turn, continued three wide around that turn, tipped further out in upper stretch, rallied outside but was outkicked. HALFWAY RIGHT checked
soon after the start, raced well back two and three wide and improved position in the lane. JUSTICE WARRIOR bumped BLACK LIMO at the start, raced in
range three and four wide and faded around the far turn. STAR DEPUTY chased the pace two wide, clipped heels entering the far turn and had no further
bids. AUTHENTIC HEART was in range inside, checked nearing the quarter pole and dropped back inside. POLIN D'ORO was outrun inside. MARTIN
FIERRO made little impact inside.
