NED CHRISTIE vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid to draw clear on the turn, then was given a couple right handed pops with the riding crop
approaching the furlong marker and she responded well and drew off to prove much the best while being ridden out. MI ENLACE vied for the early lead on
the inside, then chased the winner on the turn, moved off the rail leaving the quarter pole and came into the stretch three wide, kept on to be clearly second
best while no match for the winner. MUSICAL THEATRE stalked the pace four wide, then moved three wide on the turn and came into the drive five wide
but was empty, bested rest. TEA AFTER BALLET chased the early pace from between rivals and was two wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
ROCKET RIDE chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
HIGH SPIRITS was well rated along the inside to the half mile marker, then eased off the rail on the turn, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, went on
even terms by the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear and held off the late challenge from PISTOL BOX late to prove best under left handed urging.
PISTOL BOX was allowed to settle while three wide, then swung out four wide for the drive and closed well but needed more late. FINNEGAN (IRE) set an
unchallenged pace on the inside and dawdling along, then was headed on the turn, shook the challenge off then was headed again by the furlong marker by
the winner and gave way grudgingly. TAP THE MOJO tracked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn but weakened. CHANGE
DIRECTION was five wide into the first turn, then chased the early pace and went up four wide to stalk the pace four wide on the backstretch, then dropped
back on the turn and moved over to be three wide and tired.

and was four wide by the quarter pole while making a bid, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. HOOSIER GOLD CASE vied for the
early lead on the inside, then moved off the rail and made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead leaving the quarter pole, then dueled with the
winner to the furlong marker but could not go with that rival late, second best. CATNIP KITTEN was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn,
then moved off the rail to go by the tiring front runner, then angled in by the sixteenths pole to be up for the show. DON'T HOLD QUEENS was reserved
early, advanced four wide on the turn while four wide, then had a belated rally to just miss the show award. HER GOLD MINE was rated along early and
advanced on the inside on the turn, moved off the rail and was three wide by the quarter pole while making a bid but flattened out. BE AUTHENTIC was
allowed to settle while three to four wide and was empty in the drive. TEMRIK vied for the lead three wide, then went on to set the pace and move over to

Footnotes
ADMIRAL RETURNS tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, wore down rival late to prove best under a drive. DYNABLUE was three
wide into the first turn stalking the pace, then prompted the pace and made a two wide bid to take over on the turn, stayed on gamely but was caught late
while being clearly second best. BOURRE' TRICK was reserved early on the inside, then angled out in the stretch and rallied well late. BETTER THINK
TWICE was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out five wide for racing room and offered a late rally. RAVE ON was well placed on the inside to the
quarter pole, tipped two wide and made a bid leaving the turn but flattened out. ROCKET HOTSHOT was settled back early, advanced five wide on the turn
and came wide into the drive and had a belated rally. K RULES was reserved early, came four wide into the stretch but offered no rally. CAPTAIN
FANTASTIC was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and was sent down on the turn and weakened. DUCKDEVIL was between horses
on the first turn, then tired. LEND IT TEWMEY set the pace on the inside and gave way.
