Footnotes
KILLEEN was hustled early to stay close, put to a drive two wide on the bend, was carried out by LEE'S LUCK entering the lane, fought through the stretch
and edged ahead near the wire. FAIRWAY LANE well back early, picked up his pace two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning out to path five for the drive,
wall out all the last furlong, just missed but caught LEE'S LUCK for second. LEE'S LUCK took a clear lead and the inside nearing the end of the first eighth,
was challenged leaving the bend, drifted out to path three entering the stretch, battled gamely but did not have enough left in the waning yards. TRUE TEN
made a leap from the gate, gradually progressed from inside, had a striking position along the rail with a furlong to go but could only make up minor ground
deep stretch. COLOMBARD also well back early, angled out through the turn, lost considerable ground swinging out to the middle of the track entering the
lane and showed a willingness to run late.

Footnotes
MY WIFE IS BOSS prominent between rivals, took the advantage three wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch, steadily drifted out despite
right-handed pressure and held on. LIL BIT TIPSEY contested the pace from inside, did not stay with MY WIFE IS BOSS upper stretch, was all out the last
eighth but lacked the extra needed. MISS LEARJET vied for the lead two wide, fought outside LIL BIT TIPSEY through the stretch but also needed more in
the late going. LADY WARRIOR disputed the pace from outside from the beginning, did not keep up four wide leaving the bend but closed the gap belatedly
deep stretch. FOXIE'S BEAUTY never far back, lost the most ground taking the turn five wide and found best stride too late. LADY EXPRESS chased from
inside, angled out for a clear path upper stretch but had no late bid.

A MERRY HEART bumped leaving the chute, gradually angled in on the backstretch, waited for room on the bend, got through two wide leaving the quarter
pole, was carried out some entering the lane, bumped with BABA'S BOY upper stretch, moved ahead under urging then drew off the final furlong.
LONESOME DREAM advanced four wide on the turn, lost further ground floating out to path six into the stretch, steadily improved position, took over
second with a sixteenth left but could not close the gap on A MERRY HEART. BABA'S BOY shared the early lead from inside, moved clear when allowed
on the bend, drifted out some entering the lane, bumped with A MERRY HEART and gradually yielded. MON AMI FUZZIE soon trailed, was two wide on the
turn, swung to the outside for the stretch run and improved position without threatening. MAC PANDOWDY bumped with A MERRY HEART leaving the
chute, raced in contention early, was three then four wide taking the bend and flattened out for the drive. LASTFORTINOFAMILY failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. MAGNA LEE fractious in the post parade, displayed early speed just outside BABA'S BOY, began to yield on the turn, moved to the
inside entering the stretch and continued to give way.

KALISPELL stalked the early speed from outside, gradually angled in as she went for the lead on the bend, came three wide into the stretch, was put to a
mild drive the last furlong and was clearly best. ALMAFUERTE forwardly placed toward the outside, was four wide on the turn, angled to the inside leaving
the bend, took over second inside the final eighth then could only just hold her position. HOLD THE SPENDING settled at the back, picked up her pace from
outside on the bend, lost ground staying five wide entering the stretch, steadily advanced, came up short for second but was clearly best of the others.
MORA VALLEY was sent to contest the pace from inside, floated out some into the stretch and flattened out. VEGAN GOES BEST vied for the early lead
between rivals but began to fade midway on the turn. ARCTIC MUSIC displayed early speed from inside but just off the inside on the bend.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S HONOR soon sprinted clear of the rest, was relaxed after a half mile, roused with two furlongs to go then steadily opened up under a drive in the
lane. GO FOR SHERRIE broke on top but was soon chasing MEGAN'S HONOR, raced closest to that one from just off the inside throughout and could only
hold his position deep stretch. SHELL FIRE advanced from outside to have a striking position three wide on the second bend, floated out some entering the
stretch and only moved clear for third late. RIVER CACTUS saved ground, loved a mild bid into the lane, fought for third briefly then leveled off. TRY TRY
AGAIN chased from inside, came off the rail some on the second bend and flattened out between rivals for the stretch run. ANDREW THE GIANT saved
ground and was never a factor. ANTRIM'S GIANT gradually retreated, was widest taking the second turn and empty for the drive.

Footnotes
JUSTENUFFTUFF rated the first quarter mile, gradually progressed from outside to share the lead midway on the backstretch, moved clear when let out on
the second bend, took the rail, was roused leaving that turn, under a drive through the lane and proved much the best. JOEY B settled between rivals,
picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed from inside on the second bend, moved clear for second upper stretch, was no match for JUSTENUFFTUFF
but clearly best of the rest. AMERICAN SUCCESS settled just off the inside, saved ground taking the second turn, was under a steady drive in the lane and
gained third with a sixteenth to go. TOCCETIVE JAC in tight along the rail on the backstretch, angled out on the second bend and improved position late
from between rivals without threatening. DAVKA was encouraged to a clear early lead, showed the way off the inside, took the rail into the second turn,
angled outside JUSTENUFFTUFF after that one took the lead, floated out widest entering the stretch and continued to fade. PENALTY SHOT broke alertly
but soon trailed, moved to the inside nearing the second bend and was empty for the drive.

W W CANDY rated in midpack from outside, was roused four wide on the turn, took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker, moved clear and kept ALEX'S
STRIKE at bay. ALEX'S STRIKE a step slow at the break, was settled, picked pu his pace just off the inside on the bend, rallied three wide in the lane, split
rivals with a sixteenth left and gained second with eighty yards to go. TETSU bumped with W W SCOUT'S HONOR AT THE START, chased from between
horses, was two wide on the bend, altered out for a clear path upper stretch, brushed a couple times with CHICKS FOR FREE, gradually closed the gap and
took over third in the waning yards. CHICKS FOR FREE altered in trying to keep a clear path inside W W WCOUT'S HONOR shortly after entering the main
track, bumped TAP'S BIG SHOT, was corrected, threatened three wide on the turn, was brushed several times and forced out upper stretch, steadied inside
the furlong marker as his path narrowed, altered out some, closed well and narrowly missed third. W W SCOUT'S HONOR bumped with TETSU at the
break, quickly gained the lead and steadily angled in entering the main track, was challenged on the turn, floated out some into the stretch, moved clear but
gradually wore down inside the last eighth. HIDDEN PROMISE was also a step slow at the start, chased from inside and rallied belatedly along the rail the
final furlong. TAP'S BIG SHOT was bumped and forced inward shortly after after entering the main track, soon recovered to press the early leader from just
outside, vied for the lead on the turn but flattened out the last furlong.
