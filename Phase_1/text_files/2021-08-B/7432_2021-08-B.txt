Footnotes
ATLANTIC PRINCESS stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of CONGAREE ROSE into the far turn as LONG POINT BEACH did the same, assumed
command from those rivals passing the five sixteenths pole, swiftly drew off entering the lane, and widened before being wrapped up late. WILL TAKE
ROSES tracked two wide, failed to keep pace with bidding foes around the far turn, but stayed on through the lane to bid for place inside of rivals a sixteenth
out, and prevailed. MIKEY'S JEWEL trailed early on, tracked in hand three wide into the far turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and improved outside of
rivals to vie for place late, but missed reaching that position. LONG POINT BEACH settled off of the pace three to four wide, gained to bid for the lead
outside of ATLANTIC PRINCESS into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the five sixteenths pole, flattened out through the lane, and was
nailed by rivals on both sides for minor placings. CONGAREE ROSE opened up around the first turn, but was caught by a pair of outer rivals a the three
sixteenths pole, was headed and weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and faltered on her left lead through the lane. LANA failed to factor.

Footnotes
LEME AT EM threw his head at the start and trailed the field early on, swung five wide while commencing a rally turning for home, shifted inwards entering
the lane as leading foes drifted out, awkwardly split rivals in upper stretch, churned on to bid inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole, and edged clear.
PAPA LUKE rushed along the inside after a bit of a slow start to duel for the lead, cleared off into the turn, drifted to the five path turning for home while
maintaining a clear advantage, to attempt to float outer foes wider, stayed clear into the final furlong, but was bested by an inner foe passing the sixteenth
pole. HAIL SOUTHERN was outsprinted after breaking on top, settled off of the pace four wide, got floated to the seven path entering the lane, then stayed
on mildly while hanging on his left lead to bid for place late, but missed reaching that position. TITHED chased along the inside, but was outkicked in
midstretch, and kept on thererafter. QUAD EIGHTS chased the clear leader two wide and from between horses around the turn, shifted to the six path
turning for home as the leader drifted, then came up empty in upper stretch. MISTER MISTER rushed with PAPA LUKE to vie outside of that foe early on,
but failed to keep pace at the half mile pole, and steadily gave way thereafter. BIG POLO prompted the pace three wide early, but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
SWEET WILLEMINA pressed STRIKING CHROME from the outside, inched closer to that foe's throatlatch while being floated outwards turning for home,
sparked a duel entering the lane, and relentlessly battled through the final furlong to forge an advantage at the wire. STRIKING CHROME set the pace
along the inside, drifted out turning for home while meeting SWEET WILLEMINA's bid, dueled tenaciously inside of that rival while clinging to an advantage
into the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire. BABY GUNDIN stalked along the inside while saving ground, but failed to produce a bid and only
managed to chase the leading duelers home. I'LL MAKE IT COACH was outrun. HOPE HAS A NAME lied off of the pace four to three wide, failed to keep
pace with the leading pair while under a drive around the far turn, and faded.

Footnotes
VICARAGE trailed into the far turn, produced a rail rally through the lane to bid in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage at the wire. ONE TWO KID
pressed the pace four wide while kept in the five path, vied outside of DELIGHTFULLYWICKED around the far turn while kept in the four path by that foe,
took over in upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch, met VICARAGEs inside bid passing the sixteenth pole, and got nailed on the wire. SOCIAL GROUP
prompted the pace three wide while in the four path, gave way between horses passing the three furlong pole, chased under a drive around the far turn,
shifted to the six path to be outside of the leaders while regaining stride in midstretch, and came again, but did not have enough to catch the leaders.
DELIGHTFULLYWICKED set the pace while decidedly staying multiple paths off of the inner railing, felt pressure from rivals on both sides into the
backstretch before vying inside of only ONE TWO KID around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened through the late
stages. MY CANDY BIZ tucked to the two path into the first turn to stalk the pace, but chased under urging around the far turn without progressing, then
faded through the final furlong. BROWN ESSENCE settled far off of the pace two wide, tracked in the six path around the far turn, but lacked a bid and
faded. KAMEHAMEHA vied along the inside of a pair of foes early on, but weakened into the far turn, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
UNO TIGRESS dueled inside of SUSIKIN, maintained a narrow advantage in the prolonged battle through the lane, and gamely kept her counterpart at bay.
SUSIKIN dueled for the lead outside of UNO TIGRESS around the turn, sustained the prolonged battle through the lane with a narrow margin to gain, but
was denied by her inner counterpart. MARY COSTA chased the leading duelers three wide around the turn, and mildly grinded away at their advantage
through the lane, and was best of the rest. COUGAR VISION settled far off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane and stayed on between
horses to reach a minor placing on the wire. A TOAST TO KAY tracked from midpack tow wide, but failed to threaten. AWESOME PAL tracked along the
inside, then chased evenly through the lane without bidding. CHIT CHAT GIRL lied far off of the pace three to five wide and failed to factor. STOP TALKING
tracked four wide around the turn, but faded through the lane. BEE'SNBEE'S hopped at the start and hit the gate, then never got involved. SILVER EXCESS
saved ground from midpack, but faded. TWOFOUR SIX OH ONE was outrun and showed little.

CHICK'S SHADOW set a soft pace along the inside, dug in to resist B B'S BUSTED's bid at the quarter pole, stubbornly held a narrow advantage through
the lane from her outer battling counterpart, and won the head bob on the wire. B B'S BUSTED trailed early, pulled outside of her competition around the
first turn, but settled down into the backstretch, came under a drive into the far turn to produce a bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of a tenacious
CHICK'S SHADOW through the lane, but lost the photo finish via head bob. WAR CANOE pressed the pace setter from the outside, but faded at the quarter

DR. ANN set the pace while decidedly staying well off of the inner railing, encountered light pressure from an outer rival around the first turn, drew away
from that foe in upper stretch, and safely held sway from her to the wire. MORTAL STORM pressed the leader from the outside around the first turn, stalked
three wide into the far turn, but only managed to chase that foe through the lane, and proved second best. FAIRY WISH settled off of the pace two wide,
produced a mild bid between horses into the far turn, but faltered around that bend. ANGEL RAPHAEL tracked along the inside, but weakened around the
far turn. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE SIX FURLONG FRACTION WAS OMITTED.

Footnotes
LE WEEKEND vied for the lead outside of TAKE CHARGE ERICA while in the three path around the the turn, took over from that foe in upper stretch, drew
clear passing the furlong grounds, and held from an rallying outer foe late. TARA'S TALENT chased the pace from the four path, was brushed by an inner
foe while being forced five wide in upper stretch, quickened passing the furlong pole to produce a late bid, but missed on the wire. BACI stalked two wide
and between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch, brushed TARA'S TALENT in the process, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and only managed to
chase the leaders home. TAKE CHARGE ERICA set the pace inside of a vying LE WEEKEND while staying a path off of the inner railing, but was headed
by that foe in upper stretch, and yielded through the final furlong. CAUGHT UP IN YOU stalked along the inside, but came under a drive while failing to keep
pace turning for home, and lacked a rally. WE MISS SUSIE trailed the field in the five path around the turn, and failed to factor. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ALDO'S KITTEN set the pace along the inside, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway. INGREIDO bobbled a bit at the start, lied off of the pace three wide
and between horses. GREEN GROWTH pressed the pace two wide, chased around the far turn, then failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch,
but ran on to save showw. EPIGRAMMATIST stalked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, but only managed to chase the leader through the
lane. THE EXCEPTION tracked along the inside, but failed to factor. TRUE GRACE tossed her rider in the gate, then bobbled at the start, lied off of the
pace while caught four wide, then weakened around the far turn. UPPER CROWN was outrun.
