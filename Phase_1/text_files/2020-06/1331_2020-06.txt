Footnotes
INDIAS LUTE away quickly from the inside, hustled along to the set the pace up the backstretch, drifted out into and upper stretch, led clear through the
final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth but was able to hold on. SHE'LL TAKE CHARGE stalked off the inside, three wide into the turn, came four wide
into the stretch, angled inside the leader, closed fast but just missed. MONCHICHI chased a bit off the rail then angled in entering the turn, continued near
the inside to the stretch and held the show. DERBY LADY angled in from off the pace, traveled a bit off the fence then angled out approaching the eighth
pole, then finished evenly in the late stages. SHARE THE VISION lacked early speed, angled in and saved ground around around the turn and into the lane
and passed tired foes. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE traveled near the back of the field, four wide into the turn then angled out a path and went around a rival into
the lane and failed to rally. TUFFET forced out early by a rival, went three wide through the turn and came up empty. ENERGY CAT tracked outside a rival
then off the rail, dropped back around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. Due to a timer malfunction the first race was hand-timed.
