Footnotes
SKY PILOT saved ground rallying to upper stretch dueling from the rail getting up gamely. VALUE VOUCHER went evenly through the turn rallying to bid
three deep in upper stretch surging gamely late just missing. PERPETRATOR broke sharply pressing the pace dueling between horses late just missing.
MINI COSMO chased the pace extending four wide down the lane lacking a final surge. BOBBY V. hustled along pursued to upper stretch extending from
mid track hanging late. LITTLE BENNY slow early played no factor. ZA WOODMAN was never involved. ZEN PAPA pressed on the inside through the turn
fading in upper stretch. SIEGFREEDROESCH appearing fractious leapt in the air at the break.
