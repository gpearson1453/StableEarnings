launched an all out charge, was gaining steadily, but missed. THE YOUNG LORD stalked the pace, closed into the turn, was hustled three and four-wide on
the turn, was game in the stretch but unable to show a late gain. OVERBEARING forced the issue, chased two and three-wide on the turn, finished evenly
but lost positions late. BAY OF RUM settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, finished gamely but failed to menace. SOUPER FLY
OVER settled in mid pack, angled three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished determinedly to no avail. WHO'S GOT IT broke
inward and settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide through the turn, narrowed the gap in the stretch but was not a threat. MARTEN LAKE raced in mid
pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, fell back a bit while being hustled along but did not menace. FOREST BROTHER settled in mid pack, rode
the rail on the turn but lacked a rally. HEYDON'S CASE, away slowly, raced from off the pace, saved ground on the turn then lacked a rally.

SOLIDIFY away slowly and off the early pace, closed to mid pack still on the backstretch, was hustled rail to three-wide on the turn, rallied, gained command
a 16th out and finished under a hand ride. MAGIC TAPIT set a pressured pace, was engaged mid way through the backstretch, dueled, edged clear at the
top of the stretch, was passed a 16th out but held place. ROSE'S VISION, close early, stalked the pace, chased late turn then finished gamely to no avail.
COMBATIVE pressed the pace,challenged the leader mid backstretch, dueled to the top of the stretch and gave way, although grudgingly. SPLIT MY
PANTS got away slowly and settled off the pace, chased along the rail on the turn but never reached contention.

LION OF THE SEA was up close early, led into the turn, dueled from the top of the stretch and prevailed under a drive. READY TO REPEAT forced the
pace into the turn, challenged at the top of the stretch then gave way grudgingly in the late stages. FOREST SURVIVOR stalked the pacesetter, chased
four-wide late turn, launched a determined drive but hung late. PERFECT CRIME raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished gamely
along the rail. MAGIC SPIN settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. NEXT showed brief speed and dropped
back at the turn, was hustled into the stretch and finished with some interest. SASKATCHEWAN, bumped at the start, showed speed into the turn, was
headed and forced the issue but tired upper stretch. JACK broke outward, bumped SASKATCHEWAN and was squeezed back causing him to wind up off
the pace, saved ground on the turn and never in contention. MALIBU MANDATE raced in mid pack, saved ground but lacked a rally. GA GA GIZMO was
pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, closed into the turn, raced two and three-wide then lacked a response in the stretch.

Footnotes
JUXTAPOSE showed speed and dueled for the early lead, had the clear advantage on the turn while saving ground, opened up her lead in early stretch and
held off the rallying foe comfortably. PIQUET bumped with GIZMO FLASH at the start, dropped back to trail the field, began to rally midway around the turn,
angled four-wide at the 1/4 pole and finished well down the stretch. GOLDEN GARTER raced in midpack, was two-wide between foes on the turn then
chased in vain down the stretch. CINDERVELLA dueled for the early lead, pressed while racing two-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. TIZ
MY RIGHT stalked the pace while racing on the inside, saved ground on the turn and offered no rally. DISCREET BEAR stalked the pace while racing on
the outside, was three-wide on the turn then emptied out in the stretch. GIZMO FLASH bumped with PIQUET at the start, was widest down the backstretch,
raced three-wide on the turn, trailed into the stretch and offered no rally. FINDING PERFECTION reared at the start and dropped the rider. AFTER A
STEWARD'S INQUIRY IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FINDING PERFECTION DID NOT RECEIVE A FAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A
NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
GRAY'S FABLE had early speed, set the pace and held sway under a light drive. NASHTRICK, close early, stalked the pace on the turn, chased into the
stretch where his lost whip but finished gamely. ROYAL LASER, bumped at the outset, settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then
tendered a mild rally outside. VIEWFINDER raced in mid pack along the rail and closed willingly through the stretch. TIMESKIP stalked the pace, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. LION'S GOLDENHEART bumped with ROYAL LASER at the start, settled off the
pace, closed along the rail late turn but failed to menace. CRAWL FROM THE BAR moved up to force the issue on the turn, raced two and three-wide,
chased into the stretch but flattened out. INSIDER TRADING settled off the pace, faded four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

LUCKY CURLIN at the rear early, closed two-wide on the turn, rallied between foes and was up late, driving. CLAYTON was up close early and well in
hand, saved ground in mid pack on the turn then rallied late between foes. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide late turn
and finished under a determined stretch drive. TECUMSEH'S WAR broke alertly, dueled into the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. MALIBU MAMBO stalked the pace, chased into the stretch and was all out to the wire. MUCHMORETHANTHIS dueled, shook clear upper
stretch but gave way in the late stages. CHAMPIT raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide late turn and had no response in the stretch. GREEN
GROWTH dueled, dropped back at the turn, was hustled along the rail, dropped back again near the stretch and lacked a rally. NORTHERN THUNDER
was steadied at the start, settled off the pace, chased five then four-wide on the turn but tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
SPEEDY BOLT pressed the pace three and four-wide, chased into the stretch, had command in the final furlong under a drive and was taken in hand near
the wire. KEEN ARTIE raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn then rallied willingly outside. TORPEDO MAX settled in mid pack, raced
along the two-path and the rail through the turn then closed gamely between foes. THE REIGN MAN forced the pace in hand, chased hard two-wide late
turn but evened out in deep stretch. VICTOR'S DYNASTY, rated early, closed fast four-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. BALA FALLS
staked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch then evened out in deep stretch. EXECUTIVE RETREAT set a
pressured pace, moved clear through the turn, was collared a furlong out and gave way. AGNELLI settled off the pace, angled two to four-wide late turn but
never reached contention. SEGUIMI stalked early, was in hand on the turn, dropped back and lacked a rally. BET ALPHA steadied at the start, stalked the
pace, dropped back three and four-wide to mid pack on the turn and tired.
