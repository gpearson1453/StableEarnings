LOVE HAPPY stalked the pace three wide, bid in upper stretch, took command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. JUNA pressed the
pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, briefly cleared near the three-sixteenths pole, dug in inside of the winner in upper stretch and yielded
late. ELLIE BEAR lacked early speed while saving ground, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole and rallied outside. PAINT IT GREEN saved
ground and never threatened. AUDREY LUCILLE broke slowly, raced three wide and failed to menace. ESTATE OF SONDE set the early pace along the
rail and gave way readily leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL CHILD vied two wide around the first turn, dueled inside around most of the far turn then drew off under a drive. KATALIMA tracked the pace
two and three wide, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter pole but stayed on well enough to gain the place in deep stretch. MAKIN US
LOOK GOOD stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner near the three-eighths pole, two wide from there past the three-sixteenths pole then
weakened in the lane. HOW IS SHE saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. SING FROSTY failed to
menace while racing two wide. CELIA'S PRIDE vied inside of the winner around the first turn and retreated. SILVER AND BLUES checked at the start and
was never involved. COPELANQUIKZIP had only brief speed inside.

three-sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch and lasted for the place. QUICK ENERGY chased the pace three wide and rallied mildly widest in the lane.
BERRY STRONG saved ground well back and rallied belatedly inside of foes. RUNNING PRAYERS raced off the pace two wide, made some progress
between foes in the lane then steadied off heels in deep stretch. IRMA GIRL stalked the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. GOIN
GANGSTA played no factor while racing two wide. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE was outrun inside. CLERESTORY was unprepared for the start, raced three wide
and made little impact.

SINGINDOWNTHELANE set the pace along the rail, drew off and held well clear under a drive. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG lagged well back two wide,
advanced outside down the backstretch, moved four wide between foes around the far turn and continued on willingly to gain the place. CALCUTTA lacked
early speed inside, circled five wide around the far turn and was outkicked for the place. DI COLAS COWGIRL was devoid of speed while saving ground,
went four wide around the far turn and improved her position. ADIOS HILLARY saved ground in midpack, angled out nearing the lane and never threatened.
LIL SWEETHEART played no factor while racing two wide. CANARSIE PRINCESS chased the pace three wide and retreated after a half. ALPHARDINI
chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. VINTAGE GIN was hustled from the gate, pressed the winner two wide around the first turn and
retreated inside around the far turn.

and lacked a rally. DYNACASTLE saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and finished evenly. UAINTSEENMECRAZYET lacked
speed while racing two wide, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. DEAR JOHN LETTER was outrun inside. BETTY BOM BOTZ had

SILK STOCKING settled off the early pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, seized command two wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and quickly drew clear under a drive. FONDA ROMANA dueled along the rail, was no match for the winner from the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in
upper stretch and held well to be clearly second best. BANANA ANNA lacked early speed, saved ground around all three turn and was along for the show.
VONDA chased the pace two wide, dropped back down the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals in the lane. FLOATING BY settled off the early duel
three wide, bid midway down the backstretch then tired around the far turn. FACEY'S SISTER raced off the pace two wide, made a middle move outside
down the backstretch but faded two wide around the far turn. CHARITABLE TIME dueled two wide and stopped.

MALIBU SUNSET set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and held clear under a drive. SHACKLED chased the pace three wide and finished
willingly to be clearly second best. CASTLE FIVE stumbled at the start, lagged well back inside, made some progress two wide around the turn, shifted out
in upper stretch and rallied. GABBI'S AMOR saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild rally between. RUTH LESS BLUE chased
the pace two wide and lacked a rally. BELMONTE pressed the winner two wide and weakened. GOOD GENES lacked early speed, saved ground, made
progress in upper stretch then dropped back in tight through the final sixteenth. HARGUS hit the starting gate, raced three wide and played no factor.
SMOKY BLUES had early speed outside, steadied near the quarter pole and dropped back four wide.

two wide, made a strong move between rivals down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn but was turned back by the winner. SET'EM UP JOE
lacked early speed while saving ground, went three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. OWL RUN dueled outside of the winner for a half
and weakened. GLEN'S CASTLE chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane. WHO'S MY BOSS broke outwardly, saved ground in range
and lacked a closing bid. EMBLEM'S ESTATE played no factor while racing four wide. BLIMEY LIMEY was shut off at the start and trailed inside.
