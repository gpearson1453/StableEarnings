Footnotes
KEEP ATTACKING stalked the early speed, got through three wide between rivals into the lane, took over and was driven clear the final furlong. MEGAN'S
HONOR bumped STOSH at the break, chased from inside, swung widest on the turn then rallied belatedly from the middle of the track through the stretch.
LINE OF DENHAMS was kept close just off the inside, swung four wide for the stretch run, split rivals, fought for second the final sixteenth but did not have
enough left through the waning yards. AHEADOFTHEGAME was away slowly, progressed from outside on the turn then lodged a mild bid between foes in
the stretch. HUEY ATTACK vied for the early lead between rivals, was two wide leaving the bend and flattened out the final eighth. STOSH was squeezed
back at the break then passed inside tired ones through the stretch. BABA LOU displayed early speed, gained the rail leaving the turn then also tired the last
eighth and floated out deep stretch. CREAL WONDER disputed the pace from inside but began to tire on the bend. FLAT OUT MIRACLE vied for the lead
from outside on the backstretch but began to tire four wide leaving the turn. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS showed little.

Footnotes
GO BEEJA soon emerged with the lead, showed the way just off the inside while in hand, was let out in the lane, drew clear and under a drive the final
furlong. GONZO settled early, swung to the outside on the turn, lost ground, fanning six wide for the drive, closed well and got up for the place. YABA DABA
DOO chased from inside, angled out three wide on the bend, steadily progressed in the stretch but was too late. AFFIRMATIF SONG pressed from just
outside GO BEEJA but began to weaken in the lane. GO VO forwardly placed outside, lost ground four then five wide through the bend and had no stretch
rally. LT DAN ATTACK in contention early, was three wide through the turn and had no late bid. JIVE DADDY was a factor just off the rail on the backstretch
but faded on the bend. WILDWOODSUMMERTIME hesitated at the break then failed to menace staying well off the inside throughout. PAR showed little.
KIM MAN pressed from between horses but quit from along the rail the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
MALIGATOR advanced from outside to reach contention on the second turn, took over in the lane then steadily drew off under a drive. JOLLY GHAALY
rated just off the early speed, took over two wide when allowed on the second bend, was no match for MALIGATOR when set down for the drive, began to
wear down but lasted for second. WORKINGFORALIVING chased from inside, commenced his bid on the second turn, swung out three wide leaving that
bend and could only stay clear for third through the lane. CUT TO ORDER advanced from inside on the backstretch, also fanned out leaving the second
turn, progressed four wide to midstretch then leveled off. LEFT COAST DREAMS only passed outside tired ones the last two and a half furlongs. DAVKA
took the lead on the first turn but began to tire after five furlongs. AMERICAN SUCCESS faded from inside with a half mile to go. MR. TICKER TALKER
raced in contention three wide for six furlongs then gave way between foes. JACK N JOHN showed little.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, moved clear again upper stretch, was all out and held on. R U FORREAL
in contention from outside from the beginning, lost ground four then five wide through the bend, rallied in the lane but was too late. SHEZAHOTMAMA
forwardly placed between horses, came four wide into the stretch, also found best stride too late but got up to share third with GHAALEB'S APPEAL. The
latter pressed outside JETS A GINNIN then lacked the extra needed between rivals deep stretch. COUNTRY ASSETS in contention early, was boxed in on
the turn and deep stretch. LIL BIT TIPSEY failed to menace in a wide trip. DARLIN ROSIE showed little.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT soon emerged with the lead, drew away when allowed leaving the turn and proved much the best under hand urging. FOX FREY was away
slowly, progressed two then three wide on the bend and drew clear for second late. LADY DI was steadied in close quarters between rivals nearing the
bend, advanced two shortly thereafter, drifted out entering the stretch and wore down the last furlong. LAURA ATTACK broke inward, bumping hard with
TEMRIK, pressed from outside, was four wide on the turn, forced wider into the lane and wore down the last furlong. TEMRIK was bumped hard then
checked at the break, advanced to be an early factor outside, five wide taking the bend then tired for the drive. MUFFINS REVENGE dwelt then bore in at
the start and was not a factor. EQUALLY EVEN saved ground through the turn and had no late bid. SIMPLY FAST chased from inside, angled out widest for
the drive and had little to offer. JAM UP was steadied when her path along the rail narrowed midway on the backstretch and gave way the final furlong.
GOTTA B THE SALSA prominent between rivals, backed off from tight quarters three wide leaving the tun and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ARCHIEMYBOY prominent in the second flight between horses, went for the lead two wide on the turn, battled through the stretch and edged ahead in the
waning yards. TOUGH STUFF jostled briefly with SUNNY'S STORM just after the break, soon gained the lead, was challenged from outside on the turn,
floated out into the lane, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. YOU'RE KILLIN ME pressed from outside, came into the stretch outside
ARCHIEMYBOY, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly best of the others. HALO HUNTER raced in the second flight between horses, was checked as
his path narrowed with a quarter mile left, angled in midstretch and steadily faded. RIVER CACTUS passed outside tired ones in the stretch. SUNNY'S
STORM fractious in the gate, was taken out, walked then reloaded, jostled between rivals shortly after the break, still was in contention from inside on the
bend but flattened out the last eighth. CHRISTMAS COOKIE also jostled briefly with SUNNY'S STORM just after the start, chased from between horses and
had no late bid. CALEB'S HEIR gave way from inside on the bend. GOLDEN DRILLER three to five wide, was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
SISTER RULER broke outward, bumping PALAGO, soon had the lead from between horses, moved clear on the turn, stayed off the inside then steadily
opened up under a mild drive through the stretch. HALO COUTURE chased from outside, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend, bid under a drive in
the lane, her rider lost his whip with a sixteenth to go but caught RACETOTHEFINISH for second nearing the wire. RACETOTHEFINISH bumped solidly
from the rear at the start, quickly recovered to vie for the lead inside SISTER RULER, did not keep up on the turn, fanned outside the latter for the stretch
run and slowly wore down the final furlong. GHAALEB'S DREAMS broke inward and bumped solidly with RACETOTHEFINISH, was settled at the back,
angled out widest of all upper stretch and showed late interest. PALAGO hesitated then was bumped at the break, chased from inside and passed some
tired ones deep stretch. POSITIONEDTODANCE forwardly placed outside, came five wide into the stretch and gradually wore down. GO LITTLE GERT GO
well placed from inside on the backstretch, came off the rail some on the bend, was four wide into the lane and also slowly yieleded. RARE ACTION
ATTACK in contention early, did not keep up three wide on the turn, angled in leaving the bend and flattened out the last eighth. LEXI SUMMER failed to
menace.
