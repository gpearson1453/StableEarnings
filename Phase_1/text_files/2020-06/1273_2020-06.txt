Footnotes
SENORITA UNO bumped with VICTORIAN MOON leaving the gate, settled off the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch and
swept to the lead under a drive in the late stages. VICTORIAN MOON, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, took
command at the top of the stretch and moved clear but was passed in the final 16th. DON'T SMILE LILAH settled in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on
the turn but evened out in deep stretch. MINE FAST PHILLY, away slowly and off the early pace, saved ground on the turn then finished gamely in vain.
TACKLE THE NORTH stalked from the rail, dropped back on the turn but lacked a closing response. PLAYING SMART raced from off the pace, was roused
three-wide late turn but was never in contention. FLATOUTONAMISSION showed early speed, moved to a clear lead, was headed at the top of the stretch
and faded.

AFLEET CONNECTION settled off the early pace, closed four-wide on the turn, rallied outside through the stretch and was up late under light handling.
GIMBALA showed early speed then stalked the pacesetter, chased along the rail and two-wide through the turn, launched a strong stretch drive and was
getting to the leader but was outkicked by the winner in the late stages. SHAMRUCKUS dueled, shook clear into the turn, was under a ride to hold her
advantage but was passed in deep stretch. MIDNIGHT BREW dueled early then dropped back nearing the turn, stalked from the rail then finished under a
determined drive. OUR PETUNIA was rated at the rear early, angled in from the third path to the rail through the turn then failed to menace. GET SAUCY
offered brief speed then stalked the pacesetter on the turn, was roused along the rail late turn but had no closing response. HOCKEY HAIR also showed a
turn of early speed, stalked three-wide on the turn, chased hard, then tired at the top of the stretch.
