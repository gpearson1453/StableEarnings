the far turn and stayed on while three wide in the stretch. BIG HEARTED FACTOR stalked, was outpaced leaving the far turn and proved no match.
DYNABEAVER raced forwardly along the inside and lacked a rally. I AM READY AGAIN outrun, was urged far on the far turn, went five wide into the stretch
and offered no response. STUART HALL was always outrun. TOUCH 'EM UP made a sluggish star and produced a dull try. Due to timing issues the six and

Footnotes
CELTIC SAILOR grabbed the lead, was challenged on the turn, responded to pressure and held sway. COME ON RICO settled well, moved closer on the
turn and lodged a four wide bid in the stretch. BRILLIANT BABY saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and kept on. READY OR NOT stalked
the pace, dueled on the turn and weakened. DADDY DAVE veered in at the start and never menaced. GERDY'S BOY passed tired ones. NORTHERN
HIGHLINE was slammed into at the start and did not factor. SHANDYLAND leaned out at the start and dropped back early.
