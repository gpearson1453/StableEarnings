Footnotes
SMART N WICKED, brushed at the start, raced three deep between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to terms with the pacesetter in the second
furlong, dueled for command outside that rival into the turn, edged forward leaving midstretch and held GRAND PRIZE on a narrow advantage under firm
right handed pressure. The latter raced four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards a bit advancing on the leaders three deep racing through the turn
and continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner late. BRIGHT BLING broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the winner through the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. FORTY NINE MODEL
tracked off the first flight along the inside and continued evenly into the stretch while shifting out late to prevail narrowly for fourth. TIME FOR KISSES
dropped off the second flight while racing widest early, continued four wide into the turn making brief progress, but flattened out in upper stretch.
FLATOUTCOUNTRY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. SNOWTRICK, off last, made brief
progress three wide between foes to gain terms with the second flight midway through the turn but proved empty in the drive.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES, off last, was settled into stride while working her way to the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced along the rail nearing upper
stretch to challenge for command inside foes, gained a narrow advantage leaving midstretch and held that margin to the wire under firm right handed
encouragement. DO YOU BILEVE, forwardly placed outside rivals racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance to the
second bend, moved to wrest command nearing upper stretch, drifted out to the four path entering the lane but contested the issue grudgingly to the end
despite the loss of her rider's whip. PLENTY OF MUNNY, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight,
shifted out nearing the lane to bid between rivals midstretch but was just outkicked by the top pair. GOLDEN LILY tracked off the second flight between foes
while shuffling out of close quarters entering the backstretch and offered no closing bid. DAT GIRL, urged to the lead from between foes racing into the first
turn, angled nearer to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace into the far turn and gave way once headed racing into upper stretch. BAILDON
switched off the inside racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight between foes but steadily faded after a half. BRAHMS IS WHO was settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued four wide past the half mile marker and soon retreated.

Footnotes
UNLEASH THE BEAST broke sharply, was urged clear racing into the first turn racing just off the rail, opened a commanding margin after a half, was
prompted to resist when challenged nearing upper stretch while drifting to the three path racing into the lane but responded to left handed pressure to regain
a clear advantage. HAMAZING VISION bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to track off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
gradually gained position three deep between foes racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late. MR. BENZ
angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight in the opening half, switched out three wide midway through the far turn advancing on the
pacesetter in tandem with several rivals, was fanned four wide into the lane and failed to match terms with the winner, then was just outkicked for second.
BLUE BOMBER angled to the inside early tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, was prompted to make brief progress along the rail leaving
the midway point of the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. TOWARDS THE LIGHT, forwardly placed leading the second flight on a narrow margin
into the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on the pacesetter entering the far turn, lodged a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch, shifted
inside the pacesetter entering the lane and weakened in the closing stages. OUT OF PATIENCE settled into stride racing off the inside to the backstretch
and failed to menace. SLICK AS ICE broke in the air, was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace. FEARLESS WILL, reserved well off the
second flight along the inside in the opening half, steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SWEET BLINDNESS ducked out slightly at the start, angled to the inside racing to the first turn while under light rating to track off the first flight, was
prompted to bid for command along the rail when presented an opening nearing the far turn, contested the issue in a prolonged drive while drifting out
slightly late despite right handed pressure but narrowly prevailed on the wire. GOLDEN TAP, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace in the opening
half, was urged to press the issue outside the eventual winner racing into the far turn, shifted out entering upper stretch, then inwards under brisk right
handed pressure contesting the issue to the end and just lost the nod on the wire. SHABAM tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch,
shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, gradually gained terms with the top pair racing into the lane, altered course to bid
between foes midstretch but was steadied out of tight quarters late losing momentum. SNEAKY DIANNE, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals racing a bit
off the rail into the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. SHE B GLAMOROUS settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never
gained contention. GIO'S LIL ANGEL was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight in the opening stages and proved no threat. HUSHED, urged to
terms prompting the pacesetter between foes into the backstretch, gave way after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SHABAM LODGED
CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF SWEET BLINDNESS AND GOLDEN TAP ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THOSE
CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SON OF POSEIDON angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, gained momentum nearing upper stretch while shifting out, split foes three
deep in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under pressure. BEYOND STREETSMART tracked off the second flight four wide, then three
wide between foes racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to edged rivals for the place honors in late stages. WINTERS RUN broke sharply,
prompted the pace four wide through the backstretch into the turn, drifted out to the seven path entering the stretch and was outkicked by the top pair. ROW
THE BOAT, urged between pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage in upper stretch but gave out in late stages.
NOTTE OSCURA, reserved between foes dropping off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the turn and
continued with interest inside foes to improve position. GENERAL MILES, held up last in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned
six wide into the lane but made no impact. BLAME BISHOP tracked off the first flight racing five wide into the turn and gave way. FOREIGN RUMOR, urged
inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into the stretch. MOMENT OF MAGIC dropped out early. PHANTOM
THREEONINE, forwardly placed three deep between foes, was under pressure to advance racing into the turn but was through after a half.

Footnotes
PLANE TALK broke sharply, angled in to force the pace three deep outside foes on a narrow advantage, shifted inwards entering the turn to press the issue
outside a rival, then between foes into the lane and just edged REAL GRACE in a long drive under firm encouragement. The latter broke readily, angled to
the rail while being urged inside foes pressing the pace into the turn, continued in a protracted skirmish to late stages but was outfinished. HI HO CHEERIO
tracked the leaders three deep in second flight from out of striking distance early, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued well enough to earn a
share. DRAMA CHORUS tracked off the first flight along the rail, saved ground to the stretch and continued evenly inside foes. FRANK THE MAYOR,
bumped by ILLUMINATI just after the start, clipped heels with that foe, was settled into stride, angled five wide racing into the lane but made no impact.
WILD TONIGHT proved no factor. ILLUMINATI angled inwards bumping a rival while clipping heels, was urged between foes disputing the issue, was held
up nearing the turn while shifting out three deep making a brief second effort approaching the quarter mile marker but came up empty in the drive. CHAMPS
SUCCESS tracked the pace between foes in second flight and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DRAKE tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half while advancing with a sharp move to
challenge the pacesetter racing into the second bend, took over midway through the far turn and went well clear under firm encouragement. MACHO
RAPIDO tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out three wide racing into the far turn and continued with interest to
edge a rival for the place honors. WHERE'D THE DAY GO was prompted to advance three wide between foes racing into the first turn to gain terms with the
pacesetter, took over after a half, proved no match when confronted by the winner on the far turn and gave way into the lane. SILVER DASH broke slowly,
settled into stride, split foes racing into the far turn making steady progress to the lane but had no closing bid. TEMPLES MON CHERI settled outside the
field racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. CARAMEL ANGEL tracked the pace between foes in second flight and faded after a half.
CLASSY MAGIC, raced four wide into the first turn while being prompted to gain a forward placing but was spent early. WHATDOYATHINK, urged to lead
along the inside, was through after a half. RAISIN CANDY BAR WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE BY ORDER OF THE STEWARDS ON THE ADVICE OF
THE TRACK VETERINARIAN.

SEEK N JUSTICE, urged to the lead from the outset, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin and held sway throughout under firm
encouragement. MAJOR BIZKIT urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter while angling inwards, couldn't gain terms with the winner but
edged rivals for the place honors in late stages. MOST AMUSING tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the turn, was fanned wide into the lane,
shifted in entering the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. FRONT OFFICE angled in tracking the pacesetter outside a rival as part
of the second flight, continued in pursuit to the lane but faded late. STARRING JOHN WAIN slow to gather stride, split foes racing into the stretch and made
some belated progress. BOLD PROPOSITION raced in close quarters between rivals tracking off the second flight, swung four wide racing into the lane
carrying out a rival but had no rally. POVERTY FLATS tracked the leaders inside foes just off the second flight, checked out of tight quarters racing into the
turn and never menaced thereafter. BEERMASTER proved no factor. HOLD THAT THOUGHT settled along the inside early, switched out nearing the turn
but trailed throughout.

A ROZE AND WINE broke readily to gain terms with the leaders, was rated stalking just outside the dueling leaders racing three deep into the bend, took
over when given her cue racing into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to maintain the advantage. HURRICAIN HUNTER tracked just off
the first flight along the inside, swung out leaving the midway point of the turn while crossing the path of B L BREEZY, shifted four wide racing into the lane
and proved best of the others. SPEEDING LADY, urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn, proved no match when confronted by
the winner but prevailed for a share late. SWEET AS CANBE, urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way in late
stages. MISS STEELE JONES broke inwards crossing the path of SWEET ECLIPSE, tracked the leaders four, then three wide as part of the second flight
racing into the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane but had no rally. B L BREEZY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was caught in
tight quarters midway through the turn, angled to the inside nearing the lane but had no closing bid. RIVER SWAN settled inside foes early and proved no
factor. CHARMING FURY settled last early and passed only tiring rivals. ADDED DIAMONDS dropped out early. SWEET ECLIPSE, cut off at the start, was
urged to regain position outside foes on the backstretch but soon dropped out.
