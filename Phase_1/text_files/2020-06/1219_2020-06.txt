Footnotes
LANGUE LIEE was urged along the rail prompting the pace inside foes in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders while shifting out three wide
entering the turn, advanced readily to take over nearing upper stretch, then came under some firm right handed prompting to maintain a clear advantage.
WAY TO SUCCESS was settled outside rivals in the last flight in early stages, angled to the inside entering the turn gathering momentum, shifted out to split
foes entering the lane to bid inside the winner but proved only second best. SHARPERTHANME was rated off the first flight while shifting out to the four
path early, continued in that path into the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. LITTLE NATALIA stumbled at the start, was quickly righted, then
urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, shifted to the rail entering the turn while continuing to dispute issue inside a rival but came
up empty nearing upper stretch. BONSAI BENNY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn,
then gave way nearing the lane. LOVELY ARABELLA, brushed at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
TOOLCAT went readily to the lead under light reserve while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin inside foes on her
own courage racing to the far turn, then responded to firm handling to hold safe several challengers in the closing stages to prevail. ADIOS, reserved last
racing to the backstretch, angled outside rivals after a half, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn and continued willingly in that path
into the lane to close the gap on the winner while holding safe a rival for the place honors. FEETS OF FEATHER, reserved off the second flight along the
inside in the opening half, came around a tiring foe entering the far turn to advance along the rail, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued
willingly to gain terms with the top pair late. SHIKAKA was rated between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, angled to the inside while being urged in
pursuit of the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. BACI, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter between foes racing to the
backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and came up empty in late stages. CHARGING RENEE was rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to
the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. BRAMBLE BERRY tracked the pacesetter inside foes under light rating to the backstretch but abruptly gave
way entering the far turn. BAREBACK FUN, prompted to contention outside foes leaving the chute, bore out racing through the first turn, was collected to
gain a position three deep briefly prompting the leaders but emptied out nearing the second bend.

EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE switched off the inside tracking the leader from out of striking distance racing three deep into the backstretch, made steady
progress in that path after a half to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, continued to dispute the issue on a narrow margin outside a rival racing into
the stretch in a prolonged drive but held that foe to the end under brisk handling. VUYELWA broke in the air while getting away very slowly, was settled
while gradually gaining a position behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes four wide nearing the far turn while being urged in pursuit of
the eventual winner, angled inside that rival racing into upper stretch while continuing with a sustained challenge but came up second best. KATIE
FALOONA settled between foes just off the second flight, split foes entering the far turn, angled four wide racing into the stretch but lacked the needed
closing bid. DARESCA, caught four wide racing into the first turn racing just behind the second flight, continued five wide to the second bend and continued
evenly while no threat. SUNSHINE JOY settled between foes just off the second flight, shifted out to race four deep between foes through the backstretch
and came up empty entering the far turn. MAIDU tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded after a half.
DELIGHTFULZEE'S, urged to forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the first turn, conceded some ground to track that foe off the rail into the
backstretch but was through after a half. MIGHTY ELECTRICA sped to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, held sway on a commanding
margin to the second bend and faltered nearing the three furlong marker. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF VUYELWA LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
GRAYCAPADE broke readily, sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, shook clear nearing
upper stretch, shifted off the inside racing through the lane but held sway on a comfortable margin under pressure. BEE BY THE SEA broke inwards
exchanging multiple bumps with CARK at the start, raced a bit wide to the first turn gaining a position outside foes off the second flight, was prompted to
advance four wide racing into the far turn, continued in that path between foes to the lane and edged a rival for the place honors. CARK, soundly bumped
twice at the start, was reserved racing off the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing through the far turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and continued with interest while just outkicked for second. HANDSOME COYOTE tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to
the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even effort to gain some position inside foes. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked just off
the pacesetter inside foes racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane but proved empty in the drive. PAPA'S PLACE, forwardly
placed three deep racing to the backstretch, continued outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance nearing the
lane but gave way entering the stretch. SWIFT KID settled last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. RECLINER was settled while angling to the
inside racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. CAPTURE THE RIDE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the first turn, was eased
back from that position racing into the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half while being urged to make a brief bid racing into the far turn but soon gave
way. GO ABA GO, reserved near the inside racing to the first turn, dropped out early.

Footnotes
OLLIVANDER, forwardly placed three deep between rivals in the opening stages, conceded some position racing through the backstretch while angling to
the inside tracking just off the leaders, was urged through close quarters splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid inside the leader
and just edged that foe in time under firm encouragement. WORD OF TRUTH, prominent five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue
outside a rival in the three path through the turn, moved to gain the advantage in upper stretch and just failed to contain the winner. GREELEY'S
FAREWELL was rated just off the first flight in early stages, lost some ground to the leaders racing into the turn, then shifted to split foes three deep in late
stages while edging a rival for a share. JUNCTION was rated just off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced on the leaders four wide racing through
the turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. VERY AMUSING settled into stride in last while switching off the inside racing through the
backstretch, was caught five wide on the turn while being urged to advance but had no closing response. CALL ME HANDSOME tracked off the first flight
inside foes but faded from contention early. C'ERA UNA VOLTA was urged to gain a narrow advantage four wide between foes in the opening stages,
angled in racing to the turn disputing the issue inside foes and gave way entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
PLAN OF ATTACK, unhurried four wide tracking the leaders from out of striking distance as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, gathered
momentum after a half, steadily moved to terms with the leader while shifting inwards racing into the far turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest command
racing into upper stretch and held MASTERIO on a safe margin to the end under firm handling. The latter was settled between foes off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, switched out racing into the lane gathering late momentum, was fanned five wide midstretch but continued with a steady late bid to
prevail for the place honors. ESTILO PELIGROSO tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide
entering the lane and was outkicked for second. COURAGE DE LION switched outside foes racing to the backstretch to advance on the leader five wide
through the backstretch, continued to advance lodging a brief, three wide bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. INITFORTHELOVE reared at the start
nearly dislodging his rider, was rank against restraint while switching outside foes to race five wide into the first turn, settled outside foes in the last flight on
the backstretch, then was prompted to make some belated progress three deep between foes racing into the lane. PUERTO VARAS sprinted to the lead
while angling over, set the pace to the far turn, couldn't meet the winner's bid and gave way entering the lane. MISSUMAXWELL angled to the inside
tracking the leaders in second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. SECRET MAGICIAN settled along the inside early and failed to
menace. BEYOND THE STARS, urged to gain a forward placing while angling to the inside, made brief pursuit of the pacesetter through the backstretch but
came up empty entering the far turn. CONVEYED was a brief factor three deep between foes in second flight but gave way abruptly after a half.

I'M NASTY TOO was urged to the lead outside foes while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace racing off the rail into the turn
and widened the margin through the stretch under firm encouragement. MI TIA CHRISTINA broke inwards brushing FANCY FOX, then shifted in bumping
that rival in the opening stages, was prompted to advance to contention four wide racing into the turn, made steady progress in that path to upper stretch but
couldn't match terms with the winner while just lasting for second. TAKIN IT EASY tracked just off the first flight between foes, then along the inside racing
into the turn, shifted out four wide in the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. U KNOW I B LION, urged along while
angling inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, weakened in the drive. JIMA'S GOLD tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes racing into the
turn and faded in the drive. FRAN'S SALSA tracked off the second flight while angling inside, saved ground to the lane but had no rally. THIRTY NINE
SEVEN trailed the field to the stretch. FANCY FOX, brushed, then bumped at the start, settled outside foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FELIX THE FOX raced unhurried outside rivals racing to the first turn tracking off the second flight, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter three deep
after a half, wrested the advantage from that foe racing into upper stretch and went well clear through the lane under right handed encouragement. JUROR
was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued in
that path entering the lane and gathered some late momentum to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. SAUCY DEREK went readily to the lead
while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dispatched a rival after a half, then briefly resisted the winner's bid
entering the far turn but gave way in the drive. MY CHITU, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival, was carried out momentarily entering the
first turn, was rated tracking the leaders between foes into the backstretch, made brief pursuit between foes racing to the far turn but quickly came up empty.
ECONOMIC POLICY settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress nearing the far turn, raced in hand
awaiting an opening entering the far turn and offered no closing response. IN HONOR OF ARTIE, held up avoiding close quarters leaving the chute, settled
outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch and never gained contention. HOLY CROSS, pulling a bit against restraint in the opening stages while
angling to the inside to race just behind the pacesetter, switched out sharply entering the first turn while moving to prompt the leader into the backstretch but
gave way after a half.
