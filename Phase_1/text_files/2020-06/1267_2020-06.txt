Footnotes
PRINCESS AVRIL got bumped by BLAME THE STORM at the start, chased after MUCHA SUERTE outside several others early, had the latter get away
from her on the turn while putting daylight on the rest, fought to a short lead between horses through mid stretch, and turned back DINNER AT FIVE to the
finish. DINNER AT FIVE broke slowly, moved up around the turn five then four wide, loomed outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, and was
edged by the top one. AUNT IRENE moved up on the turn three wide, briefly lacked room just inside DINNER AT FIVE at the top of the lane, and finished
evenly. WATER WIZARD saved ground well back for three furlongs, and finished with interest between horses. MUCHA SUERTE grabbed the early lead
inside a host of pursuers, shook away on the turn, but faded on the rail through the last eighth of a mile. LOVELY LEE bumped with SYLLABUS at the start,
began moving two then three wide after three furlongs, and went evenly late. SYLLABUS brushed the left side of the gate and bumped with LOVELY LEE at
the start, and dropped back inside on the turn. BUSINESSINDUBAI brushed the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun inside.
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS checked between horses and lost position approaching the turn, and could not recover. KHOZANA raced four wide and was
through before reaching the stretch. BLAME THE STORM broke out bumping PRINCESS AVRIL at the start, showed speed into the turn, and dropped back
steadily under minimal urging.

Footnotes
PAYNTER FEST tracked in range outside early, moved to the lead three wide midway on the turn, outdueled STORMY BOSS through mid stretch, and held
off LA TRES JOLIE to the finish. LA TRES JOLIE broke a bit awkwardly, improved position four wide around the turn, and rallied on the far outside too late.
STORMY BOSS slipped through along the rail to join the leaders past the three-eighths, battled inside PAYNTER FEST through the lane, and yielded
grudgingly. COUNTENANCE moved up three wide after completing six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. DUBAIAN broke slowly, lacked speed for a
half, and passed tired horses. GOT THE GIST prompted the pace outside SAMIS CAR, reached a brief lead between horses near the seven-sixteenths, and
gave way soon after that. CHIQUI THE GRAY bobbled at the start, showed speed for a half-mile and tired. SAMIS CAR sped clear early, and faltered
around the turn.

Footnotes
BELLE LAURA cleared inside with the lead nearing the first turn, rated along through an even pace for a half-mile, edged away around the far turn, moved
well off the rail into the stretch and responded to stay in command. SENSIBLE MYTH was outrun for six furlongs, fanned widest coming off the far turn, and
rallied with good energy. LOVELY LUVY moved up four wide after six furlongs, and gained mildly between horses late. SCATNAP advanced four then three
wide around the far turn, but flattened out late between horses. PEACEFUL FEELING tucked in just off the leaders for six furlongs, had aim outside the
leader in the two-path turning for home, but weakened in the last furlong. GET REWARDED tossed her head at the break, then hit the left side of the gate
and came out awkwardly, raced three wide and did not factor. TEAM WIN settled in the middle of the field early, and tired inside. CONNECTIVITY raced
three wide on the turns, and gave way after six furlongs. MAHKATO tugged along keyed up under a hold outside BELLE LAURA early, and dropped back
steadily approaching the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
JEALOUS BOYFRIEND lost some ground to the leaders around the turn, came widest for the drive and rallied determinedly through the final furlong to
overhaul PRINCELY GOD in the last 50 yards. PRINCELY GOD set the pace inside, shook off FREEDOM FORCE turning for home, swapped leads
awkwardly, hit the rail and was steadied inside the eighth-pole, and could not hold on. FREEDOM FORCE pressed the pace outside PRINCELY GOD from
the outset, and was outfinished. SANDYS BLAZE moved out three wide around the turn, and could not gain in the stretch. HALO'S DANCE hit the left side
of the gate at the start, and was outrun three wide. I'AM BEOWULF dropped back two wide around the turn, and tired. IRON DRILL broke slowly and trailed.

BEATING THE ODDS raced three wide around the turn, got pushed further out by KATNISS KAN turning for home, rallied steadily and overtook COOKIE
COVE from outside in deep stretch. COOKIE COVE grabbed the lead after the start, rated along clear in the two-path, and yielded late.
DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB saved ground around the turn, moved out a path in upper stretch, went back inside COOKIE COVE looming a threat past the
eighth-pole, could not get by and steadied in tight near the wire. MADAME BARRISTER improved inside after three furlongs, moved out through mid stretch
and finished evenly. SPICED RUM PUNCH was outrun two wide early, and gained mildly inside through the drive. MARVA bumped with NO SE VENDE at
the start, and raced evenly three wide. MISS CHLOE G raced four wide on the turn, and made no headway on the far outside. KATNISS KAN chased after
COOKIE COVE for three furlongs, drifted to the three-path pushing out BEATING THE ODDS at the top of the stretch, and gave way. NO SE VENDE
bumped with MARVA at the start, was well back throughout, then was unsaddled after the gallop-out and escorted back. ONEZY'S DREAM clipped heels
behind DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB and/or BEATING THE ODDS and stumbled sharply early, and dropped far back. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB AGAINST COOKIE COVE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

PLATO took the lead early while kept well off the rail, rated along near the three-path for six furlongs, was roused mildly and left STILL SCHEMIN behind
through the furlong grounds, and was geared down the last 70 yards. STILL SCHEMIN pressed PLATO from the inside early, stayed on the chase moving
outside midway up the backstretch, proved no match through upper stretch on the wrong lead, and stayed clear of the rest. JANUARY WON raced three
wide, and was no threat to the top two. EARTHQUAKE saved ground and faded after six furlongs. AWESOME PARTY was outrun inside. WE
CONNECTED raced two wide and dropped far back after six furlongs. COMING UP ROSES hesitated at the start and bobbled a stride out, and trailed.

Footnotes
FLASH PASS broke out a bit while away alertly, rated along in the three-path establishing a slow early pace, moved inside through the middle stages,
responded when roused in upper stretch and stayed clear under a drive. UNCLE ANDREW bumped with BACANO at the start, prompted the pace under a
firm hold, challenged from outside after six furlongs, got shaken off into the stretch and saved the place. SUN SQUALL was well back for six furlongs, swung
four wide into the stretch and rallied belatedly. BACANO bumped with UNCLE ANDREW at the start, raced two wide and lacked a rally. WARRANT
OFFICER bumped with JUAN BOLY at the start, went four wide on the first turn, stayed in range to the stretch and came up empty. JUAN BOLY was
crowded a bit by FLASH PASS at the break, bumped the hind end of WARRANT OFFICER and steadied a stride later, raced wide and could not reach
contention. DEERSLAYER stayed close early under a firm hold, was mildly hand urged around the far turn, and faded through the stretch while never set
down in earnest. SCAR was outrun three wide.

LIKE YOU began moving after a half-mile out in the four-path, poked a head in front outside VALID QUEST and AIN'T WASTING TIME at the quarter-pole,
edged clear in upper stretch, and held firm to repel challenges from both flanks. FIRST RATE was bumped between horses at the start, followed behind the
leaders to the turn, shifted out four wide being roused after six furlongs, appeared to brush with TONS OF GOLD three-sixteenths out, moved inward and
finished gamely inside the winner. TONS OF GOLD moved up around the turn four then five wide, appeared to brush with FIRST RATE at the top of the
stretch, had a clear shot outside through the lane but did not have enough. INDY'S JEWEL pressed the pace three wide, weakened late on the turn, and
dropped back. AIN'T WASTING TIME bumped with FIRST RATE at the start, dueled outside VALID QUEST for six furlongs, and faded. VALID QUEST
bumped with FIRST RATE at the start, vied inside AIN'T WASTING TIME for six furlongs, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LA AUSTRALIANA was reserved early inside, went into the far turn well back in the four-path, fanned widest at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly
and got up outside OLYMPIC GAMES (FR) after a late battle. The latter hit the left side of the gate and was slowest away, took closer order after six
furlongs while gradually shifting off the inside, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to a short lead inside LA AUSTRALIANA with 50 yards to go, and was
edged to the finish. ZARINA went along behind the leaders and inside TRAIPSING, had no choice but to stay on the rail late on the far turn, slipped through
on the fence to take over at the top of the stretch, moved clear through the furlong grounds and was outkicked from there. ALWAYS SHOPPING vied for
command inside HELPING LISA D for six furlongs, left the rail open yielding into the lane, moved out late and stayed on for a share. GREAT SISTER
DIANE was roused early on the far turn four wide, but flattened out between horses after straightening away for the drive. TRAIPSING was forwardly placed
outside ZARINA for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. HELPING LISA D argued the pace outside ALWAYS SHOPPING for six furlongs, and gave way
between horses through upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHEZ PAREE stayed in range early, tried to get through inside CRAFTY LASS to no avail at the top of the stretch, split horses rallying near the eighth-pole,
and finished gamely to get up. PRINCESS BETTY advanced four then five wide around the turn, took over in the middle of the track with a furlong
remaining, but could not hold on. GRAN ETIQUETA stumbled at the start, lagged far back to the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved to land a
share. CRAFTY LASS set the pace inside, and weakened through the final furlong. VIVAMENTE lodged a mild bid three wide after a half-mile, and flattened
out in the lane. SMART SET stumbled at the start, advanced four wide on the turn, and weakened approaching the eighth-pole. VALID EMPRESS was
forwardly placed early, dropped back after six furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch. SMOOTH AS GLASS pressed the pace outside to the turn, gave
way after a half-mile, and was eased up in the stretch.
