Footnotes
FRIDLEY sprinted to the lead along the inside, dictated terms a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dispatched a rival racing into the far turn, then held sway
under firm encouragement to hold his rivals on a safe margin. WHISKYFORBREAKFAST angled to the rail in early stages to track the leaders as part of the
second flight, advanced along the inside racing into the lane to challenge inside the winner but proved only second best. MR. COUGAR was rated off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, gained position between foes racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide to loom outside the top pair but had no
final kick. RAHAAL, a step slow into stride, angled to the rail early while dropping into last, continued inside foes into the lane but offered no rally. HOIST
YOUR GLASS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight but lacked a closing response. MY VOW IS COURAGE, urged to a forward placing
prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, was through after a half. DON'S FINAL FINAL tracked the leaders three deep in second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
COOL EDGE tracked the pacesetter four deep in second flight in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn to press the issue midway through
the bend, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and was driven clear. IZZY IN A TIZZY tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second
flight, switched off the inside racing into the turn, angled out entering the lane and edged a rival for the place honors late. ROCKTHEPULPIT sped to the
lead while angling over racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace to the turn, briefly dueled for command inside the winner leaving the midway point
of the turn and gave way entering the lane. BLACKS FERRY ROAD, reserved between foes dropping off the second flight, split rivals nearing upper stretch,
then shifted inside while making some belated progress. SUMMERTIMER settled outside foes in the last flight in early stages, was prompted to pursue the
leaders three wide into the turn but soon flattened out. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in second flight in the
opening quarter but retreated early. WEAL was settled inside foes and failed to menace. MATT AND CHEESE dropped out early.

Footnotes
DIVA DE KELA broke readily, joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a rival into the turn and went
clear leaving midstretch under firm encouragement. RENTAL POOL, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, continued with a steady bid while
shifting three deep racing into the lane and held a rival for the place honors. GREY WAVE was settled outside foes, advanced on the leaders four wide
through the turn into the lane and continued willingly to close the gap. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn, gave way in late stages. DEFEND THE ROSE stumbled badly at the start, steadily gained position inside rivals racing into the turn, was held up
momentarily when lacking a path nearing midstretch and came up empty through the last furlong. HOTASAPISTOL, urged to a forward placing three deep
racing just off the leaders to the turn, gave way after a half. ORTS DREAM settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace.
HELEN'SPHOTOFLASH proved no factor.

Footnotes
HOTFOOT, forwardly placed between rivals in the opening stages, angled to the rail in the second furlong to track just off the leaders racing into the turn,
continued under patient handling through the bend, came through inside the pacesetter when presented an opening to challenge for command racing
through upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under brisk handling. UNCLE GOYLE sped to the lead while angling to the rail disputing the
issue inside foes into the turn, shifted a bit off the rail maintaining a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't quite contain the winner.
CHATTERMAN settled off the first flight racing to the turn, swung out six wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to prevail for a share.
OUTRUN THE POSSE, urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, was floated three wide in upper stretch and weakened late. EPIC
DRAMA, forwardly placed between foes, tracked just off the first flight into the turn and faded in late stages. MASTERFUL STRIDE, off a step slowly, was
reserved along the inside, then shifted out to pass between some tiring rivals late. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR, urged to a forward placing three wide, then four
wide racing into the turn, gave way in the drive. NO RICHIE was rated off the second flight while angling inside, saved ground to the lane but lacked a rally.
MY DISCRETION proved no factor.

Footnotes
FINN COUNTRY broke readily, angled inwards pursuing the pacesetter racing to the turn, moved to terms with that foe pressing the issue racing to upper
stretch and went clear under some right handed encouragement. MR. D'S LEGEND, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, angled to the inside
entering the turn and continued with a steady effort to edge rivals for the place honors late. CAPTAIN DRAKE, forwardly placed three wide between foes,
continued in pursuit of the leaders into the turn and weakened in late stages. BANDURRIA, urged to the lead along the inside racing through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and gave out late. DIVIDED BY PIE settled between foes racing to the turn
and continued evenly. MACHO RAPIDO was settled along the rail racing through the backstretch and never gained contention. OTSEGO settled outside
foes in the opening quarter and proved no threat. AZUSA ST. angled to the inside while being prompted in pursuit of the first flight but gave way early.
STONE COLD HEART, caught in close quarters just after the start while being steadied and trailed the field thereafter.

Footnotes
GATITO, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, was rated off the first flight nearing the turn, shifted four wide on the turn commencing a steady
advance and wore down the leader to prevail under pressure. STARRING JOHN WAIN, a bit outpaced early, angled to the inside racing into the turn,
steadily advanced along the rail and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire. CANDY WOMPUS was settled last racing to the turn, swung out seven
wide entering the lane and produced his best stride late to prevail for a share. FRONT OFFICE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival through the
backstretch into the turn, shook clear in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. FORTNITE DANCE, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start,
was prompted to track off the first flight along the inside, swung out four wide racing into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. BRANDY
CHASER tracked off the second flight outside foes, was caught five wide racing into the turn and had no rally. DRAMA IN DANUBE tracked off the second
flight between foes and offered no rally. CAN IF I CAN stumbled at the break, was quickly righted, then was urged four wide, then three wide prompting the
leaders into the turn and gave way into the lane. SEEK N JUSTICE raced three wide between foes midpack and faded nearing the lane. MAJOR BIZKIT,
urged outside a rival prompting the pace to the turn, gave way into the lane. HOLD THAT THOUGHT dropped out early.

Footnotes
DROP OF GOLDEN SUN, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals while angling to the rail, pressed the issue on a narrow advantage racing through the turn,
was roused forward entering upper stretch and gamely held SPEEDING KID to the end under firm handling. The latter was settled outside foes racing
through the backstretch, steadily advanced four wide on the turn, shifted in entering the stretch to challenge the winner but was just outkicked. KING OF
THE COURT stumbled at the start, was settled along the rail tracking off the second flight, shifted out entering the stretch and split foes three wide late to
prevail for a share. MAN U tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing three deep into the turn, shifted four wide racing through the stretch and continued
evenly. JERRYS PRIDENJOY hopped at the start, was settled last early, shifted out on the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and made no real
impact. GOT EVEN SMARTER angled to the inside tracking just behind the first flight, was urged to advance inside foes entering the lane but gave way
leaving midstretch. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN, urged to position between foes in second flight, gave way early. TIN BADGE, urged prompting the pace three
wide into the turn, gave way in the drive. AWESOME EMMIT, urged between foes prompting the pace to the turn, was through after a half.

Footnotes
THERIGHTTOBEARARMS broke sharply to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail on her own courage into the turn, then
came under pressure leaving midstretch to hold safe the challenge of SMOKIN HOT MOMMA under firm handling. The latter angled inwards to track just off
the first flight between rivals, came through close quarters splitting rivals just off the inside inside entering the lane, moved to terms challenging the winner
but was outkicked. CAUSE TO WONDER was settled outside a rival in the last flight in early stages, swung out five wide entering the lane and finished with
interest to gain a share. FRIENDLY AND KIND settled in the last flight near the inside, switched outside foes on the turn, was fanned six wide entering the
lane and improved position. BRENDA'S AN I FULL, off a step slowly, was prompted to a position tracking off the first flight along the inside but came up
empty in the drive. MUCHO SUPER GIRL, urged three wide prompting the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SHADY LANE, urged pressing
the pace between foes to the turn, gave way into the lane. SASSY SETA, caught five wide in early stages, tracked off the first flight three deep racing into
the turn and soon retreated. Races times included after further review.
