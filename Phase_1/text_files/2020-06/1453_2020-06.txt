Footnotes
MISS NAPPER TANDY stalked the pace in the two path on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, came into the stretch in the two path and gamely rallied
in between rivals. MERGIE TROID settled at the rear of the field on the backstretch, stayed along the rail on the turn and stretch, responded well to urging
and just missed on along the rail. MILLIE JOEL settled between rivals early, entered the turn three wide, tipped out five wide entering the stretch and
finished willingly under steady urging. REAL KEEPER chased pace along the rail on the backstretch, angled out at the five sixteenths, entered stretch in the
four path, and did not have enough late to get by. NAOMI FRALEY cleared quickly and went to the rail, held rail throughout the backstretch and into the turn,
drifted out mildly ending up on the two path into the stretch, gave way grudgingly late under strong urging. MADAME JEANETTE lacked speed in the three
path on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, stayed in the three path on the turn, and lacked rally in the lane.

JESS GOOD CORONA broke in bit, shifted out 1/16, best late. EL CUERVO FAVORITO broke in, drifted out late. RULENTLESS broke well, greenly.
CATALINA ROCKET shifted out start. DOCS TIENE FIRE impeded start, eased. MORE THAN LOOKS off slow, lost path. There was an objection made by
the trainer of DOCS TIENE FIRE against CATALINA ROCKET for interference at the start. After a review, the Stewards ruled that although CATALINA
ROCKET did come out at the start causing DOCS TIENE FIRE to steady briefly, it did not alter the outcome of the finish.
