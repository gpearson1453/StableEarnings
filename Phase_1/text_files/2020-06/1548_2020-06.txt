SECRET OF WAR dueled with outside rival right from the start, held his rail position throughout, met rivals bid in stretch and gamely drew off. MONCHICHI
chased dueling pair down the backstretch along the rail, entered turn in two path, entered stretch in the three path and rallied well splitting rivals. MET AT
THE DANCE dueled outside of rival throughout the backstretch, entered turn head and head with rival two wide, entered stretch in the two path and could
not match strides with inside rival, tiring and lugging in late in the stretch, to lose second late. UNTAPPED POTENTIAL broke in and bumped foe, settled
back of the pack in the four path, entered turn being asked for run and outside rival three wide, entered stretch in four path, and had no response late.
NANA SHILA bumped by rival at the start, settled in back of the pack, stayed in back along the turn two wide, entered stretch in two path and fell

entered turn three wide while making up ground, angled inside of rival approaching the stretch, and finished willingly under steady urging. SHADOW OP
broke very well and dueled rival on backstretch, entered turn two wide while head and head with rival, entered stretch in the three path, and had no
response and finished a weakening third. YODELERS WAY lacked speed from the gate, stayed in back throughout the early stages, stayed on rail
throughout and had no response when asked in stretch.
