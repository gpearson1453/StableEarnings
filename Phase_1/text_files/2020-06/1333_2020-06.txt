Footnotes
UNCLE CHUCK broke a bit slowly, quickly sprinted to the front, set the pace inside, responded when challenged on the backstretch, edged away on the
second turn and drew off under a steady hand ride. BIG MEL had speed between horses then stalked outside a rival, bid between foes on the backstretch
then fell back some a half mile out, went three deep leaving the second turn, angled in some into the stretch and was clearly second best. BIG CHEDDAR
three deep into the first turn, stalked outside then bid three wide midway on the backstretch, battled outside the winner leaving the backstretch, continued off
the rail on the second turn and weakened but held third. UNCLE ADDOUMA four wide into the first turn, angled in on that bend and saved ground stalking
the pace, dropped back on the second turn and weakened. PERSEVERANCE pulled early, stalked a bit off the rail then inside, dropped back into and on
the second turn, came out a bit in the stretch, gave way and was eased in the final furlong.

GOING TO VEGAS fanned out some into the first turn, chased outside a rival, advanced three deep midway on the second turn and into the stretch, took
the lead outside rivals nearing midstretch and kicked clear under a couple left handed cracks of the whip and steady handling. TOO MUCH HEAVEN drifted
out into the first turn, stalked a bit off the rail, bid between foes into the stretch and was clearly second best. A THOUSAND DREAMS saved ground stalking
the pace, waited off heels leaving the second turn, came out into the stretch and got up for the show three deep on the line. SAVVY GAL angled in and
dueled inside, inched clear on the second turn, fought back into the stretch and was edged for third between foes late. WHITE VELVET chased outside a
rival then a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled to the inside and put in a late bid at a minor award. MADAME BOURBON tugged some and chased a bit off
the rail then inside, came out on the second turn and three deep into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FLYING BUSINESS had speed between
horses then angled in and stalked inside to the stretch and weakened. LOVELY LILIA three deep early, dueled outside a rival, dropped back between foes
on the second turn, gave way and was eased in the stretch.

nearing the sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed late under urging. CONQUEST COBRA pulled along the inside then took back leaving the first turn and
came out, re-bid between horses on the backstretch, took a short lead on the second turn, found the rail into the stretch, fought back along the fence under
urging through the drive then had the rider lose the whip just before the wire. BLAME IT ON KITTY between horses early, stalked outside a rival then three
deep, bid for wide leaving the second turn and into the stretch and bested the others. INCREDIBLE LUCK three wide early, stalked between foes then bid
three deep on the backstretch and three wide between foes on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. UNO DANCER
angled in and dueled outside the runner-up, inched away briefly and angled in early on the backstretch, dueled inside, fell back leaving the second turn and
also weakened.

Footnotes
FULL ECLIPSE pressed the pace three deep then stalked three wide on the turn, re-bid four wide into the stretch, inched away under urging while drifting in
and proved best. SUEZAAANA dueled between horses then stalked between foes on the turn, bid again three wide into the stretch, also drifted in some and
just held second. KIRSCH TRUFFLE saved ground stalking the pace throughout and was edged for the place. POLAR ROUTE stalked between horses then
off the rail into and on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. REDS TRIBAL HEART chased outside on the backstretch and
turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. DADDYS REAL DIVA stalked the pace outside rivals then alongside a foe
on the turn, also entered the stretch three wide, drifted in a bit and did not rally. CSABA MOMMA had speed between horses then stalked between foes,
continued a bit off the rail into and on the turn, steadied off heels in upper stretch and weakened. MARCI THE GREAT broke a bit slowly, settled outside a
rival then off the rail on the turn and was not a threat. ELEMENTAL sped to the early lead, dueled a bit off the rail, inched away on the turn, fought back just
off the fence into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch then drifted inward in midstretch and weakened. TENGA'S JUBILEE angled in and saved ground off
the pace, continued inside on the turn and into the stretch and had nothing left for the drive.
