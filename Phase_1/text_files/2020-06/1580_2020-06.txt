to prevail. UNITY slow early circled out on the far turn racing six wide to upper stretch bidding late abreast foe being outfinished. J W RUCKUS advanced on
the backside rallying clear on the far turn, extending inside down the lane would cede to wide pressure. SCIENCE TO WIN hustled out set the pace through
the backside, overtaken on the far turn would weaken in the six path. WANT saved ground giving a mild bid in upper stretch finishing evenly in the two path.

NOBODY MOVE stalked the pace rallying to wrest the lead on the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch drawing out in the four path. ORE PASS slow early
responded on the far turn giving steady surge near mid track down the lane finishing as a clear second best. TITOCHIP a step slow through the backside
gave minor response from the eighth pole needing much more. BALTIMORE COUNTY hustled out pressured the pace leading on the backside dueling
through the far turn wilting in upper stretch. THE PREZ pressed the pace for half a mile then gave way on the far turn. BLAME THE KIDS had no response.
