Footnotes
KARMA KING pressed the pace in the three path around the first turn, took the lead down the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, vied inside
at around the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, continued to battled inside of foes and dug in gamely to prevail. NICOLE MUNNINGS set the early pace
along the rail, settled back into a stalking position down the backstretch, angled three wide near the quarter pole, re-rallied outside and just missed. THE
KAHN tracked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, lacked the needed rally but outfinished foes for the show. DONE
ACTING settled off the pace along the inside, came through an opening at the rail in upper stretch and rallied mildly. HAPPY WANDERER prompted the
pace four wide around the first turn, bid outside of the winner early on the backstretch, dueled outside of that foe to upper stretch and weakened. MEILLEUR
chased the pace four and five wide and lacked a closing bid. ALLEGIANCE had his head turned at the start and played no factor while racing three wide.

BIG MONEY MACHINE stalked the pace inside, knifed between rivals near the half-mile pole, bid inside of the pacesetter, took the lead nearing the far turn,
vied inside around the bend, was headed in upper stretch, battled back to a clear lead near the sixteenth pole and just withstood the late charge of the
runner-up. HIGH ROLLING DUDE settled well off the pace outside, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed determinedly and just missed.
PERFETTO was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace three wide, reached even terms around the far turn, led outside of the winner in upper stretch but
was turned back inside the eighth pole. ZITMAN lagged well back inside, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. DAS DA ONE set the
pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. GUERRERON failed to menace while racing two wide. ENGLISH LAUGHTER was off a step slow, played no
factor while racing three and four wide. BRANDT had brief speed inside.

SISTER AURORA set the pace inside, drew off around the turn, drifted out a bit in the lane and held well clear under a hand drive. DIRECTOR'S CUT was
bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and finished willingly to be clearly second best. J'S SILKY was bumped between foes at the start, had early
speed outside of the winner, could not keep pace with that foe around the turn and held well enough for the show. GOLD COUNTRY bumped at the start,
saved ground and never threatened. FUNWHILEITLASTED failed to menace while racing three wide. RIDE LIKE A GIRL was outrun inside. INDY FRONT
played no factor while racing four wide. CLOUD BREAK had brief speed three wide.

LADY BREANNA pressed the pace two wide, kicked clear near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted a bit into the lane , repulsed a bid from the runner-up in
upper stretch and re-cleared under a moderate drive. CHOLLA stalked the pace three wide, was floated out mildly turning for home, bid in upper stretch but
was no match for the winner. DARLINDIVA set the pace along the rail, vied inside of the winner from the five-eighths pole past the three-eighths marker,
weakened inside but lasted for the show. DENVER raced well back under a drive around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and passed tiring
rivals. BLAZING BROOKE was up close inside while rank around the first turn, chased inside and came up empty. SPEEDING STARLET played no factor
while racing two wide. LAPULGA was off slow and outrun while racing three and four wide. NIGHTSTORM was outrun while racing two and three wide. The
rider of CHOLLA claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference nearing the three-sixteenths pole but the Stewards found no reason to alter the
original order of finish.

Footnotes
SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL set the pace off the pace, drew clear and angled further out to race in three and four paths around the turn and held well clear
under a drive. RIDGELYSREDHOT had early speed widest, chased the winner from the four path around the turn and was clearly second best. BAD PAY
had early speed between foes, angled to the rail when the winner cleared nearing the turn, chased inside and lacked a rally. DYNAPOWER failed to
menace while racing two wide. PALACES DIAMOND chased the pace two wide between foes and faded. TIZNOISE played no factor while racing four wide.
TENERIFE MOON was outrun inside. PRISMATIC trailed well off the rail. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL ORB raced off the early pace inside, made a rail bid leaving the three-eighths pole, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, drew off and
held well clear under moderate urging. EYE ON THE FINISH raced off the pace outside, made progress four and five wide around the turn and finished well
to be a clear second. LADY AND ME lacked early speed, raced four wide and rallied for the show. STAMINA PRINCESS was bumped at the start, saved
ground around the turn and rallied mildly. MISS MARIS stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. GIFTED PATH set the pace in the three
path and retreated around the turn. MERMAID KISSES pressed the early pace inside, led briefly in the two path midway around the turn but soon caved.
BOURBON TRACE was outrun while racing two wide. ELUSIVE AURA chased the pace three and was through after a half. LONG STORY SHORT played
no factor while racing three wide. WICKED WITCH was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened.
