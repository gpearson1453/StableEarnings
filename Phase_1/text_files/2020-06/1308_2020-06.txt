Footnotes
INK SPLOTZ contended for the command as the widest of three on the backstretch, edged away coming up to the half mile and after clearing sufficiently so
cut over to the inside route, showed the way coaxed along on a continuously-growing advantage, shifted out towards path two under a drive heading for the
top of the lane, departed the eighth pole still in possession of a healthy advantage, saw it cut into substantially by the runner up but had enough at the end
to preserve the decision. YANKEE EMPIRE was under some hand encouragement on the backstretch to get going, underwent a two to three wide pursuit
prior to angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths marker, wound up in the five path a furlong later, gained steadily on the winner in the last eighth. BREES
BAYOU along the rail arguing as the innermost of a threesome for the majority of the initial split, loosely drafted behind the top one during the run around
the bend, went out three wide for the drive home, mustered up a mild response to lay claim to the show award. TRI SAINT LORENZO settled into midpack
after the start, got guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, stayed put to the end of the bend, was put to urging spinning into the stretch, proceeded down
it mostly three wide, not offering enough of a closing punch to make an impact. WARFRONT FIGHTER raced two to three wide on the turn, was
maneuvered outward during the stretch run until about seven wide, gained some but without posing a threat. VERIFY two wide in pursuit of the front runners
on the turn, lacked the needed response. EAGLES PALACE appeared to lose his footing springing from the starting gate, travelled in the three path making
its way on the bend, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, came up empty. POINT OF HUMOR left the backstretch from the two path after disputing
the pace from between rivals, was teamed up with the second place finisher to its inside in pursuit of an unattended IBNK SPLOTZ, got moved out
approximately four wide into the stretch, gave out.

Footnotes
STAGE LEFT five paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to apply pressure to
the front through the latter portion of the bend, took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive through to the finish to
prevail. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD bumped at the start by WHO'S IN CHARGE who broke inwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CAVARADOSSI five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position in the stretch. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS bobbled at the break and recovered
under hustling to take up command shortly after, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, came under
increasing pressure to the outside through the turn, swung two to three wide for home and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened through to
the finish. PROMO CODE chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals in the drive.
TAPIZEARANCE seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, swung six wide
into upper stretch and tired. BLACKTOP LEGEND six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under a ride at
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, tired and was placed to a protective hold through the final sixteenth, got quickly pulled up after the
finish, the rider dismounting, then was walked off under his own power. WHO'S IN CHARGE broke in at the start bumping VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD, chased
six wide down the backstretch and through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued six wide for home, folded, and was eased through the
final furlong.

Footnotes
VENTUS an early pace contestant, was allowed to ease back into a stalking role, departed the backstretch towards the two path, hitched up to COOLBOY
to apply pressure on that opponent as the half was being completed, turned into the lane on near even terms with the previously-mentioned foe, responded
when asked for more run in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, emerged in control a sixteenth late, held well late to stay in the clear. DR. DEVERA'S
WAY cut over towards the inside after the start, tracked the front runners while spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got called upon angling five wide
for the drive home, narrowed in, had the pilot lost the whip in the general area of the eighth pole, narrowed in nevertheless en route for the place.
DANGEROUS EDGE made it over towards the inside route by the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch on the pace, got sent outward for the stretch
run, eventually winding up in the six path by midstretch, displayed some late foot rallying for third. COOLBOY sparred for the top from the two path, felt
some pressure from the top one beginning from around midpoint on the turn, yielded when put to the test by that rival at the three-sixteenths pole,
weakened in the last eighth. KADENS COURAGE took up the chase from the two path on the turn, swung into the lane and lacked the needed response.
LUXURY SUITE was spotted bringing up the back of the pack after the start, glided over to the rail at the half mile pole, began to flash some life a short
distance from the end of the bend, stepped into the stretch and made up some real estate, tipped out for the final sixteenth and made some headway.
MANDATORY PAYOUT saved ground on the turn to no avail. PRINCIPAL DANCER travelled two to three wide on the turn, angled into path four for the
drive home, gave way. SOUL FIGHT sighted in path two at the midway point of the turn, was in the five path by midstretch. FUTURE BOOK vied for control
from along the inside for the opening half, faltered steadily after entering the lane, was taken hold and allowed to fade away at the eighth pole then was
walked off the track without need of outside assistance after being pulled up quickly past the finish line.

Footnotes
CREED three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, advanced five wide through the turn under light coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took over
command at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive kept to task. COUSIN ANDREW vied five then four wide
with a trio to his inside, steadily emerged with command briefly midway on the turn before being placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths when displaced
from the front, swung four then three wide straightened away for home, weakened in the final eighth proving no match for the top one while well clear of the
rest and second best. AJHAR bobbled at the start recovering inwards bumping with UNCLE MOONLIGHT which in turn caused that rival to shy inwards and
lean on a rival after the start causing some jostling among the inner quartet, vied four then three wide until shaken off seven-sixteenths from home, faded
through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, came again to secure the show honors when weakening to the finish to a lesser degree than some of
his rivals. UNCLE MOONLIGHT bumped at the start by AJHAR, shied in leaning on CRITICAL REVIEW and pinching that foe in concert with
OWNITIFYOUWANTIT against pressure inside from DEE JAY, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide
into upper stretch and tired. DEE JAY brushed the near side stall at the start then came outwards under correction and bumped and leaned on
OWNITIFYOUWANTIT pinching that foe against CRITICAL REVIEW and pressure outside from UNCLE MOONLIGHT, vied among a quartet from the two
path down the backstretch through to the midway point on the turn, spun just off the inside for home and tired. OWNITIFYOUWANTIT bumped between foes
and lightly pinched after the start, vied three wide between rivals among a quartet down the backstretch, continued to knock heads disputing the front until
near the midway point on the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. CRITICAL REVIEW broke out a step then
got bumped between foes and pinched after the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went six to
seven wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
ALANDRA sparred for the top from the two path, came under a ride heading home, responded and edged away. SARATOGA AFFAIR along the inside, vied
with the winner for the lead, was set down approaching the quarter pole, got shaken off during the stretch run. TONAL VISION the widest of all throughout,
underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, got sent out six wide entering the stretch, rallied for the show. KANSAS KIS sat in path two within range of the
contested pace, got let loose spinning into the lane, lacked the needed response. LOVE OF MY HEART chased the pace three wide, swung into the lane
under urging, weakened in the final sixteenth. MASTER OF HOPE remained the trailer after breaking the tardiest, inched its way over to the rail at the half
mile pole, took a four wide stroll into the stretch, was not asked for any run but instead was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
FACTORING two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to that station, dug in and held safe to prevail. CAPE COD DIVA four then three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied inside the final furlong to latch on the aforementioned foe as
she hit the wire while clear of the rest and along second best. TERPEYE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. MERLINS MUSE chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for
home, weakened in the stretch. WINGS OF FURY chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. TELETYPE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and yielded nearing the eighth pole, tired through to the finish. MAKIN' OUT lunged at the start and got away to
a tangled beginning conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
five to six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. CARLISLE BELLE four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, lost her action taking
short strides near the nine-sixteenths and was quickly placed to a protective hold, guided to the outside and eased up to a walk, then got escorted by
outrider off the course and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
OUR LAST BUCK away without apparent mishap, attained a forward position, was rated in the two path showing the way, shadowed by the runner up,
himself one path farther off the rail, continued onward under the same set up all the way to the end of the bend, got driven three wide into the lane, rapidly
extended the margin after CHESTERTOWN swerved out sharply in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, then maintained that advantage the rest of the
trip home. CHESTERTOWN in the three path contending for the top against the winner, was being tipped wider getting cued up for the stretch run, ducked
out several paths in the vicinity of three-sixteenths pole, resulting in the top one lengthening away, chased that opponent futilely thereafter, had no difficulty
salvaging second. DANNY CALIFORNIA pinched at the start, went over to the rail, secured the show off the ground-saving journey that followed. RUN FOR
BOSTON sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, made no headway. KID D'ORO chased the
pace from the three path in midpack, swung slightly wider into the lane, lacked the needed response. YANKEE DIVISION strung out three wide on the turn,
folded. BEG TO DIFFER parked out four wide on the turn, gave way.

VALUE ENGINEERING three wide through the opening bend, raced three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, tipped out five wide into the far turn
before being placed to brief coaxing angled inside to the two or three path five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied coming
inwards and bumped with TIDE OF THE SEA inside the eighth pole when seizing command, continued to lean inwards and was corrected inside the final
sixteenth, dug in to prevail gamely on the wire. TIDE OF THE SEA dueled in hand three then two wide with MILITIAMAN to his inside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over command inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was
bumped by the aforementioned foe coming inwards when coming out very slightly inside the eighth pole and was headed for command, battled on and was
ultimately repelled to the finish. NO WORD bobbled at the start, recovered to track the pace along the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and ran on to secure the show honors. MR. ALEC brushed the near side stall at the start, raced three wide
through the first turn before settling three to four wide in range of the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was let out swinging five wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive making mild headway when forced to steady nearing the sixteenth marker as VALUE ENGINEERING and TIDE OF THE
SEA came together directly in front, lost some momentum as a result before preserving the last major share. MINI P (IRE) was under a hard hold through
the first turn just off the inside and off the heels of a rival, settled three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and offered
up a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move through the final furlong weakening in the late stages. LIFE ON TOP two to three
wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position through the drive.
MILITIAMAN dueled in hand from the two path with TIDE OF THE SEA to his outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, yielded with about three-sixteenths remaining and weakened. CAPTAIN HARDSHIP three wide through the first turn, raced three to four wide in
pursuit from mid pack coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KUMAR chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. TANKERVILLE chased along the inside under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, made no impact. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Jockey's Objection
by the rider of TIDE OF THE SEA alleging interference against VALUE ENGINEERING in the stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the
result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

MORETTI established control after brushing with SIR WINSTON in the shadow of the starting gate, was rated along on a loosely-contested lead showing
the way while going about between the inside route and the two path, was towards the former on the clubhouse bend and the backstretch and more the
latter on the far turn, got called upon for more approaching the quarter pole, settled in once more near the rail in upper stretch and drew off smartly. SIR
WINSTON took up position in the pocket after brushing with both halves of uncoupled stablemates, was patiently ridden keeping an eye on the winner, close
by but not close by enough to apply any serious pressure, was let out a notch tipping to the outside coming up to the half mile pole, wound up approximately
four wide a furlong down the road, crept up, was put a drive for the drive home, shifted inward, proved no match. EXPERT stalked the winner from the two
path, was content to draft behind that foe during the run around the second bend, inched to the rail in time to cut the corner into the lane, lost out on place
honors to SIR WINSTON. ROCKETRY two wide early, swung three wide onto the backstretch, was moved out into path five after entering the far turn, came
about as wide into the stretch, had no rally. YOU'RE TO BLAME strung out four wide on the first turn, was one path closer to the rail on the subsequent one,
gave way. ADVENTIST underwent a two wide journey to the quarter pole, was fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch to no avail. PROMPT along
the inside route to the head of the stretch, had no offering. LEGIT raced two wide after making light contact with the second place finisher soon after the field
had been released, found itself along the overland route on the far turn, went into the stretch and was allowed to fade away. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE hung
out three wide on both turns, folded.

prevail inching away at the end. WOMEN NOT EASY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper

for the place honors. MAGICAL ROMANCE bumped at the start by MOPOLKA who broke inwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. MOPOLKA broke in at the start bumping MAGICAL

five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MOLLY'S NIGHTHAWK four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked two to three wide from the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and passed tired foes in the stretch.
