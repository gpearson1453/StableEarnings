leader in the final yards to prevail. HOMERS MAGIC gained to contention on the turn looming into upper stretch, drifted in outside the eighth pole wresting
the lead edging clear while ending up on the rail being grabbed late. HOWARD OF LUCK away alertly pressured the pace dueling all out through the turn
into upper stretch wearing down there in the two path. ECHO ALPHA SIX hustled along bid hard three deep on the turn, had weakened when cut off
steadying briefly outside the eighth pole finishing with little left. QUEENS DUDE tracked evenly then faded near mid track in upper stretch. WALLET sent
hard dueled all out through the turn then wilted on the rail the final eighth. KENTUCKY PEERLESS was never involved. KOLTEN'S COURT stumbled at the
break. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ECHO ALPHA SIX AGAINST THE RIDER OF HOMERS MAGIC FOR INTERFERENCE OUTSIDE THE
EIGHTH POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

SHACKLEFORDS STORM broke sharply to clear the field, threatened somewhat near the quarter pole would move out in upper stretch under mostly hand
urging to win going away. ALL ABOUT READY stalked the pace going all out in pursuit near the quarter pole, was quickly dispatched by the winner in upper
stretch holding on for place near mid track. TROUBLE X TWO raced evenly throughout lacking a contending move. BLUEGRASS BALL was always a step
slow. CONFECTION FORTUNE stumbled leaving the gate staying back after.

RING THE BELLA stalked the pace looming outside of rival into upper stretch being put to a stiff drive surging clear in the final yards. SOUTHERN BLOOD
away alertly set the pace through the turn widening along the inside in upper stretch digging in late to no avail. GRAN TOGOSHI slow early rallied along the
inside into upper stretch, was forced to steady at the eighth pole regrouping to split horses and finish well. WILD ROAD chased the pace to upper stretch
extending in the three path there weakening late. GATTO ROSSO hustled along pursued through the turn wearing down near mid track in upper stretch.
GOVERNOR MACHEN slow early was never involved. CONFISCATE pressed the early pace then faded to upper stretch. DA VINCI'S VISION was always
outrun racing nine wide through the lane. BARAVELLI gave way on the turn.

PLEASANT BUFFY stalked the pace rallying from the turn to go clear in upper stretch drifted from the two path to the rail under right hand urging holding
firm late. ISTAN ROSE pressured the pace wresting the lead on the turn, was collared and put in close at the head of the lane ceding on the rail angling out
a bit securing place. SHARPIN pressed and chased through the turn, had weakened in upper stretch mustering enough to hold the others safe. A GIRL HAS
NO NAME bobbled rushing from the gate managed to make the lead then wavered giving way on the turn racing evenly down the which was enough to hold
the rest. TWO STEP DANCER raced second flight never reaching contention. HEY FUNNY was never involved. LOVE THAT CHICK showed little. DIXIE
RED outrun early would tire. WICKED KISSER retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
GRAN CITY broke sharply setting the pace holding daylight to upper stretch digging in near the rail holding clear. YES DARLIN stalked the pace giving
chase to upper stretch extending late in the two and three paths vying willingly to the end. MOONBOUNCE stalked the pace racing inside to upper stretch
finishing evenly in the two path. LAST WOODMAN tracked evenly through the turn angling four wide in upper stretch hanging late. STERLING REBEL
played no factor. DUBULL was never involved. ONE FLASHY CAT veered then was in close at the break, rushed on the turn would flatten out in upper
stretch. RUOTE was always outrun.
