Footnotes
NOBLE JEWEL got set up in the two path proceeding towards the conclusion of the backstretch, sat on hold within range of the three front runners
contending with each other for the top, got cued up for the drive home, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane for the best of racing room, clawed
her way up to the ones to catch, got engaged with DOLL in a late duel, came up the victor. DOLL cut over into the pocket late on the backstretch, had a
good view of the ongoing pace dispute, came under stronger handling angling to the outside as the half was being reeled, was worked into path four during
the first half of the stretch run, struck the front just inside the eighth pole, failed to shake loose and was instead pounced upon by the top one, vied, yielded,
saved second. TEMPERANCE went over to the rail shortly after the start, argued as the innermost of a threesome for control for the nearly a half, was the
first of that grouping to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring just shy of the quarter pole, had the runner up become the main threat by the furlong
grounds, relinquished for good with just under a furlong to go, weakened into the show slot. QUASAR went over to the rail at the half mile pole, rode it
stepping into the lane, narrowed in when asked for more, was angled out four wide with approximately a sixteenth to go, mustered up some late energy to
nail the last major check. TRADEABLE took up position in midpack, kept watch on the pace, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got taken to the
outside for the drive, wound up the neighborhood of path five by midstretch, lacked a solid closing punch. HEARTSTRINGS pursued the pace from the two
path, shifted out six wide once into the stretch, made no impact. SHANNON'S GIRL abandoned the rail for the two path at the top of the turn, commenced
the stretch one path wider, came up empty. ITSAKEYPER disputed the pace from path two in between rivals for a half before giving way. MOON OVER
VICTORIA fought for the top from path three as the outermost of three for almost a half, folded.

RODERICK coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with BERHANU to his inside, took over command at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three
wide for home, got roused just inside the three-sixteenths, went clear under a light drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. ZIPPY BABY
coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under light coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. BERHANU coaxed from the start, dueled to the inside of RODERICK from the get go, got
headed at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BUSTIN BIEBER three then two wide in pursuit, tucked inside placed
to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered along the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CIVIL UNION underwent a three wide journey until the end of the second bend, got switched over to a drive coming up to the quarter pole, was moved out
one path wider stepping onto the head of stretch, took off in earnest in a quest for the top, fought on tenaciously, inching up with every stride, wore down a
stubborn BLAME DEBBIE in the final seventy yards, then dug in gamely to preserve the decision. CAP DE CREUS remained in the two path after the field
had been sent off and running, proceeded along in an unhurried manner and would remain so until the stretch drive, got called upon, gained ground on a
wall of three equines, tipped out a few paths with just under a sixteenth to go, then took off with good energy, fell short. BLAME DEBBIE a half length the
quickest out of the gate, cleared to rail with advantage shortly after crossing the finish line for the initial turn, was content to yield the front end to
WHATDOESASHARKSAY at the top of the clubhouse bend, got steered out into the path two and went to loosely draft behind the new leader until the
conclusion of the backstretch, closed the gap during the run around the far turn, was put to a drive spinning into the lane, forged to the front by the start of
the final furlong, relinquished reluctantly in deep stretch, stayed on well to salvage the show. WHATDOESASHARKSAY grabbed away control from BLAME
DEBBIE heading for the end of the homestretch, tucked into the path two, showed the way mildly pressed all the way to the half mile pole, got guided over
to the rail at that station, had the earlier-mentioned rival crank up the pressure, came under a ride by the five-sixteenths pole, got reeled in upper stretch,
vied on vigourously before weakening late. SEEKING REVENGE strung out three wide on the first turn, was worked over to the rail by the half mile pole,
kept an eye on the pace from the back of the pack, got cued up angling to the outside heading home, wound up five wide by the completion of the
maneuver, made no headway. SETTING THE MOOD took the inside route, was roused springing from the three-eighths pole, went into the lane and
faltered.

Footnotes
BEBE BANKER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide from just off the pace, took over command near the five-sixteenths and came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, went clear under a drive to prevail. VITESSE chased along the inside, briefly steadied inside the
three-eighths when placed in tight as CHARGE AHEAD drifted inwards, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the place honors. ONESHOTATFOREVER chased four to five wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. VARANGIAN broke in at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three
wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. MORE THAN STRIKING coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from CHARGE AHEAD, to the outside, shook off that rival near the midway point on the turn and
came under coaxing when headed for command at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. KING OF AMERICAN
devoid of any early speed, chased three then two wide detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper
stretch and was unable to make an impact. DUBLIN GREEN chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under
coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. CHARGE AHEAD pressed the pace from the two path coming under
coaxing near the three-eighths when in the midst of getting shaken off, faded forcing VITESSE to briefly steady on the rail when drifting in, swung three to
four wide for home, folded, and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
MAD MUNNYS grabbed the advantage after appearing to come away in good order, cut over to the inside, showed the way, pressed by the second place
finisher to the outside, saw each of the pace contestants get called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, bravely clung to the lead the
rest of the way to the eighth pole, had already started to come out at that station then went on come out more readily when fed some left side stick work,
saw QUARKY compliantly shift wider too, traded leans with the nemesis in the final strides, dug in gamely to prevail. QUARKY went at it with the winner
from the early stages onward, was in path two forcing the issue during the run around the bend, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and got switched over
to stronger handling, was induced to head towards the middle of the course once the top one began his wayward ways in midstretch, saw the twosome lean
lightly on each other twice in deep stretch, fought on with distinction, but ended up denied. MORNING BREEZ sent over to the rail in rapid order, stayed put
for a half, angled into the two path for the drive home, narrowed in, eventually splitting rivals right around the eighth pole en route for third. MONTAUK
DADDY taken in hand after breaking rightward with its initial step, spotted the competition a head start in the neighborhood of two lengths, rejoined the
others after being hand urged, vacated the inside route tor the two path at the top of the bend, went one wider for entrance into the stretch, failed to make
an impact. WAR TOCSIN sneaked his way into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed in range of the front runners, cut the
corner under a drive, came up empty. JAKE ROCKS firmly rated in the two path during the opening phases, commenced the stretch from path three,
weakened. CUCINA strung out three wide midpoint on the turn, was in the six path by the eighth pole, in each instance being the widest of all, trailed almost
throughout.

Footnotes
LOVELY LUCKY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a
drive rallying under an off sided stick to issue a challenge through the final furlong, had the rider lose the handle on the whip nearing the sixteenth marker
when switching it to the near side, took command at that station, dug in under threat being shown a right hand to the finish and prevailed gamely by a
whisker. SENGEKONTACKET tracked the pace along the inside in aim of the front, remained patiently handled until angled out five wide into upper stretch
set down for the drive, rallied with good energy to threaten for it all late but just missed at the end. COME STORMING forwardly placed just off the inside in
closest range of the leader, got let out swinging four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong out dug in under threat from a flanking
trio and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to safely secure the show honors. TILSA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, battled on
to the sixteenth pole before being shaken off in the late stages. CHECKSANDBALANCES (IRE) crossed from the outside to the two path near the
seven-eighths pole and forced both JASMINESQUE and CHEROKEE SONG to be steadied and checked, pulled on the bit before settling midway down the
backstretch, continued just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch making some
headway, then came up empty in the drive. CHAMPAGNE DIET three to four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from
home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. CHEROKEE SONG pulled early on under restraint
along the inside and was forced to steady seven furlongs from home off the heels of CHECKSANDBALANCES, as that foe crossed in front at that station,
tipped two then three wide, came under coaxing briefly at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. JASMINESQUE three
wide in pursuit, got forced to check near the seven-eighths as CHECKSANDBALANCES tucked in front, remained three wide through the far turn coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. LADY COMMISSIONER four wide early on, tucked to the two path
six furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and trailed. Due to a timer malfunction the
final time was corrected.

Footnotes
WEDONTBELIEVEHER wound up towards the back of the pack after the start, stepped onto the turn from the two path and was put to encouragement,
angled six wide coming into the lane, kicked into her best with a sixteenth remaining, wore down OUR LADY OF LORETO, herself on the wrong lead, to
earn the verdict. OUR LADY OF LORETO sailed along unopposed in the two path, drew out to her largest lead traversing around the turn, stepped into the
lane, saw the others closing in, hobbling along on the wrong lead, got caught in deep stretch and had to settle for second. STUNNING MUNNINGS
underwent a three wide pursuit, was in the same path entering the stretch, finished well enough to be along for the show. TOUCH OF NIRVANA came in
slightly after losing her footing at the start, chased the loose leader from path two on the turn, shifted inward in time to cut the corner into the stretch,
flattened out. GIPSEY SORCERESS faltered off a ground-saving trip. HOT LITTLE HONEY four wide onto the turn, was as wide exiting it, gave way.
BELLA INVASION saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
BREDENBURY (IRE) three then two wide in closest pursuit of the leader, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing
the eighth pole, inched away under a drive kept to task. SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) three to four wide in pursuit, advanced through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied coming inwards despite a corrective near sided stick placing some rivals lightly in
tight near the just inside the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. MISS J MCKAY four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to secure the show honors. NOTORIOUS R B G chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got let out spinning three wide
into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. CHILI PETIN established the front and showed the way in hand two to three wide down
the backstretch before tucking along the inside through the turn, got roused spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and capitulated near
the eighth pole, battled on weakening late and drifted out in the final strides forcing GOGO SHOES to be taken in hand near the finish. GOGO SHOES three
to four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home, rallied and was in a bit tight between foes just inside the eighth pole, knocked heads with a pair until the final strides when forced to be steadied in
the last jumps as CHILI PETIN came out late. LADY FATIMA saved ground in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide for home and offered no response. COFACTOR four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch, lost her lane as NOTORIOUS R B G tipped out a furlong out and was paused in behind, then weakened to the
finish. CALL ON MISCHIEF chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, got steadied in tight along the
inside just inside the eighth pole before weakening to the finish.

ZIPALONG took up the chase from the three path for three-quarters, swung out one path wider entering the turn, closed in with good energy, took charge in
the final sixteenth and kicked clear. BRICCO strung out in the four path travelling on the first bend, continued from well off the inside on the backstretch,
stepped onto the far turn still stationed in path four, moved closer and closer to the rail while moving closer and closer to the ones to catch, got cut loose for
the drive home, wrested away the advantage at the furlong grounds, put up resistance before releasing the top for good with less than an eighth to go,
stayed on well to save second. K. K. ICHIKAWA rated in the pocket keeping watch on the pace for the opening six furlongs, was asked to pick it up angling
to the outside from the five-sixteenths marker, would up in the neighborhood of path five when done, rallied down the center of the course to secure the
show. SHARED SUCCESS encountered additional trouble after striking the right side of the starting gate, bobbling and then bumping with another soon
afterwards, assumed a prominent position, stalked the pace from the two path, cleared to the front end and over to the rail at the top of turn two, was himself
reeled in at the furlong grounds, weakened after relinquishing. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE four wide on each bend, closed ground during the stretch run, albeit
without ever menacing. YAH HUH chased the pace from the three path for the opening three-quarters, tucked into path two late on the second bend and
was still there entering the stretch, lacked the needed response. GOLCONDA took up position along the inside route, slipped by a fading rival after
completing six furlongs, got steered out five wide for the drive, rallied mildly. TRUE PALACE parked out towards path five on the first turn, was down in the
three path making its way on the subsequent one, tipped out five wide for the drive home, made no impact. FALSE ALARM bumped with SHARED
SUCCESS after bobbling at the start, underwent a two wide journey to the head of the stretch, between rivals early, backed away after spinning into the
lane. MR. FIDGET running for purse money only, was sighted in path in reserve, never reached a contending position. HURRICANE ANDREW strung out
four wide heading for the backstretch, was in the five path exiting it, folded. LIAMS MAJESTY broke through the gate, cantered off a sixteenth before reeled
in by an outrider and brought back, proceeded to come away cleanly and on the lead, showed the way from along the inside route, yielded shortly after
entering the turn and steadily retreated afterwards.
