Footnotes
DYNAMO KID stalked the pace off the inside, advanced on the leader turning for home, bid upper stretch, wore that same rival down under steady handling.
NO QUARTER broke alertly, set the pace inside, maintained a daylight advantage turn, dueled with the winner upper stretch and past the furlong marker,
could not match strides with that rival late, well clear for the place. FAITH'S RACEDAY lacked speed along the inside, came out a bit to float out a couple of
rivals turning into the stretch, brushed then was in turn floated in by GRAND PRIORITY soon after, continued to drop to the rail, staged a mild rally to annex
the show. IN A BIND within striking distance inside, in a bit tight along the fence exiting the turn, was straightened, moved out a bit upper straight, lugged out
further forcing GRAND PRIORITY out into YES BAB and causing both of those foes to check up, was straightened once more to finish up evenly. MY PAL
JAC off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight off the inside, closest to the top two entering the stretch, tired in the run to the wire. GRAND
PRIORITY back off the pace just off the inside, floated out turning into the stretch, bothered, checked up a furlong out to lose all chance. YES BAB off a step
slow, raced back and outside, floated out leaving the turn, checked up with a furlong remaining. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
GRAND PRIORITY AGAINST FAITH'S RACEDAY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN AND AGAINST IN A BIND FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SIXTH.

MY KIKI away in good order, pressed early while racing outside, dueled through the turn in the two path, between rivals into the lane, kicked strongly clear
under steady handling. TOTALLY GRACE broke sharp, set the early pace, dueled inside the winner through the turn and into the lane, proved no match for
that rival the final furlong, remained well clear for the place. STEPH'S SPIRIT chased the top two throughout, no threat to that pair in the drive, remained
clear of the others. GLORYS LEIDY BELLA broke toward the back and behind the top two, turned in an even effort off the inside. MISCHIEF GIRL one
paced off the inside, lacked a serious response. KAITLYN'S COURT last away, failed to menace. AUDACIOUS GIRL made little impact. SHOP AROUND
trailed throughout in showing little.

DE LAST DANCE closest to the leader off the inside, engaged that one from the outside nearing the furlong marker, edged clear. DOUBLE DOWN BRITT
dwelt at the start, advanced along the inside turn, steered out to be widest for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the place in the final stride. GLADYS'
FRONTIER broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner with a furlong
remaining then could not keep up, nipped late for the place position. OUR DIAMOND went evenly while racing off the insidce. SASSY MALLORY went one
paced in failing to threaten. JUST A BANDIT settled off the early pace, backed up through the stretch. CHAMPAGNE MOMENT back off the pace,
shortened stride in apparent distress midway on the turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
TUMBADORA broke alertly, was clear out of the chute, continued to show the way by daylight up the backstretch while off the inside, three path into the
lane, not threatened through the stretch while kept to task. LADY CARLOS settled off the pace, saved some ground through the turn, along for the second
spot while not a threat to the winner. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA chased the winner off the inside, could do little with that rival in the drive, lost the place position
late, enough left to save the show. DOUBLE RED broke back, lacked speed, off the inside for the drive, slowly gaining for the show late. DESTINY
TWILIGHT last away, trailed for over a half, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHOCKIN settled off the pace and the inside,
raced four wide through the turn, had little for the stretch run. LABRUNA remained always back. PREMIE BABY forwardly placed in the early going, stopped
before a half, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
WINNING ROMANCE broke sharp, with the pace into and through the turn, between foes turning for home, kicked well clear the final furloing. PLATINUM
QUEEN forwardly placed while racing outside, moved closer three wide to briefly challenge on the outside turning for home, could not match the winner the
final furlong, all out to prevail for the place. MIRABEAU settled off the pace, in the two path through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, gaining late for
the place while not a threat to the winner. PERFECT PEACH last to leave, void of early foot, swung out six wide exiting the turn, improved position down the
middle of the strip. TECATE TIME in mid pack while racing off the inside, came five wide out of the turn, continued one paced to the wire. APRIORITY GIRL
dueled early inside the winner, was finished after a quarter. ABIGAIL G remained always back. LOUISIANA'S HOPE within striking distance in the early
going, steadily faded. WHO DAT GREY was outrun while racing wide. MY LITTLE FUEGO was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
LOVELY TETON broke alertly, set the early pace inside, hooked up with the runner up for an extended duel early in the turn, found more late to narrowly
prevail under brisk right handed urging. THIRSTYAMERICANGAL close from the start off the inside, bid early in the turn, raced on equal terms with the
winner through the turn and entire stretch, narrowly missed to be outkicked at the wire. LUCKY ARTIE broke back, improved three wide into the turn,
dropped inside entering the stretch, advanced to be closest to the top two with a furlong remaining, moved back and and flattened out late while remaining
well clear of the others. RAISING THE ROOF settled in mid pack off the inside, in some traffic while three wide late in the turn, also failed to muster little if
any late gain on the top pair. MY LITTLE FIRE forwardly placed outside, came four wide out of the turn when closest to the top two, had little left late.
STARBUCK LUCK broke with the field, settled back, failed to seriously menace while improving position slightly. LADY KAZA forwardly placed for three
furlongs, faltered in the drive. GETTOTHEPOINT lacked speed, dropped to the inside to save some ground, failed to menace. BINDS FAIR LASS last to
leave, remained back. TWO WITH A TEN was also always outrun.

Footnotes
BROADWAY ICE broke back, fell further back to trail early, continued back into the turn, swung out five wide when beginning to advance turning for home,
closed with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be up in time. BUXTERHOOTER last away, advanced steadily into contention while three wide,
took over with less than a furlong remaining, clear late, caught. OUTOFTHISGALAXY cleared to the inside exiting the chute, showed the way into and
through the turn, dueled past the furlong marker, faltered late, comfortably saved the show. BERKO off the early pace and the inside, advanced before a
half to engage the leader from the outside, dueled into and through upper stretch, also weakened in the final furlong. PHILLY forwardly placed for a half, had
little left for the stretch run. RUN TAPPY lacked early foot, came four wide into the stretch, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. SHIP
STALKER remained back in failing to menace. DREWSIZZLE within striking distance early, asked along while four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.
RELEASE THE BEAST flashed brief early foot along the inside, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ROSSLARE HARBOUR unhurried early, advanced on the outside before a half, challenged three wide far turn, vied into the straight on the outside, wore
down rival under firm handling. SILENT FORCE forwardly placed in the second flight early, continued to save some ground into the far turn, lost some
position in some traffic through that bend, steered to the outside for room for the drive, finished up willingly to be in time for the place. RAISON MARTINI
broke on top, showed the way into the first turn just off the inside, continued to set the pace the middle half, held a narrow advantage into the lane, held on
stubbornly until late, losing the place in the final strides. LAST NITE OUT vied early while between rivals into the first turn, fell back steadily the middle half,
displayed some late interest to improve position through the lane. J C'S IN TOWN four wide into the first turn when vying for the early lead, moved inside,
saved some ground through the second turn, went evenly through the stretch. POPPI IS SMILING lacked speed, moved out, advanced a bit closer in the
three path the third quarter, flattened out in the drive. MO'S RIDE in the second flight early, advanced inside the winner to challenge into the far turn, briefly
vied between rivals then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
FREE INDEED away in good order, with the pace from the start, put a head in front into the turn, shook clear soon after, pulled away through the stretch
while being kept to task. FLASHYBOY BOBB settled in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, chased the winner into the stretch, proved no match
for that one in the run to the wire, remained clear for the place. JAIL HOUSE off the pace and the inside, came in the three path for the drive, slowly getting
to the runner up late. DOUBLE COOL off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack early, four wide into the lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest.
PROPER CROSS went one paced outside in lacking a serious closing response. JACK'S KISS within striking distance early, had little left for the drive.
WHITE RUSSIAN broke well, shook clear onto the main track, showed the way up the backstretch, briefly dueled with the winner early in the turn then
began to tive wway. SHO MO THE MONEY settled in mid pack early, failed to respond when called on for the drive. SON OF PATRIOT remained always
back. LARRY DALE was finished early, well beaten. JACKSON T. gave way early, fell far back, jogged in.
