early, rallied inside, but was no match for the winner. PABLO'S DREAM set a pressured pace for a quarter mile then gradually weakened.
DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF raced just off the pace outside and lacked a rally. MADELYN'S DANCER prompted the pace and gave way on the turn. MICRO
MARGARITA forced the leader wide and gave way after three furlongs. TIZ A TRIBUTE was urged close up between rivals early then stopped abruptly.

CARGO SHIP came out slightly leaving the gate and had his heels clipped, set the pace just off rail, repulsed several bids and gamely held on. KION was
three wide stalking the pace, loomed boldly near and through stretch but was outfinished. HAIL TO THE KING, between rivals early, moved out three wide
and challenged near stretch but then flattened out late. DUBROVSKY bobbled leaving the gate then failed to menace. ALLIUM broke slowly, raced just off
the rail and failed to be a factor. CARPENTER dueled for command between foes then tired. ANTRIM AUBREY clipped heels and bobbled leaving the gate,
saved ground and tired. SPIDER JORGENSEN, three wide in second flight, stopped.

KEEPING THE PEACE dueled outside, edged ahead midway on the turn and was kept to a drive to remain safe. RIDE ON FAITH earned a narrow lead
along the rail and continued gamely for the place. BROTHER TEZ saved ground off the pace, split rivals late rallying while no threat. TRUE WISDOM
pursued the pacesetters three wide and continued willingly. SMOOTH DON B balked at loading delaying the start then saved ground and faded. AMI'S
ARTIE dropped back racing wide and failed to menace. TUFFY'S LUCKY saved ground and was never in contention. A J'S WAY raced well back outside
and was never a factor. DELINQUENT trailed early then passed a fading rival. JONES TAXI raced very wide and gave way readily.

ELIZABETH T raced close up, saved ground on the turn, altered course outside passing the eighth pole and was just up. SHESASUPERFREAK stalked the
pacesetters three wide, bid to the front near the top of the lane but was nailed at the wire. JULIET'S MUSIC hustled to the lead inside, battled when
challenged and continued gamely. EZ ON THE EYES dropped back inside and lacked a significant rally. BELLA G lacked speed and was always far back.
ARTEMIS RISING prompted the pace outside for half a mile and gave way. BIRD TYCOON broke sluggishly, made a brief bid into the far turn then faded.

Footnotes
TARA'S TALENT saved ground, fell back slightly after a quarter mile, waited briefly for racing room entering stretch, split foes then closed determinedly to
just get up. CAPITAL Q prompted from the four path, shook loose mid stretch but then was nailed on the wire. KEY LIGHT, jostled leaving the gate, angle
wide and was up for show. LULA'S ROADRUNNER came out leaving the gate, stalked four wide and weakened. CRAZY BEA came in leaving the gate,
raced in the four path and was no threat. IMPERIAL LADY saved ground and failed to menace. SWEET TURN, five wide and just off the pace, tired.
JAFFLE set the pace three wide then had nothing left.

Footnotes
SEMI EXCITED broke slowest, was allowed to settle, advanced wide on the final turn, collared the pacesetter a sixteenth out and edged clear. D T GOODIE
pursued the leader inside and continued determinedly to the finish. INFURIATED took control before a quarter mile, widened on the final turn but weakened
in the final furlong. OVER SENSUAL dropped well behind inside, continued on the rail closing the gap while no threat. ADMIRAL ABE eased back off the
pacesetter, pursued then proved empty in the stretch. MOON GATE WARRIOR raced close up three wide and began fading after half a mile. HIT IT ONCE
MORE was urged close up between rivals early then gave way.

Footnotes
FINAL PROSPECT, in the five path while just off the pace, looped the field on the final turn, took the lead and drew off in hand. CHAMPAGNE CHUCK
saved ground vying for command, swung out into stretch and was clearly best of the others. KLAATU, five wide into and rounding the first turn, remained
outside stalking the pace then tired. SIGHT LINE, bumped leaving the gate, saved ground and failed to menace. QUENCH MY THIRST, in the four path,
passed tiring foes. STORMY JUSTIN vied for command three wide before tiring. AMERICAN ROMA was four wide dueling for the early lead and then gave
way. SALUTATION came out leaving the gate causing crowding, raced very wide and showed little. ALAAPATIQUE, bumped and steadied after the start,
tired badly. FLYING ROCKET, in the three path while just off pace, stopped suddenly and was pulled up and walked off the track under his own power.
HIGH FLYING GUY WAS SCRATCHED ON THE VETERINARIAN. A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID. ALL OTHER WAGERS ON HIM
WERE REFUNDED.
