Footnotes
CALL ME HANDSOME, prominent four wide in the opening stages, went clear racing into the turn while angling to the inside and held sway to the end on a
safe advantage under firm encouragement. TARTAN THE BULL prompted the pace between foes from the outset, lost some ground to the eventual winner
nearing the turn but continued with a steady bid just outside that rival to prove best of the others. AMERICANO, in touch with the first flight three deep
between foes racing to the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. MEILLEUR settled inside foes of the first flight in the
opening stages, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and continued with a mild bid. FAR FROM AWESOME, forwardly placed along the inside, gave
way entering the turn. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE settled between foes in early stages and offered no rally. MOUNTED COP was settled outside foes and soon
dropped out.

Footnotes
HELLFIRE BOB angled to the inside stalking the leaders under light rating to the backstretch, shifted outside a stricken rival racing into the far turn, angled
to the rail while being prompted to advance racing into upper stretch and prevailed under firm encouragement. ANALYZEYOURVISION, in touch attending a
rival's pace in the opening half, inherited the lead entering the far turn, contested the issue between foes resisting the winner's challenge into the stretch but
came up second best. O DANNY BOY tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening half, was prompted to challenge three deep between foes
nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the top pair late but edged a rival for a share. COURAGE DE LION tracked off the first flight between foes in early
stages, switched out avoiding some traffic entering the far turn, loomed briefly four wide racing into upper stretch but flattened out late. K'S FUNHOUSE,
taken under firm restraint in the opening stages, never gained contention. FERNANDO settled between foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out
early. HANDSOME COYOTE broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, was pulled up in distress racing into the far turn and was
vanned off the course.

TIZANILLUSION tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in second flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards while making a steady advance to challenge for
command midstretch, then wrested the advantage and held NIKKI BELLA safe under firm handling. The latter tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of
the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out nearing midstretch and edged a rival for the place honors while moving to close the gap. MZ. FOO DO was
urged clear along the inside through the backstretch, held sway to midstretch but faltered late. LANGUE LIEE tracked the pacesetter between foes in early
stages, shifted out three wide entering the turn but had no closing bid. RATTLESNAKEROSE ducked out at the start, was righted to track the pacesetter
outside foes racing to the turn but lacked the needed late response. COCKTAILS OR CANDY bobbled at the start, settled last early and never gained
contention.

deep on the far turn pressing the issue outside rivals, then wrested command racing into upper stretch to go well clear under pressure.
HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE, bumped at the start, was reserved between foes to the backstretch, steadily gained position between rivals racing into the far turn,
angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest while just holding a rival for the place honors on the wire. VUYELWA, reserved in early
stages, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, was urged to advance while being fanned five wide into the lane and just missed for second.
KATIE FALOONA, bumped by BLAZING RUBY at the start, was settled last to the backstretch, then split foes just off the inside entering the lane to
continued with a mild bid. MEANASASNAKE, pulling hard against restraint while going a bit erratically, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the
inside to the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn and gave way in the drive. KATIE'S LAST DANCE tracked just off the first flight three deep to the
backstretch, was urged outside foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. MOR BREEZE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace to the
backstretch, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and gave way into the stretch. DELIGHTFULZEE'S settled inside and failed to menace.

EVIDENCE broke readily to gain a clear advantage racing well off the rail to the turn, dictated the pace in the three path into upper stretch and widened the
advantage in the closing stages under pressure. BOLTER tracked just behind the second flight along the rail racing to the turn, saved ground through the
turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. NOT TELLING, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing into
the turn, had no closing bid while holding a rival for a share. HONOR THIS tracked the pacesetter five wide just off the second flight early, made brief
progress racing four wide into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. STARSHIP FONZY, bumped at the start, angled to the inside, dropping off the
second flight and continued evenly inside rivals. TOMMY TUESDAY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but lacked a rally.
TARQUIN broke awkwardly while dropping out late and failed to menace thereafter. ERIN GO BRAUGH ducked inwards at the start bumping STARSHIP
FONZY, and dropped out early. GALLEON LIGHT was urged in brief pursuit of the eventual winner three deep on the backstretch but emptied out early.

NEAT STREET tracked the pacesetter between rivals in second flight to the backstretch, continued under patient handling while angling inside after a half,
switched outside foes leaving the midway point of the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch, was forced to correct his course in late stages
when carried out by AGRIPINO but collard that rival in time under steady left handed encouragement. The latter sped to the lead while angling to the inside,
dictated the pace on a clear margin into upper stretch, drifted out in late stages and just failed to contain the winner. MORE THAN TEDDY tracked off the
second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out three deep midstretch and continued with interest to gain
position while earning a share. YADI settled between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn, then advanced in that path into
the stretch to make a mild gain. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight in the opening half, made brief progress to
close the gap nearing the lane but flattened out in the drive. REWROTE settled between foes in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. HUSBAND IN
LAW tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, made brief progress between foes after a half, continued along the inside on the far turn
and faded into the stretch. AWESOME ROMEO, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued in pursuit between foes
to the second bend and gave way leaving the far turn. HALEL, off last, failed to menace. LITTLE GUY steadily retreated.

Footnotes
CREDIT CYCLE angled to the inside just after the start tracking just off the pacesetter, was prompted to advance on that rival racing into the turn, bid along
the rail leaving the midway point of the turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and edged clear late under energetic handling. DRILL'S
LI'L MAN, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, shifted in racing into the turn to advance three deep nearing the lane, exchanged some contact
with RED HOT LOOKS in late stages but edged that rival for the place honors. RED HOT LOOKS broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, shifted off the rail
setting the pace racing into the turn, couldn't match the winner entering the lane, then exchanged bumps late while losing the place honors. WILD WINTER
settled last in early stages, angled inside racing into the turn steadily gaining position, then shifted out three deep in the lane to improve position.
BETWEENHEREANDCOOL tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. FORTY FATHOMS tracked off the
second flight racing four wide to the turn and never gained contention. VERY AMUSING bobbled at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes in
the opening stages and faded early. JUST FLASHY flashed brief pace between foes but was finished early.

Footnotes
HEY GRIFF, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light reserve racing to the backstretch, conceded some ground to that foe racing into the far turn
but continued with a steady bid to prevail in time under firm left handed pressure. MONETIZED sped to the lead while angling inside, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin along the rail to the backstretch, edged clear on the far turn, resisted the winner to late stages but couldn't contain that rival. POSITIVE
IMPACT, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a contending position, tracked the pacesetter three wide as part of the second
flight and continued in that path into the lane to make a mild gain late. LODI, pulling hard while a bit rank between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the
inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane and finished evenly late. IN HONOR OF ARTIE, reserved last when
caught in close quarters just after the start, split foes entering the backstretch while being prompted to advance, swung out four wide racing into the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. IMPERIAL PALACE settled along the inside early and failed to menace. DRAMA AN VICTORY settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch and proved no threat. TINKER'S PAL urged to a contending position three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, was through after a
half. FEISTY KITTEN dropped out early.
