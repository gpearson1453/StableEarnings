Footnotes
SOUND CHECKERS stalked the top trio a bit off the rail into the turn, angled inside of BIG FAST CAT at the eighth pole, gained command mid stretch and
drew clear under hand urging. EURODOLLAR vied between rivals for command, pressed three wide into the lane, challenged in the drive and edged BIG
FAST CAT for the place. BIG FAST CAT vied inside a pair of rivals, led in the two path into the lane, battled between rivals then lost command nearing the
sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the place. KENZLEE'S GOV hopped at the start and trailed the field up the backstretch, drifted wide around the bend
then angled inward to enter the stretch three wide and improved position. LOVE AND HOLD stalked outside a rival, came out and bumped SUPER CAL
midway around the turn, angled four wide at the eighth pole and lacked a rally. SUPER CAL hopped slightly and broke out, vied three deep for the lead,
outpaced by the top pair and bumped by inside rival nearing the three-sixteenths marker, cut the corner into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ROCK ALL DAY showed good early foot outside a pair of rivals, cleared those and angled in entering the turn, inched away a bit off the rail to the stretch
and held safely under left-handed encourament. MILLIE JOEL settled off the pace, saved ground along the inside to the lane, rallied through the final furlong
and proved second best. MAZ KANATA away quickly then contested the pace between foes, outpaced by the leader up the backstretch and chased outside
a rival, went two wide around the turn and finished evenly in the drive. CUTE TALKER lacked early speed, traveled two wide through the turn, came out
entering the stretch and showed a mild response. HELIACAL raced up close with the pacesetter then chased from the inside, put in tight quarters and
steadied entering the turn, moved out into the three path and drifted out further into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

SPECTACULAR STORM pressed the pace early then chased the leader from the inside to the stretch, rallied and gained gommand mid stretch and moved
clear under a drive. ASEM tracked off the rail then three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, closed well from the outside and earned the
place. DURGA angled in early and trailed the field, saved ground into the lane, rallied along the inside to finish a game third. SHEZA KATHY stalked the
leader from off the rail, moved closer from the outside and was floated out by the leader into the lane, bid three deep in the stretch but lacked the needed
late kick. NAOMI FRALEY sped to the front and cleared SPECTACULAR STORM, raced in the two path nearing the turn then moved over to the rail, drifted
out into the stretch, met bids from both sides and fought back to mid stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS settled outside a
rival, went four wide into the turn then angled six wide leaving the bend and came up empty in the final furlong.
