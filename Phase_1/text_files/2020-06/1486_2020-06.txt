Footnotes
ASPEN XTREME set the pace on the inside, dueled with RONIN WARRIOR on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival past midstretch and battled
back late to get the nod at the wire. RONIN WARRIOR was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, then vied two wide for command, dueled with the
winner on the far turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, dug in gamely through the final furlong and just missed. JANE'S FACTOR raced four wide early,
then vied three wide, chased between rivals on the far turn, then closed late on the far outside. KID MACHO tracked the pacesetters racing close up on the
inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied in the three path and was outkicked. MR CLASSICAL was bumped at the start, stalked two and three wide,
rallied four wide in the stretch and was outkicked. SPARTAK raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

HEART OF A DREAMER tracked the pace while saving ground, bid on the rail nearing the far turn, took over, drew clear and held well under urging through
the final furlong. CURLIN'S KNIGHT stalked outside rivals, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied turning for home, dug in gamely but second best.
ROAN MOUNTAIN raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced two wide on the far turn, closed mildly and earned the show spot. SILVERZAR set the pace
racing a bit off the inside, dueled briefly with the winner entering the far turn, then chased and tired. MY MAN ELVIS trailed the field and did not factor.
PARTNER'S POWER raced off the pace, then chased inside and gave way.

TAKE ME HOME angled towards the rail in the opening furlong, set the pace, edged clear near mid stretch and then held on under strong handling.
HEATHERLY, in the four path early, moved to the rail near stretch and closed for place. DANCIN DEBBIE prompted lapped on winner, drifted out slightly
leaving the turn and fought gamely to the wire. QUEEN OF SCHMOOZE, three wide and just off the pace, challenged near the stretch, was fanned out soon
after and weakened late. UNTOUCHABLE U, racing in the six path early, remained wide and was no factor. LUNA AZTECA, three wide under rating, never
threatened. DRIVEN BY SPEED was very wide and showed nothing. ANISSA was never a serious threat.

JOYCE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and got up late for second. CONGRATS ANSWER was fractious

pace, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. SUGAR SHACK DANCER raced off the pace, between rivals on the turn and lacked a rally.
LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE raced off the rail, outrun early, moved up four wide on the turn and closed belatedly. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased inside, rallied four
wide into the lane, then weakened. JUMPINTOACTION was outrun early, came wide into the stretch and did not factor. ONE TOUGH ROSE dueled
between rivals, battled on the turn and faded. BROAD JUMPER raced off the pace, inside on the turn and did not factor. CARTOUCHE dueled inside for the

early as the horses left the starting gate twenty four minutes passed scheduled post time, eased out near stretch, challenged between foes mid stretch and
battled tenaciously to wire. POWERFUL VENEZUELA, racing in the four path while just off the pace, had no rally. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ, three wide on turn
and through stretch and was too late. CELTIC TREASURE saved ground and passed tiring foes. O'KRAM broke slowly, saved ground and steadied briefly
on the turn. SENSATIONAL ZIP dueled for command just off the rail then tired. READY AND RICH stumbled leaving the gate, raced between foes, eased
out and failed to menace. MASS APPEAL dueled two wide, was clear on the turn, stopped suddenly through the final furlong. IT'S GOOD TO BE US
bobbled leaving the gate and failed to menace. KING'S GOLD showed nothing. IMPACTFUL, between foes, tired badly.

Footnotes
SPANKY, three wide, took the lead midway on the turn, held a long lead in mid stretch and won handily. TO THE FLAG saved ground and was drawing from
the others. MISSES KNIGHT stumbled as the horses left the starting gate twenty six minutes past scheduled post time, set the pace just off the rail then
tired. GIRL POWDER, racing in the four path, failed to menace. BIG RED SEVEN was never a serious threat. BON HEIR broke slowly then saved ground.
RAPIDEZ bobbled leaving the gate, raced in the four path while not far back then gave way. CONGRESSIONALSTORM, well placed between foes,
dropped back leaving the turn. MIDNIGHT SKY broke slowly then showed little. RIO VISTA bobbled leaving the gate then raced very wide.
