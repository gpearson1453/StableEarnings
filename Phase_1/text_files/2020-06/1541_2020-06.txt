Footnotes
TOUGH KICKS lacked early foot, began to advance in the turn, came on the outside for the drive, engaged the leader just inside the furlong grounds and
drove clear. DUEFORADATE off a step slow, raced back early as a result, moved closer toward the inside late in the turn, steadied in some traffic with less
than a quarter remaining, steered out for room, finished up willingly to be well clear for the place. NEW ORLEANS SPICE vied up front while four wide into
the turn, shook clear midway on the bend, continued to show the way upper stretch, weakened in proving no match for the top two the final furlong,
comfortably saved the show. CRESCENT LACE with the pace along the inside, began to weaken in the turn. COOL SPRING with the pace in the two path
between rivals, exchanged bumps with MI COPA REBOSA into the turn when appearing to get out a bit, also began to falter before three furlongs. MI COPA
REBOSA contested the pace 3w up the backstretch, exchanged bumps with COOL SPRING into the turn, took up sharply to lose all chance. FOLLOWING
A CLAIMM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MI COPA REBOSA AGASINT NEW ORLEANS SPICE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN AND
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE BEND, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
ZARTASTIC dueled into the first turn off the inside, clear before a quarter, set a soft set of early fractions, extended advantage second turn, not threatened
in the drive while firmly being kept to task with a brisk right handed stick. TONIGHTS STAR void of early foot, continued back while between horses into the
far turn, advanced three wide through that bend, extended drive for the place, no match winner, game for that position. WHISKEY FACTOR settled off the
pace while saving ground, continued inside into and through the second turn when improving a bit, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the
place. CLEAR THE NILE dueled early inside the winner, fell back to chase that one the middle half, had little left for the drive in weakening between rivals
upper stretch. PURPLE HEART ROAD was finished after a half and trailed home.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN broke on top, set the pace while rating along the inside, responded when challenged by a pair of rivals turning for home, found more inside
the furlong marker after a heated late duel to gain the nod in a game effort. COPPER FIDDLE stalked the pace off the inside, advanced and challenged
three wide exiting the final turn, dueled past the furlong marker, put a head in front late but could not last to narrowly miss. GOLDEN NOGUEZ closest to the
winner just off the inside, advanced to challenged outside that one and inside the runner up late in the final turn, briefly raced on equal terms with that pair
then could not keep up, remained clear of the others. SIR POKERFACE unhurried early inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, came up
empty in lacking a serious closing bid. WHATAFIND settled off the early pace just off the inside, continued one paced in the run up the backstretch, came
three wide into the straight then also lacked a closing response. CORVETTE SPIRIT last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TIZZY'S SONG settled in the second flight for a half off the inside, three wide out of the turn, moved out wider, set down, closed with good energy to win
going away. HEART OF SOUL closest to the leader for four furlongs, took over in the two path entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner late.
DIVA'S RANSOM broke alertly, got clear to set the pace soon after, continued to show the way through the turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the runner
up in upper stretch then could not match strides with that rival, also no match for the winner. SHE SANG DIXIE back off the early pace, raced four wide
through the turn when improving slightly, flattened out in the drive to finish up evenly. GLORIETA a bit reluctant to load, lacked early foot, steered out widest
for the drive when straightened for home, improved position with some mild late interest down the middle of the strip. ISLAND BLUE within striking distance
early along the inside, continued to save ground while beginning a steady fade before a half. PRESLI'S ARGUMENT last away, trailed most of the way to be
always outrun. L L L COLLEGE FUND made little impact in trailing home.

Footnotes
VICTORY BIND broke back, raced well out in the strip, was five wide through the turn, roused for the drive, closed with good resolve down the middle of the
strip to kick down the leader. CHASIN GRACIE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, relinquished the advantage late in the turn,
regained the lead when straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner late, remained clear of the others. GRAND
OMEGA void of early foot, raced in the two path while still back through the turn, dropped to the inside for the drive and improved up the rail. CAEUS IN
PASADENA lacked early speed, steered out widest exiting the turn, staged a mild, belated rally midtrack to also improve position. CAT ON THE ROOF
prompted the runner up from the outside early. BRAZOSWILDCAT went one paced throughout, not dangerous. ALYS APPOINTMENT forwardly placed for
three furlongs, had little left for the drive. WHISTLING WIND broke out while rank to be slow away, remained back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
never a threat. NICKELONTHETRACK raced in mid pack early, was appearing to tire in midstretch when caught up in traffic toward the inside. HEART
WARRIOR raced within striking distance early, four wide turn, tired.

FATS away in good order, vied up the backstretch three wide, came in slightly into the turn, dueled through the turn in the two path, began to put the other
speed away approaching the furlong grounds and edged away under firm handling. TACTICAL PRIORITY last away when bumped slightly, moved out,
came four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be in time for the place. SAPONI light bump start, vied up front while closest to the inside of the first flight,
dueled with the winner through the turn and into the lane, could not keep up in the final furlong, lost the place position late. SMOOTH CURRENT lacked
early foot, saved ground turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. HALF OURS N STORMY with the early pace between horses up the
backstretch, brushed with the winner into the turn, steadied, fell back and did not recover.

Footnotes
PRAY IDE SING lacked early speed inside, moved out, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, kicked well clear under steady handling. TROLL
AND STROLL bothered, steadied to be off slowly, trailed early, outside advance, finished willingly to be in time for the place, too much to do in order to kick
down the winner. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE pressed the issue early outside, dueled through most of the turn, vied between foes into the lane, could not keep
up with the winner the final furlong, kicked down late for the show. FIRST METAL COUNT broke alertly, cleared toward the inside in showing the way early,
vied through the turn then began to weaken while remaining closest to the inside nearing the furlong grounds. HEZA FORTUNE broke out, was straightened
to race forwardly early, steadily faded before a half. WILLY B FAST bothered, pushed out into the runner up at the break, remained always back.
LETITHAPPENLUCKY was finished early, trailed home.
