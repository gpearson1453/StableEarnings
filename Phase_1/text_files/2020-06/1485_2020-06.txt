Footnotes
FOREST BLUE slow early gained on the turn looming six wide in upper stretch hooking foe late getting up at the wire. BOBBY V. stalked the pace rushing
to lead on the turn, dug in from the three and four paths being hooked late battling to the end. CHARITABLE sent hard pressed dueling through the turn,
extending in the three path down the lane came up a bit short. CHAIRMAN GAREY bumped at the break gave a mild rally on the turn racing evenly in the
four path down the lane. GONE MOUNTAIN slow early improved past tired ones. DISCREETLY PLACED played no factor. SKIP THE LAWYER pressed
early then faded to upper stretch. THORNADO bumped at the break was hustled early tiring to upper stretch. SPECIAL CONCOCTION was always outrun.
