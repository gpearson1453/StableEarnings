Footnotes
MILLEFIORI saved ground allowed to settle for nearly six furlongs, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch, rallied steadily and overhauled COUPLE
OF NIKKIS from outside in time. COUPLE OF NIKKIS tucked in behind the first flight inside, moved out to the three-path turning for home, collared SPENCE
from outside in mid stretch and briefly drew clear, but could not hold off the winner. MATCHA bumped with MYFIRSTEXWIFE at the start, lagged far back
inside for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and was up for the show. SPENCE cleared inside early and vied with MYFIRSTEXWIFE, deferred and moved
outside entering the backstretch, rebid after six furlongs and took over in upper stretch, and was outkicked through the last eighth of a mile. PRINCESA
CRYSTAL (GB) was slow into stride and three wide early, moved inside and advanced mildly to upper stretch before flattening out. CAPELINE bumped with
SILVER PALMS at the start, and faded in the two-path before reaching the stretch. SILVER PALMS bumped with CAPELINE at the start, raced four wide
and tired after a half-mile. LOOKN FINE AS WINE tired three wide before completing six furlongs. MALAGA broke sluggishly and was outrun inside.
MYFIRSTEXWIFE bumped with MATCHA at the start, took over outside SPENCE while a bit keyed up around the first turn, moved inside showing the way
to the end of the far turn, and had nothing left. DA DOOP was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY BLESSING vied inside FUN LOADED early, let that one go briefly on the turn, rebid confidently along the rail past the five-sixteenths, spurted
away in upper stretch and was kept to pressure. FUN LOADED contested the pace outside HEAVENLY BLESSING, edged away briefly midway on the turn,
proved no match at the top of the lane, and ran on best of the others. CHUCKY broke out brushing into PUGIN, chased two then three wide around the turn,
and lacked a bid. GEGE CONQUEST broke slowly, raced three wide and posed no threat. H P BIG HOPE raced four to five wide around the turn, and was
done after three furlongs. PUGIN bumped with HEAVENLY BLESSING at the start, then was brushed and crowded as CHUCKY came his way, and was
through early outside. WATER CAY dropped far back after three furlongs.

Footnotes
DAYS OF SPRING settled within range early inside, moved out to the three-path to go after DIENDA after six furlongs, and drew off through the stretch
under a drive. LA RUSIA shifted to the four-path just outside DAYS OF SPRING turning for home, could not go with that one through upper stretch but was
along for the place outside. DIENDA bumped with AFFICIONADO at the start and was brushed by LITTLE BIT GOOD, sprinted clear early in the two-path,
set a sharp pace, could not stave off the winner into the lane, and yielded the place weakening through the late stages. INTEREST angled widest off the
turn, and made no headway. LITTLE BIT GOOD broke out and brushed with DIENDA, was put to a drive on the turn four wide, and was empty. STILL
ALIVE broke open the gate prior to the start, was slow into stride, moved up mildly after a half-mile, then dropped back. AFFICIONADO (FR) bumped with
DIENDA at the start, and dropped back four wide around the turn.

Footnotes
ESTILO TALENTOSO tracked outside EVER SMART early, took over from that rival midway on the turn, repelled a challenge from INDEPENDENT MISS
after six furlongs, drifted out while clear near the sixteenth-pole, and was geared down late. INDEPENDENT MISS was never far back, loomed menacingly
outside ESTILO TALENTOSO with five-sixteenths remaining, was turned aside in upper stretch, and ran on much best of the rest. MAY I raced two to three
wide on the turn, and was no threat to the top two while well clear of the others. SWEETOLOGY unseated the rider and ran off prior to the start, and was
finished after six furlongs. EVER SMART set the pace removed from the rail, and retreated once displaced for command on the turn. This race was hand
timed.

Footnotes
SAINT BENEVOLENCE chased the leading trio while between horses into the turn, rallied in the two-path straightening away into the stretch, and got the
best of SEPTEMBERTEN after a long drive. SEPTEMBERTEN vied outside FLAMING HOT and QUICK STEP ED for a half-mile, edged away approaching
the quarter-pole in the four-path, battled back when hooked from the inside by SAINT BENEVOLENCE in upper stretch and was stubborn to the finish.
HANDSOME PRINCE saved ground awaiting room around the turn, moved to the three-path finding clearance in upper stretch, and rallied mildly. FLAMING
HOT moved through inside after the start to vie inside QUICK STEP ED and SEPTEMBERTEN, and weakened into the stretch. CHINOMADITO raced
between horses three then four wide on the turn, and lacked a rally. QUICK STEP ED argued the pace between horses for a half, and gave way. DIZZY
SIGHT tired around the turn four then five wide. JACK B WINKLE was outrun five wide.

JUST A BIT SASSY vied three wide up the backstretch, dueled outside EL SCORCHO from midway on the turn to the top of the stretch, pulled away under
a drive and was geared down nearing the 70-yard marker. EL SCORCHO contested the early pace inside rivals, could not match strides with JUST A BIT
SASSY turning for home, and drifted out on her left lead while clear of the others. VIVA PER LEI argued the pace between horses, and weakened midway
on the turn. TELL ME MAUX raced three wide, and faded steadily after six furlongs. The quarter-mile and half-mile fractions of this race were hand timed.

Footnotes
NOTE TO SELFIE was devoid of speed two wide to the end of the turn, moved out finding her best stride in upper stretch, rallied steadily outside and nailed
TAKE CHARGE AGAIN at the wire. TAKE CHARGE AGAIN advanced early on the turn, cruised up to take over outside MARCHING IN late on the turn,
took charge with the rider taking a confident peek back at the top of the lane, drew clear lightly hand urged through upper stretch, and was handled that way
to the finish unable to hang on. TALE OF V K bumped with PALACE TWO STEP at the start, saved ground in the second flight for three furlongs, moved out
for the drive and rallied mildly. MA MEATLOAF raced four wide, had a clear shot through the lane but had no punch. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA broke
slowly, lagged far back four wide to the lane, and passed tired horses. PALACE TWO STEP bumped with TALE OF V K at the start, chased inside to the
stretch, and faded near the eighth-pole. SIZZLING ROMA raced in the two-path and was no menace. MARCHING IN set the pace removed from the rail, got
collared approaching the stretch and gave way readily. MY SEBASTIANA gave chase three wide early, and tired after three-eighths of a mile. GOLDEN
NOLE was finished early four wide.

Footnotes
DYNADRIVE dropped back unhurried midway up the backstretch, swept up willingly outside the leaders four wide after six furlongs, took over through the
furlong grounds and edged clear under a drive. CAPTAIN D led for a good part of the opening quarter-mile before deferring to LURE HIM IN, chased
forwardly to the half-mile pole, dropped back steadily around the turn despite urging three then four wide, and rallied belatedly outside the winner.
REBELDE raced within range four then three wide to the top of the stretch, and weakened late. LURE HIM IN took over inside CAPTAIN D after entering the
main track, rated along in the two-path to midway on the turn, was put to a drive before reaching the stretch, and faded under pressure. UNCORK THE
BOTTLE raced two then three wide on the turn, and tired in the stretch. BAHAMIAN PRINCE moved up mildly up the backstretch, but gave way after six
furlongs.

Footnotes
QUENANE lost some position while allowed to settle up the backstretch, moved fast four wide around the turn, headed INDIMAAJ from outside at the
quarter-pole, and kept that rival at bay through the stretch. INDIMAAJ was crowded and bumped between ICE TEA and EXPENSIVE STYLE at the start,
advanced along the rail reaching even terms with QUENANE late on the turn, but could not kick on with the latter through the drive. MEADE raced in range
three wide to the end of the turn, and could not rally with the top two. ICE TEA bumped with INDIMAAJ at the start, chased in the two-path for six furlongs,
and weakened into the lane. EXPENSIVE STYLE bumped with INDIMAAJ at the start, moved out four wide after six furlongs, and had no rally.
NOTSOSUBTLE moved inside around the turn, and could not keep up. TIZ APPROVED set the early pace well off the rail, was overhauled from both flanks
late on the turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
BELLA GIANNA pressed STORM DELITE from outside for a half-mile, took over three wide midway on the turn, repelled a challenge from CULTIVATION
coming to the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch with MARICOPA looming to her outside, drifted out under left-hand pressure and brushed that
one past the furlong marker, and held firm. MARICOPA moved up four then five wide after six furlongs, bid outside BELLA GIANNA and was brushed by
that one entering the last eighth of a mile, and came up second best. NEW YORK COMMANDER stayed in range two wide early, cut the corner into the
lane, and was along for the show while no threat to the top pair. SURPRISE ARRIVAL saved ground close up for a half-mile, lost position around the turn
despite urging, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and improved mildly. BORROWED ANGEL was no factor two wide. CULTIVATION was under
a drive four then three wide late on the turn outside BELLA GIANNA, and weakened after six furlongs. EMILIA STRONG was well back early, and drifted six
wide tiring at the top of the stretch. MS. OUTRAJES moved inside early, and was never in the hunt. STORM DELITE set a pressured early pace slightly off
the inside, and gave way on the turn. REINA CARIBE dropped back to trail soon after the start, and lost contact with the others.
