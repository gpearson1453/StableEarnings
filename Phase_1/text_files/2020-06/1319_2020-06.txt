Footnotes
PLUIE D'AVRIL dueled early, edged clear once on the turn, widened, then held sway under a strong hand ride. OXESOME showed early foot dueling with
two rivals, chased on the turn and finished best of the rest. VINYASA vied early between horses,chased on the turn then finished evenly. MUNCH AND
CRUNCH settled in mid pack, chased two-wide through the turn but failed to menace. MYSTERY DAY raced from the rear of the pack, was hustled along
the rail through the turn but never reached contention. PETITE AMIE broke a step slowly and moved to the outside, closed a bit then chased three-wide on
the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SUPER CHOCOLATE moved up to duel on the main track, edged clear nearing mid turn, widened, then just held under a drive. SNIPPY pressed the pace,
was hustled from the rail on the turn, launched a determined drive and was getting to the leader late. BIG MAMBA, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was
hustled two to four-wide through the turn then finished gamely. NO QUESTION stalked the pacesetters, chased hard three and and four-wide on the turn but
evened out in deep stretch. ELITE SONG dashed to a short early lead, entertained a challenge on the main track, dueled, yielded near mid turn, chased to
the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. SAVVY'S SISTER settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing
response. WILD LUTE was pinched back at the start and raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn but lacked a
rally.

NOT ORBINARY raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the final turn, bid mid turn, had command into the stretch and held sway
under a drive. DESDEMONA, always in range, closed three and four-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. HANCHY was rated off the
pace, raced two-wide through the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied willingly. CALAIS COVE settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the
far turn then finished evenly. FRESHIEINTHEFOREST stalked the pace, failed with a bid midway through the far turn and lacked a closing response.
COURT TIME raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the far turn and finished gamely to no avail. SHOW ME THE PRIZE stalked the
early pace, raced three-wide on both turns and lacked a rally. SAILING BY was sent to an early lead, set a reserved pace, was headed midway through the
far turn and faded.

FORESTER'S TURN stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, bid a 16th out and prevailed driving. SOUPER HOT forced the pace, bid a
furlong out, battled, but was out finished by the winner. ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn then
was all out in the stretch and just missed. SILENCE BREAKERS set a pressured pace, was collared a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. SPRING
EDITION dropped well off the pace approaching the turn, was roused but rallied belatedly. SOCIETY'S TIGER got away slowly, raced in mid pack, chased
two to four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. CAPTAIN HANDSOME, in range, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the
late stages. KID'S MISCHIEF settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. PER THE RULING #1094157 FROM
THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISION, SUPER HOT WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

SILENT POET led early and set a pressured pace along the rail, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a drive. OLYMPIC RUNNER
raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide through the far turn then rallied outside and gained steadily through the stretch. AVIE'S FLATTER, in range,
bid late on the far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly but hung late. SKYWIRE settled in mid pack, was hustled three and
four-wide on the far turn then rallied very gamely between foes. COOLER MIKE stalked the early pace, forced the issue on the backstretch, bid late turn,
was headed at the top of the stretch, chased to the late stages and evened out. MIRACLE SILVER broke alertly, stalked the pace, was steadied early
backstretch, stayed on the rail through the turns but flattened out mid stretch. DUN DRUM, rated off the pace, saved ground, was roused on the far turn,
picked up momentum but ran into traffic in the stretch and there was no rally.

Footnotes
PIERIAN broke slowly but gained striking range quickly and forced the pace two and three-wide, angled out leaving the turn, rallied determinedly and got up
late under a drive. PARABLE forced the issue, bid early turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed to contain the winner late. FLAT OUT
FABULOUS broke alertly and settled in range, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely inside rivals. KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS
settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, launched her rally but evened out in deep stretch. NORDIC PEARL raced in mid pack, was
hustled angling from the five-path to three-wide through the turn then finished gamely to no avail. FINE LADY settled of the pace, came four-wide through
the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch and rallied belatedly between foes. REAL CHOPPER raced from off the pace, closed three to five-wide through
the turn but never reached contention. DOWN WITH BROWN settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then lacked a closing
response. SOUP DU JOUR forced the pace from the rail, was squeezed and had to steady at the turn, remained in range but evened out in the stretch.
KEEP YOUR SILENCE, away poorly, raced off the pace along the rail, was hustled on the turn but never reached contention. ECHO LOCATION had speed
and led into the turn, was quickly engaged by PARABLE, battled with that one but was forced to steady in tight approaching the top of the stretch and was
through.
