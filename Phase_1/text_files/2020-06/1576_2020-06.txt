FOREST LASS set a pressured pace, had the lead on the far turn and was kept to task. EINSTEIN'S BABE was in touch, a factor on the far turn and from
the four path at the top of the stretch held place. VINPEARL VALENTINE was off the pace, in tight on the far turn and got up for show. MARVEL was well
back and gained ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. KEEP YOUR SILENCE broke poorly and raced evenly
from the inside on the far turn but needed more. GABBY'S BALLERINA was in range but lost ground on the far turn and was not a factor. WICKEN CENTS
forced the pace but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. MISS LESTER MURPHY had no speed and was roused on the far turn but from the six path
at the top of the stretch was no threat.

Footnotes
SOFIA'S SLUGGER was up close, dueled on the turn, vied through the stretch and proved best. JACK BEANSTALK was in touch and moved up on the turn
but with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. PERFECT MINE was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and angled out
through the stretch and finished well. MOCAL was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. DES
BOIS forced the pace and was a factor from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. ALMOST DANCER
showed speed from the inside but chased on the turn and was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON PERFECT MINE AGAINST JACK
BEANSTALK FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

THE OTHER BREEZE was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BEEN
WAITING stalked the leaders and had the lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. WORLD OF
PROSPECTS forced the pace and was roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. TH ORIGINAL SCOTTY was
off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. OUR VICTOR set the pace and was a factor
on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch came up empty. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE EARLY STRETCH RUN LEFT THE
RESULTS AS POSTED.
