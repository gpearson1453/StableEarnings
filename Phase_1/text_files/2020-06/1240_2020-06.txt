Footnotes
MAMAS GONE CRAZY broke alertly, showed the way early, steadily drifted in the middle part, clear, finished up along the rail. MY KIKI broke a bit to the
inside, raced forwardly, continued to chase the winner past the furlong marker, could not get to that one late, held sway for the place. BEYOND D'ORO
within striking distance in the middle part of the strip, slowly getting to the runn er up late. GLORYS LEIDY BELLA bothered, pushed out at the start,
remained well out in the strip, managed some late gain. KNOCK ME DOWN broke out, bothered rival, closest to the winner out of the chute, faltered the
final furlong. HOT WINE remained always back. AUDACIOUS GIRL bothered slightly at the start, was not a factor while remaining along the rail. SMART
SHELLEY fell quickly back at the start and was well beaten.

Footnotes
BROADWAY ICE broke back, continued to be outrun into the turn inside, saved ground into the lane, switched out with a furlong remaining, late surge to be
up in time. KING BANDIT behind the first flight while well out in the strip in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged in the five path late in the
bend, shook clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. ALEX'S TURN with the early pace after moving up following
the start, briefly shook clear midway on the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, saved the show. CAJUN DUDE broke alertly, vied four wide
into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, gradually weakened and was outfinished late for the show.,. LOOKING FOR BULL lacked early foot, came six
wide out of the turn when beginning a slight advantage, increased interest late to continue to improve position. SET HUT with the early pace while three
wide and between horses, gave way in the drive. JADE STAR went one paced while in mid pack throughout, lacked closing bid. KINGDOM WAY lacked
speed, raced three wide, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. RANDY PAUL broke back, trailed much of the way, was not a threat while
also passing faltering foes after the issue had been decided. DUDE GREELEY last away, was never a factor to be always outrun. ABSOLUT
NEWORLEANS flashed brief early speed while between horses for three furlongs, gave way. RICKY DALE five wide through the turn, backed up in the
drive.

Footnotes
POPS LEGACY steadied at the start to be last away, in the two path while unhurried through the first turn, moved out, advanced on the outside to be four
wide turning for home, challenged the leader past the furlong marker, fully extended to prove best over that one in the run to the wire. OUTOFTHISGALAXY
with the early pace off the inside, dueled in the three path in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, held a narrow advantage into the stretch and
proved stubborn to the end. EXTON with leaders into the first turn, stalked the two leaders the middle half, remained within striking distance into the stretch,
lacked a winning response when called on for the drive. CHAOSMOS dueled up front outside the runner up, first to blink in weakening through the stretch.
HIDEAWAY HERO was never a threat. SPIRIT OF CALEDON four wide through the first turn when forwardly placed, came up empty for the drive while
continuing outside. MR. GRACEFUL within striking distance off the inside, gave way in the drive.

HE'S A CLIMBER balked at loading, void of early foot, rallied four wide out of the final turn, lodged an outside bid with a furlong remaining and finished with
good energy to win going away. WHISKEY FACTOR chased the dueling leaders for five furlongs, advanced, challenged off the inside turning for home,
proved no match for the winner late, edged clear for the place. EL HOMBRE with the early pace inside, dueled onto the backstretch, shook. well clear before
a half, expanded that advantage far turn, vied past the furlong marker closest to the inside then weakened, saved the show. PAINTED CANYON five wide in
the first turn when with the second flight, continued outside, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. KOWBOY'S BOBO lacked early foot, improved
in the far turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. CLEAR THE NILE shuffled back start to be last away, raced back, improved position a bit while not
posing a serious threat. COMMON LAW CAT settled off the pace, lacked a closing response. IZZY B WINN forwardly placed in the early going, began a
steady retreat before a half. GOLDEN NOGUEZ dueled up front off the inside for less than a half and stopped.

strongly clear. ROMAN JEWELS dueled early off the inside, chased the leader in the run up the backstretch, briefly challenged between horses turning for
home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. TOP TEN DUCHESS forwardly placed behind the leaders while saving
ground, moved closer far turn, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, outfinished for the place. CATCAKE four wide when off the pace in the first
turn, turned in an even effort. MISS MABELEE last away, saved ground while continuing to be outrun, improved position in the drive with some belated
interest. RHETT'S RACER dueled early along the inside, got clear the middle part then gave way when headed by the winner turning for home. CATBALEE

Footnotes
GOTTA GO never far back off the inside, three wide into lane, took over past the furlong marker, drove clear. TREYS MIDNITE MOON outrun for five
furlongs, advanced from between rivals turning for home, could do little with the winner late while proving game for the place along the inside. FREEDOM
FACTOR chased the winner off the inside, challenged and gained a brief advantage between calls in upper stretch, hung the final furlong, outfinished for the
place spot. INVASORS WIND lacked early foot, remained back second turn, came on the outside for the drive, displayed some late interest while remaining
out in the course to improve position. PINCH ASSAULT settled in mid pack early off the inside, crept a bit closer in the second turn, finished up one paced in
lacking a closing kick. SON OF A SAINT lacked early foot, improved into the lane off the inside, flattened out in lacking a further advance. RUN TAPPY
broke back while bothered slightly at the start, was never a threat. DON'T SPLIT TENS broke out, moved up to race in the second flight early, tired from
those efforts. WABASH CANNONBALL was finished after a half. SHOTSOFT broke on top, clear before a quarter, faltered when headed entering the
stretch. YEOWZER off slow, remained back in showing little. FLASHING ANGELBABY settled off the pace, gave way.

Footnotes
HALF AGAIN with the pace from the start along the inside, continued to vie through the turn, disposed of the other speed to be quickly clear when
straightened for home, kept to task with left handed pressure to the wire. HEZA PRIORITY broke in and slowly, raced well back, in some traffic early in the
turn, continued between horses into the lane, worked way to rail, rallied up the inside to be in time for the place. REACH THE CIRCLE in the main body off
the inside, came three wide into the lane, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, no match for that one, nipped at the wire for the place spot. IZZY'S
BABY BOY lacked early foot, swung out sharply exiting the turn, improved position. ALAN'S ARGUMENT broke in the middle of the pack, raced three wide
with the second group through the turn, lacked a closing kick. TOO MUCH BOURBON lacked early foot, four wide through the turn, bothered entering the
stretch, improved a bit late while not a serious threat. GEM OF CARLOS void of early foot, raced four out to five wide late in the turn, bothered when IZZY'S
BABY BOY angled out into the stretch, lacked a serious bid. PAPA BRO broke through the gate prior to the start, settled off the pace, was going evenly
when in traffic as the runner up crossed to the rail midstretch, continued one paced to the wire. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER with the early pace three wide for
a half, gave way in the drive. SAPONI vied up front while between horses for four furlongs as well, faltered in the drive. CUSTOM READY tired drive.

Footnotes
TODAYISNOTTHEDAY forwardly placed toward the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, challenged just inside the furlong marking going away.
LADY KAZA dueled up front while off the inside, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth, held
sway for the second spot. RATTLESNAKE SHOW with the early pace, dueled through the turn inside, weakened a bit in the drive but managed to save the
show. SHOULDACOULDAWOULD forwardly placed outside the two leaders. MADISON'S PLACE in mid pack while racing outside, raced five out to six
wide exiting the turn, went one evenly through the lane. FICKLE FLASH void of early foot, improved steadily without proving a serious threat. ANTE VERA
in the second flight while racing outside, crept a bit closer late in the turn then came up empty for the stretch run. RUBY RED SLIPPERS failed to muster a
rally . MISS INVADER back off the pace and the inside, was four out to five wide turn, tired in the drive. YOU HAVE A POINT last away, was never involved
outside, jogged in, eased. ASH BLONDE was finished early, was also eased up through the lane and jogged in.
