Footnotes
EL HOMBRE broke back, unhurried early off the inside, pulled hard in the run up the backstretch, ranged up to take over under his own courage midway on
the second turn, shook clear and maintained daylight through the stretch while being kept to task. TUNE MY GUITAR prompted the pace along the inside
under restraint, bid, no match drive, clearly second best. TONIGHTS STAR prompted the pace, fell back into the far turn, went evenly to save the show.
PURPLE HEART ROAD settled off the pace and the inside, three wide second turn, failed to respond when called on for the drive. IZZY B WINN broke on
top, narrowly showed the way off the inside, vied between foes into the far turn then began to give way when headed soon after. PRIVATE REALITY
remained back in failing to rally. CLASSY TONI last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL away well, raced with the pace from the start in dueling out of the chute closest to the inside, continued to alternate into and through the
turn, continued to duel past the furlong marker while a head behind, dug in to find more late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. YES HE CAN also broke in
good order, dueled outside the winner throughout, held a slight advantage late, outfinished in the waning strides. BOLD THIRST within striking distance off
the inside, roused late in the turn, crept closer to the top pair entering the stretch, fell back past the furlong marker then was slowly closing the gap on the
same two late, well clear of the others. HEZA PRIORITY broke inward and last, moved up a bit after straightened, went one paced throughout in lacking a
closing response. HE'S A LUCKY MAN fell back to trail after the start, never a threat. GOOSE forwardly placed early while between the top two, began a
steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
STATE TREASURER lacked early foot off the inside, advanced from between horses into the lane, roused for the drive, blew past the lonesome leader to
win going away. O'L RED shook clear soon after the start, maintained a sizable advantage through the turn and into the lane, offered little resistance to the
winner the final sixteenth, remained comfortably clear for the place. GIANT MESA broke back, raced back and off the inside, moved out widest for the drive,
staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest, no match for the top two. REDDY TO BET exchanged bumps with RISKY STEPS at the break, raced in mid
pack, improved slightly while finishing up evenly without a serious late kick. LION HEART LEGEND four wide out of the turn, went one paced through the
lane in lacking a closing response. RISKY STEPS bumped at the start, trailed for four furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious
threat. STORMATION raced in the second flight early while between horses, had little left for the drive. FIDDLERS FAREWELL chased the runner up for
three furlongs off the inside and gaze way.

Footnotes
BIG HEADED BABY cleared to the inside after breaking in good order, set a soft set of fractions, well clear midstretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe
in the late going. BORODINO last away, void of early foot, began a three wide rally midway on the turn, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner
late. CHROMED HEART lacked early foot outside, raced four wide into the turn, moved a bit closer in the three path late in the bend then flattened out in the
drive. COACH O pressed the winner for a half then gave way turning for home. GOOD AIR within striking distance in the early going, began a steady fade
before a half. FOOLING JAY was finished early, gave way while wide out of the turn, finished far back.

TAKE THAT FOR DATA in the second flight while along the inside, patiently handled while continuing to save ground second turn, got through into the
stretch, slight drift when challenging, drew clear under steady handling late. KING OF CANDY chased the early leader off the inside, dueled the middle part
while continuing in the two path, led midstretch, proved no match for the winner late. MAJESTIC SIGN broke on top, set the pace while attempting to rate,
dueled far turn, weakened when headed while allowing the winner the inside into the straight. POWER JET last away, raced outside in trailing most of the
way, lacked a serious response in the drive. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT second group early, moved closer before a half, had little left for the drive while
continuing out in the course.

Footnotes
ROCK THE JUKEBOX broke on top, set the pace along the inside, responded when the winner came alongside, turning into the stretch, extended drive,
dug in gamely to gain the nod in a game effort. MISS KATNISS closest to the leader in the two path, engaged that rival from the outside turning for home,
narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, continued that protracted duel to the wire, narrowly missed. SKEETER settled off the pace toward the
inside, wide into the stretch, slowly getting to the top two late, far clear of the others. PRINCESS ARWEN bothered, steadied at the start to be last away,
continued to trail, came four wide out of the final turn, improved position while never a serious threat. LA REINA ISABEL went one paced throughout in
lacking a closing response. VICKY APPLE broke to the outside to bother an outer rival, remained back in a dull effort. SPANISH ARCH broke back and
never menaced. PRINCESS GIANNA forwardly placed in the early going, gave way, well beaten.

Footnotes
MATT'S PRIDE away in good order from the outside, stalked the leader in the run up the backstretch, closer turn, dueled into the lane, wore that same foe
down under firm handling, held runner up safe late. BOURBON BLUES lacked early foot, advanced into a forward position through the some traffic late in
the turn, three wide into the lane, saw that progress on the winner stall a bit a furlong out then was coming again late to close the gap on that rival to some
degree. PRIORITIZING within striking distance while in the two path, set down for the drive, lacked a winning response. SKEDADDLE BABE broke sharp,
sprinted clear, continued to show the way into the turn, dueled briefly with the winner into the straight then could not keep up, continued to weaken through
the stretch. PRAY FOR LISA broke back, lacked early foot, moved out, was five wide exiting the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat.
BEAR THE MOMENT settled in mid pack, saved some ground through the turn, was also not dangerous in the drive. HIGH HOPES DANCE in the second
flight early, tired from those efforts to have little left for the stretch run. PARTY TWIST last to leave, was never a threat. SWEET KARMA steadily faded while
racing outside.

Footnotes
FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR broke up, sprinted clear out of the chute, showed the way by daylight up the backstretch, given a breather in the turn, drew out
through the lane while being kept to task. R T'S DUCHESS in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, continued to chase the winner through the
turn and stretch, proved no match for that one, fully extended to save the place. KODIAK SKY last to leave, void of early foot, three wide turning for home,
found best stride too late, getting to runner up. SUCKERFORAGREY went one paced throughout in lacking a late kick. MAGGIE TRUE broke alertly,
chased the winner inside the runner up in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
FOURSWEETNIECES in the second flight in the two path up the backstretch, moved out and advanced three wide into the stretch, outside bid, dueled
through stretch, fully extended to narrowly prevail. FRESH SNUFF pressed the leader for three furlongs off the inside, engaged that one midway on the turn,
took over, responded when the winner came alongside when straightened for home, dueled with that one to the wire closest to the inside, proved stubborn
to the end. MADELYN'S MOMENT fractious prior to the start, ran off up the chute, broke alertly, set the pace inside for three furlongs, briefly raced on equal
terms with the runner up late in the turn, could not keep up with that rival or contend with the winner through the stretch, saved the show. CABO SUNSET
chased the early pace, fell back in the turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a late punch. SILENT TRICK lacked early foot, between rivals in
some traffic through the turn, improved position in the drive without posing a serious threat. SUDDEN AFLEET settled in midpack early, failed to respond in
the drive. TOSHITA FOREVER void of early foot, swung out to be five wide turning for home, finished up evenly in a nonthreatening manner. SUNDIAL
STAR off slowly, raced back, five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally down the middle of the strip. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY steadied at the start,
recovered to race in mid pack for a half the backed up through the stretch. SAFE KEEPING trailed well back in showing little.
