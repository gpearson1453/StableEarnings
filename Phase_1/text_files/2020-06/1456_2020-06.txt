Footnotes
D'URBAN PARK forced the pace, took over into the stretch and edged clear under a drive. NETELA raced forwardly along the inside and stayed on.
ORANGE settled well, moved closer on the far turn, was angled three wide and made a mild bid. GOLD BACKED was void of speed and showed some late
interest. MAJOR PERFECTION seized command, was headed leaving the far turn and gave way. NATTYTYME retreated. LIGHT BOUND BID was outrun
while traveling five wide. AMERIPOINT showed little. The six furlong fraction was unavailable.
