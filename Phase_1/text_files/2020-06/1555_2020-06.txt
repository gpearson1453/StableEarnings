Footnotes
SALTINI trailed the field into the turn, commenced a two to four wide rally from back around the bend, fanned into the six or seven path as the field turned
for home and wore down the front runner at the sixteenth pole, inching away late while wide. ALICIA'S KID stalked the early leader, took over midway on the
turn and had a clear lead in upper stretch but couldn't hold the winner's kick and settled for second best. SILENCE BREAKERS chased outside, angled out
to loom up into range as they turned for home but laid in on his wrong lead in the later stages, battled hard for the show spot. SOUPER HOT chased along
the inside while on hold around the turn, came off the fence to pass a stopping speeder, back to the rail by the eighth pole and slightly hesitated when the
inside got tight, finishing evenly the last seventy yards. ROCKCREST trailed into the stretch, angled out from inside to the four path by the eighth pole and
rallied mildly inside the final sixteenth. THE KIPPY TRAIN sprinted clear early, was then taken hold of by his rider, led to midway on the turn and backed
away down the lane.

Footnotes
TAKE IT EASY rushed through along the inside to take the lead after a quarter mile, widened her advantage on the turn, and was never challenged down to
the wire. YES PLEASE outbroke the gate but was content to chase the leader while outside two rivals around the turn, closed determinedly down the lane
without threatening the winner. BURBANK ROAD chased the leader while in between rivals, could not match the energy of the place finisher but bested the
balance showing gameness late. TIZ PRICELESS settled off the pace, rallied two to four wide on the turn and was fanned out to the six or seven path
turning for home, continuing her rally while wide in the stretch for a minor award. SUGATI broke out and bumped a rival at the start, chased the leader inside
of two rivals throughout, losing the show spot late to a closer. SHAMRUCKUS was off the pace and steadying along the inside down the backstretch, trailed
the field turning for home when a large lane opened up, but could only close mildly, levelling off in the final stages. DOLLY STORMY broke in and bumped a
rival at the start, stayed three to five wide near the rear around the turn, was fanned into the seven path turning for home and did not threaten. MY
CANTATA settled in mid pack with an open gap trip, was in range turning for home but backed up down the lane.

Footnotes
FINDING PERFECTION took back early to stalk outside under a hold, rallied four to six wide on the turn, closed resolutely while widest to front at the
sixteenth pole, shifting in slightly, holding a safe advantage to the wire. MARY OF SCOTTS chased inside while hard held, fell back while hustled around the
turn, came again inside late to nail down the place spot. CINDERVELLA was three to five wide closing inside the eventual winner around the turn, then
steadied while lugging in by the sixteenth pole, recovered and ran on well for the show spot. DANCING DOLL rushed up the inside to lead, held until tiring
inside the final sixteenth, losing the place spot late as well. GELATO AMORE stalked the leader early, fell back around the turn and tried to re-bid for the
front but was lugging in badly in upper stretch and dropped back late. GOSUDARINA had the first call but fell back to last quickly and trailed throughout.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND THE TRAINER AND JOCKEY OF CINDERVELLA ALSO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
REGARDING AN INCIDENT BY THE SIXTEENTH POLE. AFTER REVIEW, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE FINAL PLACINGS.

Footnotes
OLD SECRETS was pinched back badly at the start and settled off the pace along the inside, angled out to the three path late turn and found a seam while
in the eight path in upper stretch, driving to the front by the eighth pole, holding safe late. APPELLA broke in badly bothering numerous rivals at the start,
was off the pace before rushing up without much urging into the turn, came two to six wide and was further herded out by a rival as the field turned for
home, had a brief lead by the three sixteenths pole but couldn't hold the winner from the eighth pole in. WHAT'S THE RUSH chased the two leaders,
nestled in along the rail, got to the front when the speed collapsed in upper stretch but couldn't match the energy of the top two finishers, holding the show
safely. QUEEN'S SPEED trailed by a large margin before rallying from off the screen in the later stages, flying in the final sixteenth. LA BESTIA off the pace
early, came rallying two to four wide on the turn, drifting in from the six or seven path to near the rail in the final sixteenth, somewhat greenly. CLASSY
MISTRESS was bumped very hard at the start falling well off the pace, rallying past half the field in the stretch after appearing hopelessly out of it.
TWOMANYSHOTS broke out at the start bumping the winner, sat in mid pack along the inside, came off the rail in upper stretch and was in tight by the
three sixteenths pole, running on evenly from there. DEARFUTUREHUSBAND rushed up to chase the leaders outside a rival, was in range as the field
turned for home but levelled off in upper stretch. AUDITION showed inside speed, was hounded by a rival around the turn, surrounded and headed by
numerous foes in upper stretch, shifted in impeding two rivals by the three sixteenths and faded from there. EIGHT SPEED stalked the leader, bid for the
front mid turn but drifted out into the five path as the field turned for home, backing away down the lane. TACKLE THE NORTH chased along the rail under
restraint, was in contention turning for home along the fence when forced to steady by two shifting in rivals, the rider easing up from that point to the wire.A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN THE DISQUALIFICATION OF THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER APPELLA. SHE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND TO SIXTH.

Footnotes
SWEET SOUPER SWEET wrested the lead from two pace rivals early, opened up a clear margin on the turn and retained it comfortably to the wire. MORE
SAVVY chased along the inside after allowing the winner to lead, angled out in upper stretch but was no match, clearly second best. A. A. FAST LIDA in mid
pack, rallied three wide on the turn and continued to close, striding well and up for show in the final sixteenth. FEDERAL COURT was three wide chasing
early and two wide in range around the turn, but failed to sustain her bid in the stretch, levelling off in the final furlong. BLU SKY SUNRISE broke out at the
start and trailed the field, rallied nicely two to four wide on the turn, stalled a bit but re-rallied with long loping strides in the final eighth. DANCING ZAZINGA
was along the rail in mid pack early, moved into range late on the turn but levelled off late. SLIP'N RUN broke awkwardly, ranged around four wide to look
dangerous on the turn but had no response down the lane. KENTUCKY FAN was off the pace and still trailed into the stretch, never in contention.

Footnotes
BOARDROOM was pinched back at the start, closed from well back with a long steady rally three wide around rivals on the turn, had dead aim on the leader
in upper stretch and collared that one at the sixteenth pole, a very professional debut. FEELING FUNNY broke out into the winner at the start but recovered
and made the lead quickly with the rider tall in the saddle, but was no match for the winner who pulled away in the final yards, still a clear second best.
MUCHACHA chased along the inside, was steadied into the turn, angled out in upper stretch to put in a solid rally, finding her best stride late. PACENZA
was inside and along the inside under restraint, stayed on the fence until upper stretch when angling out and rallying nicely for a minor award. LADY
KRATOS broke in after the start, corrected herself to stalk the early leader, still in contention at the top of the stretch but retreated down the lane. BEYOND
MYBUDGET rushed up the inside to nestle in behind the leaders early, tapped on the brakes into the turn, never mounting a serious bid from that point.
NEPTUNE'S PEARL was wide and off the pace, getting out in the six path around the turn, never recovering to put in a bid. WORDS OF GOLD trailed early,
tried to rally while three wide on the turn but could not get it together. DID I STUTTER chased early, dropped back in the two path on the turn and retreated
in the stretch.

Footnotes
NEVAEH'S VALENTINE sat in the catbird's seat behind the two leaders down the backstretch, moved to them midway on the far turn, led as the field turned
for home and won a headbob in a multi horse photo, showing good determination to just last. GUITAR GEORGE was off the pace, rallied three to two wide
on the far turn, angled out to the widest path by the eighth pole and closed best of all to just miss. AVIE'S MESA vied early before taking back to chase, sat
off the eventual winner's flank for the final six furlongs but couldn't get by that foe, not changing leads down the stretch to the wire. MIRACLE SILVER led
early while stalked, was passed as the field turned for home but battled on gamely along the inside, refusing to give up without a fight. WILLY'S CASTLE
was off the pace before advancing quickly to settle on the fence in behind the leaders, still in contention down the lane but failing to match the top quartet's
energy, running in place the final sixteenth. SILENT JET was in mid pack, three to four wide advancing on the turn but couldn't sustain his bid and stalled
down the lane. BOURBON EXTENSION was well off the pace and could only mildly rally to pass tired foes in the stretch. FEDERAL LAW exchanged the
front end with a pacesetter around the first turn while under restraint, vied with that one until midway on the far turn when the brakes went on. FREITAG
near the rear early while four wide into the first turn and could not muster a challenge.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH WAY (IRE) stalked the leader through a pedestrian opening quarter, stayed there when the pace quickened noticeably around the turn, closed
doggedly to get by that rival in the final few strides. ANOTHER TIME led early, quickened the pace around the turn and had a clear advantage in upper
stretch but failed to hold the winner in the final stages. MALAKEH (GB) chased between rivals and behind the top pair throughout, angled out in upper
stretch but could only inch up late to make it interesting. AMALFI COAST trailed early, came running three to four wide on the turn as the pace picked up,
then continued to inch up down the lane while widest without threatening. NANTUCKET RED chased along the rail while hard held through a soft first
quarter, was till in touch as they turned for home but outrun in the final stages. EYEINTHESKY broke with her head in the air, the rider wrestling with her in
the first quarter but still advancing into a stalking position, looming three wide on the turn but retreating from the top of the stretch home.

Footnotes
HAI BOBBI advanced steadily along the rail from second last early to vie for the front inside the leader into the turn, dueled with that rival until turning for
home with a clear advantage, widening the edge gradually to the wire. LET'S HAVE FUN chased between early, was outside the winner into the turn,
dropped back on the bend but re-rallied up the fence, gaining the place spot by the eighth pole, a clear second best. WAKE UP MAGGIE was in behind the
leaders and in tight into the turn, shuffled back momentarily before swinging out to loom up turning for home, steadily rallying while outside for the show
position. MUSTN'T GRUMBLE led from the outside, had the winner come up inside of her into the turn, dueled with that one to the top of the stretch but
faded from there, holding on to a minor award. SHE'S A DREAM chased early in the second tier, was slightly steadied early on the turn while three wide,
roused to re-rally mid turn, but could only run evenly in the late stages. STORM GAUGE was off the pace and along the inside, roused into mid pack on the
turn but could not sustain her bid, levelling off down the stretch. STERLING SPEED trailed after breaking sluggishly, circled rivals four to five wide on the
turn, but her rally stalled in mid stretch. D'S SOUL fell off the pace, rallying mildly when three to four wide on the turn, but had nothing left for the stretch.
LADIES SIGNATURE stalked the early leader and pressed that on the turn, but backed up from mid turn on, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
LIVIN IN THE SIX led early, let a rival go by and take over into the turn, chased that one before angling out turning for home with dead aim on the lead,
wearing her down by the eighth pole and drawing off late. HELLO FRIENDS stalked the early leader, settled back when a different rival took the front into
the turn, made a bid with the winner on the turn but could not match that one's energy, settling on passing the tiring pacesetter for the place spot late.
REVIVALIST broke out at the start, made a wide run to the front into the turn, led to the eighth pole when the winner went by and lost the place late. SING
YOUR LIFE was in mid pack and two to four wide on the turn, drifted out at the top of the stretch and ran a bit greenly down the lane, not changing leads
and somewhat erratic. BORN TO BE GOOD was in mid pack and rallying inside on the turn, got up to a striking position but her could not sustain it inside
the final sixteenth. BOSCOBEL chased along the inside and was in contention at the top of the lane but could not sustain her rally inside the final three
sixteenths. IVYLEA raced from well off the pace and rallied mildly in upper stretch without threatening. BABY DRIVER was mid pack and moving up three to
five wide on the turn, came into the stretch in the seven or eight path but stalled the final eighth. DASHI was always far back but did exhibit a bit of zip in the
final sixteenth to save from running last. ESSA STAR was far back and never reached contention.
