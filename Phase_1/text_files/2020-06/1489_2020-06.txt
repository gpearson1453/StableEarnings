Footnotes
TELL IT AGAIN showed the best speed to go to the lead opened a good lead on the turn drifted out in the stretch when challenged while not changing leads
but found more in the final eighth to draw clear again. BRAVE DISH chased the winner throughout appeared to be cutting into the margin in the stretch but
could not sustain that bid. DUSTY SKY came six wide entering the stretch and was up for third. BLUEGRASS BETTY came five wide entering the stretch
but could not make up the needed ground. TEMPLE CITY DARLIN got a perfect rail trip and moved to third when others went very wide but tired in the late
stages. LINDAS BLACK COMET was well back throughout and passed a tired foe late. SPIRITA raced in the two path just off the pace drifted out through
the lane while tiring. PER RULING FROM THE COLORADO RACING COMMISSION, TELL IT AGAIN WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
SPIRITA raced as AIM HAPPY.

MAGIC MOMENT was well back for much of the race with only one horse beat at the top of the stretch came out for the drive and swallowed up horses
while going away at the end. ULTIMATE INDIAN made a big rally between tiring foes and opened a length and a half lead with about 100 yards to go but
was caught in the final stages. HIDDEN FAITH raced along the rail behind the early speed came through and held third when the speed collapsed at the
eighth pole. DIAMONDINTHEGRASS showed good speed in the two path but came to a stop inside the eighth pole and faded quickly. BEHOLD DE SKY
showed good early speed along the inside but stopped inside the eighth pole and dropped back quickly. BILLIE MAE raced along the inside and had no
rally.

contention but was outfinished in the final stages. JOHNNIE B raced along the inside in the middle of the pack and never mounted a rally. CALL ME MR TE
