Footnotes
PLATINUM GALE raced last early, went four wide to rally on the turn and powered past horses for the win. NO VA MAS chased the leader from inside,
moved out on the far turn, steadied looking for room heading into the stretch, and found run after getting in the clear. MOUNTAIN MUSIC went to the front
toward the inside, dueled on the turn, and evened out in late stretch. BIZBY chased the leader close up into the turn from the outside, went between horses
moving into the stretch and faltered past the eighth pole. TOO SHORT raced last, was in tight between horses trying to move up heading into the turn, and
flattened out late wjile improving position. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE tracked right behind the leader early, dropped back between two quickening foes
nearing the turn, was taken back while in tight at the five sixteenth pole and faltered in the stretch. The trainer of No Va Mas lodged an objection against
Platinum Gale for interference but the order of finish was upheld by the stewards.

RICHIESONARAMPAGE raced in the second flight, launched a three wide rally on the turn, continued to gain ground late and got up in time.
DINGDINGDINGDING had an outside lead, dueled a foe through the turn, drew clear in the stretch and was nailed late. TRIPLE DELIGHT bumped a foe at
the start, pressed the winner through the turn, couldn't keep pace with that one but held show. GIOVANTE was bumped between horses at the start, raced
mid pack, and improved position while moving late. HUGH B. had the lead inside briefly, dropped out of a duel heading into the turn and leveled out in the
lane. DUJAC was last coming into the turn and very wide enetering the stretch. A NICE RENDITION was bumped at the start and never threatened. GREAT
HARBOUR CAY was off tardy, rushed up and saved ground on the turn to no avail.

keep up wide into the turn but used up and faded in the stretch. RACEY WEEKEND had a good start but dropped back quickly. AFLAXENDREAM showed
little in debut with no run from the start. DONT JUDGE MALEIA broke a bit awkward, rushed inside, seemed a bit rank into the turn and faded badly into the

game foe at the sixteenth pole. IRISH PROUD raced behnd and outside the leader to the far turn, quickened to engage that one in a stretch duel for the
lead, but was second best in a game try. EL RUBIO tried to press the leader inside early but was turned back, came under urging on the far turn and rallied
midly in the lane. HOORAY FOR HARVEY bobbled at the start, was in tight going into the first turn, contended to the far turn, was urged there and then tired
in the lane.

Footnotes
BLACK KETTLE led from the start, was pressed by a foe while racing at the rail on the turn, then held that one at bay for the win. BLINKERS tracked
outside the leader, lacked room nearing the turn, got clear to press that leader but was unable to keep pace and settled for second. NAUGHTY FACTOR
was inside in contention, dropped back nearing the turn, moved outside and rallied for show. ALLOUTPATRICIA raced in the second flight inside and lacked
the needed rally in the stretch. HELGA SHMELGA raced briefly between horses early, moved five wide on the turn and tired. SIMONELA was slow into
stride while being urged out of the gate, and failed to threaten.

a bit tardy with no excuse after that, and chased winner home while no match. MARIAH'S GIRL chased outside to the stretch with a widest run for the show
spot late. SPECIAL BLUE tried to stay with winner to the turn with nothing left for the drive and faltered late. COSTUME JEWELRY never a factor. MINI
MUSKETIER was off a beat slow and never close. SEAWARD rider lost the whip into the turn and never factored.

trailed to the stretch and rallied for the place. OXBOWINDY with the pace to the stretch, forged to a narrow lead at the furlong marker but, faltered and lost
the place spot. CYCLONE MILLIE rushed to the front, edged clear to the turn, pressured and gave way readily. MY MAIKO far back to the stretch, passed a
couple from the rail late. HOT FRANCESCA raced evenly along with no response and galloped past the wire. CALIKA ROSE quick speed from outside,
pressured leader to the turn but gave way and also galloped past wire.
