Footnotes
BIG BOY MO required several strides to get going after being pinched at the start, dove over to the rail a sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, closed the gap
during the run around the bend, maintained the momentum being steered to the outside entering the stretch until in path four by midlane, struck the front in
the general area of the sixteenth marker, came out slightly but was held together well to preserve the decision. ADIOS AMIGOS shied away from GO RUDY
GO after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, went on take up position in midpack on the backstretch, departed it from the four path, shifted
into path six during the initial portion of the stretch run, rallied for the place. IMPERIO D within striking distance three wide, was moved out five wide once
into the stretch, mustered up a stretch response sufficient enough to stake down the show award. GO RUDY GO was gathered after coming out at the start,
but not prior to some contact involving several opponents directly to his right, raced into a prominent position, went up to challenge at the widest of three,
from path three, at the top of the turn, kept the pressure on, challenged spinning into the lane, made it to lead by a slim margin by the beginning of the final
furlong, saw the winner take charge soon afterwards and weakened. UNBRIDLED JOHN sat reserved in the two path for the opening half, was given its cue
and launched a steady rally down the stretch. J'S WARRIOR forced the issue three on the backstretch, slid into path two at the half mile pole, went on to
dispute the issue from between rivals, came under heavy pressure turning into the lane, gave in by midlane and backed away. MARINER QUI in path two
arguing for the front on the backstretch, got guided onto the rail leaving the half mile pole, came under brisk handling a furlong down the road, stayed in the
thick of things to the furlong marker then gave way. WARDENOFTHENORTH took up the chase from the three path, proceeded to angle out at the
five-sixteenths pole, wound up five to six wide, made no impact. TALESPIN brushed between at the start, stepped onto the turn from the two path, failed to
made his presence felt. STREET DANCE two wide in midpack, tired. FRAT brushed after the start, was hung out four wide on the turn, never got involved.
BRIAN'S LAST SONG spotted two wide on the turn, had no rally. SNAPPY CAT along the rail contending for the lead during the run leading up to the half
mile, continued along the inside route, was taken in hand stepping into the stretch with little left.

BIG THICKET coaxed from the gate, chased three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home in behind the leader and was leaned on by BUSTIN SHOUT straightened away, came under a near sided
stick and nudged his way out a path for clearance at the three-sixteenths, traded leans briefly with BUSTIN SHOUT before taking command a sixteenth from
home, then drifted out slightly safely clear to the finish to prevail. BUSTIN SHOUT coaxed from the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and leaned inwards on BIG THICKET straightened away, got nudged out a path at the
three-sixteenths from that rival, dug in trading leans once more inside the eighth pole before being shaken off in the late going running on safe for the place
honors. FOOLISH GHOST showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, got set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a pair to the outside, got collared a sixteenth from home and weakened
in the late going. SHAMROCK KID six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. VICAR'S LEGEND five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, ca,e under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. SAN JUAN DIEGO broke a half a beat slow, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. MANIFEST DESTINY coaxed from the gate, chased five wide coming under a ride midway on the turn, swung four
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BRONX BOMBER four wide in pursuit just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung

Footnotes
DANFUSI away with good energy, established the top in short order, got set up along the inside route, was rated along showing the way, attended by
BARLEEWON from the outside, ventured onward under the same scenario for over three-quarters, was still on hold spinning onto the head of the stretch,
with the aforementioned rival by this stage under a drive, inched away during the ensuing furlong when switched to handling best described as ridden out,
was then put to a drive himself at the eighth pole, dug in with determination to prevail. BARLEEWON attained a prominent position after brushing with
VOLIERO at the break, stalked the winner from path two, got cued up issuing a challenge as three-quarters was being reeled off, displayed willingness
down the stretch but was staved off. AINTITFUNKYNOW caused the pilot of FREEDOM AND WHISKY to check hard taking up residence on the inside
route on the clubhouse bend, kept watch on the top twosome loosely pocketed, went into the stretch and lacked the needed response. VOLIERO came in a
bit at the start, making light contact with BARLEEWON, gradually made its way into midpack, sat reserved in the two path thereafter all the way to the end of
the second bend, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, failed to muster up a kick. NOBLE MISCHIEF forwardly placed three wide on both
turns, tired. OPERATIVE spotted three wide on the far turn, made no impact. STASH MY MONEY saved ground to no avail. FREEDOM AND WHISKY
checked off the heels of AINTITFUNKYNOW as that rival was taking up position inside itself on the first turn, recovered and saved ground for six furlongs,
swung out four wide into the stretch, couldn't gain. THE PRIMITIVE MAN at or near the two path, was no factor. BOOK OF DELANCEY placed along the rail
soon after stepping onto the backstretch, failed to contend.

Footnotes
CLARA PEETERS (GB) tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear, remained patiently handled until set down angled three to four wide into upper
stretch, offered up a good kick to close in stoutly late overthrowing a dueling pair to get up in the final jumps. LADY LAWYER just off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide for home taking over command straightened away, dug in coming under
threat a furlong out, knocked heads on near even terms in game fashion through to the finish with STONE TORNADO but was caught in tandem in the last
strides to the wire. STONE TORNADO (GB) three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, advanced through the turn into contention when let out spinning
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to poke a nose in front a furlong out, dug in dueling through to the finish gamely but was collared in the last jumps and
then bested narrowly for the place honors. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL raced just off the inside near the rear of the field and was in tight among rivals under a
firm hold off heels six furlongs from home, gained better clearance into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. KREESIE three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide
into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. MADELEINE MUST (FR) chased four then three wide, got set down cornering three to
four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DEVANT (FR) broke out a step at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LADY GRACE forwardly placed along the inside, came under coaxing in retreat at
the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. HANNAH'S SMILE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. QUEEN KAHEN coaxed from the start, showed the way lightly coaxed along
the inside, came under threat near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch relinquishing the lead straightened away and faltered.

Footnotes
A D'ORO attained a forward position down the backstretch, left if from the three path, was kept on hold with a good view of the ongoing pace dispute a short
distance up ahead, crept up as the half was being completed, was put to a drive issuing her bid, struck the front, then held well to preserve the decision.
QUEENTIGUA settled into the two path, pursued the front runners from between opponents for a good portion of the initial half, came up to the quarter pole
having been put to a light hand ride a few strides earlier, came home in a steadfast manner to procure the place. EMPRESS LUCIANA raced towards
midpack, going about the turn from the four path, was worked into the six path from upper to midstretch, made no late headway. HAPPY HILL LIL chased
the pace four wide on the turn, was hand ridden getting set up into path six during the opening phases of the stretch run, stayed on to earn the last major
check. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH remained towards the two path after the start, was asked to pick it up by midpoint on the turn, fanned out seven wide down
the stretch displaying a mild response. MISS ROSS abandoned the inside route for the two path at the half mile pole, was on the move to the outside
heading home, went wider and wider until approximately ten wide when done, had some gain. VITANZA got rated prompting the pacesetter from two path,
lost position to the winner as the field turned into the lane, was called upon in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, failed to fire appreciably.
FRENCHIE FROU FROU off a length the slowest, was three wide midway on the turn, and eight wide midway in the stretch, made no impact.
FUNDERELLA strung out four wide on the turn, had no rally. PRETTY FABULOUS tracked the pace from along the inside route and faltered. ANGELS AND
US parked out five wide on the bend, was never involved. DEJA RACONTE vied for control from just off the rail, came under a ride stepping onto the head
of the stretch, relinquished readily and backed away. SASSY SECRET failed to menace off a ground-saving journey.

Footnotes
RIKEN established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, got set down straightened away, drew off to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to prevail. EMPIRE LINE five
to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied
willingly to cut into the aforementioned foe's margin but was ultimately staved off while well clear of the rest and second best. LE GENERAL five wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four wide for home, ran on to secure the show honors. ACED three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. TAKE IT TO SCALE three wide in pursuit
from mid pack, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a ride three furlongs out, went two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. CALL THE CAT three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, got coaxed along midway on the turn, angled five wide at the top of the
stretch and passed tired rivals. BEARS MAFIA five wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn placed to urging at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE chased two to three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled
four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ three to four wide in pursuit in range of the leader, came under encouragement
five-sixteenths out, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. BLUE SKIES FOREVER crossed to the two path shortly after the start, tucked inside at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home and was unable to make an impact. NORTHERN HAZE got
away to an awkward beginning conceding three to four lengths directly at the break, crossed to to the inside soon after continuing to lose ground, went five
wide for home well behind and trailed throughout.

TAP IT TO WIN quickly established control, rated kindly in the two path, facing only token pressure from the closest pursuer, inched away from others
during the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker when switched over to stronger handling, began the final furlong in
possession of his largest advantage, squandered some of it but kept well clear. MYSTIC GUIDE underwent a two wide pursuit, between rivals for much of
the opening three-quarters, finished with willingness down the lane to garner second. COUNTRY GRAMMER well off the inside throughout, kept watch on
the top one towards the five path, was under a drive coming into the lane, got outkicked. BASQUIAT shadowed TAP IT TO WIN from the two path, was let
out a notch attempting to keep pace springing from the half mile pole, swung into the lane and gave way. FAMISHED quickly sent over to the rail, tracked
the winner without benefit of cover, stepped into the stretch and had no rally. INFORMATIVE settled into midpack after the field had been sent off and
running, was two wide onto the turn and angled five wide exiting it, lacked the needed response. WILL SING FOR WINE the early trailer, travelled three
wide on the turn, shifted out into the five path during the stretch run, made no impact. NOTHING BETTER chased the pace three wide, was through after
going three-quarters.

Footnotes
PARET (AUS) forwardly placed from the start, raced three wide into the first turn taking over command narrowly before clearing NOBLE INDY to the outside
to safely tuck to the inside, showed the way rated down the backstretch and into the far turn patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under lone threat to the outside, held gamely to the finish to prevail. DOT MATRIX three wide through the
opening bend, raced four to five wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied
with good energy to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on the aforementioned foe near the sixteenth marker but could not go by ultimately
getting repelled to the wire. SADLER'S JOY four to five wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors in a blanket finish. HIGHLAND SKY three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish to just be bested for the show honors on
the wire. CURRENT three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along midway on the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. STANDARD DEVIATION two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four
to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CORELLI fractious in the gate prior to the start leaping up requiring the rider to remount, got away
to an unprepared start lunging to the near side and conceding three to four lengths to the front, saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. CHANNEL MAKER tracked the
pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish.
HAYABUSA ONE (FR) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cornered three wide for home and offered no
response. GO POKE THE BEAR three wide through the first turn, raced four then three wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five
wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. PETIT FILS (FR) three wide through the first turn, settled three wide in aim of the leader, came
under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. NOBLE INDY led early on before conceding the front into the first
turn, settled tracking the leader in closest aim moving to be just off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn, came under urging at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and backed away.

Footnotes
HUNNYBUNNERDINI went over to the inside after the start, drafted behind PLIMSOLL ANNY, quickened when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole,
out-hoofed that foe for the two path, going on to split rivals while challenging for the front, spun into the lane two to three wide and under a drive, took over,
felt a pair of rivals during the final sixteenth, dug in well to preserve the decision. SNICKET tracked the pace from along the inside route, angled to the
outside at the top of the lane, had aim on the top one with a sixteenth to go, got staved off. TOWERING GAZE pursued the front runners towards the inside
route, was under encouragement cutting the corner into the lane, scurried into contention, flattened out and had to settle for the show. DANCING KIKI
chased the pace two to three wide, swung out six wide into the stretch, rallied mildly to secure the final significant slice of the purse. CAKE raced three wide
on the turn, got driven five wide into the stretch, made no late headway. GRAETZ attained a prominent position, disputed the pace two to three wide, got set
down for the drive home, failed to muster up the needed response and backed away. SHAYNA BAY sat two wide in midpack, entered the stretch and lacked
a solid closing punch. LA KARA MIA away last after making contact with right side of the starting gate, departed the backstretch from the two path, went into
the stretch then alternating between the inside route and the two path, gained but without impact. CEMETERY V I P kept pace three wide for the opening
half before giving way. LUZMARIA forwardly placed along the rail, issued an abbreviated bid coming up to the quarter to lead briefly, gave up readily and
faltered. PLIMSOLL ANNY contended for the top from the two path, began to drift out while tiring as the half was being completed, opening up as it turned
out to be an avenue of opportunity for the eventual winner, then continued to wander to the outside while retreating down the stretch. HENNING'S PENNY
reached out in a green manner after the start, cut over to the inside and went on to save ground to no avail.
