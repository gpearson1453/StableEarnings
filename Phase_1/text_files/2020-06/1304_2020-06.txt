D TWO stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded and was just up for the place. WARRIORS GEM dueled
from the outside early, battled with the winner through the turn, remained forward but was outfimnished for the place. PAT ME DOWN could only improve
position. ADRENALINE forced the early pace outside but had nothing left. BETA LOVER was never a factor. COWBOY CACTUS JACK had a steady fade.
