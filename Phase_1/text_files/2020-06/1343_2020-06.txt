drew well clear and held on under a steady drive. DUBAI WAS LIT settled off the pace while racing three wide around both turns, rallied outside and was
quickly gaining in deep stretch. MOONLIT NIGHT sped clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the
three-eighths, chased inside from there and held well enough for the show. MELTECH was bumped at the start, saved ground and lacked a rally. MEAN TO
AMEND failed to menace while racing two wide. MAYHEM LIKE ME saved ground around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole, chased the
winner around the far turn and tired in the drive. Per stewards ruling #45, Feisty And Sassy has been disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
LUCKY PENGUIN was unprepared for the start and out several lengths behind the field, rushed up three wide into the contention around the first turn, bid
two wide into the far turn, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and drove clear. J J WEDGIT MAN stalked the pace two wide between foes,
fought on inside a foe in the stretch and won the duel for the place. MAN OF THE NIGHT settled off the pace while racing two wide, circled four wide around
the far turn, rallied outside and just missed second. FONEY broke outwardly and bobbled at the start, advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn,
cleared and angled in near the half-mile pole, vied inside of the winner around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. RUM
RUNNER RED was off slowly, saved ground far back, advanced at the rail around most the far turn, swung out nearing the eighth pole and passed some
tiring rivals. SHAMELESS RISK set the early pace along the rail and faded inside. THORN OF ROSE HILL broke awkwardly, raced three wide and never
threatened. ASK ME HOW IKNOW played no factor while racing two wide.

CHARITABLE SPENNY set the pace along the rail, was briefly headed near the seven-sixteenths pole, responded to urging soon after, drew off around the
far turn and widened under a drive. RIP THORN stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes early on the backstretch, briefly led near the seven-sixteenths
marker, could not keep pace with the winner around the far turn but stayed on well to be clearly second best. GOLDEN APPEAL settled off the early pace
two wide, bid three wide near the half-mile pole, was quickly repulsed, chased two wide from there and bested the rest. AFFIX saved ground to no avail.
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE played no factor while racing two wide. THOMAS EDWARD bobbled at the break, chased the pace three wide and was done after

SUAVE JUAN set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of foes and just lasted. RAVIN' MAVEN stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, steadily gained and just missed. KING OF BLUES dropped off the pace inside, angled out early on the backstretch, went four wide
around the far turn, closed outside and ran out of ground. CRYPTOSONDE settled well back two wide early, advanced outside down the backstretch,
angled to the rail entering the far turn, quickly moved into contention around that bend then was boxed in throughout the stretch run. MASTER YOO stalked
the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. MODERN COWPOKE chase the pace three wide and was through after a half. MACHEN BETS was
outrun while racing two and three wide. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch but found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

HAY BABY GIRL hopped at the start, raced well off the pace four wide, made progress five deep around the far turn, continued on her left lead in the lane,
closed widest and was up and clear late. DON'T SPIN ME was bumped at the start, steadied off heels early, advanced two wide to the lead, cleared late on
the first turn, set the pace along the rail from there to deep stretch but was no match in the final strides. FRENCH NOUGET saved ground off the pace,
angled three wide near the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, rallied between foes and just missed second. LADY'S CORK settled off the pace
while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. MADEITOUTTAHARLAN lacked speed, raced two wide around
both turns, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SAVANNAH ROXANNA was bumped at the start, stalked the pace two wide and came
up empty in the lane. GLORIOUS MYSTERY set the early pace along the rail, angled out to chase two wide nearing the half-mile pole and tired after a half.

Footnotes
CAMGO stalked the duel in the clear three wide, bid three wide into the far turn, seized command leaving the three-sixteenths pole, drew off under a drive
while continuing on the left lead then was taken firmly in hand while drifting out late. MOTI saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide between foes
around the far turn and finished strongly through the lane. LASER LOOP settled off the early pace two wide between foes, made progress four wide around
the far turn and rallied for the show. CAVALLOTTO lagged off the pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. JEFFERY
SCOTT saved ground in range and lacked a rally. LOVE THAT JAZZ vied two wide around the first turn, cleared off down the backstretch, was collared
leaving the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. MISTER HUMOR failed to menace while racing four wide. CARTER'S RUN was outrun while racing three
wide. CATONSVILLE vied along the rail around the first turn, angled out to chase two wide down the backstretch and faded after a half. WILLS DEFENCE
played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
PARTY ROCK set the pace along rail, turned back a bid around the turn and drew off under a drive. BIRD TRAFFIC settled off the pace while racing three
wide, angled in leaving the quarter pole, lacked a serious rally but was up for second in the final strides. SAINTE THERESE stalked the pace from the rail
around the first turn, angled out nearing the far turn, bid two wide, was no match for the winner, continued on her left lead in the lane and lost second in final
strides. NOT A SECRET lacked early speed while racing two wide, went four wide around the far turn and improved position. SECRET O'LIFE saved
ground to no avail. HI HI HOLLY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SCOTTISH DENIS played no factor while racing two and three wide.
FOXY JOXY was bumped at the start, raced four and five wide and made little impact. GIVEN ACHANCE bumped at the start, stalked the pace two wide
and retreated after a half. SEEKING SERA was outrun while racing three wide.
