Footnotes
MR. DIGGER was forwardly-positioned along the rail down the home stretch the first time, saved ground on the first turn then dropped back a bit up the
backstretch, put to urging still inside on the far turn, moved up inside the leader in upper stretch, took a narrow lead in mid-stretch while drifting out a bit
under left-handed urging and held sway. SCOTTY WHO set the pace from off the rail in about the two path, edged clear on the far turn under mild coaxing,
was challenged by the aforementioned in upper stretch, headed in mid-stretch and was herded a bit while fighting on gamely. MOOSEWOOD raced outside
the leading quartet in the four to five path through the first turn, continued wide up the backstretch into the far turn going five deep on that bend, fought on in
the stretch to get up for show honors. HIT A LICK was two then three wide on the first turn just off the leading pair, advanced between foes up the
backstretch to challenge for the lead, continued three wide on the far turn and had no extra in the drive. DISCLOSED raced outside at the back in the five
path entering the first turn then shifted in a path, continued moving nearer inside to be three wide heading into the far turn and also being asked for run three
furlongs out, continued two to three deep on that bend and ran on near the inside in the stretch. VICTORY LANE went outside a foe three then four wide
through the first turn, edged closer to press from outside up the backstretch and in contention for the lead, went four deep on the far turn still outside rivals,
entered upper stretch between foes and lacked a late kick. BAD RABBIT was just off the fence in the two to three path on the first turn at the rear, continued
inside a rival at the back but on or just off the rail on the far turn, angled out four wide at the head of the stretch and failed to make a bid. Due to timer
malfunction no fractional splits were available.

Footnotes
DAN WHO attended from outside foes entering the turn five deep, moved in a path once clear of rivals, took charge at the head of the lane and forged clear
under steady handling till near the wire. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT prompted the pace from between rivals after urging from the start, kept on for place over
ALVIS, who pressed from inside, saved ground along the rail through the turn coming out just a bit leaving that bend, could not kick on with the top pair.
LINCOLN COUNTY KID attended from between foes four wide into the turn, steadied ever so slightly when in tight between entering the turn and shifted in
a path thereafter, ran on late. B A CHAMPION lacked early speed racing just off the rail, gained late inside before coming out nearing the wire. MICKEYS
GOLD switched off the inside leaving the backstretch to enter the turn well off the fence in about the four path, went wider still into upper stretch and was not
a threat. SEVEN ROONEY raced between foes three deep into the turn, dropped back and shifted in a path before angling out four deep at the top of the
stretch, failed to rally. CLABBERS WIN raced off the rail in the four path on the turn while dropping back to last, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SELFISH WOMAN pressed from outside early, went three wide into the turn, was overtaken by an outside rival in upper stretch, dug in to retake command
just outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. JAZZELLE broke inwardly, was coaxed forward to pursue the top pair in behind and near inside, shifted four
wide past the three-eighths, bid leaving the turn to take a narrow lead by the top of the stretch but was outfinished. W F LA VENADA was brushed lightly at
the break, set the pace facing pressure while racing off the inside, went in the two path through the turn, yielded in the stretch. BET IT ALL pursued the
leaders in behind and off the inside, raced in the four path on the turn, edged a little closer nearing the top of the stretch but could not rally thereafter.
TOWER WAGON was along the rail in the early going, shifted out early on the turn to be three wide nearing the quarter pole and five wide late on the turn,
improved position while never really a threat. MS HIGHSPEED chased briefly in the early going then continued mid-pack, saved ground on the turn and was
never a threat. THREE CHIPS was off slow and in a bit tight at the start then ridden strongly while switching outside of rivals up the backstretch, went in the
five path on the turn, shifted in to the three path leaving that bend and flattened out. MISS BLACK DOC was forced in at the break, raced outside a rival at
the back going two to three wide on the turn, moved out four deep into upper stretch and was never near enough to threaten. KISSES AND KICKS was
mid-pack to the turn going in the five then four path on that bend, came up empty and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
LUCK BE MINE set the pace racing well off the rail in the early stages, went in the two to three path on the turn, shook free turning for home, was clear and
held sway under steady handling. SHANGHAI KEELY stumbled at the start, was rank to place in behind traffic in the early going, found room to move up
and shadow the eventual winner going three to four wide through the turn, could make no headway but held second. SELECTION PARK raced outside off
the leaders into the turn going from the four path in to the two path by the latter part of that bend, gained mildly near but off the inside and missed second.
BRAVE CINDERELLA was inside till the turn then shifted out coming to the four path nearing the three-sixteenths, drifted out in mid-stretch and gained
some. SAMURAI'S GARDEN tucked in a bit to enter the turn three wide having dropped back off the leaders, was carried five wide on the turn and failed to
rally. SPANDEX BRITCHES raced in the three path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY FLASH stalked briefly then engaged outside INDIA WILKES, dueled with that one putting a head in front entering the turn, went four then three wide
on that bend, edged away late. INDIA WILKES broke outwardly, dueled inside LUCKY FLASH but off the rail entering the turn in the three path then moving
in a bit on the turn, yielded grudgingly late. SENORITA TAPIT broke outwardly, pressed briefly inside the top pair then continued to pursue them racing in
the two path then moving nearer the rail early on the turn, came out into upper stretch then lugged out a bit under a left-handed whip. STREET BELLA
veered in at the break, switched out heading up the backstretch, entered the turn about three wide moving out four deep midway on that bend, came out six
deep into the stretch and improved position position. PROSSER'S KITTEN lacked early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, swung out seven wide to
be widest for the drive and improved. MS. LEA lacked early speed, shifted in and saved ground on the turn then passed tired rivals. EYEJUST
TOOKCHARGE dwelt at the start, raced off the inside going in the three to six path through the turn and was never a threat. ICE BEFORE DAWN dwelt at
the start, passed rivals into the turn going four then three wide on that bend and was empty thereafter. SPIRITOFTHEDESERT chased from inside on or just
off the fence, dropped back, faded in the lane and was not persevered with the final sixteenth. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
