BOLT BROTHERHOOD was void of early speed, then made a wide move on the far turn, closed well to get up late. OLDFASHIONED CLUB pressed the
early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to draw clear, but was caught late. MIDNIGHT ACT traced the pace four wide but offered no rally, held
show. GENERAL PADDY lacked a rally. LUVINMEISEASY saved ground throughout. WOODBURY was not a threat while four wide. KID MAC COOL had
no rally while in between horses. SHEER MAYHEM set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way after five furlongs. WORTH HIS SALT raced five wide
and tired.

Footnotes
DREAMS UNTOLD set the pressured pace toward the inside, shook clear leaving the turn, was kept to task and held sway. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC
stalked the pace, came under a ride inside the three furlong marker, came four wide to make his bid, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner.
MARVIN came away a beat slow, moved up along the rail, shifted out entering the stretch and continued on to earn the minor award. CYRIL'S BOY was
unhurried into stride, rallied between horses into the stretch and was making up ground. THE POSER broke slow, was jostled between horses, was allowed
to settle, finished with a belated gain but failed to threaten. GUITAR TRIBUTE was allowed to settle and lacked the needed late response. SELF
AWARENESS shifted out and prompted the pace outside the winner through the turn, tired entering the stretch, was bumped near the furlong marker and
retreated. AMEN CORNER failed to respond. TAPPING THE GLASS broke slow, moved up three deep, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded.
BAND ON TOUR chased three wide, but bore out on the turn and dropped back. The jockey of THE POSER lodged an objection against
HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC for alleged interference at the start, but following the Stewards review there was no change to the order of finish.

Footnotes
WARM broke in bumping THREE HAWK at the start, tracked four wide, came to level terms on the turn, opened clear into the stretch and held safely.
NIGHTLIFE prompted the pace outside, fought on between, was unable to go on with the winner but stayed on to preserve the runner up spot. THREE
HAWK was bumped and shuffled back early, tucked in to save ground, got through and kicked on well to earn the minor award. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS was
close up along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, but flattened in the drive. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO was bumped and shuffled back early, circled five
wide to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. ITS A JOURNEY was slow into stride, came four wide and finished with a belated gain. NOT
LEAVING was away in good order, disputed the pace off the inside, but faltered leaving the turn and faded. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS contended between
horses to the turn and tired. STREGA NONNA was through after a half.

EMPTY NESTR Stalked the early pace while four wide, made a four wide move on the far turn to take command, drew clear in the stretch, then was kept to
a drive to prove best while clear. GAMBIT Set a pressured pace towards the inside, came into the stretch off the rail, proved to be no match for the winner
while saving place. TWOFORONESPECIAL Was four wide into the first turn, came into the stretch three wide, angled in the stretch for room to have a
belated rally. MARNESIA ONE STEP was reserved early while four wide, came into the stretch four wide to offer a rally but needed more. BEEBE'S BEST
BET pressed the pace three wide then weakened. GOTTAWAY Was allowed to settle on the inside but offered no rally. COWBOY GANDHI was not a factor
while four wide throughout. GOOFY BOY failed to menace. WHERE'S THE BEN'S Raced towards the inside and stopped.

ARTEMUS BRIDGE was settled early on the inside, moved up on the inside on the far turn, swung out four wide for the drive, closed well to get up late,
driving. JAG was well rated early, was boxed on the far turn while saving ground, angled out three wide for racing room, rallied well but was outfinished.
GLORY SONG was away alertly to set the pace, shook clear turning for home but faded late. GOLAZO raced wide early, then finished well late on the

Footnotes
SO SUBLIME vied for the early lead towards the inside, then was headed and dropped back past the quarter pole, then was resurgent in the stretch, drew
clear late, driving. PRIME TIME MAN was allowed to settle early, came into the stretch five wide, finished well. RIDE THIS TRAIN was settled back early,
commenced a five wide rally on the second turn, came widest into the stretch, belatedly. KOWBOY KING was allowed to settle early, made a four wide bid
on the far turn to assume command, but weakened in the drive. HE'S SMOKIN HOT had a five wide trip but offered no significant rally. POSHSKY was
reserved early, came into the stretch four wide, angled in for racing room in the stretch to pass the fading horses. SILVER DAGGER chased the early pace,
came into the stretch three wide but tired. CONTROLLED FURY failed to menace while four wide. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR pressed the early pace three
wide and stopped. INDYGO BREEZE raced three wide then stopped.
