SHE'S SO SPECIAL stalked a bit off the rail then between foes into and on the turn, rallied between rivals under strong handling and a late crack of the whip
to gain the advantage in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE saved ground stalking the pace, awaited room inside behind horses
leaving the turn then a bit off the rail to the sixteenth pole, came out off heels in deep stretch and got up for second four wide on the line. THANKS MR.
EIDSON had speed three deep then stalked three wide to the stretch and continued willingly between foes late. PHANTOM BOSS went up inside to duel for
the lead, fought back on the turn and through the stretch and continued willingly but was edged for a minor share late. ROOKIE MISTAKE was bumped then
bobbled just after the start, stalked outside a rival then three deep into the turn, fell back some on the bend, swung four wide into the stretch and also went
on willingly late. PARTY TOWN broke in and bumped a rival, dueled between horses then outside a foe, fought back between horses in the final furlong and
was outfinished but shared fifth.

Footnotes
SWISS SKYDIVER sped to the early lead, set the pace inside then came out some into the backstretch, angled back to the rail, responded when a rival
loomed alongside leaving the backstretch, edged away again on the second turn, widened while being shaken up a bit with a loose rein in midstretch and
won clear under a hold late. SPEECH stalked off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and continued willingly to be second best. MERNEITH had speed
outside the winner then stalked a bit off the rail, bid alongside that one a half mile out, continued just off the inside on the second turn and into the stretch
and weakened. REGAL BEAUTY broke a bit slowly, chased off the inside, dropped back on the second turn and had little left for the drive.

under urging in midstretch and proved best. CHARLITO chased off the rail then a bit off the fence on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and gained
the place. RAYRAY had good early speed and angled in, dueled inside, fought back on the turn and into the stretch and was edged late for second.
MYSTERY MAN stalked outside foes then bid four wide on the backstretch and most of the turn, came three deep into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. QUICKER a bit slow to begin, settled a bit off the rail then chased inside, continued along the fence into and through the stretch and lacked the
needed rally. BRAZEN stalked between rivals then bid three deep between horses on the backstretch and most of the turn, angled in a bit off the rail into the
stretch and also weakened. WINNING PROSPECT chased outside a rival then dropped back and angled in some on the turn and had little left for the drive.
