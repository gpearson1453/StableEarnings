Footnotes
EMCEE PRIME coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through solid splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole facing a
challenge for the initial time, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive repelling the threat and edged clear to the finish kept busy to
the wire. QUICK RETURN five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
offered up a bid to issue a challenge swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was shaken off a furlong out getting ultimately
rebuffed by the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. TRUE GRACE coaxed from the start, chased three wide down the backstretch and
then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch in behind QUICK
RETURN and came up empty. BOOK OF DELANCEY hustled from the gate, was devoid of speed chasing just off the inside coaxed along from the get go,
tucked inside through the turn, went two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BUSINESS CYCLE away well, attained a forward position, sat perched three wide with a good view of the pacesetter, crept up when ready approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, was still in hand challenging for the top, cemented himself ton the lead when roused a few strides late, chugged along on a fairly
comfortable advantage, finishing the final seventy yards being only mildly urged. DEEP SEA remained stationed along the inside route once the field had
been released, sat within range of the front runners during the opening half, was forced to remain on hold stuck in heavy traffic beginning from the end of the
bend, managed to tip into the four path and thus into freedom at the furlong grounds, mustered up a good response when finally asked for more and rallied
for second. HARDCORE FOLKLORE briefly spotted along the rail on the backstretch, took up the chase primarily from the two path, going about his
business from between opponents on the turn, got set down spinning into the lane, was outkicked. MONEYMEISTER along the outside throughout, travelled
three wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, flattened out in the last eighth. SWIPING DAN made
solid contact with EARNED SUCCESS at the start, got going, was pulling hard angling to the inside afterwards, stepped onto the turn and began to get out,
eventually shifting out about three to four wide, swung out five wide into the lane, came up empty. EARNED SUCCESS bumped soundly with its next stall
neighbor after coming out at the start, recovered and assumed a prominent position, disputed the pace two to three wide, found himself momentarily
between foes as the half was being completed, hung around as a forward factor for a little while longer then backed away. TIPSY MOOSE contended for the
top from just off the inside route for the opening half, gave way.

XANTHIQUE forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
dueling through the stretch and took narrow command a sixteenth from home, then dug in gamely to prevail. JOYOUS TIMES established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in confronted and dueled
through to the finish getting headed a sixteenth out, then fought on to the finish. JAZZIQUE (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside, got set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. INDOCHINE settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position. HOTSY TOTSY (IRE) three wide in pursuit, got let out angled four wide
for home, weakened in the stretch. FASHION'S STAR (IRE) just off the inside near the rear of the compact field, remained patiently handled until roused
spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, then offered no response.

Footnotes
HURRICANE HILL secured the pocket well before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch on the front runners within striking distance,
waited for suitable courses of action as the half was being complete, found some wiggle-space and inched towards path two at the head of the stretch,
came upon some room soon afterwards with which to split rivals and after getting cued up, did just that, this occurring in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
marker, emerged at the furlong marker as the new and undisputed leader, steadily padded the margin before getting geared down for the last few jumps.
UNPRECEDENTED cut over to the inside after the start, went to to bide time during the last stages of the run around the bend, cut the corner into the lane,
checked off the heels of a faltering DEPUTY FLAG just beyond the three-sixteenths pole,tipped into the two path and into clearance a couple of jumps or so
later, kicked in when given his cue, rallying with willingness to procure the place. WILD WILLIAM prompted the pace two to three wide, struck the front end
by a narrow margin as the half was being reeled off, held it for about a sixteenth, proving no match once the top one got rolling, weakened into the show
slot. FROSTED ROSE got moved to the outside on the backstretch, advanced into contention by launching a steady three wide run, angled towards path
five for entrance into the stretch, flattened out. FUTURE BOOK took up the chase from the two path, got sent out six wide from upper to midlane, made no
impact. COOLBOY settled into midpack after the break, travelled about the turn from the two path, got steered out four wide for the drive home, lacked the
needed response. PRETERNATURAL rode the hedge for the opening half, was on the move to the outside for the stretch run, eventually winding up seven
wide, made no headway. DEPUTY FLAG established the top after some brisk urging springing from the gate, got guided over to the inside, showed the way,
pressed by WILD WILLIAM from the outside, got displaced approaching the quarter pole, was taken in hand when the winner went whistling by a sixteenth
later, readily faded away coaxed from three-sixteenths pole onward..

Footnotes
LIL COMMISSIONER broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back BROKERS PRIZE in tandem with CALIFORNIA NIGHT, raced five paths off the
inside in aim of the front before advancing at the nine-sixteenths and tucking three wide, vied through the turn outside a pair coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. WALKOFF dueled
two to three wide with ARMAMENT to his outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and now vied inside a pair through the turn coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and got shaken off while well clear of the rest
to be along second best. ARMAMENT led early on before being engaged by the aforementioned foe, dueled from the four path with that rival to his inside,
tucked to the two path and was joined outside by the eventual winner, vied between rivals through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch in the midst of getting shaken off, then weakened in the drive. CALIFORNIA NIGHT broke out at the start bumping and
squeezing back BROKERS PRIZE in tandem with LIL COMMISSIONER, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through
the turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. SPECTACULAR PLUM broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. BROKERS PRIZE got
bumped between foes who each broke his way and was squeezed back at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, cornered just off the inside for home well behind and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
CORAGESCONTENDER strung out four wide on the opening bend, was one path closer to the inside on the subsequent one, sat reserved for nearly
three-quarters, returned to the four path for the drive home, closed in on the one to catch over the ensuing furlong, poking a head down in front by the
beginning of the final furlong, kept on going with good energy and shook free. SELFMADE remained stationed along the inside route after the start, vied as
the innermost of three during the initial stages until FRIDAYBEERS was allowed to ease back, went on to contend with YOUSAIDHELLO from the outside
thereafter, was given its cue for the drive home, came under attack from the top one shortly afterwards, got headed, saw that foe edge away but stayed on
for second. FALSE ALARM three wide early, raced from path two on the fuller turn, came into the stretch once more three wide, altered course into path five
in midlane, rallied mildly to secure the show. YOUSAIDHELLO vied for the lead from between rivals during the opening phases, began to spar one on one
with the runner up after the first fraction had been recorded, kept the pressure on until upper stretch before backing away. BIELEFELD proceeded five wide
heading for the backstretch, angled sharply over to the hedge a sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, got maneuvered back to the outside after stepping onto
the far turn, left the three-eighths pole from path four, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretcjh, beat several others despite being the widest of all for
much of the running of the event. FRIDAYBEERS forwardly placed three wide vying for the top, got eased back, chased the pace thereafter from the three
path, got set down spinning into the lane, still positioned three wide, put in a bid for the next sixteenth, made no headway and tired. TRUE PALACE sent
over to the hedge at the nine-sixteenths marker, rode it on second bend, got moved out approximately three wide once in the stretch, had no offering.
SUPPLY SIDER far back after striking the left side of the, loped along while continuing onward far back.

Footnotes
CRITICAL VALUE away without apparent mishap, crept up towards the top with willingness, responded and was eased back a bit by the pilot as the first
fraction was being finalized, kept watch on the ongoing three-way spat from just off the inside, left the half mile pole being lightly hand urged to keep pace of
the front runners, tipped to the outside until four wide wide and was given her cue at the five-sixteenths pole, closed in readily, availed of the good set-up
and took charge in upper stretch, left the eighth pole leading by a healthy margin, kept it, ridden out during the last few strides leading up to and then past
the sixteenth pole before lastly completing the event wrapped up. BIG Q disputed the pace from path three as the widest of three until the top of the lane,
proved no match for CRITICAL VALUE, held on well to salvage second. NAKED AVENGER along the outside throughout, was sighted four wide and being
urged along on the turn, lost position to the winner coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, departed that station from the five path and having been called
upon, was still five wide spinning into the lane, rallied mildly by weakening ones to secure the show. RISKY MISCHIEF went over to the rail, was the
innermost of three vying for the control until the head of the stretch, weakened after being overhauled by the winner. COURAGEOUS GIRL forced the issue
from between rivals until the top of the lane, going about the task from the two path, backed away steadily from the furlong grounds onward.

GIACOSA veered in at the start bumping TIMELESS JOURNEY into KISS AND RUN, chased three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, advanced and went four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in held safe to the finish. TWO CENT TOOTSIE

PARTNER, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive surging late to latch on the winner as that rival hit the wire. CRESCENT LADY three then two wide in aim of
the leader, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away for home, dug in under threat and was headed
a furlong out, fought on to the finish between foes in the late stages while safe for the show honors. KEPT WAITING three to four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BEYOND BROWN established the front and showed
the way in hand along the inside, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded command straightened away and weakened in the late
stages. TIMELESS JOURNEY got bumped at the start by the veering in GIACOSA and in turn bumped KISS AND RUN, chased just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no rally. KISS AND RUN got bumped askew at the start by TIMELESS
JOURNEY due to pressure from GIACOSA veering inwards, chased just off the inside into the backstretch pulling lightly on the bit and was taken in hand off
the heels of a rival with six and a half furlongs to run and then once more with six furlongs remaining, tucked to the hedge near the five-eighths pole,
advanced mildly once in a brief clear and was steadied half a mile from home as TWO CENT TOOTSIE took to the hedge in front into the turn, came under
brief coaxing and was taken hold once more near the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, had
the rider pause near the eighth pole before tipping out inside that station four to five paths under a light hand ride and made no impact. SPIN YOUR
