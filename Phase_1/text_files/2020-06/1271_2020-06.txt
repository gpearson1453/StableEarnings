Footnotes
JEWEL OF NAVARONE settled into stride off the leaders, began to advance outside four wide through the turn, draw alongside in upper stretch, was
bumped near the sixteenth pole and edged clear after that. P J'S FROG broke a half-step slowly, was forwardly-placed just off the leading pair, advanced
three wide into the turn taking a narrow lead early on that bend and moving in a path, challenged in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and
bumped the aforementioned near the sixteenths pole and was outfinished. TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR raced mid-pack off the inside, went in the two then three
path on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch then shifted inside the top two and gained mildly. MAD MAGICIAN vied outside a foe up the backstretch
then inside a rival early on the turn while shifting nearer the rail from about the two path, lacked the needed late kick. MOMMA JOKE trailed early, went in
the four to five path on the turn and did not threaten. F S GOLD pressed inside, began to drop back and was eased through the lane. Following a stewards'
inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
WEDDING DANCE set the pace from off the rail, went in the two path through the turn and asked for run at the top of the stretch with some right-handed
urging, continued to be hand urged past the sixteenth pole and held safe in a quick time. FLAXY LADY was within range outside, went four wide on the turn,
chased the winner but was no match. BUOYANCE was forwardly-positioned early racing three wide just off the leader into the turn, dropped back early on
that bend and came in a path, kept on evenly in the lane. RHYTHM'N SONG was back early, went outside five then four wide on the turn, evened out in the
lane. HUNKA BULL raced back and inside a foe early, entered the turn three wide, shifted five wide by the end of that bend and failed to rally. COMICS
CASHWAY raced just off the rail early, moved a bit nearer the rail at one point on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. A KISS FOR MOM raced
inside at the rear early, moved out a path on the turn, swung five wide turning for home and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GONNA' ROCK N ROLL was hustled at the break, vied outside runners four then three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit past the furlong marker with the
lead, turned back the challenge of SOUTHERN FIRE, who raced inside up the backstretch, moved out two wide entering the turn, shifted five deep coming
past the three-sixteenths, ranged up alongside the aforementioned in upper stretch but was held at bay. DANDY DON WHO raced off the leaders in behind
and inside, moved out a bit early on the turn, swung seven deep coming out of that bend, gained show honors late from PAC SUM HEAT, who raced close
up early, went three wide on the turn making a minor bid at the quarter pole and shifting in a path then, could not kick on with the top ones and lost third late.
MAGNIFICENT CHANCE was off the early leaders, advanced rapidly five then four wide on the turn reaching contention by the three-sixteenths, was in a bit
tight between foes near the eighth pole then ran on. THE GHOST OF DIXIE broke like a shot but was quickly outpaced early, chased five wide into and on
the turn and failed to rally. DAJUDGE showed brief speed inside foes, came out a bit early on the turn while dropping back and faded. RUNAWAY REGENT
vied between runners, began to drop back midway on the turn while shifting in, came up empty. SILVER SECRET R F reared badly at the start and was
away from the gate awkwardly, raced off the inside and showed a good run in the stretch despite being hopelessly far back. Following a stewards' inquiry no
action was taken.

D E LOVER settled off the leaders racing removed from the inside, went in the three path on the turn coming out just a bit leaving that bend before altering
in a path at the head of the stretch, put to urging and got up inside foes past the sixteenth to prevail. MR. MOOCH chased from outside but outsprinted
early, went four wide on the turn losing ground, continued on well in the lane and was bumped inside the final sixteenth. MYHOTRODLINCOLN was just off
the leaders from outside, went five wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in late stretch and bumped a rival. HOLLYWOOD HENRY was urged forward at the
break, moved through inside to set the pace, edged clear on the turn racing in the two path, led till just past the sixteenth pole and weakened. LODE THE
GOLD chased between rivals early then going three wide on the turn, came out a path leaving that bend, lacked the needed late kick. E J'S GOLD chased
inside and failed to rally. FLASH OF HUMOR broke a half-step slowly, trailed racing off the inside, went in the five path on the turn and out a further path
into the stretch, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
TOX settled off the leaders racing outside, advanced four wide on the turn, taking closer order into upper stretch, struck the lead inside the final furlong and
drove clear. STRIKE A STORM was closer than the aforementioned early while stalking from outside, bid four wide on the turn taking the lead by the
three-sixteenths and was clear turning for home while drifting in just a bit, overtaken in mid-stretch and outkicked. GOOD OLD FRIEND set the tempo on a
clear lead racing near inside but mostly in about the two path on the turn, was overtaken late on that bend and weakened. WISHFUL SLIM raced well back
early inside a rival, continued inside going two then three wide on the turn and wider into upper stretch, improved position. RUFFY STICK chased in behind
the pacesetter outside a foe, went three wide on the turn, gave way in the stretch. NO DOUBT raced outside a foe well back, went three to four wide on the
turn, moved out a bit further into upper stretch and needed more late. FORTY FIVES STORM chased inside just off the rail, came out a bit leaving the turn
and came up empty. ATTILA'S FLAG chased in behind the leaders off the inside, shifted in to about the two path leaving the backstretch, tired. CORDES
switched out heading up the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to rally.
