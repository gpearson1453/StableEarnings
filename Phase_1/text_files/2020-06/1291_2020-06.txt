Footnotes
CURLIN BEAUTY stalked the pace while racing along the inside, gained command with three-sixteenths of a mile to run, drew off through the lane and was
in hand late. UPGRADE ME raced three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace throughout, was no match for the winner but clearly second best.
CALLHERMRSGELNER broke sharply, pressed the pace while racing outside a rival but lacked the needed late response. TWINS PLUS A DOT raced four
wide on the first turn, was in mid-pack throughout and failed to respond when called upon. CYBER SENSATION showed no speed and improved his
position late. SMART BUCK raced five wide into the first turn, was close up for a half mile, was three wide through the final turn and tired. SECRET JOY
was away alertly, set the early pace while saving ground and tired. BUGGELS GIRL unhurried early, raced between foes and was never a factor. ST MARIA
broke in the air and never menaced.

SWIFTOWN MISS broke sharply and dropped back after the start, angled out for the drive, responded when asked and drew clear late.
CALLMEONMYCELLFONE was never far back outside a rival, raced three wide through the turn, could no match strides with the winner in the late going
but was clearly best of the rest. CHERRY TWIST, away alertly, set the pace and weakened in the final furlong. CARSON'S PROSPECT pressed the pace
while racing outside a rival and tired in mid-stretch. PROMISE TENDER stalked the pace from the rail and faded in the late going. Z PRIDE saved ground to
no avail.

JUST FOR CASEY disputed the pace between rivals, took over into the second turn, shook off IYATTA entering the stretch, was wrapped up in the final
sixteenth and scored with something left. IYATTA tracked three deep, loomed a danger midway through the second turn, was no match for the winner but
stayed on to hold the place. GET ONE MORE bobbled at the start, was unhurried into stride, settled off of the inside, angled out and finished willingly to
earn the minor award. IMAJIMMYCREED broke outwardly, was slow into stride, tucked in to save ground, got through and finished with a belated
improvement. VERITY JANE was shuffled back into the first turn, settled off of the inside and lacked a response when called upon. KISS ME LILY was
allowed to settle in mid pack and failed to threaten. CITY GONE COUNTRY vied along the inside to the second turn and retreated. TAKE CHARGE
TAYLOR was close up along the inside to the second turn and stopped.

FORESTDUNGONE disputed the pace toward the inside, opened clear nearing the quarter pole, widened into the stretch and held safely. BINDING settled
saving ground, got through and finished willingly to earn the runner up spot. CAPTAIN TYREE was allowed to settle, came under a ride into the second turn,
got through entering the stretch, shifted out for the final furlong but flattened. JOEMO was allowed to settle, finished with a belated improvement but failed to
threaten. RAHFEES MAN contested the pace through the second turn and faltered. LANDING MAN was close up three wide, but came up empty midway
through the second turn and retreated. SPRING RODEO broke in the air to get away behind his field and was never a factor. MEDIAMAKER broke slow and
never recovered.
