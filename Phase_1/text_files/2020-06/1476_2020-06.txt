Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT broke slow, raced well off the rail while staying off the leaders, moved up in tandem with a foe on the turn, came very wide into the
stretch, was floated out and then ridden out to pass a foe for the win. FLAT OUT FAST lacked room shortly after the start, split horses on the first turn, raced
off the rail well back of the leaders,rallied on the turn with another horse, led and drifted out in the stretch while unable to withstand the winner late.
CONGRUITY went to the front, dueled off the rail and leveled out in the stretch. CROWN TO THE GOLD lost footing at the start, moved off of the water at
the rail,on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, re-raliied to move up and leveled out in the stretch. REVOLT was no threat.
SITEENPARKSIDELANE dueled outside, was under whip urging at the top of the turn and faltered. Race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
ALEXANDRIA sharp start, led throughout under stout hold, cleared on her own and winning as rider pleased to dominate the field. GONNABEGOOD was
off very tardy with a widest rush to the turn with a bid but was no match for the winner and settled for place spot. LEJEUNE saved ground to turn, improved
position while no threat. CONGRATS JENSEN raced evenly from off rail throughout. TAP THE TOWN failed to keep up, faded in the stretch. SHEZ
SHACKED UP raced forwardly to the stretch, faltered in the drive. HAPPY AS YOU GO was off very slow from the gate and never a menace.
GOOSEISONTHELOOSE never a menace. CRYPTO'S IMAGE dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
GOT THE NOTION broke in and bumped a foe at the start, took the lead off the rail in the first turn, and repulsed a late bid by a closing foe while drifting in
under the whip. LIZZY'S LURE stalked inside, moved up nearing the turn, split horses and was bumped at the top of the stretch, angled in past the eighth
pole and closed fast but was rebuffed by a game winner. THIRSTY ACTOR was unhurried, saved ground while starting a bid on the turn, and rolled on the
rail in the stretch but was beat for place late. GIANT TRICK tracked off the leader, was bumped at the top of the strretch and flattened out. TERMINAL
SPEED was mid pack in a strung out field, rallied on the turn to contend and faltered in the stretch. MYSTIC TIGER was bumped at the start, widest out of
the first turn, and no threat. Due to a timer malfunction the seven furlong fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
TIZ RED WINE sent quickly outside, set all pace while well handled and cleared in the stretch to hold sway to the wire. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER chased
winner throughout with a mild run in the final furlong. EDGE OF NIGHT good position from outside to stretch, grinded away for show spot. LUCKY AT
JUSTICE broke sharp, shuffled back from inside to the stretch, rallied along well late to move up. SUPERSTAR DIVA raced evenly along with no late kick
when needed in the drive. HEADFIRST saved ground to no avail throughout. CANDY LANE was through coming out of the turn. BOURBON 'N DITCH
never a real menace. MISS PINKERTON broke awkward while bumped around, went extremely wide to the turn and never recovered. SILENCIA had a
steady fade back from outside. Race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

BOOTS N' BATTLE was off a bit tardy, raced unhurried to the turn, moved up in the five path and drove past the field in the stretch. PRINCESS DANIELA
tracked the leader, moved up in the two path on the turn and drifted out in the stretch while keeping on for second. STORMY MEMO chased the pace,
rallied in the three path on the turn, was floated out in the stretch before faltering late. SANCTUAIRE SPOT was the speed off the rail, but tired past the
eighth pole.

Footnotes
CANUSTAYTONIGHT just off leader to turn, took over out of the turn while going away to the wire as much the best. TIZ STELLA inside to turn, angled out
into stretch, split horses and rallied for place. GALLOPING HARMONY off tardy, made a steady advance and ran along for the show spot while cutting the
gap. PSYCHOANALYST saved ground to turn, angled out stretch, outfinished for show. QUEEN CITY KITTY off tardy, made a steady run to the turn
outside with a bid at the furlong pole but flattened out late in a good effort. TREASURE WILBURNYA flipped in the paddock during saddling and never a
menacing factor. KAYLEE'S HOPE was through early and dropped back. IT WILL HAPPEN chased entry mate to the stretch but gave way readily in the
drive. NANA ROZE was through early and dropped far back.
