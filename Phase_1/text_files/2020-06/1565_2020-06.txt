Footnotes
COME ON CITY (GER) stalked the pace pressuring on the backside then through the far turn, dueling abreast foe in upper stretch would drift out eight wide
late going clear. CHASING THE KITTY rushed clear set the pace under pressure through the backside dueling on the far turn, extending inside of rival in
upper stretch would angle six wide as foe drifted ceding in the final yards. BROKE FINANCING raced evenly throughout being roused at mid track down the
lane lacking surge there. MILA'S DREAM (IRE) raced evenly through the backside then weakened on the far turn. MISS DURLYN faded on the backside.
FLATTER ME OWEN was always outrun. Due to timer malfunction six furlong split was unavailable.
