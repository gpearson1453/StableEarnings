Footnotes
JORNALERO bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, prompted the pace from outside a foe entering the turn four wide, moved in a bit late on that bend
while edging to the fore, drifted in when clear at the top of the stretch and held sway. MY STORM WARRIOR broke inwardly, was well-placed outside and
up close early, eased back from outside rivals and moved in a bit going in the three to four path and unhurriedly on the turn, moved out five deep having
reached upper stretch, ran on well late to get up for second. CAUGHT STEALING broke inwardly, chased in behind the leading pair, was outside rivals into
the turn going four then five wide on that bend, made a mild and brief bid in upper stretch then evened out and lost the place late. INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM
was lightly bumped at the break, shifted in and moved forward up the backstretch going between rivals two deep on the turn, moved in a little bit late on that
bend having drawn to within striking distance but had no late kick. STAY AWAY JONESY broke a half-step slowly and consequently lost the path as an
outside rival broke inwardly, moved to the rail and chased from inside, took closer order on the turn, switched outside a rival past the three-sixteenths as that
one came in just a bit and ran on. GUSHER broke inwardly, trailed while racing off the inside, went in the four path on the turn, swung out six deep into
upper stretch and was not a threat. CHROMATIC JAZZ encouraged forward while moving out after the start, vied inside the eventual winner while racing
well off the rail, went in the three path through the turn, was overtaken at the quarter pole, came out a bit turning for home while weakening and faded. Due
to timer malfunction race was hand-timed.

Footnotes
BULLY BABY broke alertly and was quickly clear to dictate terms racing off the inside, was joined on the outside by ONE MARK after the opening
three-sixteenths, dueled inside that one but several paths removed of the rail, was never headed and dug in gamely to hold sway. ONE MARK moved
forward after the opening furlong, ranged up outside BULLY BABY to duel, went four wide on the turn, gave good effort but could no get past the winner.
SEVENTH HENNESSY reared at the start spotting the field a couple lengths, moved forward just off the inside and advanced past a rival on thet urn going
in the two to three path on that bend, was no match for the top pair but got up for show honors over DIGGER'S GOLD, who broke inwardly just a bit, raced
outside off the dueling leaders heading to the turn, shifted in entering that bend to about the two path, moved in a bit more turning for home and lacked the
needed late kick. SMOOTH BLUES chased from inside a rival but off the fence, continued in the three to four path on the turn while dropping back and failed
to rally. ROGUE WAVE raced well back along or just off the inside and was never a threat. CORNERSTONE raced outside at the rear, went in the two to
three path on the turn and was not a threat. WHISKEY WORTHY went wrong heading up the backstretch, lost the rider and was vanned off. Following a
stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
AISLE RUNNER stalked from outside, bid four wide entering the turn taking command past the five-sixteenths and moving in a bit soon after, had an outside
challenger in FILL THE BILL but quickly disposed of that rival under just moderate hand urging, the rider looked back past the furlong marker and he was
ridden out thereafter. FILL THE BILL settled off the leaders, moved outside swiftly five then four wide early on the turn, got to within half a length in a minor
bid about the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. SHAMEFULLY SWEET set the pace from off the inside with an outside pursuer, entered the turn
in the three path with rivals now outside and inside and steadied just slightly near the quarter pole, dropped back at that juncture but ran on in the stretch to
get show honors. W F RIP TIDE veered in a bit after the start, was lacking speed despite some encouragement, saved ground on the turn before angling
eight wide turning for home, improved position. QUICK LAUGH chased from between rivals, went two wide on the turn and failed to rally. DIABOLICAL
PACKAGE was bumped lightly at the break, chased in behind the leaders and outside rivals, went in the three to four path on the turn, came out six wide
into upper stretch and flattened out. ILIKEROLLIN saved ground on the turn but failed to rally. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT bumped the inside rival at the start,
raced well back in about the three path on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
ZESTY JAZZMAN set the pace with moderate outside pressure racing a path off the rail, edged clear midway on the turn, was given mild encouragement
about three-sixteenths out, drifted about a little bit in the lane but was kept to the task and held sway. BENJAMIN WHO was forced out at the start, moved
up outside foes, went four wide and within range on the turn and turning for home but could make no headway on the winner while securing the place.
BAND OF GLORY pressed the winner from outside going three wide on the turn, asked for a little more past the quarter pole, and offered no extra in the
lane. PUB was within range inside early, continued on or just off the rail on the turn before moving out a further path into upper stretch while dropping back
and failed to rally. FARMER FRED R F was outpaced early, raced off the fence in about the four path on the turn, passed tired rivals while gaining mildly
late. FLYING WARRIOR was fractious in the gate then hopped at the start, raced mostly in the two path and tired in the stretch. PROSPECTOR AL broke
outwardly, was in behind and up close early, went three wide on the turn while dropping back, shifted in at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLAVICHORD settled in behind the leaders, moved three wide and between foes coming to the quarter pole, angled out leaving the turn to emerge six deep
for the drive and within striking distance, took charge a sixteenth out and drew off. K P RIGHT OF WAY broke awkwardly and had to be taken hold of,
switched out moving widest of all heading up the backstretch, swept five wide early on the turn taking the lead at the five-sixteenths then edging clear into
upper stretch, was overtaken a sixteenth from home and could not kick on with the winner while clearly second best. GOGO OXBOW prompted from outside
going four then three wide on the turn, proved no match for the top two. BABO STORM stumbled at the start but quickly recovered to be
forwardly-positioned between runners early, dropped back while in the three path on the turn but kept on in the lane to regain position. YUUUGE PARTY
pressed from inside but a path removed from the rail, weakened. JUST AWESOME M raced off the inside behind rivals at the rear early, went in the two
path into the turn, shifted in past the quarter pole, improved position in the stretch. TESTING THE WATERS raced three to four wide outside and in behind
foes in the early going, failed to rally and was in a bit tight at the wire. INDY MOON was within range early after shifting in, saved ground into the turn before
moving out a path or two late on that bend, was never a threat. PALICE REVENGE broke outwardly, chased from outside and in behind the leaders into the
turn going four to five wide on that bend, tired.

Footnotes
STEALING HOME vied between runners into the turn going six then five wide on that bend and taking the lead past the quarter pole, drew off in the lane
under urging. EASTER DREAM vied between runners off the inside four wide into the turn, moved in a path contending still between foes on that bend,
could not kick on with the winner but was second best. MAMA'S KID raced in behind the leaders after breaking just a hair slowly, went in the two path on the
turn before moving out three wide turning into the stretch, shifted inside foes at that juncture and ran on to gain show honors from MEENA'S MAGIC, who
was forwardly-placed between rivals contending for the lead five wide, moved in a path along with those inside and out about midway on the turn, came out
a bit for the drive and lacked the needed late kick. I AM A DEPLORABLE raced well back early from between foes, went in the three to four path on the turn,
swung out seven deep turning for home and ran on mildly late. CAN'T GET AWAY vied outside rivals early, went seven wide on the turn and had no late
bid. STORM SHAKER shifted in early, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn and had no rally. LAKE MARY broke sharp but lacked early speed and
dropped back, raced outside foes toward the rear into the turn going four to five wide on that bend, swung about eight wide into upper stretch and failed to
rally. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT showed brief speed inside then steadily weakened. ENDLESS THYME vied between runners then inside foes on the turn,
appeared to go awry near the furlong marker, was attempted to be pulled up but lost the rider, was caught by the outrider and vanned off. Following a
stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
