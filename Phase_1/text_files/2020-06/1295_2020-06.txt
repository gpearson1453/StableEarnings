Footnotes
MINER'S NOTION was racing along the inside and when Jimbo's Biz came well of the rail turning for home slipped through to get to the front and then drew
clear. EXCESSIVE KID was well off the pace early and when the leader came very wide on the turn slipped through and was up for second. PICADILLY
ROADSTER came wide on the turn and then was forced six wide when the leader came well off the rail and finished well for third. JIMBO'S BIZ was on the
lead and the rail in a four horse speed duel came wide entering the lane taking several rivals wide allowing the eventual first and second place horses
through a big hole on the inside. BEIRUT was racing midpack and got an advantage when the leaders went wide and made a mild bid. PORT AGGREGATE
raced mid pack while off the rail and never mounted a rally. TETON was the third horse out in the speed duel and was forced very wide entering the stretch
and tired. XAVIER DAVEY showed good speed four deep and was carried out entering the stretch and lost all chance. MAYHAWK came wide entering the
stretch and could not make up ground. HYPER DRIVE was up close in the two path and stopped on the turn.

for the lead in the two path and gave way. LADY ELSA was well off the pace in the early stages was wide and could not make up the needed ground.
GRADIOACTIVE was very wide up the backstretch came to the rail on the turn but was empty in the stretch. LIL JESSIE showed good early speed in the
three path but tired through the stretch. ZIBO raced along the rail midpack and offered no rally. FRAN'S EMPIRE raced in the two path while well back and

Footnotes
PAROLEE was in tight quarters up the backstretch between foes but was able to angle to the rail in the turn and came through along the inside when a
small hole opened up and took command after that. COLORADO CANDY showed good speed in a three horse speed duel came off the rail a bit entering
the stretch to allow the winner to come through and was second best today. ROCKIN O raced along the inside and was able to get up for third. DOUBLE
ONE SHOT was wide up the backstretch then in the two path in a three horse speed duel and tired. MACHO ON DAX was the outside horse in the three
horse speed duel and gave way in the lane. WHATATRIP raced along the inside and passed a few foes in the lane. I'M A STAR raced six wide on the turn
and could not make up ground. VONSTER showed speed for a quarter along the inside and tired. TRE raced midpack and had no rally. DUDE raced mid
pack while well off the rail and could not make up ground. SUNSHINE WHISKEY was always well back.
