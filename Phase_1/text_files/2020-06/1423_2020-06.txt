Footnotes
AMPHITRITE , three deep around the turn while chasing the pace, took the lead inside the eighth pole and drove clear. ZIG sped to the early lead, set the
pace slightly off the rail around the turn, failed to match strides with the winner late but held on gamely to best the others. MILLIE CHILD saved ground on
the turn, moved into the stretch in the two path and rallied between rivals. MY LILA dropped back on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and
offered a late rally. UTTERLY ENCHANTING , four wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to rally in an even effort.
HEELSTOTHESKY saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and weakened. TRADING CENTS , very wide in the stretch, passed
tired horses. ADABEL , very wide on the turn, was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and gave way. SI MAMACITA , well positioned between horses
on the turn, was checked in tight quarters entering the stretch. PARCHED GHOST , no factor, saved ground on the turn. ANOTHER WHIM , very wide, was
outrun. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK prompted the pace outside ZIG and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CATERINA ONE sped to a clear early lead, dropped in then was headed leaving the far turn, rated kindly while stalking past the three eighths, shifted out a
bit soon into lane, came back under right handed rousing and took a short lead a sixteenth out, kept on while on her left lead, dug in when confronted late
and just lasted. CAROLINA ICE stalked to the inside of a rival mid turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed steadily under pressure, drifted out late and just
missed. WHO U GONNA CALL settled off the pace about two wide, leveled off past the furlong grounds, split rivals and finished well to gain. MISSIMARD
angled in early, chased while saving ground into the lane, edged up past the eighth pole but flattened out very late. POLISHED GAL settled off the pace,
circled five wide making some progress into the stretch but failed to seriously sustain. NEVISIAN SUNSET saved ground off the pace, eased out late and
had run while steadying off heels near the wire. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA broke a step slow, raced four wide into the lane and failed to menace.
PETTICOATSNPISTOLS , four wide mid turn, angled six wide into the lane but lacked a bid. SCARFREE had speed to the inside of the winner, steadied
back off that one nearing the turn, angled out and rebid in hand to take command early turn, moved clear mid turn, remained clear while under a drive past
mid stretch, ceded command a sixteenth later then faltered late. MAE SAI PRINCESS edged up four wide after a light brush leaving the gate, chased four
wide into the lane then faded near mid stretch.

TUTTI BENVENUTI advanced three wide leaving the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole and prevailed under steady handling.
TELLMEONASUNDAY prompted the pace outsider BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL, bid for the lead between horses in upper stretch and continued gamely.
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA drifted five deep mid way on the turn, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. PENSABA , two wide
on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied between horses. BERNADETTE THE JET , bumped and forced in by BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL leaving
the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL bore in after stumbling at the break, rushed up inside
horses to take the lead mid way down the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and gave way in the drive. DARLING'S CURE , wide around the turn, was
outrun. BOURBON GYPSY trailed.

approaching the stretch, shook clear under a hearty drive in upper stretch and held firm while kept to task. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE tracked the leaders while
saving ground, got through entering the lane and kept on willingly to earn the place. JOYFUL NOISE was squeezed back at the break, angled wide nearing
the turn, worked her way five wide and between rivals into the lane, altered in near the sixteenth pole and finished with interest. SPLENDOR GAL , off the
pace, raced four wide into the stretch, advanced between rivals in mid stretch, steadied briefly near the sixteenth pole, regrouped and churned on.
FLIRTATION WALK chased off the inside, edged closer four wide and between runners past the five sixteenths, had aim in upper stretch but flattened out.
GIRL DRAMA set a pressured pace off the rail, ceded command into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY
rushed up between rivals early, chased and gave way. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE saved ground, edged up some in upper stretch, steadied lacking room
near mid stretch, angled out and had interest under some hand pressure. GREASEDLIGHTNING circled the turn five to six wide and gave way. R TRUE
SENSATION disputed the pace between foes, failed to keep pace entering the lane and dropped back. WILKO LOVESONG was outrun.

Footnotes
TAMBORA advanced outside horses on the turn, challenged for the lead approaching the stretch, dueled and prevailed under brisk urging. HAMMERS
VISION , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, was taken to the inner rail turning for home and finished gamely. LA MAQUINA GRIS , five deep
around the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. COBH bumped with TWIN VALOR leaving the starting gate, was well
placed four wide between horses turning for home and lacked the necessary late effort. BARON OF BLUEGRASS sped to the early lead, saved ground
around the turn, angled to the two path turning for home, dueled and weakened. HIGH ROLLER , five wide around the turn, failed to menace in an even
effort. BAYTOWN GLORY raced in the three path between horses on the turn and failed to rally in an even performance. INCENSED was not a factor.
JONATHAN MCD , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor. SWING STEP was outrun. THE FORTY FACTOR , inside horses around the turn,
chased the pace and gave way. TWIN VALOR bumped with COBH leaving the starting gate, swung to the eight path in mid stretch and gave way.

LASTING UNION gained a slim lead inside a quartet of rivals into the first turn, edged clear leaving the three quarter pole, was joined by M.J.'S LADY past
the three furlong marker, kept that one at bay and then encountered a challenge from SKI BUNNY into the lane, dueled on near even terms past the eighth
pole then edged clear late under a drive. SKI BUNNY broke inward, was corrected and vied three wide between rivals into the first turn, rated back kindly
into the backstretch, came back and bid three deep past the five sixteenths, battled head to head with the winner from upper stretch to about the sixteenth
pole then gave way grudgingly. WHITE WINGED DOVE settled off the pace while saving ground, moved up leaving the far turn, angled out nearing the lane,
raced on her left lead and churned on with interest. SOMEWHERE GOLDEN saved ground, advanced inside rivals heading to the far turn, eased out under
pressure into the lane, shifted back in and went evenly late. M. J.'S LADY , with the pace four wide between foes into the first turn, steadied briefly near the
six furlong marker, came back to bid outside the winner mid way on the final turn, forced the issue into the lane then gave way past the three sixteenths.
SING ALONG SUZY was steadied along nearing the backstretch, lost ground and gave way. LADY MAGNOLIA , five deep into the first turn, dropped in a
path to stalk, stayed in range to the far turn then gave way. WINNING MELODY broke outward, forced the pace two wide between runners nearing the
seven eighths, chased past the five eighths then was done before going six furlongs. SEVEN CLUBS , squeezed back at the break, raced off the pace while
between rivals with a half mile remaining, failed to kick on and faltered through the fnal quarter mile.

Footnotes
BUSTOFF disputed the pace two wide for five furlongs, opened up turning for home and lasted under brisk urging. BOBBY G saved ground around the turn,
angled off the rail entering the stretch, rallied nicely and drifted out late. HANALEI'S HOUDINI , five deep leaving the turn, flattened out. ROUGH SEA , three
wide on the turn chasing the pace, lacked the needed rally. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , along the rail entering the turn, lacked room turning for home, angled to
the five path and showed a late move. TATTOOED , a forward factor inside horses, chased the pace and weakened. COLONEL JUAN stumbled at the
break, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE , steadied in traffic entering the turn, lacked a rally. THE RIGHT
PATH lacked speed, raced along the inner rail leaving the turn and was never a factor. RUBY BLEU disputed the early pace while along the inner rail and
gave way in upper stretch. BELFOUR trailed and was eased.

Footnotes
EASTERN BAY broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated between rivals, took command then went clear into the turn, set the pace two wide into the
lane, drifted out a bit while widening past the three sixteenths, was corrected with right handed encouragement then was fully extended to hold sway.
ABSENTEE saved ground in range early, eased out leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane and finished strong to gain. FORTUNATE FRIENDS ,
away well, chased the winner while three wide around the turn, was under pressure into the lane and gave way grudgingly. PREMIER STAR , off last after
bobbling, regrouped to find himself well off the early pace and off the inside, commenced a run leaving the three eighths, circled six wide into the lane and
kept on with interest. CERULEAN SPRINGS lagged off the pace while saving ground, remained inside, eased out and finished with decent energy between
rivals. HALL PASS lacked speed while off the rail, raced five wide into the stretch, shifted in for the final furlong and had some kick between horses. TAPPIN
CAT stalked the pace, came four wide into the lane and faded. CHARGE TO VICTORY had speed then chased to the inside of a rival, shifted out into the
stretch, kept on past mid stretch then wilted late. PERFECT COVER had some early foot then steadied back off foes after a furlong, saved ground moved
up nearing mid stretch then flattened out. FOLLOW THE DOG flashed speed, pursued off the rail, gave way and was eased late. TRUE BOLDNESS was
outrun. RUNAWAY LUTE fell after breaking through the gate pre race, was examined and reloaded, steadied soon after the start, raced off the inside, failed
to keep pace and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
FIRTH accelerated to the early lead, angled in, set the pace near the rail, responded to urging in mid stretch and drew off. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD chased
the pace, challenged for the lead outside the winner in mid stretch but was out finished. DANCINGWITHPAYNTER came out shortly after the break, hugged
the inner rail leaving the far turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and had a slight rally. JUMPSTARTMYHEART , wide the far turn, was in the five path
in mid stretch and rallied mildly. CASSIDY AVE saved ground the first turn, raced between horses turning for home and weakened. JANELLE DREAMS
lacked speed, was wide around the far turn, floated to the six path in mid stretch and passed tired horses. DANGEROUS WOMAN , a forward factor outside
horses, weakened through the stretch. CAPUCINE was no factor. WAR TWEET , a forward factor outside horses the far turn, was four wide entering the
stretch and weakened. YESTERDAYSPLAN , steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, lacked speed, stumbled and swerved out near the half mile
pole.
