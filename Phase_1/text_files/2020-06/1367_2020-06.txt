leader from the inside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MADAME BOVERY was unhurried early
and was roused from the inside on the turn but was never a threat. GABBY'S BALLERINA was in range early but trailed on the turn and had no impact.

STRATEGIC VISION showed speed from the inside, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. MOCAL stalked the
early leader, raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. FLAMBORO JEWEL was hustled early and roused on the
turn but was no real threat. ALMOST DANCER was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.
