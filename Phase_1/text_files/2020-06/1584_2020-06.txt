TWISTED REGAN was allowed to settle well behind the pace along the inside angled out for the drive and found room between foes to engage for the lead
and steadily drew clear in the late stages. YANKEE PRIDE raced four wide on the turn took the lead at the stretch call but could not hold off the winner in
the final eighth. NOT THAT I RECALL was five wide turning for home then forced to fan out even wider entering the stretch and could not make up the
needed ground. CHEVERIE hugged the rail the entire race first engaging for the lead and then through the lane while not being able to gain ground.
EXTREME CAUTION showed good speed in the two path relinquished the lead up the backstretch but was still in contention until tiring inside the eighth
pole. DRAFTY BREEZE made a big move up the backstretch to open up a sizable lead but had nothing left and dropped back quickly turning for home.

Footnotes
VONSTER was parked four deep most of the mile came into contention at the top of the stretch drifted in through the lane but still proved best. I'M A STAR
showed the best early speed and hugged the rail until the top of the stretch when he came out a bit hooked in a long stretch duel but could not match strides
with the winner. ARCH SEEKER chased the pace for much of the race angled out for the drive but then went back to the inside and could not make up
ground. TOP HAT HUSTLE raced in the two path just off the pace but had no rally. JUSTPLAINALBERT raced along the inside the entire mile but never
mounted a rally. YOU ARE IN LUCK raced in the three path much of the race and had no rally. WILD PAINT raced in the three path but had nothing in the
drive. SHOWEM APOLLO was wide into the first turn while well back and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
REAL HEAT raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive and wore down the pacesetters to win going away in the final sixteenth. PUT YOUR
PANTS ON battled for the lead while three wide drifted in through the stretch but held second. HOWDY KINGKOWBOY showed good speed along the
inside had to alter course in the stretch when Put Your Pants On drifted in. After a stewards inquiry there was no change. HE COULD made a move four
wide on the turn but could not sustain that bid through the lane. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE raced along the inside and had no rally. HOT BLOODED SONG
raced five wide on the turn for home and could not make up ground. I'M LUCKY was away very quickly and showed speed for the first 100 yards and then
dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
COLLEGE PARTY was showing good speed in the three path up the backstretch came in going into the turn forcing several horses to check went on to
draw clear through the stretch After a stewards inquiry, College Party was placed fifth. SUM CANDY came six wide entering the stretch and made up some
ground. SILIS was racing along the inside in good position but was forced to take up when College Party came over and started a chain reaction continued
on along the inside and finished with interest while drifting out some. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER was up close along the inside going into the turn stayed
clear of the trouble but had nothing for the drive. FINE WITH ME was in good position between rivals when College Party Came in and had to take up
sharply re gathered and finished well. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC was four wide on the turn and was caught in tight quarters through the lane. SPUR was
caught in tight quarters through the stretch and forced to briefly steady. BILLIE D raced midpack and had no rally. NAIVASHA MONTANA did not seem to
get away with a good start and was not a factor in the outcome. HOLY CLEM was well back throughout and not a factor.

COLLUSIONIST was allowed to settle behind the pace came to the outside and circled the field four to five wide and drew clear to win easily.
ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST had a two path trip came out a bit in the drive and was up for second. SKY T showed the best early speed and got to the rail but
could not match strides with the top two through the stretch. WHISKEYDRUNKAGAIN raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. A J SAMURAI was
up close while three wide and tired. DUGABOY BROWN was well back the entire race and never a serious factor.
