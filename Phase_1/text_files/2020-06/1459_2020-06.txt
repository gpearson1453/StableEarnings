Footnotes
FRENCH CHARM bumped lightly with JUSTCALL ME CANDY leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the backstretch and lapped onto the leader through
the turn, dueled into the stretch, edged clear just into the final furlong and held under a drive. ANITA GRIGIO hopped leaving the gate then stalked the pace,
rode the rail on the turn then gained steadily through the stretch. CLASSY N' SILENT led quickly, set a pressured pace, was engaged late turn and dueled
into the stretch then yielded in the final furlong. SIX PACK GIRL broke slowly and settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide through the turn then
finished gamely. JUSTCALL ME CANDY bumped with FRENCH CHARM at the outset, stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn but evened out in
the late stages. MINE FAST PHILLY raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, closed into the stretch then flattened out. BUSINESS CLASS
settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn then was eased up through the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MERVEILLEUX pressed the pace, moved outside the leader on the backstretch, forced the issue then took command mid turn and held sway under a drive.
SUPER PATRIOTIC stalked the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, launched a determined stretch drive but failed to get up.
GRAND MESA, rated off the pace, was hustled on the far turn, swung five-wide approaching the stretch and rallied gamely outside. PAKHET, in range
early, was hustled three and four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. LOVE DADDY settled in mid pack,
chased two to four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. MARCH OF DREAMS raced in mid pack, chased along the rail and two-wide through
the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. NIIGON'S SPIN showed early speed, set a pressured pace, was headed midway through the far turn and faded
in the stretch.

JEAN ELIZABETH sprinted to a clear early lead, set the pace then held under a strong hand ride. PAINTING bumped ELLYB at the start, settled in mid
pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then rallied outside and was gaining fast. SUMMER SUNDAY stalked the pace, chased into the stretch and
finished gamely but lost place late. CHARMAINE'S MIA raced in mid pack, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch.
FOXXY BELLE settled in mid pack, chased two-wide late turn but evened out in the final 16th. GAMBLE'S CANDY, in range, chased three-wide on the turn
then flattened out in mid stretch. WESTERN CURL settled off the pace, came two-wide through the turn then closed with some interest. ELLYB, bumped at
the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide late turn but was never in contention. ODE TO JOY stalked early, was hustled along the rail
through the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. ALNILAH settled off the pace, was hustled four then three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing

Footnotes
SANSA'S VOW was unhurried in the early stages, advanced past DELIGHTFUL DREAMER on the backstretch while racing on the inside, began to inch
closed to the pack on the turn, swung to the five-path at the head of the lane, dueled for the lead and finished best. CANDY'S DREAM followed the trio of
leaders early, was two-wide on the turn, angled four-wide to launch a bid late on the turn, dueled for the lead to midstretch but was second best. KEEPME
IN THEGAME stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, launched a bid and dueled into the stretch but was outkicked midway down the lane.
BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) took back and dropped to the rail in the early stages, made up ground on the turn, stalked the leaders into the stretch, lacked a
path as CHERUBIC began to tire in front of her, found room in midstretch and chased to the wire. ROYAL MANDATE raced in midpack on the outside, was
two-wide on the turn, was carried out to the six-path as SANSA'S VOW swung out in front of her then passed tiring foes in the stretch. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER tossed her head a bit at the start, trailed the field, was well back from the pack on the turn then offered a mild rally in the stretch. JOYFUL CAT
stalked the leader, raced two-wide on the turn, commenced a duel late on the turn then tired past the 1/4 pole. CHERUBIC got out to set the pace, was
headed midway around the turn, dueled into the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S FORTUNE set a pressured early pace, was headed late backstretch and was satisfied to stalk the leader on the turn, began to close along
the rail but was steadied in tight near the top of the stretch, stormed to the lead when clear and finished under a hand ride. SEVENTH WONDER raced in
mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. BIG EXECUTIVE forced the pace into the turn, was
hustled three and four-wide and challenged for the lead late turn, led briefly at the top of the stretch and chased to the end. CARDIFF HALL forced the pace
early, stalked on the turn, encountered traffic in the stretch, angled out quickly and rallied. ORPHAN HALLIE settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide on
the turn then finished gamely outside. EXECUTIVE SEARCH forced the pace late backstretch, bid five-wide late turn, dueled, was passed upper stretch and
gave way. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT broke slowly then veered sharply inward, trailed early, made up ground quickly along the rail on the turn and continued
on willingly through the stretch. TOUMAN settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. BEAR CUB showed
early speed, led late backstretch, was joined mid turn, gave way at the top of the stretch and faded. KISH POINT hopped at the start, closed to mid pack
quickly but was through by mid turn and faded.
