GO MAMA sat just off the pace outside, moved up closer mid turn, gained the lead into the lane and held under a drive. LIL OL FLATTER reserved off the
leaders early, came four wide into the lane but was unable to reach the winner through the drive. A FLEETING FEATHER raced near the back of the pack
and continued well enough to earn share. NU LEGACY stumbled badly from the gate, raced five wide into the lane, angled towards the rail and evened out.
EMERALD CANYON was quickest to the turn, had no response when challenged and faded. MI CHICA out sprinted to the turn and dropped back.

ROMAN STEEL vied for the early lead, held good margins through the turn and held a commanding advantage under pressure. BRING HOME STANLEY
saved ground early, came three wide into the lane and continued with interest to prove best of the others. REGAL CANDY sat off the pace inside, lacked the
kick needed and held position. TINY TYCOON hustled away the raced in closed pursuit and came up empty in the drive. SETTING THE TONE lacked early
speed and failed to threaten. HUSTLE HOME fractious in gate and offered little. DIEGO'S DAY failed to produce a bid.

and was unable to reach the winner. SILVER PRAIRIE sat in striking range, rallied between rivals into the stretch and weakened. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE
shifted over to avoid loose horse, chased the leader then faded through stretch. IRISH TRICK ducked in losing the rider, did not finish and walked off.

Footnotes
ZUCCHINI prompted the pace from the four path, was headed into the lane and won driving. GO WILD was well rated, was unable to keep pace with rivals,
came under a ride into the stretch and edged rival for place. TRANSPLANT contested the pace racing three wide, responded mildly to challenge from
ZUCCHINI, shifted outward at the head of the stretch and was edged out for place honors. RED WINGS raced five to six wide leaving the opening turn,
reserved off the pacesetters, closed steadily but missed. BOLSANO settled mid pack, steadied mid stretch and yielded. AURORA'S KID took closer order
into the far turn and lacked a closing response. WATCH ME STRUT trailed the field and failed to threaten. BEAR FABULOUS SON rated off the pace along
the rail, had no response when asked and stopped. NEVER EVEREVER offered little.

Footnotes
FAIRY BARB broke inward then contested the early pace, showed the way through the turn, responded to looming threat from SOMETHING ABOUT ME
and held on. SOMETHING ABOUT ME sat in striking position from the four path, went in pursuit of the leader entering the stretch but was unable to reach
the winner. PIPER ROSE saved ground early, shifted out at the head of the stretch, closed determinedly to early show honors. CITY OF PEARLS allowed to
settle outside, was roused at the top of the stretch then came together with CHICOUT D'TIGER and was edged out. FLORIST saved ground inside, raced in
traffic leaving the final turn and was out kicked. LYLA LORRAINE offered a late mild bid. CHICOUT D'TIGER squeezed leaving the gate, sat in range
between foes, was brushed into the stretch and gave way. DAZZLING CHIC broke alertly was overtaken into the turn and dropped back. THE LADY
CHABLIS bucked leaving the gate, trailed and was unable to make up ground. AXIAL LOAD raced wide through the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
PEYTONS PRINCE quickly went to the front, drew away into the lane and just held under a late drive from ITS ALL ON SLEW. ITS ALL ON SLEW settled in
range, angled in racing into the turn, went in pursuit of the leader into the lane, was gaining ground quickly and just missed but proving clearly second best.
BLAZING CHANNING sat in striking range while five wide, loomed boldly at the head of the lane, chased to no avail through the drive and just held sway.
ARCTIC REIGN angled in leaving the backstretch, raced wide into the lane and finished evenly. MARIA'S MAGIC sat mid pack along the rail and offered a
late mild rally. GUNN WITH THE WIND chased on the rail and lacked a closing response. STEELFORCE saved ground and lacked a serious bid.
IMPERIAL WOOD chased throughout. SLY NOT SHY raced wide leaving the backstretch and failed to threaten. ALL PRADO was outrun. DOUBLE
RANSOME sat just off the pace, moved up closer to leaving the final turn and wilted abruptly. HIHO out sprinted to the turn, dropped back quickly then was
pulled up, did not finish and walked off.
