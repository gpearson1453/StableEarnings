Footnotes
FAMILY TRIPS chased off the inside, went outside a rival on the turn, angled out into the three path, bid four deep in the lane and got up late in deep stretch
under a drive. SHE BE FIRE N ICE away quickly from the outside, dueled with CHITTER CHATTER into and around the turn and into the stretch, led
through the drive but was overtaken by the winner in the final sixteenth. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked a bit off the rail, angled to the rail on the turn and awaited an
opening, bid inside the top pair in the lane, finished well along the rail and missed the place. CHITTER CHATTER dueled from the inside to the stretch,
fought back through the final furlong and between runners late but got outkicked. SOPRESCIOUS outside a rival on the backstretch, four wide into the turn
then moved into the three path, kept on willingly through the lane and made mild gain late. FOR MY BROTHER mid-pack in the early going, angled inward
and saved ground around the turn, then finished evenly in the stretch. HOPE WINS unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide then came out in the
stretch and failed to response when needed. KATHIA stalked off the rail, raced four wide into the lane and made no impact. HAPPIER TOGETHER reared
at the start, assistant starter grabbed hold, rider dismounted and walked off. The Stewards reviewed the start of HAPPIER TOGETHER and ruled that as
she reared in the air the assistant starter let go but then grabbed a hold again shortly after and therefore is declared a non-starter.

Footnotes
CIOPPINO PASADINO broke through the gate prior to the start, brushed from the inside while off alertly, set the pace and angled inward, led clear then felt
a bit of pressure from CHARMING ALEXIS before quickly turning away that foe, drifted out in the lane under left-handed urging and held well. WICKED
SUNSET traveled along the inside and saved ground to the stretch, rallied through the lane and proved second best. CHARMING ALEXIS stalked from the
inside then moved outside the leader, bid from the outside around the turn but lost contact with the leader into the drive, chased the winner through the final
furlong and was edged for the place. TAPITHA BONITA bumped both sides at the start, unhurried in the beginning, raced five wide nearing the turn then
angled inward, lacked room and checked on the turn, exited the turn three wide and came out in upper stretch and finished with out with run. BLOOMING
HANNAH went between rivals on the backstretch, two wide on the turn, and lacked a rally when prompted. JOE'S PASSION broke out and bumped rival
leaving the gate, chased three deep or four wide into the turn, moved in a path around the bend and never rallied.

Footnotes
YES I'M WILD knocked into rival at the start, pressed the pace outside the lead, challenged three wide, dueled with BONMONT through the lane and edged
clear under strong hand urging. BONMONT broke out then corrected quickly to set the pace, dueled with YES I'M WILD into and around the turn and down
the stretch and yielded grudgingly in the final sixteenth. REAL QUICK bumped leaving the gate, chased outside, four wide to the stretch and held the show.
JAZZIE CAT fractious in the gate, bumped rival at the start, chased the top pair then went up inside, steadied around the turn, continued along the inside
into the drive and finished evenly. OVERKOTER bumped and squeezed at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn,
drifted out in upper stretch and proved no menace. The rider aboard JAZZIE CAT lobbed an objection against BONMONT alleging interference at the start
and once more on the turn. After a review, the Stewards ruled that the video was inconclusive and the rider's claim of foul was disallowed.
