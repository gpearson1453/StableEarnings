Footnotes
WOLVERETTE stalked the pace pressuring from the half, wrested the lead on the far turn digging in upper stretch widening late in the three path. BELLE
MAGIE stalked the pace looming through the far turn, angled from the three path to mid track in upper stretch going all out to save place. WEST COAST
TEMPLE raced mid pack losing ground to upper stretch bidding all out there in the seven path. LOOPY away alertly set the pace coming under pressure
from the half pole, ceded the lead on the far turn battling on from the rail down the stretch coming up a bit short. DADDY'S STORM raced evenly in mid pack
moving three path down the lane finding no late surge. DELICATE CHRISTY bore out on the opening turn, gave a mild middle move then leveled off to
upper stretch. BLESS THE RAINS was carried out on the opening turn playing no factor. SHESAROCKSTARTOO gave a prompted middle move bidding
through the far turn before wilting in upper stretch. LOVELY LEE was never involved. BRAHMA MOMMA off slowly would trail throughout. Due to a timer
malfunction the six furlong split was unavailable.
