Footnotes
JOHN'S INTUITION flashed good speed and dueled off the rail inside of BIG HEATER to the stretch, edged away from that one to mid stretch then held
determinedly. BILLTOWN BANNER was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide then swung out for room into the stretch and finished willingly for
second. CAPACITOR chased the leaders to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. BIG HEATER hustled to
contest the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and lacked the needed late response. DARKHAWK was
outrun to the turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch then swung out widest for the drive and closed belatedly. DESERT MOVIE stalked the pace from the
rail to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and did not rally. YOU BAD got outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. SHINER'S CODE had no
speed and was outrun.

MY LUCKY MARK attended the pace outside SADDLE BAR, pushed away from that one to mid stretch then held off MALIBU ALEX determinedly. MALIBU
ALEX had no speed, was forced to circle four wide to the stretch then closed steadily but too late. MIRROR IMAGE chased the pace two wide to the stretch,
got outkicked tdo mid stretch and was not a threat to the top two. SADDLE BAR hustled early to dispute the pace from the rail but was outrun to mid stretch
by the winner and weakened. UNCLE HAL stalked the leaders from t he rail to the stretch then lacked a closing response. SWEET DISTINCTION had no
speed, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. AALSMEER brushed the gate coming out, recovered and chased three wide to the stretch then gave way.

BUILDER was just off the leader to the second turn, pushed up two wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, met SHOT OF A LIFETIME's bid in mid
stretch and edged clear driving. MANILA MISCHIEF had no speed, settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then rallied inside to gamely get
the place. SHOT OF A LIFETIME chased the leaders to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, moved out widest for the drive but was
outfinished for second. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) hustled to set the pace from the rail under pressure from the the winner for six furlongs, was overtaken
by that one into the stretch and tired. REY COLIMAN had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SWIRLING was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the quarter pole then shifted off the rail, rallied between rivals in the drive and inched clear. DRIFT
AWAY lagged to the turn, swung out five wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive and surged late to get the place. BAKO SWEETS tracked the pace
early, was three then four wide to the stretch, dueled leaving mid stretch then was outfinished by the winner and tagged late for second. POINT HOPE (IRE)
was chasing to the turn, came two then three wide to the stretch then could not muster the needed late response. AMBER LOUISE stalked the leaders three
wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms to mid stretch but weakened in the late stages. I LOVE ROMANCE contested the pace from the rail to the stretch,
was collared in mid stretch and gave way. NAUGHTY SOPHIE dueled outside of I LOVE ROMANCE and two wide, was rank on the turn, got outkicked to
mid stretch and also gave way.
