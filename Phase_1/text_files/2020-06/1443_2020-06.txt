Footnotes
EXPECT ICE stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when asked entering the drive and was along in
time. CHEESEBURGER chased the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, gained the margin entering the drive, held a clear
advantage at the eighth pole but could not last. PRIME HOOK well placed from the outside, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace.
MISTER ANDER chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn but had nothing left. U COMPLETE ME chased the early
pace from the inside but came up empty in the drive. HAPPY JOURNEY was no factor. I DON'T FLY COACH was never close. FLY GUY RAK was no
threat.

advantage entering the second turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear while kept to task. FLASH ATTACK stalked the early pace from
the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded entering the drive but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. BINDING
outrun early, advanced inside through the second turn, responded and rallied late for the show. TRIP CANDY bumped at the start, dueled from between
foes early, remained engaged up the backstretch but had nothing left for the drive. DAD SAID NO could only improve position. ROUND HILL chased the
early pace from the outside, held a forward position for the drive then tired. MOSTA FLYIN stumbled at the start, bumped with a rival and was no factor.
