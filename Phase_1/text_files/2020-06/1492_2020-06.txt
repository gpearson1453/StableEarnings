Footnotes
COUNCIL RULES, urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shook clear entering upper stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement. DISTINCT APPROVAL tracked off the first flight from out of striking distance racing four wide early, advanced in that path to upper stretch
and edged a rival for the place honors late. SPELL WINDER, urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the turn, faded in late stages. WILD
DESIRE, forwardly placed three deep tracking the first flight to the turn, gave way after a half. TRIPLE TROUBLE dropped out early. PAPA MAMBO
stumbled badly at the start dislodging her rider but walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION. All times have been omitted pending review.

Footnotes
RUNTECH, caught four wide racing into the first turn, pulled his way to terms with the first flight into the backstretch, went clear while angling to the inside
racing into the far turn and held sway on a safe margin under pressure. WHATA PERFECT DAY, held up out of close quarters to race last to the first turn,
switched outside foes on the backstretch, advanced to contention four deep entering the far turn, shifted inwards gaining second racing into the lane but
couldn't gain even terms with the winner. HOIST YOUR GLASS tracked off the first flight outside a rival, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn
into the lane but had no final kick. MARK IN GREELEY broke readily to join the pace inside foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders to track
those rivals along the inside, switched out entering the lane and regained some position in an even effort. LITTLE INSTIGATOR tracked the leaders inside
rivals as part of the second flight, angled out five wide in the lane but had no rally. UNCLE TAP, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace to the
backstretch, gave way on the far turn. DAZZLING REUNION, urged between rivals, then inside the first flight prompting the pace into the backstretch, gave
way abruptly nearing the far turn.

HONDO LANE tracked off the first flight from just out of striking distance through the backstretch, made steady progress four wide on the turn to wrest the
advantage and went clear under firm handling. PLEASANT MOON, forwardly placed outside the first flight, bid three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner. EUROMANTIC was settled off the second flight early, gained between foes, then briefly awaited an
opening midway through the turn, angled out four wide entering the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. BULLY FOR ERIC, urged inside rivals
pressing the pace after the opening furlong, gave way into the lane. HURTS SO GOOD, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace, gave way
nearing the lane. PARLAY PETE vied for command between foes into the turn but was through after a half. COASTLINE SERMON was pinched back at the
start and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
AUBEY RIDGE broke readily to gain a narrow advantage along the rail, disputed the pace into the backstretch, went clear racing into the far turn and held
sway on a commanding advantage under pressure. ALWAYS COOL tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the
far turn and continued with interest to prove best of the others. J P WARRIOR was rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, angled out four
wide racing into the lane and finished with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. SEMI CHARMED DAY settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out entering the lane while being roused to advance between foes and just missed for a share.
MALIBU JACK tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight, drifted out racing into the lane and gave out late. THEMANLOOK settled between foes
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. OH LARRY, urged prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way between foes racing into the far
turn. DINNER AT CRUMPIES, caught a bit wide early, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR, brushed at the start, came through close quarters to gain a position tracking inside foes tracking off the first flight racing to the turn,
shifted out to split foes entering upper stretch, switched outside BLUE JEANS N BEER while moving to wrest command from that foe and edged forward
under firm handling. The latter hopped at the start, then was urged to terms with the a rival prompting the pace racing to the turn, went clear into upper
stretch, shifted inwards gaining the advantage racing through the lane but failed to sustain that momentum. TRUE WEST switched outside rivals early to
track off the first flight three deep racing to the turn, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a
share. OVERANALYZFAKENEWS angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, swung out four wide entering the lane but had
no late kick. LONESOME HIGHWAY, urged to dispute the pace from the outset racing a bit off the rail, gave way into upper stretch. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL
settled off the second flight while shifting off the inside but never gained contention. CYCLONE DAN settled outside foes and never mounted a serious
challenge. HANDSOME JOHN settled last while angling to the inside early but failed to menace.

BROKEN KEY was settled along the rail racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half gathering momentum, advanced three deep entering
the far turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and just hold OUTRUN THE POSSE to
the wire under firm handling. The latter angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out to split foes three wide entering
upper stretch and contested the issue grudgingly inside the winner to the end to just miss. TENSPEED tracked the pace outside foes in second flight,
advanced three deep nearing the lane to gain a brief advantage while shifting in entering the stretch but proved no match for the top pair. SCATTERED
CASH settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort
to improve position. FORMIDABLE FORCE tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, split foes just off the inside racing into the lane,
shifted out in late stages and continued evenly between foes late. MY DISCRETION, urged inside a rival pursuing the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way
into upper stretch. BORN FORCE settled last and proved no threat. BUYMEABOND proved no factor. I'M AN EIGHT tracked off the second flight outside a
rival, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. POWER CRY sprinted clear of the field along the rail, held
sway on a commanding margin racing to the far turn and gave way abruptly nearing the lane.

LILA'S LUCKY LADY switched outside a rival racing into the first turn attending the pace, pressed the issue racing into the far turn and went clear under firm
handling. HUSH Y'ALL tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out three wide entering the lane and edged a rival for the place
honors. EUTYCHIA, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command into the far
turn but proved no match in the drive. CSILLA forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the first flight, came under pressure to advance on the far turn
and gave way into upper stretch. SUMMER LOVIN settled last racing to the backstretch, switched out four wide after a half but offered no rally. COIL AND
STRIKE tracked off the first flight along the inside but retreated early.

Footnotes
PINE GROVE ROAD, in touch with the leader attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue midway through the far turn
into upper stretch and edged forward in late stages to go clear under left handed pressure. OFF THE MEDS angled inwards to track the leaders between
foes in second flight to the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail for the place honors. SKIPPY'S
STRIKE sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command to midstretch but yielded late.
CHATTERMAN tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick while finishing on even terms with a rival for fourth. IRISH MAJOR angled to the inside tracking just behind the
second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out to split rivals just off the inside entering the stretch and finished on even terms with a rival for fourth while
making no real impression. MESA SKYLINE settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, was fanned five wide racing into the stretch but
offered no rally. GOLDEN SCEPTOR angled inwards tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
nearing the lane but came up empty entering the stretch. REAL LUTE, reserved last to the backstretch, failed to menace. Fractional times are under review
and are unavailable.
