KELSEY was away a step slow and quickly hustled into contention in the two path took the lead on the turn and opened up and held gamely in the final
yards. PRETTY TWISTED showed good early speed but was forced three wide dropped back a bit at the top of the stretch but was cutting into the margin
late. FOXY TWIST stalked the pace along the rail came through at the top of the stretch in the two path and made a mild bid. MY MEADOW showed the
best early speed along the inside held gamely to the stretch call and then tired. MAYBEA GRAND trailed from the outset and was never a factor.

CRAFTY'S LAST was allowed to settle off the pace came three wide on the turn and then fanned out five wide entering the stretch and steadily wore down
the leader. MY PERFECT GRAYDAR showed the best speed along the inside while challenged every step of the way and held gamely through the stretch.
DA VAN GEAUX was along the inside on the turn behind the pace came out entering the stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth. MAGGIES PATROIT
showed good early speed in the two path to engage for the lead but gave way in the stretch. FIVE B C raced along the inside while well back and never
mounted a serious rally. SMOKIN WITH APOLLO raced three wide entering the stretch and could not make up the needed ground. REMEMBER LUCKY
showed good early speed three wide for the first quarter and then stopped.

Footnotes
MR. POPCORN showed good early speed in the two path took the lead entering the stretch and steadily drew clear down the lane. MAJOR PERFECT was
full of run between rivals but tried to get in twice each time interfering with Huntingtons Rithm. The first was going into the turn and then at the eighth pole for
both of the incidents the stewards disqualified Major Perfect and placed him fourth. ZERO SUM GAME showed good speed while hung three deep on the
turn and could not match strides with the winner in the stretch. HUNTINGTONS RITHM raced along the inside and was bothered by Major Perfect twice.
The first incident occurred going into the turn and the second at the eighth pole. COOL HAND LUCAS raced three wide in the second tier of horses and
could not make up ground. LINEMANS CHECK raced very wide entering the stretch and could not make up the needed ground. STUCK ON GEORGE
showed the best early speed and opened a clear lead quickly but stopped in the stretch. JIMMY DEAN DUBAI raced three wide on the turn and was not a
factor.

and drew clear to win impressively. TOP OF THE ROCK showed good early speed in the two path took a clear lead in a stretch battle but could not hold off
the winner. EMPEROR'S CHOICE had a rail trip behind the pace and was up for third. HEAVY FAVOR showed good early speed along the inside but tired.

rally. LUCKY KID raced along the rail and had no response in the stretch. HACIENDA BLVD came wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground.
KITTEN'S BULL was always well back and had no rally. WAR BEAU was always well back and not a factor. AFTER CHAD showed the best early speed for

Footnotes
MATAPAN was away in good order but allowed to settle behind the speed raced in the two path on the turn angled out for the drive and made a big move in
the final furlong to draw clear late. BLOOMIN PERFECT showed the best early speed along the inside to carve all the fractions opened a good lead at the
eighth pole but tired in the final yards and could not fend off the winner. MISS SHAWHAN was well back in the early stages while racing along the inside
came one out for the drive and was finishing well. INDY N ROSES raced in the two path just off the leaders but could not make up the needed ground in the
stretch. SETTLE DOWN EILEEN was well back in the early stages came out for the drive and was making up some ground. MY CRAFTY GAL showed
some good early speed while three deep and tired. CHASIN LUCAS showed good early speed in the two path and tired. HERE'SLOOKINATYA raced mid
pack while off the rail and never offered a rally. CODIFY raced midpack for the first half then stopped in the stretch.
