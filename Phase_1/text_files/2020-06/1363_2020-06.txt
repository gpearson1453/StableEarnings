victory. GARNETS GAL bobbled at the break but still came away on the lead in the two path held a clear advantage in the stretch but could not hold off the
winner inside the sixteenth pole. MAGIC MOMENT raced mid pack along the inside and rallied between foes in the drive for third. HEAR THE MUSIC
showed good speed to battle for the lead along the inside but gave way on the turn. HIDDEN FAITH was off a step slow settled off the pace behind the
leaders made a three wide bid on the turn but tired in the stretch. BILLIE MAE was well back from the outset and never offered a rally.

OKIE PRINCESS showed the best early speed to clear the field but was off the rail in the two path drew clear and held steady through the drive. FAST
PUFF came in the three path on the turn but made little headway through the stretch. NOT THAT I RECALL was along the inside behind the pace angled
out for the drive and made a mild bid. TWISTED REGAN came four wide on the turn but could not make up ground. PRETTY TWISTED came through
along the rail to challenge on the turn but tired through the stretch. EPSOM IMP raced along the inside on the turn but never mounted a serious threat.

Footnotes
SON OF ELEANOR broke well and was up close was allowed to settle behind the early pace while in tight quarters angled out for the drive and wore down
the leaders. ZOOT SUIT showed good early speed in the two path took the lead in the stretch but could not hold off the winner. MR. LOVEJOY showed
good early speed along the inside but could not match strides with the top two through the stretch. YO Y ME was away a half step slow and was well back in
the early stages came through on the inside and finished well while never a threat to the top three. JILAS MIRACLE broke best than was allowed to drop to
the back of the pack and finished with interest. MAGICAL STAR was mid pack in the two path and had no rally. ONE STEP AWAY raced along the inside
and had no rally. CHEROKEE DYNASTY raced in the two path and had no rally. SKY T raced very wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground.
