Footnotes
GOSSIP ISLE stalked the leader outside, led in mid-stretch and edged away driving. SUSIKIN broke through prior to the start, led off the inside, vied to the
late stages and continued gamely. VALIANT SPIRIT bothered at the start, saved ground and rallied mildly. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE lacked speed then passed
fading rivals. IT'S A SHAW THING chased within striking range and was never a factor. FROSTY FRIEND raced three wide, bid on the turn then proved
empty. POINT LOCKOUT came out at the start bumping rival, raced inside and faded. IZA ONE dropped back early and gave way readily.

Footnotes
DREAMER'S MOON took the lead at once, moved to the rail and set the pace under light rating, roused mid stretch drifted out slightly and drew out fully
extended. DANCE AND DANCE, two wide in second flight, also drifted out a bit through stretch and was no match. STREGA NONNA, bumped soundly
leaving the gate, recovered and raced just off rail and just off the pace then tired. WHITNEY COVE, racing in the five path, dropped back steadily. DAZZLE
ME stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced wide, moved in through the stretch. MARVELLA, outside winner early, stopped suddenly. THE STEWARDS LITE
THE INQUIRY SIGN CONCERNING THE START BUT THEY DIDN'T ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. WITH THE EXACT AMOUNT OF
MONEY TO WIN ON EACH, DREAMER'S MOON AND DANCE AND DANCE WERE CO-FAVORITES.

ALL STAR RED, racing just off the rail and just off the pace, eased out three wide near quarter pole, took the lead and drew off. INKY DINKY DO didn't
break sharply, was hustled to duel for command between, fell back a bit near mid stretch but then came back for place. ROYALTY SALVATORE, outside
top flight, took the lead on the turn then weakened late. MIDNIGHT GAMES, racing inside stablemate while just off the pace, weakened. BRIDGET'S BIG
LUVY was wide while never far back then tired. CLEAR PROSPERITY saved ground and showed little. AMERICAN GREATNESS broke slowly, saved
ground and never threatened. WIRELESS FUTURE, wide, showed little.

SALSITA ROJA took control at once, drew away on the turn and remained well clear under mild pressure. CREEDIBILITY chased three wide, faded on the
turn but came again for the place. OFFLEE OPTIMISTIC saved ground within striking range and flattened out through the stretch. LITTLE NECK lagged far
behind and moved very wide in the stretch. NANCY B pursued between rivals and gave way readily. VOLODINA injured herself in the starting gate and was
ordered scratched by the stewards.

GIRARDI, just off the rail and not far back, swung out wide leaving the turn, took the lead leaving sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS
saved ground disputing the pace and gamely held place. FASTROADAHEAD, three wide vying for command, held on with good courage. BROOKLYN
HEIGHTS dueled for command between foes then faded late. KEEPMYEYEONTHEBOYS, between foes, drifted out through stretch and rallied.
PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER went in the air in the gate breaking far behind and the field left the starting gate nineteen minutes past scheduled post time, raced
very wide and passed tiring foes. WHEREWITHAL broke slowly and then failed to threaten. ARIMA, wide and just off the pace, tired. ELIANA'S MISSION
showed little. BUCKY BE LUCKY was in the three path and just off pace, pulled up in distress in early stretch and was vanned off. THERE WAS NO
CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START.

IWISHIRISH broke slowly, rallied strongly, drew off in the stretch, pulled up lame soon after the finish and was vanned off. BIG RED SEVEN saved ground,
advanced on the final turn and continued well. PRETTY COOL CAT lagged far behind then closed the gap with late energy. IRON LILLY prompted the pace
three wide, was carried wide into the stretch and faded. EMPTY HOUSE lacked speed and passed fading rivals. DESCARADO dropped back early and was
never in contention. NATASHA FATALE forced the pace outside, was carried wide into the stretch and faded. OWESAYCANYOUSEE set a pressured pace
inside, bore out into the stretch and yielded. HEART BEAT AWAY lacked speed and was never a factor. SARATOGA BY DESIGN chased close up wide
early and stopped. ELAN was fanned very wide on the first turn then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SCOOBYDOOPAPA saved ground, was blocked from the quarter pole into the lane, angled out to secure room and drew away quickly. TATTERED
advanced four wide on the turn, led in the stretch but was no match late. RAGGY ROCKS lacked speed, raced very wide into the stretch rallying. TOMMY'S
TOP CAT dropped back after the start then offered a late bid. FRAN'S WORRIER vied in the two path to the stretch and weakened. MARCH SCREAMER
raced outside and passed rivals without menacing. EL DULZURA saved ground close up to the far turn and retreated. WICKED GRIN raced far behind
throughout. WEST FORK broke alertly and chased just off the pace outside then faded. FLATEXCEL dueled along the rail to mid-stretch and stopped.
FAIRLY BOLD was urged within striking range then gave way. BILL'S MAFIA lagged far behind throughout.
