Footnotes
GENERAL MATHIS broke in bumping KARAMOJO into STRONG HEADED, lagged well back for six furlongs, fanned to the far outside at the top of the
stretch, kicked in well and was up outside TRACEABILITY and KARAMOJO while brushed near the wire by the latter. TRACEABILITY bumped a few times
with VIKING PLUNDER shortly after the start, advanced inside off the far turn, bid along the rail and reached the lead inside REINOANIMAUX entering the
final furlong, briefly went clear, but could not hold on and saved second. KARAMOJO was bumped between horses at the start, settled in the middle of the
field early inside, moved out four wide for the drive, bid between horses in deep stretch, drifted out under left-hand pressure brushing GENERAL MATHIS
and just missed. GUACO began moving four then five wide late on the turn, rallied to contention with aim in the five-path through the furlong grounds, but
was outkicked. VIKING PLUNDER was pinballed shortly after the start and checked sharply between TRACEABILITY and STRONG HEADED with the rider
briefly losing the left iron, advanced into traffic through upper stretch on the rail, and finished with good courage. REINOANIMAUX set the pace inside,
stayed on to upper stretch and weakened. OXBURGER tucked in behind the leaders for six furlongs, lacked room and steadied behind REINOANIMAUX
and CALL BROS in upper stretch, and gave way. CALL BROS raced three wide in striking range to the stretch, had aim but faded approaching the
eighth-pole. STRONG HEADED was bumped by KARAMOJO at the start, bumped several times with VIKING PLUNDER and steadied shortly after, raced
three wide on the turns, and could not gain. CHARLIECANDO stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, and tired. KITTEN'S CLOWN was never
prominent. NATHAN'S SECRET prompted the early pace outside REINOANIMAUX, turned up the pressure after a half-mile, but faltered soon after
completing six furlongs.

Footnotes
TAMIAMI stumbled and brushed with FRANKLY MY DEAR at the start, swung four wide off the turn with a lot to do, rallied steadily in the four-path and was
up outside FRANKLY MY DEAR in the final strides. FRANKLY MY DEAR brushed with TAMIAMI at the start, dueled inside SOPHISTICURL and WORLD
GONE WILD for three furlongs, moved clear through most of the stretch run, and was nailed at the wire. SOPHISTICURL contested the pace between
horses to the head of the stretch, weakened and saved the show. NYSSA saved ground outsprinted to the lane, moved out three wide approaching the
eighth-pole and finished one-paced. ALEX'S FIRST lagged far back inside to the stretch, and found her best stride belatedly on the rail. PRETZEL raced
four wide around the turn, and could not make an impact. MACY'S HOME RUN was outrun three wide. WORLD GONE WILD argued the early pace outside
FRANKLY MY DEAR and SOPHISTICURL, and tired coming off the turn. SIERRA DIAMOND raced two wide, and faded approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CALENTITA (IRE) advanced three wide after six furlongs, hooked up in a duel outside ZODIAC PRINCESS approaching mid stretch and prevailed after a
long drive. ZODIAC PRINCESS took the early lead, rated along through even fractions, responded when CALENTITA ranged alongside, drifted out through
a long drive and was edged. MELISSANI bumped with STRICT VOW at the start, moved through between horses into the far turn and brushed with STRICT
VOW while shifting inward, came two wide looming a threat into the stretch, but flattened out. CARIBBEAN KITTEN was outrun for six furlongs, circled six
wide approaching the stretch, and improved for the last major share outside. STRICT VOW bumped with MELISSANI at the start and was slow to begin,
saved ground in the second flight early, brushed with MELISSANI and steadied slightly inside that one midway on the far turn, and lacked a closing bid.
ABARRIO FOREVER became unruly away from the gate and going to the first turn, moved inside while far back, hugged the rail into the lane and went by
tired horses. KARENINA lodged a mild bid four then three wide around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. TWEETY KITTEN raced three to four
wide around the far turn, and could not reach contention. LEMONCITA was never a factor. KISSES FOR TIZZY stayed in range while moving out three wide
after a half-mile, but faded before reaching the stretch. TENNESSEE COTTON hopped slightly to get off slowly, raced four to five wide and made no gains.
HENNY'S TREASURE broke out, went up to force the pace outside ZODIAC PRINCESS entering the backstretch, gave way after six furlongs, and was
vanned off. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF STRICT VOW AGAINST MELISSANI ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DISTURBIN BOURBON sat outside the battling trio of early leaders, took over four wide after a half-mile, and drew off through the stretch under pressure.
TONY SMALL bumped with O DRISCOLL shortly after the start, came five wide advancing near the top of the stretch, finished well outside but was no
threat to the winner. O DRISCOLL bumped with TONY SMALL soon after the start, raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing response.
OROSCOPO vied inside rivals early, was outpaced into the turn and moved out three wide, then stayed on outside to pick up a share. KING WADE vied
early between horses, moved to the rail after a half-mile and faded in the stretch. CAPITAN FOFO was no factor two wide. MITHRA broke slowly and was
always outrun. EAST CODE contested the early pace three wide, and gave way after a half. BIP BIP FULL POWER broke slowly and was far back inside.

Footnotes
PERT was slowest underway and five wide going to the first turn, moved up on the backstretch and dueled outside QUEEN FIELD after completing a
half-mile, gained the upper hand turning for home and stayed clear under a drive. MIDNIGHT GEM raced three wide in the second flight for six furlongs, and
finished well outside to get up for second. LA CARA BONITA cleared to the lead and moved inside soon after the start, yielded to three rivals soon after
hitting the backstretch, began to gain around the far turn two wide, rebid outside PERT in upper stretch, could not reach that one and was outkicked for the
place. A BEAUTIFUL DAY stayed in range early, was shuffled back badly inside through the far turn, moved to the two-path in upper stretch and finished
well too late. QUEEN FIELD was four wide into the first turn, went up to force the pace between horses after a quarter-mile, dueled inside PERT leaving the
backstretch, and weakened turning for home. WICKED SOLUTION was outrun early inside, moved three wide on the far turn, and passed tired horses.
KAYSERI was unsettled approaching the first turn, moved out four wide to the backstretch and was never prominent. TEACHER DRAMA steadied inside
entering the first turn, angled widest at the top of the stretch and made no appreciable headway. LASTING JOY pressed the pace between horses entering
the backstretch, and gave way after a half-mile. SMARTIZAR dropped well back after six furlongs. UNION LANE was no factor.

Footnotes
SUMMER KID came in after the break, tracked inside early, moved out four wide around the turn, reached the front outside EL SAMURO and TATWEEJ
after six furlongs, drove clear through upper stretch and was geared down a sixteenth out. EL SAMURO bid for command between horses three wide near
the five-sixteenths, could not go with the winner turning for home, but finished with good courage going clear for the place. TATWEEJ brushed the left side
of the gate at the start, shadowed CHAMBERLAIN from outside early, bid between horses midway on the turn, moved inside for the drive and weakened
through the late stages. SPICE ROAD lacked room behind SUMMER KID after the start, and was never close. ROBIN TEAM SHOW was outrun inside.
CHAMBERLAIN set the early pace inside, gave way on the turn, drifted wide approaching the stretch and was eased up late.

Footnotes
OBLIO'S WISH prompted the pace outside CLASSY OF COURSE, challenged in earnest after six furlongs, began to prevail entering the final furlong and
edged away while drifting out. CLASSY OF COURSE set the pace inside, responded when headed at the top of the stretch, dueled through the furlong
grounds and yielded grudgingly. SWEET STORY saved ground under a firm hold early, raced three wide around the turn, and finished well on the far
outside. NIGHT WATCH settled in midpack two wide to the stretch, moved to the rail and gained mildly for a share. SASSY JUSTICE was four wide early,
moved up entering the backstretch, stayed in range to the stretch in the three-path, and weakened between horses. BELIEVE INDEED was four wide early,
gradually moved closer to the front flight after six furlongs while remaining well out in the course, and flattened out in the lane. DURVEN lacked the needed
response inside. DIXIE PRINCESS stayed close inside to the far turn, and tired. GLAM checked hard to handle entering the first turn at the rear, moved out
extremely wide to the backstretch, and remained far back. WORTH AVENUE bore out badly approaching the backstretch, dropped far back after six
furlongs and was eased up in the stretch.

MY SARASOTA STAR sprinted clear inside after an alert break, got roused coming off the turn in the two-path, and held sway under a drive.
TALKTHETALK bumped with DISTINCTLY BLUE at the start, raced two wide on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, and rallied on the rail. FLASHING
DIAMOND moved swiftly four wide late on the turn, loomed through upper stretch outside the leader, but flattened out in the late stages. PAPA'S LITTLE
GIRL saved ground well back to the stretch, and gained belatedly on the fence. BAHAMIAN GIRL raced three then four wide on the turn, gained a bit but
needed to find more on the far outside. FIGHTRESS gave chase outside the winner for a half-mile, and tired. DISTINCTLY BLUE chased three wide for a
half, and tired. HY DOLLFACE could not keep pace inside on the turn, and dropped back in the two-path at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
CENTSLESS DRAMA broke out, took control early in the two-path, moved inside and backed down the pace up the backstretch, got roused approaching
the stretch with a healthy advantage and stayed clear driving. AERODYNAMIC was forwardly placed inside for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and
finished willingly to narrow the gap. ADIOS bumped with BION MAGIC at the start, advanced a bit while swinging out to the four-path after six furlongs, and
rallied outside too late. BLUE MISTRESS broke in bumping TRIESTE at the start, chased outside the pacesetter for six furlongs, and lacked a closing bid.
TRIESTE (BRZ) got bumped by BLUE MISTRESS at the start, was well back to the stretch, and was no threat with an even finish. TOLERATION raced two
wide, and tired after six furlongs. BIZNESS BEAUTY lacked room behind CENTSLESS DRAMA at the start, and was outrun. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE was
three wide on the first turn, and retired early. BION MAGIC bumped with ADIOS at the start, and dropped back after a half-mile.

Footnotes
COOL ARROW was up in between the leaders entering the turn, waited for room from the three-eighths pole to the top of the stretch, moved to the rail and
responded smartly to take over past the furlong marker and draw clear. FLASHY KYEM rallied to contention five then four wide on the turn, battled on a
short lead through upper stretch, and stayed on to hold second. CHAMPAGNEONME hopped at the break and was off slowest, swung five wide rallying into
the stretch, loomed outside a furlong out, but hung late. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) brushed with KING DADDY at the start, lacked room rank behind and
between foes early, moved out four wide with a run on the turn and steadied between horses past the quarter-pole, regrouped but lacked room and steadied
again a sixteenth out, and settled for the last major share. RUNNING FOR RIZ argued the pace in the three-path to the stretch, and faded steadily on the
wrong lead. TRAVY BOY broke with the leaders and stayed close early inside, lost considerable position around the turn, moved out widest and was empty.
KING DADDY brushed with MI TRES POR CIENTO at the start, rushed up inside to get a short lead before completing a quarter-mile, then gave way readily
late on the turn.

CHEROKEE SOUND bumped with PRINCESS CRYSTAL after the start, moved up three wide around the far turn, lugged in challenging for command
entering the final furlong, straightened out from left-hand pressure and edged clear under good handling. V K LEGACY raced in range two wide, moved
inside for the drive and was up for the place. JOSEFA steadied behind NANIE'S TREASURE into the first turn, moved out and was sent up to take over from
outside after a quarter-mile, sped off up the backstretch, drifted out beginning to labor in mid stretch, and gave way. MOMS LOVE advanced after six
furlongs, came three wide off the far turn and gained mildly. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL took the worst of a bump with SUBTLE JOY at the start and was off
slow, saved ground far back early, angled to the far outside at the top of the stretch, went back in through the late stages and was going well to the wire.
PRINCESA CRYSTAL (GB) bumped with CHEROKEE SOUND after the start, was four wide on the first turn and far back, and made up some ground
without threatening. PASATIME had the two-path on the turns, and posed no threat inside through the lane. NANIE'S TREASURE led into the first turn
inside, deferred to JOSEFA after a quarter-mile, moved out and stayed on the chase to the stretch, and tired. SUBTLE JOY bumped with ALL AMERICAN
