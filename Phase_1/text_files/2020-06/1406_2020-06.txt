Footnotes
SWEEPING EDGE broke readily to assume a forward placing along the rail, conceded position to stalk just off the pacesetter inside a rival into the
backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the far turn while moving to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, took charge entering the lane
and held sway under firm handling. SATELLITE, reserved last while angling to the inside, switched off the inside racing into upper stretch gathering
momentum, shifted four wide midstretch and proved best of the others. MONEY BROKER, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter to
the backstretch, advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn, continued between foes into the lane but couldn't match the top pair while narrowly
edging a rival for a share. LOGAN'S LEOPARD, urged to the lead outside the eventual winner racing into the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining the
advantage, disputed the pace inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. PURPLE SKY was rated tracking off the first flight near
the inside in the opening half, shifted out to race four wide nearing the lane but had no rally. WILLISTON DUDE tracked outside a rival in second flight but
was through after a half.

Footnotes
SAISON stalked just off the first flight racing through the backstretch, was urged to bid three deep between foes entering the turn, continued in a protracted
skirmish in that path to upper stretch and edged forward late under brisk handling. MYNAMEIS PRINCE broke slowly, was prompted to advance four wide
racing into the turn, pressed the issue in that path to midstretch but was outfinished. CLASSY MAGIC, urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for
command into upper stretch, couldn't match the top pair late but edged a rival for a share. GOLD AND SKOL broke readily, prompted the pace outside a
rival in early stages, pressed between foes to upper stretch and gave way late. MY EASY CASH settled between foes racing to the turn and failed to
menace. RAISIN CANDY BAR was settled along the inside early and proved no threat. EMMETT CAT, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders, gave
way after a half.

ASTONISHING TWEET broke readily to gain a clear advantage while shifting inwards, dictated the pace just off the inside racing into the turn, turned back a
challenge from DAD'S A GAMBLER racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under mild prompting. The latter broke a bit slowly, was settled
outside foes in the opening stages, was urged to advance four wide racing into the turn to loom briefly outside the winner but flattened out nearing
midstretch. PEACOCK COWBOY was rated inside foes just off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane to race four deep in late
stages and edged rivals for a share. MAY WE ALL, forwardly placed four wide, then three wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, faded into
upper stretch. ELUSIVE FORCE tracked off the second flight along the inside, came around a tiring foe racing into the lane and gained some position along
the rail in the closing stages. MONDAY CONFESSION tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the turn and gave way into upper stretch.
RACE THE MOON proved no factor. GIANT GAMBLE, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. THE RACES
WERE CANCELLED AFTER RACE THREE DUE TO LIGHTNING AND CONSOLATION PAYOFFS WERE CALCULATED FOR PENDING MULTI-RACE
WAGERS.
