Footnotes
BELLAMY CAY with the early pace three wide, garnered a larger advantage into the far turn, repulsed a brief bid past the furlong marker then drew steadily
clear. SEVEN JEWELS vied early while between horses and inside the winner, fell back off of that rival after a half, moved out and lodged a brief rebid in the
four path into and through upper stretch then proved no match in the final furlong, remained clear for the place. AMERICAN MOM last to leave, raced well
back for five furlongs, came three wide into the lane, staged a willingly rally to be up for the show late, not a serious threat to the top three. EXACTA vied
early closest to the inside, fell back off the issue up front before a half and gradually weakened, lost the show late. GATOR PROUD void of early foot, came
four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
TIZ ONE FEE void of early foot, rallied four wide out of the final turn, collared the leader inside the furlong grounds while remaining well out in the strip,
kicked well clear under steady handling. LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN with the early pace between horses, shook clear of the other speed midway on the final
turn, continued to show the way by daylight into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. ANCONA behind the first flight early,
moved closer after a half, flattened out in the drive while proving best of the rest. FOR REAL ALICE with the early pace while three wide through the first
turn, weakened after a half. FOUR PRINCESSES went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. DIXIE FLYER narrowly showed the way along
the inside through the first turn, dueled with the winner up the backstretch then gave way in the far turn.

WAR SONG away in good order, narrowly set the early pace, shook off the other speed turning for home, steadily drew out while only being shown the stick
through the lane to win ridden out. MR. E EDWARDS lacked early foot, came four wide out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip, up for the place
in the final jump, no threat to the winner. MAN ALIVE off the pace while toward the inside, tipped out turning for home to improve position, chased the
winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, nipped in the late going to lose the place. WESTERN STAR within striking distance while
racing outside, floated out to be six wide into the stretch, remained widest to the wire while lacking a closing response. GRIP TIGHT lacked speed, made
little imapct. PENNIES LIL MAN pressed the pace for three furlongs off the inside and faltered. ZIPPIT ZIPPY last to leave, trailed throughout in showing
little.

DECADENT DIAMOND forwardly placed inside, patiently handled through the turn, steered out a bit for room once straightened for home, took over past the
furlong marker and drove well clear. NOON'S BABYGIRL also close from the start, took over to be clear late in the turn, narrowly showed the way past
midstretch then proved no match, remained clear of the others under steady handling. VIKING VOYAGE broke on top to set the early pace, chased the
runner up out of the turn, could do little with that one nor prove to be a match for the winner, enough left to save the show. JERRY'S LEGACY settled off the
pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, slowly gaining for the show late. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE within striking distance while three wide
exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. SHAKETHAHATERSOFF lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, also lacked a rally. MRS. DELLA off a step
slow, moved outside, came five wide into the stretch, remained back as well in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
KEHRON'S CREED stalked the pace off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, long drive, narrowly gained the nod while between
rivals at the wire. ANY OLE THING steadied just after the start in a slow beginning, remained back the opening five furlongs, was five wide when
commencing to rally into the stretch, closed with good late energy on the outside to just miss. JUANANDORA dueled up front closest to the inside,
continued to alternate in the run up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed as the winner was challenging exiting the final turn, proved stubborn to the
end to just miss while closest to the inside of the first flight. BELLA KRISTINA settled off the pace, within striking distance after a half, lacked a closing
response in the drive. CASUAL COOL dueled up front in the two path for six furlongs then gave way into the lane. CRY LIKE A BABY raced in mid pack
early, had nothing for the drive. LADY DATE broke back, never menaced,. ZARB'S WINNIE broke back, trailed throughout to be well beaten.

Footnotes
DONWELL lacked speed while off the inside, advanced four wide into the stretch, engaged the leader late and wore that rival down under brisk handling.
LIP SERVICE also raced back early while off the inside, advanced four wide far turn, took over nearing the furlong ground, gave ground grudgingly to the
winner, clearly second best. THREE RUN HOMER away in good order, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the stretch, could not
match the top two the final furlong, lasted for the show. DR. BAGLEY settled off the pace and the inside, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing
response. BEN'S MAGIC STONE settled within striking distance, continued to save ground through the final turn and came up empty for the stretch run as
well. FLASHY IMAGE in the first flight through the first turn inside, fell back the middle half, moved out, came four wide into the stretch and was another
found lacking with the real running began. WABASH CANNONBALL void of any early foot, never menaced. ROLLWITHIT last to leave, remained always
back. SIMBA'S PRIDE was also always outrun. CAJUN CASH broke running from the outside, prompted the pace for six furlongs, stopped in the drive.

KING'S PRAYER broke alertly, sprinted clear soon after, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn while being given a breather, remained clear
through the lane while being kept to task. FLASHBURN also broke in good order, chased the winner throughout off the inside, moved a bit closer out of the
turn, proved no match in the final furlong. IT'SUPTOYOUPAL in the second flight, had little for the top two in the drive, proved determined for the show.
HUGHES DONT LOSE settled off the pace and the inside, set down for the drive, lacked a significant response in the drive, outkicked for the show spot.
BIG COUNT went evenly in lacking a closing effort. BROTHER DAVID also lacked the needed closing response in the drive. ESCAPE THE GALAXY broke
back and was never a factor. CANRUNALITTLE dwelt at the the start, remained sluggish in the run up the backstretch, collapsed midway on the turn in
apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
HALOSTAR broke alertly, set the pace inside, rated in the run up the backstretch and far turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the stretch, not
threatened in the run to the wire. OH MY ACHING ARCH allowed the pace to go early, crept closer while off the inside late in the final turn, could do no
more with the winner through the stretch, fully extended to last for the second spot. UNWANTED INTRUDER settled off the pace, came into the stretch off
the inside when roused for the drive, slowly getting to the runner up late. GEM OF CARLOS pressed the winner for five furlongs off the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
PURE VALOR broke with the field, vied early, shook clear while well off the inside late backstretch, stayed clear through the turn in the three path, not
threatened in the stretch while being kept to pressure. ROUND QUARTER with the first flight early while along the inside, chased the winner through the
turn and into the stretch, could do little with that rival in the run to the wire, enough left to last for the place. SUPERCONDUCTOR also raced with the first
group while inside the winner early, pursued that rival through the turn outside the runner up through the bend, also proved no match for the victress through
the stretch, outkicked for the second spot. GRAND TY settled off the inside early while toward the inside, saved some ground through the turn, moved out a
bit for the drive and improved position slightly. CLASSIC HEATH last away, trailed early as a result, was five wide out of the turn, staged some mild late
interest to improve position down the middle of the strip. SIX GRAND void of speed, was four wide out of the turn, also improved position. TIZ NEYNEY
AND RAD forwardly early inside the winner, faded. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE lacked speed toward the inside, was never dangerous. HIGHLY CENTSABLE
behind the leaders, tired in the drive. ELLA'S ACTOR steadily faded. CALLMECHAMP was finished early.
