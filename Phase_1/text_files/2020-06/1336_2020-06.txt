Footnotes
CHICKS FOR FREE was off a step slowly then jostled between horses at the start, rushed to gain position through the early stages, but was rank between
horses when the rider of DAUER failed to control his mount at the half mile pole, stalked the leaders three wide around the turn, sustained a rally through
deep stretch wtih MR PICKLES to catch, and wore that foe down in the final sixteenth. MR. PICKLES was off a bit slowly and bobbled a bit at the start,
recovered to prompt the pace three, then two, wide into the turn, bid for the lead outside of EL CASADORA at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage
from that rival in upper stretch, but was worn down by CHICKS FOR FREE in the late stages. EL CASADORA broke sharply and set the pace from the
onset, was tested by MR PICKLES turning for home and was headed by that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, then subsequently gave way while
hanging on his left lead. HIGHEST MANDATE broke a bit inwards and trailed the field early on, advanced through the turn while five wide and outside of
rivals, but lugged inwards in upper stretch and flattened out. DAUER was sent early on to be forwardly placed along the inside, but got a bit rank when the
rider failed to control his mount at the half mile pole, then saved ground around the turn, but to no avail. CAVATINA was keen while between horses in
midpack passing the half mile pole, took the turn in the two path after coming under a drive at the three furlong pole, then failed to play a factor. COUNT
FROST took the turn in the four path while in midpack, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. CITI CHARM was midpack along the inside early on, but
retreated to trail the field at the half mile pole, then was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
RAHWAY set the pace from the onset while staying a path off the inner raIl, widened her advantage when asked in upper stretch, and was driven to the
wire. CATTY KRYS was forwardly placed along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch to be outside of the leader, but failed to match strides
with that foe, then fended off GRATS ROAD through the late stages to hold place. GRATS ROAD took the first turn in the three path while rating off of the
pace, shifted to the four path into the far turn before swinging to the five path turning for home, then sustained a mild grinding advance, but was fended off
for place in the late stages. URBAN KAT shifted to the four path and advanced in between horses to striking range into the far turn, but failed to keep pace
with rivals on both side after shifting down to the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, then kept on for a minor reward. FUN PADDY was caught
four wide around the first turn while far off of the pace, sustained a steady advance down the backstretch to make a four wide bid for place into the far turn
while in the five path, shifted down to the four path around that bend, but flattened out turning for home. MOLLY'S GAME prompted the pace setter while in
the three path, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole and faded. SILVERTAIL trailed early on and never got involved.
COLORINCOLONEL never got involved while in the two path.

Footnotes
BLUNT FORCE was forwardly placed two wide, inched forward to bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage while inside of FRENCH ROSE in
upper stretch, then held firm and kept that foe at bay through the late stages. FRENCH ROSE was forwardly placed three wide, made a three wide bid in
upper stretch with BLUNT FORCE catch, but failed to make late headway and proved second best. ISABELLE'S JOY broke in and bumped a rival a the
start, pulled forward inside of rivals to lie just behind the leader into the turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to split foes at the furlong
pole, and finished up evenly. GIANNA'S GIFT cleared away from the field early on, held a margin through the turn, but was headed by rivals in upper stretch
and yielded. HEAVEN ESCAPE broke outwards, raced in midpack in the three path around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ALL FACT
was sandwiched between horses at the start and took up hard, produced a rally in the three to four path outside of rivals around the turn to be in striking
position turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch and faded. SHE WANTS MORE broke outwards and bothered a foe at the start, then failed to
get involved thereafter. TIMELY MISS trailed throughout and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MILLENNIUM FORCE set the pace along the inside from the onset, repelled SAIL ON ELLEN's bid in upper stretch and shook loose from the field
approaching the furlong pole, then held sway through the late stages. JIM'S BRONZE STAR saved ground chasing the leading group through the turn, split
foes in the three path at the furlong pole, and edged place from between horses in the final sixteenth. SAIL ON ELLEN was forwardly placed in the four path
down the backstretch, made a three wide bid into the far turn and vied turning for home, but hung on her left lead in upper stretch, was repelled at the three
sixteenths pole, battled on for place, but was outfinished. FLATOYA stalked close to the pace along the inside, but lacked a kick to make a rail bid in
midstretch, then was outfinished for minor rewards in the late stages. GIRL NAMED PATSY had a slow start, saved ground in midpack, and finished up
evenly without threatening. CLAUDETTE NONSTOP prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. BESTOW was
off slowly and bumped by a foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace before leaving the rail turning for home, but drifted outwards when the rider
switched to left handed pressure at the three sixteenths pole, and failed to menace. SKYHAWK saved ground while far off of the pace and was no factor.
WAR FOR PEACE was off slowly, trailed the field in the two path, and passed tired foes along the rail through the lane. MEDIA MENDACITY failed to factor
after shifting to the four path in upper stretch. MY DESTINY was brushed on her hind quarters at the start, shifted from the three path to the five path while
midpack turning for home, and weakened. HEALTHFUL was off slowly and raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, lugged in in upper
stretch while still well out of it, then failed to factor.

Footnotes
ART COLLECTOR set a soft pace inside of FINNICK THE FIERCE, shook loose from that foe when let out a notch turning for home, then widened his
advantage through the lane under a mild hand ride. SHARED SENSE trailed his trio of rivals while in the two path around the far turn, shifted to the three
path into the backstretch, stalked the leaders three wide around the far turn, but came under a drive turning for home, produced a place bid outside of
FINNICK THE FIERCE in midstretch, then edged that position away from that rival approaching the wire. FINNICK THE FIERCE was washed out pre-race,
prompted ART COLLECTOR from the outside, inched forward and vied for the lead outside of that rival into the far turn, but was repelled and proved no
match for that foe turning for home, then lost place in the late stages. NECKER ISLAND stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the far turn, but
failed to produce a bid and weakened.

Footnotes
EBBEN stalked along the inside, rated patiently in the pocket around the turn, waited behind horses in the three path turning for home, shifted to the five
path approaching the furlong pole, and surged between horses to edge an advantage in the late stages. PYRON prompted the pace three wide, bid for the
lead in the four path turning for home, forged an advantage from an inner foe passing the quarter pole, then held a margin passing the furlong pole, but was
bested in the late stages by an oncharging rival. TWELFTH LABOUR took the turn in the four path while midpack, shifted to the five path turning for home,
produced a bid in upper stretch, but did not have enough to reach the leader. RUNNIN' RAY dueled two wide, forged an advantage passing the five
sixteenths pole but was headed by PYRON at the quarter pole, battled on through the lane, but yielded in the final sixteenth. TIZ MISCHIEF saved ground
while far off of the pace, shifted to the three path turning for home, but failed to factor. TUT'S REVENGE dueled for the lead inside of RUNNIN' RAY, but
weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently faded. CHASIN CHARLIE trailed early on, then never got involved. MAKE NOISE was
crowded between horses at the start, came under a drive at the three furlong pole, took the turn in the five path and outside of rivals while far off of the pace,
shifted to the six path turning for home, and failed to respond.

CROATIAN stalked the pace early along the inside, squeezed through along the rail near the five sixteenths pole, stayed on the inside into the lane, took
over command down the lane and drew away in the final stages. EISENSTAEDT chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and was no
match for the winner in the stretch run. FULL OF RUN was a bit slow from the gate and trailed the field early on, raced along the three path into the lane,
altered out widest in the stretch drive and had a late gain in the final stages. DECEMBER SEVEN tracked the pace early, took over and led near the five
sixteenths pole, was off the rail into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. HARDLY A SECRET raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane, was
steadied in upper stretch and moved up late in the stretch run. ESKENFORIT chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch drive. RARE FORM set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. DEGROM was a bit slow at the start and was
no factor. POPULAR KID was never a real threat.
