Footnotes
STAR GAZE dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged with BORN TO D' WILD through the second turn, put that one
away entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth pole and was clear late under mild urging. THEBOYZGALAXY off a step slow, chased the early
pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and closed with a rush for the place. KOOL AID GIRL
pressed the early pace outside, remained in a forward position for the drive but was outfinished for the place. BORN TO D' WILD dueled from the outside
early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but could not keep pace. D'OR FILLE was never a factor. DEEP END was
never close. Split times unavailable due to a timer malfunction.

SENT'S GALAXY dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn with TOOCAN DANCE, put that one away entering the drive, was engaged by
AMAZING SOUND, dueled with that one and outnodded his rival after a stretch long duel. AMAZING SOUND chased the early pace from the inside,
steadily advanced through the turn, engaged the winner entering the drive but was outnodded. GRAND TRIBUTE well placed from the outside, chased the
pace through the turn, remained forward but could not keep pace. LAKEN LONGLEGS pressed the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the drive
but was too late. TAP A MIRACLE could only improve position. TOOCAN DANCE dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn then
tired in the drive. SAINT DANSANT was no factor. MOONLIGHT WILLY dueled from the inside and gave way. BRUSH WHACKER was never a threat. Spit
times unavailable due to a timer malfunction.

THIRSTYAMERICANGAL stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded when sat down for the drive and was just up the
final stride. CHEROKEE CHATTER well placed early from the inside, inched closer through the turn, responded but was outfinished the last stride.
CUSTOM CUT broke sharp from the inside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, continued to be clear at the eighth pole but
could not last. LADY'S TRIBUTE chased the early pace outside, made a bid entering the drive and rallied late. MILLIE'S AN ANGEL could only improve
position. FLAT SCAT forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY could only pass tired ones. IRON CROSS
was never close. PRIMAL PAST was always outrun. Due to a timer malfunction all times have been omitted.

BOSS LADY MELISSA dueled from between foes early, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second turn, was engaged by SHE'S TOO COOL
entering the drive and outfinished that one after a stirring stretch long drive. SHE'S TOO COOL up close early from the outside, dueled through the second
turn, remained engaged entering the drive, dueled with the winner through the drive but was outfinished in a game effort. CHRISTEANA'S KISS stalked the
early pace from the inside, dropped back slightly up the backstretch, responded entering the second turn and rallied late for the show. QUICK POINT could
only improve position. NANA'S JOY went evenly. CELTIC LASS pressed the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the second turn but faltered in
the drive. LIL KYLIE dueled from the inside early, remained engaged up the backstretch then gave way. Seven eighths split time unavailable duel to a timer
malfunction.

HOYAM up close early from the outside, chased the pace up the backstretch, crept closer entering the second turn, dueled through the second turn,
remained engaged through the drive with TARANTA and outfinished that one late. TARANTA (IRE) unhurried early from the inside, chased the pace up the
backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, angled outside for the drive, responded to duel with the winner through the drive but just missed.
CINDY'S PRAYER broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, dueled through the second turn,
remained forward for the drive but weakened the final yards. LOVE BOUND chased the early pace outside, made a bid entering the drive but was too late.
STUMBERG was never a factor. MALIBU JUNE chased the early pace and tired. MINERTIME forced the early pace inside and gave way.

ROCKINTHERED broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and
was well clear while lightly roused. AMANDAS LIGHTENING pressed the early pace from the inside, angled outside for the drive, responded and was just
up for the place. DOUBLE PRIORITY up close early from the outside, chased the pace through the turn, responded but could not keep pace while holding
the show. PREACHER forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. GASPERGOU went evenly. FLASH OF PEPPER forced the early pace
inside and tired. TEXAS STORM CHASER was no factor. CHAN MAN was no threat. BRINKMANSHIP was never close. Due to timer malfunction all times
have been omitted.
