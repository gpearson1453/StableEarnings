Footnotes
LADY MAGNA stalked the early speed from just off the inside, took over when allowed on the bend then steadily drew away under a mild drive in the lane.
FOO FOO GIRL quickly moved clear of the field and took the inside, was challenged on the turn, no match for LADY MAGNA and could only just last for the
place. AMSALOR shuffled back at the break, picked up her pace from inside on the turn, squeezed through along the rail at the top of the lane, closed well
and narrowly missed second. NOW THATS ALL chased from outside, lost ground fanning widest into the lane but showed late interest. JERSEY SCANDAL
four wide on the bend, weaved through traffic to advance in the stretch. BARBIELLO forwardly placed between rivals, weakened late. WARY CARRIE
chased from inside, angled out leaving the turn, altered out for a clear path upper stretch then had no late bid. CRAFTY DANZIN prominent early,
threatened three wide on the turn but gave way for the drive. CRICKET steadily faded from inside.

Footnotes
SEATTLE TRAIN rated off the early speed, picked up her pace between rivals on the bend, fanned four wide for the stretch run, took the advantage inside
the furlong marker and gradually opened up under a drive. DON'T DALLY vied for the early lead outside RUBY LEES SONG, was no match for SEATTLE
TRAIN the last furlong but won her battle for second. RUBY LEES SONG displayed early speed just off the inside then also had to battle for second from
between rivals in the lane and did not have enough late. TAPNFIRE chased from well off the inside but showed late interest running widest through the
stretch. CAROL'S A CASE prominent early, saved ground through the bend, her rider lost his whip leaving the quarter pole, vied for the lead midstretch but
could not sustain her bid. SERENA'S HALO came into contention three wide on the turn, fanned outside SEATTLE TRAIN into the lane and gradually wore
down. JUST CHARLIE failed to menace. ICE ATTACK saved ground and was never a factor. WAKE UP AND RUN showed little.

Footnotes
SHMILY was sent to contest the pace from inside, moved clear with a quarter mile to go, his rider lost his whip upper stretch but steadily opened up under
hand urging as much the best. GO VO contested the pace between rivals, drifted out as he dropped back from SHMILY leaving the turn then could only just
last for the place. ROSKI forwardly placed just off the inside, showed a willingness to run late between rivals. GO BEEJA pressed from outside, lost some
ground staying outside GO VO leaving the turn then lacked the extra needed deep stretch. BAD MOON void of early speed, saved ground taking the turn,
commenced his bid in the stretch and gradually angled out the last furlong to advance. AFFIRMATIF SONG saved ground to no avail. JOLLY GHAALY
failed to menace in a wide trip. ROCKYSHACK showed little.

Footnotes
CROCE D'ORO vied for the lead briefly then was rated off RIPE ATTACK, went for the lead from between rivals leaving the bend and slowly edged ahead
under steady urging in the stretch. SEA OF MAKEBELIEVE commenced his bid three wide on the turn, was caught in close quarters between horses upper
stretch, altered inside CROCE D'ORO with a furlong left and gained second late. INTERNET SUCCESS advanced to contention four wide on the bend,
dueled for the lead from outside upper stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. YABA DABA DOO chased from midpack, had the rail on the
turn, angled out upper stretch and improved position without threatening. DR. LIECHTY also saved ground taking the bend, came off the rail some to reach
a striking position upper stretch but leveled off instead. HAWK'S IMAGE improved position three wide on the turn then lacked a significant stretch response.
CLASS WON chased from between horses, altered in upper stretch for a clear path then also lacked the needed late bid. CAST IRON was four wide taking
the turn, failed to have a stretch rally. RIPE ATTACK was hustled to an early lead but quit from inside leaving the bend.

Footnotes
GARRISON COMMANDER contested the pace from the beginning, drifted out some leaving the second turn, pulled clear under urging in the stretch and
maintained control under a steady drive. MALIGATOR settled at the back, gradually picked up his pace on the backstretch, lost ground widest into the lane,
closed well but was too late. CUT TO ORDER bumped at the break, raced in contention between horses, did not keep up through the second bend, lacked
a serious stretch bid but caught DAVKA for third. DAVKA disputed the early pace outside GARRISON COMMANDER, was no match for that one when set
down for the drive and began to wear down the last furlong. AMAROQ steadily progressed to threaten between rivals on the second turn but gave way for
the drive. MR. TICKER TALKER broke outward, bumping CUT TO ORDER, was prominent just off the inside, gave way after five furlongs and was hand
ridden between horses the last quarter mile. MR D'S WAY failed to menace. AMERICAN SUCCESS battled for the early lead between horses but was
finished after a half mile. I'VE GOT ISSUES chased from inside, swung to the outside leaving the second turn but had little to offer. JAGUAR RIDGE
displayed early speed from inside but quit after four furlongs.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE moved clear of the rest with a half mile to go, was challenged from outside on the turn but pulled away as much the best in the
stretch while kept to task to the waning yards. D' YANK forwardly placed between rivals from the beginning, advanced three wide on the turn, altered in
upper stretch for a clear path and edged ahead for second late. COUP DE VILLE unwillinging to load for several minutes, trailed from outside in the early
going, was four wide taking the bend then showed a willingness to run deep stretch from outside. TUFF ATTACK raced in the second flight from outside,
threatened on the turn, proved no match for KHOZAN'S VALENTINE when set down for the drive and his rider lost her whip inside the sixteenth marker.
AUNDREYA'S BOY prominent between rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide through the bend but closed the gap on the second flight
through the waning yards. BOLD ATTACK was an early factor just off the rail but gave way on the turn. LIBOR PLUS displayed early speed while in close
quarters along the rail on the backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
LONG LEGGED LINDA jostled between horses shortly after the break, went for the lead outside KALISPELL leaving the bend, took over upper stretch then
continued to draw clear under a drive. KALISPELL vied for the early lead between rivals, moved ahead and stayed off the rail on the turn, could not stay with
LONG LEGGED LINDA upper stretch, angled out some approaching the furlong marker and could only just hold on for second. JUKEBOX MONEY broke
inward, jostling with LONG LEGGED LINDA, raced in contention outside the latter, her rider lost his whip midstretch, angled in shortly after that and was
clearly best of the rest. LOGI was a contender running widest for a half mile then began to wear down. HELEN MAE'S SONG also jostled briefly with LONG
LEGGED LINDA shortly after the start, was prominent between horses, moved to the inside leaving the turn and began to wear down nearing the last
furlong. ARCTIC MUSIC displayed early speed just off the inside but gave way two wide with three furlongs left. LADY WARRIOR was soon well back,
closed the gap from outside on the bend then drifted out through the lane. FOGGY KITTEN pressed the pace from along the rail on the backstretch, gave
way on the turn and was allowed to coast through the stretch.
