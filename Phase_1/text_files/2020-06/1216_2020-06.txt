Footnotes
CHICKEN DINNER prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, secured command inside the three sixteenths, battled outside
BA YORK past the eighth pole, kicked clear under a drive then was kept to steady hand urging the final seventy yards. DATA PRINCESS had speed to lead
early, checked off the heels of BA YORK as that one went to command near the half mile marker, regrouped to stalk, edged up past the five sixteenths,
angled out to find room leaving mid stretch and came back between rivals to gain the place. TOUGH N BUFF had her rider briefly lose the left iron after
breaking a bit slow, recovered and edged forward into the turn, angled out, circled rivals five wide into the lane and churned on. BA YORK moved up outside
rivals in the opening furlong, angled in clearing into the turn, set the pace two wide, was confronted by rivals near the quarter pole, battled on past mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SILVER SIDES stalked the pace four wide, advanced between runners nearing the quarter pole,
checked when put in tight leaving the furlong grounds then failed to seriously recover. NEXT QUEEN moved up between runners early on to close, angled in
then steadied near the far turn, stalked inside to the stretch then gave way. BIGDADDYSGLORY , towards the inside leaving the far turn, was not a factor.
PRISS was outrun. MAJORIE MUGS broke a step slow, lost ground four wide and faded.

Footnotes
THE MAGICAL ONE , unhurried down the backstretch, circled the far turn four deep, closed determinedly outside BAYTOWN JIMBO and was up late.
BAYTOWN JIMBO advanced four deep entering the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. JUNIOR SENATOR , three wide the
first turn, bid for the lead in the two path between horses leaving the far turn and failed to sustain the move. WISE MEN lacked speed and passed tired
horses late. AULD LANGE SYNE , three wide between horses leaving the far turn, failed to rally. SENOR SEVILLE , no factor, was five deep the far turn.
HUNT ME DOWN , three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. STUCCO was not a factor. CONFUSION BABY BOY showed speed along the
rial and tired. WAR LANCE sprinted clear leaving the first turn, set the pace along the rail and gave way. COFFEE PLEASE , steadied the first turn, gave
way. FIVE STAR PERFECT was outrun.

Footnotes
LION LORD vied outside HIGH ROLLER before going clear into the turn, set the pace two wide around the turn, opened up under a drive in mid stretch,
drifted in some then held firm. MIDNIGHT CRY had speed then rated off the winner to stalk three wide, came under pressure mid turn, gave hard pursuit
into the lane and stayed on for the place. COBH settled in the clear early on, moved up between foes after a half mile, angled out and closed steadily.
UMMU UMMU UMMU had speed then drafted back nearing the half mile marker, came under pressure mid turn, circled four wide making headway into the
lane then kept on trying to the line. TICKER TAPE PARADE rated inside foes nearing the half mile marker, advanced between runners nearing the five
sixteenths, angled out about five to six wide into the stretch, shifted back in some and continued with some interest. HIGH ROLLER vied inside the winner
through the opening quarter mile, failed to keep pace and dropped back mid turn, race two wide into the stretch but could not generate the needed
comeback. BAYTOWN GLORY saved ground under pressure and lacked a bid. UNEQUIVOCAL leaned in and brushed with a rival to be away slowly,
circled five wide and offered a slight kick. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR saved ground, failed to keep up and gave way. SWING STEP , away awkwardly when
brushed, raced four wide around the turn and failed to menace. HOMER J faltered.

Footnotes
AWESOME D J rated kindly while saving ground just off the leaders, eased out past the quarter pole, moved through an inviting seam in upper stretch and
eagerly kicked away under a drive. CELTIC TREASURE prompted the pace outside PUMPKIN STAR, went on the attack past the five sixteenths, vied into
the stretch and kept on gamely to save the place. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN , four wide stalking the pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn, bid outside
foes after six furlongs, drifted out a bit into the lane, straightened, gave willing chase to the end and just missed the place. V. I. P. CODE broke a bit slow,
was hustled from the gate, steadied briefly a few strides out, was taken well wide into the first turn, lost ground five wide through the backstretch run,
commenced a rally past the three eighths, was fanned six wide turning for home but failed to sustain the final furlong. PUMPKIN STAR took over into the
first turn, set the pace towards the rail, was hounded past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. RUNABOUT rated between
foes early, was under coaxing four wide past the three eighths but lacked a rally. BOB'S MY UNCLE settled in mid pack, raced three wide between runners
near the quarter pole and came up empty. SAVVY STREET dropped in early, lagged and failed to rally. KENYAN gained an inside position early, edged up
a bit near the half and faded. CANDY ASSET , three wide, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
MARYLAND MO saved ground stalking the pace, gained the lead along the rail in mid stretch and drew off. BOLD QUEST lacked speed, swung to the
seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. HOUSE ARREST saved ground around the far turn while setting the pace, came off the rail in upper
stretch, swerved out near the eighth pole and weakened. LASTING IMAGE lacked speed, was taken to the eighth pole, switched to his proper lead late and
passed tired rivals. CHAMPAGNE DIET , four wide both turns, floated to the six path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally`. KENDAMA lost
ground entering the stretch and failed to be a menace. COHIBA GHOST chased the pace, raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and
weakened. LIFESPAN advanced in the two path between horses on the far turn and retreated after being checked in tight quarters in mid stretch. BODIE'S
DANCE bore out leaving the starting gate, checked in traffic entering the first turn and was not a factor. MAN UP DUDE , pinched back leaving the starting
gate, advanced outside horses on the far turn and steadied in tight quarters in mid stretch. PREMIERE CHOICE was no factor. FAVOR MAKER trailed.

Footnotes
R TRUE SENSATION tracked in hand three to four wide, cruised up to challenge mid turn, gained command entering the lane, spurted away after being set
down then was fully extended to last. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE broke slowly, advanced outside rivals into the turn, ranged up five wide into the lane, drifted in
and made contact with FLIRTATION WALK past the eighth pole, corrected and closed steadily to gain. JOYFUL NOISE , off the pace while saving ground,
steadied off heels nearing the turn, eased out and moved up mid turn, swung about six wide into the lane, dropped back in a bit to progress near mid
stretch, altered back out, split rivals and finished well to gain. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY dropped off the early pace, angled out leaving the far turn, came
five to six wide for the drive and finished with interest. FLIRTATION WALK chased between rivals, edged up past the three sixteenths, was bumped and
herded inward by SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE leaving mid stretch and flattened out. SPLENDOR GAL broke a bit slowly, raced very wide through the final three
furlongs and offered a mild kick. GLORIA'S GAL was rated back early, saved ground mid turn, angled out past the three sixteenths but failed to rally. GIRL
DRAMA grabbed command early, set the pace just off the inside, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then
gave way. JAZZY JUDER saved ground while in range to the turn, angled out a bit for the drive and gave way. CIAO LUNA , caught between rivals giving
early pursuit, dropped back some nearing the quarter pole, angled out and came up empty. BARBSGRAY LION forced the issue outside a rival, dropped in
around the turn, stayed in touch to upper stretch then gave way leaving the furlong grounds. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of
FLIRTATION WALK, SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE was disqualified from second and placed fifth for causing interference in the stretch.

Footnotes
MARY ALICE stalked four wide, bid outside rivals leaving the three eighths pole, dueled outside KEEPER IN SPITE heading towards the lane, dropped back
a bit past the three sixteenths, came back then was bumped when resurgent a sixteenth out, straightened, forged to command late and was fully extended
to prevail. KEEPER IN SPITE rated off the early lead, quickly bid between foes three furlongs out, gained a slim lead mid turn, dueled inside the winner
before shaking free inside the three sixteenths, wandered outward from left handed rousing and bumped with the winner a sixteenth from home, corrected
and stayed gamely. ANY MINUTE NOW saved ground early, angled out and split rivals mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch, shifted further out in the
final furlong and steadily gained. NOW OR EVER chased off the rail, edged up between rivals nearing the lane, continued pursuit past the eighth pole but
flattened out late. FREEDOM QUEEN , off the pace, raced three deep mid turn, angled five wide for the drive and had belated interest. TAPPING MY
HEART bobbled at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, angled four wide into the lane, steadied off heels, regrouped and had a mild response.
LIL SURVIVOR failed to menace. FOUR LADY lacked speed inside, angled out near mid stretch but failed to menace. VICTORY TIME saved ground while
outrun. YIRA flashed speed, pursued to mid turn then faltered. KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS was sent up then went clear nearing the half mile marker, set the
pace towards the inside, was swarmed over leaving the three eighths and dropped back nearing the lane. DEVIL'S REVOLUTION refused, galloped around
when finally leaving the gate and was distanced.
