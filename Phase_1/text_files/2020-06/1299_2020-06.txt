Footnotes
MIN FREYA broke readily, tracked just off the leaders three wide racing to the turn and continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage and went clear
under firm encouragement. ROSES FOR DOUG tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and
continued with interest to prove best of the others. RIVER SWAN settled between foes in early stages, shifted out entering the stretch and continued to
improve position between foes to prevail for a share. UNBRIDLEDMOONLIGHT broke readily to gain terms prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue on
the turn to edge forward racing into upper stretch but faltered midstretch. KENNEDY'S DAY, urged to gain a position off the second flight, angled in racing
into the lane and continued with an even effort. MZ JACKIE was hustled to contend in early stages, made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide to the turn
and gave way. COWGIRL COURT, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half. TOP SHELF SARA, bumped
at the start, was settled last and passed only tiring rivals. FAST MATH tracked off the second flight near the inside and retreated early. MY AWARD tracked
off the second flight between foes in the opening stages but faded early. Race times included after further review of tracking data.

Footnotes
COLLEGE QUEEN tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards entering the bend to advance on
the leader three deep after a half, lost some ground to that foe entering the lane but shifted out and wore down the leader to prevail in time under firm left
handed encouragement. LIL B QUICK, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the rail, dispatched a rival, then edged forward racing into the
lane but failed to sustain that momentum. DEPUTY DORA bobbled at the start, was righted to track off the first flight between foes, shifted out four wide
entering the lane and edged rivals for a share. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. COUNCIL RULES tracked the leaders three deep between foes in early stages, shifted in nearing the turn and soon faded.
REMARKABLE CHARM settled last in early stages and failed to menace. TROPHY BRIDLE stumbled at the start, was collected while racing extremely
wide in the opening stages, continued four wide into the turn and proved no threat. SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, gave
way after a half.

Footnotes
NORA'S LEGACY, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue through the turn to upper stretch and edged forward to a narrow advantage
under brisk left handed pressure. HUNTER'S HELLCAT tracked off the second flight racing five wide to the turn, the made a steady advance outside foes
racing into the lane to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire while just failing to collar the winner. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN, urged to dictate the pace
on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command on the turn into the lane and weakened late. TIMEINTHETAVERN, off slowly, was urged to
gain a position inside foes just off the first flight racing into the turn but came up empty entering upper stretch. TANTIMA settled between foes dropping off
the second flight, then split foes just off the inside to gain some position in late stages. GOING RUNNING TOO angled to the inside early dropping well off
the leaders, switched out three wide entering the lane and made some belated progress. AMANDA STORY worked her way to the inside tracking leaders as
part of the second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. WEE MS. BURNZIE stumbled at the start, was quickly righted to track just off
the first flight racing three wide to the turn but gave way after a half. TIMBER LADY proved no factor. WARREN'S WISH was a brief factor four wide in
second flight racing to the turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
FENDER BENDER was switched off the inside early tracking behind the second flight, steadily gained position between foes racing through the turn, shifted
out four wide while moving to close the gap on the leader nearing midstretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. GEAUXCRO broke readily, disputed
the pace racing a bit off the rail into the turn, went clear in upper stretch, drifted out while being urged to resist the winner's challenge but came up second
best. BLUE JEANS N BEER tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out making steady progress four wide racing through
the turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. DAD'S A GAMBLER, shuffled back at the start, settled into stride, split foes three
deep racing into the lane, then angled inside foes racing through the stretch while finding his best stride late. CYCLONE DAN tracked off the second flight
five wide in early stages and continued evenly in that path to the lane. LONESOME HIGHWAY angled inside tracking just off the first flight, saved ground to
upper stretch but faded in the drive while drifting out late. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL, caught six wide in the opening quarter, soon dropped out. ROYAL
CREED bobbled at the start, was urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the turn and gave way into the lane. OVERANALYZFAKENEWS tracked
just off the first flight racing three wide to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TEMUJIN LADY vied for the lead three deep between foes in the opening quarter, continued in a protracted skirmish while shifting inwards racing into upper
stretch and edged forward late under strong handling. MS KELA TIME, in touch with the first flight five wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the
issue four wide through the turn, couldn't match the winner in late stages but proved best of the others. STYLIN N PROFILIN, shuffled out of close quarters
at the start, settled into stride, angled inside on the turn gathering momentum, then shifted out four wide entering the stretch and steadily gained position to
the end. SPEEDING LADY broke slowly, was settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and found her best stride late. DROP O' CHOCOLATE
vied for command inside foes from the outset into the into turn and gave way in upper stretch. BABY GORDITA tracked off the first flight five wide in early
stages and never gained contention. FLASH FLOOD was settled into stride along the inside, shifted out entering the lane but lacked a rally. SOBER PEACE
vied with the first flight four wide between foes into the turn and gave way after a half. SHAY'S GLORY proved no factor. BINDING TIME forwardly placed
three deep between foes racing just off the first flight, gave way entering the bend. FACING NORTH vied briefly between foes just off the inside but dropped
out early.

RAY'S ANGEL was urged to the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin remaining a bit off the rail into the turn,
then held sway to the end under firm handling. EL TIZAR broke sharply, was urged inside the eventual winner prompting that rival into the turn but couldn't
gain even terms while best of the others. GOPHER GOLD tracked the leaders four wide between foes in early stages, angled inwards racing into the stretch
and continued with a mild bid to edge a rival for a share. WEEKEND RIDE broke slowly, was hustled between foes to gain a position off the first flight,
lodged a brief, three wide bid nearing the lane but had no final kick. LIL' NINJA was rated between foes tracking off the second flight, angled to the rail
racing into upper stretch and continued to gain some position. BLUE ECLIPSE, urged pursuing the leaders four wide into the turn, gave way into the lane.
OVERLY LUCKY, shuffled back at the start, was reserved in early stages, swung out five wide nearing the lane but never seriously menaced. HATTIES
JEWEL settled off the second flight between foes and offered no rally. PHANTOM THREEONINE, reserved off the second flight outside foes, angled in
nearing the lane but offered no rally. BIG FALCON ROCKET flashed brief pace inside foes in the opening quarter but gave way into the turn. YOU SAY SO,
caught five wide racing to the turn, dropped out early. IMA HARLEY TOO broke awkwardly while being steadied at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
UNLEASH THE BEAST broke sharply, angled to the inside racing into the first turn dictating the pace on a comfortable margin and held sway into the lane
under firm encouragement to prove best. TWOKO BAY was rated between foes just off the second flight, split foes nearing upper stretch, angled out three
deep and continued with a steady late response to prove best of the others. VALENTINE GUY tracked the pacesetter inside rivals just off the second flight,
briefly awaited an opening racing into the far turn, came through inside foes to gain position but was outkicked for the place honors. BLUE DANCER, urged
to gain a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, lodged a brief bid racing into upper stretch but flattened out late. FAYETTE
WARRIOR, caught four wide between foes racing into the first turn, settled well off the second flight, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and gained
some position in an even effort. MINNESOTA MIRACLE, caught five wide racing into the first turn, was prompted to gain terms with the second flight racing
four wide into the far turn and faded in the drive. WHY GOD, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. MOST AMUSING,
urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter in second flight, gave way nearing the lane.

VEGAN GOES BEST, urged to force the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, shook clear after the opening quarter, held sway off the rail and was
kept to firm encouragement. WHO'S FOOLING WHO, urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the second flight along the inside on the turn,
shifted out racing through the lane to split foes and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire. FAIRLY HONEST, urged pursuing the leaders four wide
through the backstretch to the turn, continued three deep into the lane but lacked the needed late bid. HALEYS HEIST bobbled at the start, quickly
recovered, was urged disputing the pace a bit off the rail, continued in pursuit of the winner into the turn and gave way into the lane. VICTIM settled off the
leaders while angling inside early, saved ground to the lane but never gained contention. GREATEST GAL tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing
to the turn but offered no rally. CHICLE SPARKS settled between foes in the last flight and failed to menace. COIL AND STRIKE settled outside foes in the
