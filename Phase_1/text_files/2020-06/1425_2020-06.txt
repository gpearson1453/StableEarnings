Footnotes
FAST INTENTIONS was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced well off the inside in the stretch and held gamely to be clear late under all out pressure.
FAIRY DUST tracked the early leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
SACRED SHO GRL stalked the pace, raced towards the inside throughout and finished willingly to the wire. NO GOOD DEED broke in sharply at the start,
settled off the early leaders, raced three deep in the lane and had no rally. GAVIE took up at the break, was unhurried early, saved ground and never was a
factor. OFFERYOUCANTREFUSE was slowly, raced five wide into the stretch and never threatened. JANE settled off the pace and failed to have a
response. POLLYPEPTIDE was unhurried early, saved ground and never was a factor.

SONG OF INDY set all the pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. PARANOIA tracked the early leader while racing
just off the inside, raced three wide through the lane and finished second best. ADREAMGOESONFORVER stalked the pace from the outside, angled to the
inside down the backstretch, moved up while saving ground into the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. NEW FOUND TREASURE dropped back early,
raced towards the inside, angled four wide through the stretch and showed good late interest. DULCIBELLE (GER) dropped back early, raced three deep
and had not enough late. L. A. HOUSE stalked the pace, took bad steps near the three eighths pole, raced four wide through the stretch and weakened a bit
late. IVANYA settled early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. GETWITHIT was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. SIX PACK GAL failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN stalked the pace, raced two wide through the lane, surged late and got up under steady handling. DEVOTION IN MOTION showed
good speed from the outside, was well clear mid stretch but couldn't hold off the winner late. MIDNIGHT HAULER dropped back early, raced three wide and
had not enough late. BUTTON CANDY stalked the pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no rally. B DETERMINED dropped back early, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. THE HUMONGOUS ONE was slow early, saved ground and had no response. INDEHERE saved
ground and never was a factor. THE TRAIN dropped back soon after the break and failed to have a response. LORRI'S CANDY was hustled along from the
outside and tired readily. Internal points of call were manually added.

PRINCESS BRIE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and just got up in his final strides under strong encouragement. SUNNY
HOLLY stalked the pace, raced two wide through the stretch, led late and just missed in a game effort. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST raced up close
throughout, saved ground and weakened a bit late. FAIRFIELD was allowed to settle early, angled four wide through the stretch and had not enough late.
DOUBLE CROSSED was unhurried early, raced five deep through the lane and had no final winning bid. COURAGEOUS KATIE was slow early, raced
three wide and never was a factor. KEWANNE raced six wide at the eighth pole and never threatened. BOX OF GOLD dropped back early, raced seven
wide at the eighth marker and never menaced. SNOW BLOSSOM failed to sustain a bid. MERROW set a fast pace and stopped.
