Footnotes
BOURBON GAL saved ground around the turn disputing the pace, battled to the eighth pole then drove clear late. BOUND FOR BROADWAY , three deep
around the turn, dueled with the winner and finished gamely. MABEL'S FABLE , two wide stalking the duel around the turn, was taken to the five path
turning for home, flattened out and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. STYLISH NINETYNINE hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to threaten in
the stretch. MELISANDE circled the turn, was fanned six deep turning for home a lacked a serious rally. SCARLET'S SONG lacked speed, raced a bit
greenly in the stretch and offered a mild, late move. I AM AINE saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. RAN CHAR disputed the early pace
between the top pair and gave way.

LADY ROZINA , three wide between rivals early while stalking the pace, bid between runners after a half mile, gained a slim lead nearing the eighth pole,
dueled under right handed rousing and held firm. SUSIKIN sped clear early, set the pace two wide, met bids near the quarter pole, ceded command near
mid stretch but continued gamely inside the winner. ATLANTIC AVENUE was sent up between foes early, chased off the inside, took closer order near the
quarter pole, shifted out late and kept on willingly. HAND RAIL , four wide outside foes, bid nearing the quarter pole, drifted a bit wider into the lane, chased
near mid stretch and came up empty. PRINCESS A'GO GO lagged off the pace, raced three to four wide in upper stretch and offered belated action
between rivals. DETERMINED MISSION rated between foes leaving the far turn, angled six wide into the stretch and had a mild response. CLOSE THE
DEAL rushed up early, chased inside into the turn and faded. MISSIMARD failed to menace. PERFECT EXCHANGE , pinched back at the break,
regrouped, progressed wide into the turn, sustained to about the five sixteenths then faded. ORBITING THE MOON saved ground, faltered and was eased
late.

Footnotes
MARKET MOVER , taken to rate early on, edged up off the rail into the turn, set his sights on the dueling leaders past the three eighths, bid five wide into
the lane, shook clear after being set down to a drive inside the three sixteenths, was rejoined by WELLING in deep stretch but held firm under steady
handling. WELLING vied three deep early, dueled outside JEBOLIGIST around the turn, moved to slim lead between foes into the stretch, saw the winner
get away a bit in mid stretch, but battled back gamely to the inside to keep that one honest to the line. SILENT MALICE bobbled at the break then dropped
back after clipping the heels of JEBOLOGIST soon after, regrouped and was well back off the inside, circled five wide into the lane, straightened away and
rallied midly while on his left lead late. SAINT MARCO bid between foes leaving the chute, vied into the turn, chased the leader past the three eighths, came
three wide for the drive and continued on with effort. SUPER HOUDINI lagged off the pace while saving some ground early on, moved off the inside around
the turn, came three wide for the drive and had some belated interest. JEBOLOGIST came out soon after the break and bothered SILENT MALICE,
corrected and set a pressured pace towards the rail, was headed entering the lane and had little left past the three sixteenths. SUCCESSFUL CURE , close
up while saving ground early on, dropped further back mid turn and lacked a response. FLASHARINO was outrun. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
start of the race. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
OLD DOMINION , well handled racing along the inner rail, secured command on the far turn, opened up in upper stretch and held sway under brisk urging.
LOVE'S LEGEND , along the inner rail for much of the race, angled out for the drive and rallied. MASAI MAN hugged the inner rail most of the race and
passed tired horses. THE WALK stalked the pace, raced three to four wide leaving the far turn and gave way. CALAMITY KAT rushed to the early lead, was
always well off the inner rail and tired after six furlongs. EASTPORT , always outside horses, gave way. HIGH SOCIETY was not a factor. MCLEAN HOUSE
, rank in traffic approaching the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn and weakened. IMPERIAL BREW was not a factor. CATAUGA COUNTY was
outrun.

finished gamely to gain the place. WHATS THE CHANCES tracked inside, eased out and bid between rivals mid turn, dueled to the inside of DEVOTION IN

break and was away slowly, regrouped and edged up well wide outside rivals into the turn, circled five wide into the lane, advanced past mid stretch then
flattened out late. DEVOTION IN MOTION came out at the break and bumped a rival, corrected and hustled up between foes, bid three deep mid turn,
dueled on a short lead past the three sixteenths, drifted out some past mid stretch and weakened late. BOSTON BILLY , bumped and pinched back at the
break, lagged back inside, remained inside to mid stretch, angled out and rallied mildly. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , bumped at the break, chased four wide

Footnotes
AMERICAN SAILOR , bumped leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and lasted under urging. TRICKS TO
DOO chased the winner around the oval and gained late. COMPLETED PASS , well back after breaking sluggishly, was wide around the turn, floated to the
six path entering the stretch and rallied outside rivals to dead heat for third. LOVE YOU MUCH , never far back, came into the stretch five wide between
horses and finished willingly to dead heat for third. ISOTHERM lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and offered a late move. OLDIES BUT
GOODIES stalked the pace, was four wide turning for home and weakened. REGALLY IRISH raced along the inner rail and lacked room in mid stretch.
JAMMER , pinched back soon after the break, angled to the seven path in upper stretch and came up empty. DUPREE bore out leaving the starting gate,
was well placed along the inner rail on the turn and weakend. DUNCASTLE saved ground around the turn, swung out at the head of the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
RUSSELDOINGTHINGS , off the pace while saving ground early, angled out early turn and was put to a ride, worked his way between rivals from the three
sixteenths to past mid stretch, surged to command late, kicked clear and was taken in hand at the wire. KARAN'S NOTION sped to contention, dueled
outside SUGAR DADDY, shook clear of that one in upper stretch, kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner but held well
in a sharp debut. JOSEF IS REAL , off last after leaning in and hitting the gate, recovered to show a burst of speed outside rivals, moved to contention past
the three eighths, gave hard wide chase into the lane and kept on well to close the gap. HELLO AMIGO , between rivals early, raced three wide into the lane
and continued with interest. SUGAR DADDY , bumped at the break, quickly to contention, dueled on a short lead from the far turn, ceded past the five
sixteenths, stayed on past the furlong pole then gave way grudgingly. IMA IMA STARBOY , five to six wide, ranged up nearing mid stretch then failed to
seriously sustain. ARTISTIC REASON , a bit reluctant to load, lacked speed while saving ground, altered course multiple times and churned on.
KICKSTARTER , four wide into the lane, was not a factor. ROBBER BOB , away well, stalked the dueling leaders, was under pressure four to five wide into
the lane and weakened. GOT YOU BEAT broke sharp, dropped off the early pace, saved ground mid turn and lacked a bid. HEZAWINNERWITHME flashed
speed inside, dropped back mid turn, angled out in mid stretch and failed to menace. ZEN PI dropped back early and failed to menace. FIRECALL drifted
wide leaving the far turn and never recovered.

Footnotes
DANCE OR STROLL stalked the pace around the turn racing in the two path, was taken outside the leader approaching the eighth pole, closed and took the
lead late. FOGGY DREAMS , wide around the turn, rallied outside the winner. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , three wide around the turn chasing the pace,
gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. CHECKBOUNCIN BILLY , between horses through the stretch, rallied mildly. BUSTIN HEARTS ,
very wide turning for home, showed a mild gain. EIFS , off last, rushed up six deep leaving the backstretch and failed to rally. PRINCESS KILLMAIN hugged
the inner rail around the turn and was not a factor. SEXYAMA , no factor, was very wide leaving the turn. R U HAPPY NOW , sent to the early lead, showed
speed along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. GOODNIGHT MOON was not a factor. DAT DARES GOLD showed speed two wide to the stretch and
gave way. MISS AJA BROWN was outrun.
