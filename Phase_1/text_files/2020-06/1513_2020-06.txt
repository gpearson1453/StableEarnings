FULL SPEED AHEAD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and drew off through
the lane with complete authority. LINCHPINS WAKE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain no the winner
in the drive but was clearly second best. SHELBY R. was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain in
the drive. AUDAZ GIRL broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. PINCHALINCH showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SMARTY JEANS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
CHRIS THE BEAVER stalked the pace BULLET BAY while racing four-wide, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew clear. GORDON
ANTHONY broke sharply to chase the pace of BULLET BAY from off the rail, stayed on well on the drive and finished willingly. CAMDEN HIGH was off a
step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. BEX settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, back out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with late interest. BULLET BAY sprinted cleat at once,
increased his advantage through the turn and weakened through the final furlong. TOUGH ROOSTER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn
and failed to menace. SWEETWATER CLYDE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a
factor. VICKY'S DIAMOND hopped at the start and lagged throughout.

CONSTANT CRAVING broke sharply to stalk the pace of A FILLY CAN DREAM while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing SHOE GAME to prevail. SHOE GAME was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. BEAU ROCKS was forwardly placed from
between foes, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. A FILLY CAN DREAM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave
way through the final furlong. ZANAB lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. BISHOPS OF COMPTON chased
the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch and gave way. IF YOU WANT IT showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and did not menace.

Footnotes
DRIZZY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. DUDLEY
STUDLEY disputed the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. CEDAR RAPIDS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out and spit rivals in mid-stretch and
finished with good courage. LAST ONE STANDING raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive.
ROMAN BOOS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STAY IN POWER showed no early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and failed to menace. CREST DRIVE dueled for the lead from between foes and weakened after going a half. DON'TBESHYWILLIE vied
for the lead from between foes, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened. MY FOOLISH BEAU was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and was not a factor.

SOPHIE'S DREAM pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with INVITE ME through a prolonged drive
and was up at the wire. INVITE ME was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, vied with the winner and just missed. CLASS DEFINED was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, checked in
mid-stretch while giving was and continued to retreat. WHY ARE U SO SWEET showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a
furlong to run and finished with late energy. LINCHPINS JEWEL raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into
the stretch and finished evenly. DARK SUSPICION pressed the pace from between foes for three furlongs and weakened. BELLAMAGIC lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NATIONAL HEROINE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and

RI' PIN SNAP broke sharply to duel for the inside with I WORK FOR CARROTS, vied with that rival for a prolonged drive and was up at the wire. I WORK
FOR CARROTS was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and just missed in a game effort. CLIFTON HOLLOW
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, did not gain on the top pair in the drive but appeared to be the best of the rest. STANLEY
RYDER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. PEGASUS CHAMP raced off the leaders from the
inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. HE'S BANDIDO was bumped hard at the break, bobbled, raced unhurried, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. COOLER THAN YOU was bumped at the start, raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not menace. SPEEDING RUNING was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and
did not offer a bid. DOIN DOUBLE TIME lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STRATEGIC HOUR was bumped at the
start, showed brief speed and weakened.
