Footnotes
WILD ABOUT THIS cleared off from several pursuers around the turn, drifted out in the stretch and stayed clear. JOSEFA saved ground around the turn,
lodged a mild bid along the rail and did not have enough. PLATINUMCENTS raced forwardly toward the inside early, was taken outside with aim at WILD
ABOUT THIS approaching the stretch, but flattened out. RANK AND FILE steadied slightly shortly after the start, came four wide off the turn and rallied
mildly for a share. NANIE'S TREASURE was no factor. PASATIME saved ground on the turn, and gained mildly. NEEDS NO ALIBI never menaced.
HECHIZADA was always outrun. DAMA DE NOCHE was far back throughout. AMERICAN COUNTESS was never prominent. MAMA LONGLEGS showed
brief speed between horses, and gave way before reaching the stretch. JIMMYS LASS chased outside into the turn, and tired after three furlongs. The first
quarter-mile of this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
THE ICE BEAST eyed the dueling leaders three wide on the turn, rallied to take over outside in mid stretch, briefly drew clear and held on late. SEAZAN
broke out at the start, came back in greenly and bumped with CARAMEL CHIP, raced four wide around the turn, and was gaining outside the winner to the
wire. CASALSA became fractious and unseated the rider prior to being loaded, broke without incident and dueled for command outside ATTU ISLAND, got
the best of that dispute in deep stretch but was overhauled from outside by the top two. ATTU ISLAND dueled for the lead inside CASALSA from the outset,
and weakened on the rail in the lane. THE BEST DISTANCE broke a step slowly, and was never prominent. VENETIAN DREAM was outrun inside.
CARAMEL CHIP bobbled and broke out, got bumped by SEAZAN shortly after that and was taken hold off while racing very erratically, and stayed far back.

Footnotes
RULE YOURSELF was reserved early in midpack, saved ground advancing around the far turn, tipped outside the leaders in upper stretch, caught
BALISTICO from outside in deep stretch and prevailed under good handling. BALISTICO prompted the pace outside CROW MOON, dueled outside that
one wresting command through the furlong grounds, and ran on gamely while being edged late. MYSTICAL MOON stayed in range toward the inside for six
furlongs, moved out in the drive and rallied outside the top two on the wrong lead. CROW MOON set the pace inside, dueled with BALISTICO into the
stretch, and weakened in the last eighth of a mile. MASON'S SONG raced three wide early, moved to the two-path around the far turn, and gained mildly
without threatening. MONMOUTH DR leapt up a stride out of the gate at a cost of several lengths, moved off the inside approaching the backstretch,
bobbled slightly a quarter-mile out, and improved position late. BLUESKY KITTEN saved ground on the turns, and improved position while not a factor.
BOLD PAYNTER was strung out five wide early, took the far turn in the four-path, and tired. SPEED GRACER was no factor. BYE BYE MAN was never
prominent. MY BROTHERSLEDGE raced four wide and was finished early. CAPPY HOUR stayed in range three wide to the far turn, and was through after
six furlongs.

AMANZI YIMPILO (IRE) hustled through on the rail to get the lead, repelled a bid from TEQUA from the quarter-pole through upper stretch, and drew away
under a mild drive. TEQUA chased three then two wide early, challenged outside the winner turning for home, proved no match, and bested the others. TIK
TOK FAMOUS (GB) split horses three wide advancing early on the turn, shifted to the rail in upper stretch and lacked a solid response on her left lead.
SHAN'S TIGER raced four wide on the turn, and faded through the drive. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY raced two wide, and tired after three-eighths of a mile. LADY
QUINTESSA lacked room behind BAHAMIAN BEAUTY and TEQUA at the start, and was outrun inside. DIAL A LADY balked at loading, and trailed.

Footnotes
REMASTER (IRE) was boxed in along the rail around the turn, gained clearance guided out three wide in upper stretch, and rallied to overtake the leaders
from outside on the wrong lead. KHOZY MY BOY raced in the two-path on the turn, moved out for the drive and was closing in on the far outside. DEO
FORTE pressed the pace outside BYCHANCE, took over in mid stretch, and was outfinished. YOUNG RAYMOND moved inside approaching the turn,
waited behind the first flight at the top of the lane, idled through mid stretch in the two-path, moved to the rail and offered a mild final response. NO NAY
MAYBE (IRE) raced two to three wide on the turn, and lacked a solid closing bid. POPPY'S BOYS broke a step slow, came wide off the turn, and gained
belatedly. BYCHANCE set the pace inside, and weakened in the last furlong. JUNGLE WARRIOR broke a step slow, and was outrun. ROYAL DUKE
steadied and was shuffled back past the half-mile pole, and never recovered.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY saved ground and vied up front from the start, took over inside HARTLING after six furlongs, opened daylight into the stretch and
widened under a drive. GESTURE sat behind the leading trio up the backstretch, ranged up outside to loom a threat at the top of the lane, and ran on evenly
to hold the place. LADY ARCHA had the two-path behind the leaders turning for home, and lacked a solid response. HARTLING vied outside rivals three
wide, could not match strides with the winner into the stretch, and faltered while drifting out. WELL BRUSH MYTOOTH dropped far back after a half-mile,
and showed little. LOVELY LADY LEXI argued the early pace between horses, gave way soon after completing a half, and was eased up in the stretch.

HEIR BALL sped to the front with an alert getaway, kicked away inside through upper stretch, and dug in late for the decision. PRECOCIOUS PEACH was
outsprinted to the front by HEIR BALL, steadied and was shuffled back behind the leader entering the turn, moved to the two-path with aim into the stretch,
and was whittling away the margin late. WAR STAR saved ground on the turn, and rallied with good energy along the rail. CAT'S ASTRAY pressed the pace
outside, and weakened in the three-path after straightening away for the drive. I LOVE TO RACE broke slowly, lagged well back to the stretch, and
improved without threatening. AWSUM ROAR was no factor three wide. THE GREAT KATH raced four wide on the turn, and faded in the stretch. MISS
MIAMI chased around the turn three wide, and tired. TIPLE (IRE) was in the two-path on the turn, and never reached contention. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT was
far back throughout. CITIBIKE was pulled up on the turn at the back, and walked off. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SOLE VOLANTE settled well off the early pace, began to take closer order after six furlongs while shifting out four wide, rallied steadily on the far outside
under steady hand urging, reached the front 70 yards out and edged away under confident handling. JESUS' TEAM raced off the dueling leaders three
wide, closed in from the three-path through mid stretch just inside SOLE VOLANTE, and was along for second in a good effort. SHIVAREE hooked up in a
dispute outside ETE INDIEN soon after the start, got the best of their duel through upper stretch and briefly moved away, but yielded inside the top two
through the final stages. ETE INDIEN contested the pace inside SHIVAREE through a sharp six furlongs, weakened through mid stretch, and drifted out
while tiring. WITH VERVE saved ground to the stretch, moved out a bit and could not gain. HARD LIGHTING was outrun two wide to the stretch, moved to
the rail and made no headway. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SNAP HOOK tracked from striking range outside, took over without need of urging through mid stretch and drew away in hand. GEONOSIS prompted the
pace outside, challenged between horses after six furlongs, and was no match for the winner while best of the rest. THIRD ARMY bumped with SULTRY
SAMURAI at the start, was outrun four wide to the stretch, and rallied mildly to get up for the show outside. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK broke out, went up to
set the pace inside for six furlongs, and weakened through upper stretch. SULTRY SAMURAI bumped with THIRD ARMY at the start, and was no menace
through an even effort. DOCTOR D J bobbled slightly at the start, and was outrun. COLIN A WINNER prompted the pace outside STRATEGIC OUTLOOK,
and weakened on the turn. COWBOY BOB raced three wide, and dropped far back after six furlongs. BABA TOBI was slow into stride, and dropped far
back after six furlongs.
