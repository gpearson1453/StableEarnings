Footnotes
MOOCHIE set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and held clear a drive. HIPNOTIZADA stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with
the winner from the three-eighths pole to midstretch then was gaining late. CILLA lacked early speed while saving ground, angled out four wide near the
five-sixteenths pole and finished willingly outside. SUPERHELPFUL saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT was reluctant to
load, prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. OUR BELLA NICOLE was outrun inside. SQUARE PENNY played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
LE PETITE PAPILLON pressed the pace two wide between foes, took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole, drifted out a bit turning for home, drove clear
in upper stretch and held clear under a solid hand ride. SAND IN MY SHOES stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, could match strides in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to save the place. THAT IS KEY stalked the pace inside, angled two
wide midway around the turn then finished evenly to hold third. SUSI SOLE chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. FREEDOM QUEEN lagged far
back three wide and passed tiring rivals. ROSIE SUMMER played no factor while racing two wide. ELL BE EYE set the pace along the rail and retreated
from the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
NEVISIAN SPIRIT was strung out four wide around the first turn, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, split rivals in upper stretch, angled to
the rail, closed inside and edged ahead late. SUNDRENCHED settled off the pace while hung out four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied
outside, came in a bit near the sixteenth pole and sustained the rally while unable to quite reel in the winner. SHES DYNOMITE prompted the pace two
wide, took the lead while shifting in slightly in upper stretch, battled on between foes and was out finished late. DON'T CHARGE IT was bumped at the start,
raced two wide in midpack early, went five wide around the far turn and rallied. MISS AL DILA lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced between
rivals around the far turn, bid in midstretch then flattened out. PRIDE LEADER settled off the pace two wide, went three wide around the far turn, bid
between rivals in the stretch but was forced to check off heels in deep stretch. CAPUCINE lacked speed inside, advanced three wide around the far turn,
swung further out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MISS AJA BROWN was bumped at the start, raced three wide in midpack early, angled in nearing
the far turn, checked midway around the bend and had no further bids. UNCLE MO'S AFFAIR was reluctant to load, stalked the pace two and three wide
and came up empty in the lane. ICY LADY was outrun inside. ROSE M. had early speed inside and steadily faded. MUSIC MAKER set the pace along the
rail, was collared nearing the lane, was shut off and lost the irons in upper stretch and was eased from there. Following multiple claims of foul and an
inquiry, the Stewards disqualified SHES DYNOMITE from third and placed her last for interference in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MR CLASSICAL settled off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached even terms in upper stretch, dueled outside through the
lane and prevailed. GEMO RAIN settled off the early pace three wide, bid three deep into the far turn, took the lead midway around that bend, dug in inside
of the winner to duel through the lane and gave way grudgingly. CODE NAME BRODY angled in early on the first turn, raced two wide and was along for the
show. JACKFRUIT was devoid of speed while saving ground, made progress down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn, swung to the far
outside in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. DRIFTWOOD pressed the pace two wide, led midway down the backstretch then tired nearing the
lane. WIDGET FACTORY set the pace in the two path and retreated around the far turn.
