Footnotes
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS stalked the trio of duelers from the four path down the backstretch, progressed into the turn and made a four wide bid outside of
those foes at the five sixteenths pole, forged a lead at the quarter pole and shifted down to the three path in upper stretch, then held his margin through the
lane under a long drive before clearing off inside the final sixteenth. AMERICAN MANDATE dueled two wide and between horses, dug in at the quarter pole
when ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS forged a narrow advantage, battled on gamely through the lane inside of that rival and outside of AMERICAN BUTTERFLY,
but gave way to ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS inside the final sixteenth. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY dueled inside of a pair of rivals through the early stages, then
inside a trio of foes approaching the five sixteenths pole, where he was headed by multiple rivals, dug in and battled on through the lane, but failed to regain
even terms with outer foes. LONELY PRIVATE dueled three wide early on, took back to stalk at the half mile pole before his hand was forced to make a
three wide rebid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS ranged up alongside, but was outkicked by that foe and inner rivals at the
quarter pole, then kept on through the lane to miss achieving show. CARDIAC KITTEN trailed the field throughout and made no impact. TOHUI reared on
his own doing when the gates opened, lost his rider, and walked off. Following a Stewards' Inquiry, it was deemed that TOHUI's incident at the start was due
to his own accord.

Footnotes
TOP SEED vied for the lead along the inside of CROATIAN down the backstretch and around the far turn, dug in passing the quarter pole as
THIRSTFORLIFE made a stout bid, shifted out to meet that challenge, then gamely fended off that foe through the lane under driving pressure.
THIRSTFORLIFE stalked two wide while in the three path, made a stout three wide bid for the lead approaching the quarter pole, but drifted to the four to
five path straightening into the stretch, sustained his bid and dueled outside of TOP SEED through the lane, but was fended off and denied the victory by
that foe. SIGNALMAN trailed two wide around the first turn, shifted to the four path and advanced outside of rivals through the far turn to be in range of the
leaders turning for home, but leveled off and was outkicked in upper stretch, then stayed on to claim show. CROATIAN vied two wide, held a narrow
advantage down the backstretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe and his inner vying counterpart at the quarter pole, then kept on to save fourth. GUN IT
stumbled at the start, saved ground around the first turn while rating off of the pace, took the far turn in the two to three path while getting outmoved by an
outer foe, causing him to trail the field turning for home, then split foes at the furlong pole, but hung on his left lead and failed to menace. FRANKNJYMME
lied close to the pace along the inside while under a tight hold through the first turn, but came under coaxing to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, and
failed to do so through the lane.

Footnotes
UNIQUE FACTOR was pinched back at the start, got rank behind rivals at the half mile pole, shifted to the four path and rallied outside of rivals around the
bend, drove clear passing the furlong pole, and held RISKY MANDATE off safely through the late stages. RISKY MANDATE was off slow, shifted off of the
inside to the five path into the far turn, commenced a rally approaching the five sixteenths pole, sustained her advance through the lane to forge place at the
sixteenth pole, and was gaining on the leader late. SKAMANIA dueled two wide around the turn, took over from her inner counterpart at the quarter pole
while under confident handling, but was put to a drive at the three sixteenths pole as UNIQUE FACTOR made a bid, proved no match for that foe at the
furlong pole, then yielded. DIVINE QUEEN was squeezed between horses at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, and produced a mild rail rally
for a minor reward. PERUVIAN APPEAL brushed an inner foe at the start, raced in the three path between horses around the turn while off of the pace, then
got outkicked by rivals in upper stretch, and kept on late. LADY T N T broke outwards forcing rivals to be squeezed, vied three wide early on before taking
back to stalk at the half mile pole, rebid three wide between horses at the quarter pole, but was outkicked and weakened. ISTAN COUNCIL failed to factor in
the two path. MAE NEVER NO (IRE) was squeezed at the start, then forwardly placed two wide, but was outkicked by leading foes in upper stretch, then
weakened late. TALK VEUVE TO ME bobbled a bit at the start and was off slowly, rushed along the inside to midpack, but weakened at the five sixteenths
pole, then was eased in upper stretch. SHANGHAI TARIFF broke outwards, dueled for the lead along the inside around the turn, but was headed at the
quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

EXTRA EFFORT advanced three wide around the turn, sustained his grinding advanced through the lane, and just caught the loose leader at the wire.
SAINTSATION established a clear advantage leaving the chute while setting a fast pace, held a loose lead through the turn and midstretch, but tired in the
late stages and got nipped at the wire. GOLDEN STAR LADY tracked the loose leader two wide around the turn, but weakened turning for home. MAGIC
MOTION raced far off of the pace inside of EXTRA EFFORT, but was outmoved by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten while staying
on. LEFTATTHEALTAR was forwrdly placed along the inside, but weakened into the turn. POSH PRINCESS showed little.
