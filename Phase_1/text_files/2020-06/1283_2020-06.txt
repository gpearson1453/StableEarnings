Footnotes
FORTUNATE GINA shifted out to the four path shortly after the start, stalked the pace into the stretch, closed willingly in the five path through the final
furlong and was forced out to the eight path through the final stages an was along in time. GIFT FROM MOM battled for the early lead near the four path,
shifted in entering the turn, shook clear midway on the turn, set the pace in the three path through the stretch, drifted out when struck with a left handed
whip inside the sixteenth marker, the rider switch to a right handed whip but couldn't hold off the winner. DREAMINOFJUSTICE settled just off the leaders
along the rail, steadied a bit entering the turn, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch, was forced out to the seven path by the runner up in deep
stretch and finished under a steady hold while in tight between horses to the wire. SOLE FACTOR failed to menace. CIRCLE WILL RUN dueled with the
runner up down the backstretch, had speed into the stretch then faded late. UCANTKEEPUP moved up on the turn then leveled off. FLASHY G was no
factor. EDGE OF HONOR was outrun. MY PEGGY LOU was through early. THE RIDER OF DREAMINOFJUSTICE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF GIFT FROM MOM FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GIFT
FROM MOM AND PLACED HER THIRD.

Footnotes
SHADOW TRACER broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to win going away while taken in
hand late. MASQUERADE PARTY chased the winner into the turn, inched closer midway on the turn, kept pressured into the stretch then was no match for
the winner though well clear for second. STEVE CAME THRU trailed into the turn and found his best stride late two wide. AMERICAN SPARROW inside,
failed to menace. SOUTHERN SPIRIT stalked the pace into the stretch then faded. OH OZ close up early, swung wide and lost ground. MASCHERATO
was outrun. LOVE TREE was no factor.

EXCLUSIVE DONALD broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace, shook clear on the turn and into the stretch and lasted
while in hand. FLATTER ME PLEASE allowed to settle, closed fast along the rail through the stretch, shifted outside the winner late and just missed
catching that one in the final strides. DANEFIELD vied for the lead and was outfinished despite a game effort. TIO PERICO close up from the start, closed a
gap late in the five path. SCARED WARIOR settled mid pack and was gaining ground late in the six path. SUPER VALENTINE allowed to settle, swung
wide for the drive and was gaining late in the seven path. IDOWHATIDO stalked the pace down the backstretch, inched closer on the turn then came up
empty. FRITTONS GOLD was outrun. GUNTER pressured the winner to the top of the stretch then folded.

closed rapidly along the rail through the stretch but finished second best. FOREST CHATTER sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
into the stretch, shook clear then was outfinished in the final stages. CUTLER prompted the pace two wide until deep stretch and finished with good energy
three wide. THE COOKIE MAN vied for the lead down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, had speed into the stretch then
came up empty. FAT DADDY failed to menace. PIOCHE GOLD was outrun. KING DADDIO was through after a half. AGAINST THE ODDS was through
early.

Footnotes
OHIO PLAYER broke alertly and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and won going away under right handed urging. I WANNA WIN chased
the winner the entire trip and finished second best along the inside. WICKED WARRIOR settled just off the leaders into the turn, loomed boldly three wide
before the quarter pole, kept pressure until deep stretch then was outfinished. FASTEST MAX chased the pace near the inside through the turn, shifted out
to the five path entering the stretch then went evenly. CHIP CHOP failed to menace. CHIEF RANDEL was no threat. SERVE REVENGE COLD passed
tiring rivals. FOOLISH EQUATION bore out at the start bumping a rivals and was never involved. NEVANS had brief speed. CELTIC LINE was bumped at
the start then failed to reach contention. OUR PETITION showed little. WATCH HER STRUT was no factor. ROMANTIC COWBOY had speed into the turn
then flattened out. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-007, DATED 06/11/2020, OHIO PLAYER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM ALL
PURSE MONEY.

Footnotes
KHALFANI made the lead a few strides out of the gate, set the balance of the pace, drifted out under a left handed whip then in under a right handed whip
and drew away late under brisk handling. CAT'S CURIOSITY never far back while inside through the turn, advanced in the four path into the stretch, angled
inside the winner as that one drifted out, shifted out in deep stretch and finished second best. CATS VALENTINE had speed from the start, offered a bid four
wide on the turn, drifted into the stretch and lost ground. DIDDY DEW vied for the lead two wide into the turn then weakened. PRETTY STORMY pressed
the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. WYATTS WARRIOR trailed. THE TRAINER OF CAT'S CURIOSITY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
