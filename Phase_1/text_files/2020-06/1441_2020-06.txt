Footnotes
SHANE'S JEWEL rated just off the leader while about three wide early, was brushed and forced in by THROW THE FADE near the half mile marker,
chased the pace past the five sixteenths, got through along the rail to challenge in mid stretch, poked a head in front with about a sixteenth remaining and
drove clear at the wire. STONEY BENNETT sped clear in the opening sixteenth, set the pace two wide, took pressure approaching the quarter pole, drifted
four wide entering the lane, dueled to the inside of DAY THE MUSIC DIED past the three sixteenths, was taken on by the winner past the furlong grounds
and gave way grudgingly. DAY THE MUSIC DIED prompted the pace outside rivals, bid three deep past the five sixteenths, was floated five wide entering
the lane, straightened to contest the issue past mid stretch then faded late. COLONEL SHARP hopped at the break and also bumped with THROW THE
FADE, recovered and was taken well wide, circled the turn and came up empty. ZITARROSA rated behind the leaders, was asked mid turn but lacked a
response. THROW THE FADE , bumped at the break, rated outside the leader then brushed with a rival near the half mile marker, bid mid turn, forced the
pace to upper stretch then gave way. WHIRLIN CURLIN lacked speed, raced very wide in upper stretch and lacked a response. HILL SHADOW saved
ground without threatening.

KEVIN WITTE set a pressured pace to the stretch, gained a clear advantage in upper stretch then steadily increased his lead while under urging. BAYANO ,
between horses around the turn and in upper stretch, was forced to alter course to the outside in mid stretch and rallied. LUCERITO bobbled at the break,
circled the turn four to five wide, chased the winner and weakened. AIR TOKEN saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
flattened out. LITTLE BAY , inside horses on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and failed to menace. TOP HAT SCRUTINY , wide leaving the turn,
lacked a rally. NIC NIC BOOM raced between horses on the turn and weakened. THREE CHOPT PUNCH was outrun. WHATS THE CHANCES chased the
pace three wide around the turn and faltered in the drive. KING PACAY was outrun. COLD SWEAT prompted the pace outside the winner, faltered and was

Footnotes
WELLING relaxed three to four wide tracking the pace, moved up under a light hold and bid three deep around the turn, moved clear into the lane, kept on
under a drive nearing mid stretch, turned away some threats and pulled away while kept alert. SILENT MALICE , off the rail and towards the inside of a rival
early on, raced between runners leaving the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch, ranged up to loom in mid stretch, flattened out but got the place.
CALL ME PLUCKY , off slowly, settled five wide, dropped in and was put to pressure leaving the far turn, eased back out past the three eighths while
picking up solid momentum, worked between rivals and took aim past the three sixteenths but failed to sustain in the final furlong. DESHACKLED prompted
the pace outside BACK CHANGE, bid between foes mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then weakened in the last eighth. BACK CHARGE cleared early,
set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a pair of foes leaving the far turn, stayed on to upper stretch then gave way. SECURITY BREACH , off the pace,
angled off the inside leaving the far turn but failed to respond when put to a drive. CRAZY KATER chased the leaders while five wide and faded nearing the
lane. MEADOW MAGIC was outrun. SUPER E edged up inside rivals nearing the three quarter pole, pursued to the far turn, faltered and was eased in the
drive.

Footnotes
JUST CHILL OUT rated off the pace and towards the inside, crept closer into the lane, bid to command past the three sixteenths, shook clear leaving the
eighth pole and widened under a steady drive. ALEPH rated outside rivals while about three to four wide, shifted in leaving the three sixteenths and finished
willingly to gain the place. OVERPOWER broke slowly, angled out around the turn, circled six to seven wide into the stretch, remained on his left lead and
closed steadily under hand pressure. G MAN came in some at the break and knocked heads with CREATED SPECIAL, straightened and sped to command,
set a pressured pace two to three wide, shook clear into the lane, could not resist the winner nearing mid stretch and faded. ELUSIVE MOTION advanced
inside foes early to reach a stalking spot, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, chased past the three sixteenths and weakened. CREATED
SPECIAL knocked heads with G MAN at the break, flashed some foot between runners, dropped off the leaders into the turn, saved ground into the stretch
and came up empty. CECIL THE LION lagged back, raced wide into the lane, drifted in near the three sixteenths and failed to menace. RARE NOTION ,
reluctant to load, pulled his way forward outside rivals, bid four wide outside the leader, dueled from the five eighths to mid turn, failed to keep pace into the
stretch and faltered through the final furlong. DIAMOND NIC chased outside a rival, drifted six wide into the stretch and tired. DIVINE PROPORTION lacked
speed while towards the inside, raced under some rating into the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STROLL SMOKIN prompted the pace outside SKY MAGICIAN around the turn, wrested command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and
held sway under urging. WHISKEY AND YOU , rated back from close quarters leaving the backstretch, stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, swung
out to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. HARD FOUGHT lacked speed, raced slightly off the rail in the stretch, split rivals in mid
stretch and rallied inside the top pair. W W SPRINGTIME chased the pace between horses around the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and
finished evenly. ROMANOFF , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. DUPREE , along the inner rail much of the race, failed to rally. SKY
MAGICIAN showed speed along the rail and gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
HELLO BEAUTIFUL was nudged clear in the opening strides, dictated the pace two wide and under some rating, opened up after being put to a solid hand
ride in upper stretch, continued to eagerly increase her advantage past the furlong grounds then was geared down in the final yards. INDY TAKES
CHARGE was steadied back from between foes near the four and a half furlong marker, regrouped and edged up between runners mid turn, angled in soon
after, moved up inside near mid stretch and kept on gamely to gain the place. PRETTY EDGY rated early outside rivals, circled four wide under a ride past
the quarter pole, continued with effort and saved the show. LEAVEUWITHASMILE broke outward, settled off the pace about four wide, angled five wide into
the lane but lacked a solid response. PRINCESS ADIRA , unhurried early, came under a ride mid turn, raced three wide into the lane but failed to generate
a serious run. FIFTEEN ROYALS prompted the pace three wide, came under a ride soon into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. ROMNEY
MARSH gave early pursuit towards the rail and dropped back around the turn.

Footnotes
COOKE BROTHERS circled the turn five wide, floated to the six path in upper stretch when taking the lead, steadily drifted in through the lane and edged
clear. GONE HOME , a forward factor in the two path entering the turn, was taken to the four path leaving the turn, bid for the lead inside the winner in upper
stretch, drifted in during the drive, was out finished by COOKE BROTHERS and steadied in deep stretch when in narrow quarters. CONFUSION BABY BOY
, three wide between horses around the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. ALLERIA , kept wide throughout, passed tired horses late.
MARYLAND BANDIT lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and passed faders. DESTRUCTION showed speed near the inner rail and
gave way in the drive. PAID HOLIDAY sped to the early lead, raced two wide aorund the turn and gave way. BEAR TREASURE was no factor. An objection
by the rider of GONE HOME against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run
to the wire but no action was taken.
