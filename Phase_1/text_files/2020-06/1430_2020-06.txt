Footnotes
FLASH OF SILVER set a pressured pace, moved clear through the far turn, bore out approaching the top of the stretch, lost the lead briefly but rallied, had
command quickly and widened under light handling. DYNAMITE KARMA, in range, closed along the rail through the far turn, had the lead briefly at the top
of the stretch but was no match when the early pacesetter stormed by him but held place. CAUSE FOR ALARM stalked the pace, was hustled three and
four-wide on the final turn then finished gamely. COUNTRYSIDE DRIVE got away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled moving outward from the rail
to three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. BREAK AND ENTER pressed the pace, moved outside the leader very briefly early backstretch,
chased two-wide on the turn but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARLES STREET led midway through the backstretch, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch then widened under light handling.
MAZINAW LEGEND, at the rear early, closed quickly and steadily while three-wide on the turn then was all out in the stretch. SEIFERT, off slowly, moved
up and pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader on the turn, chased into the stretch and flattened out. NU BABY DADDY, off slowly and at the rear of the
pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn then finished gamely to no avail. HIGHLAND JAX, off slowly and up close early, chased
two-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE closed up early to stalk the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, was
hustled along but failed to menace. TRINITY THUNDAH was in range early, stalked the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

BODE'S MAKER set a pressured pace, rode the rail on the far turn, shook clear upper stretch then held driving. CHEEK TO CHEEK stalked the pace,
lapped onto the leader through the far turn, chased into the stretch and launched a determined drive, but hung. EXECUTIVE SIGHT stalked the pace, was
hustled from the rail on the turn then finished gamely. BENS LAST CALL, rated off the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn and
raced gamely to the wire. AM PREPARED, away slowly, settled off the pace, came three and four-wide through the far turn but never reached contention.
WE TAKE CHECKS settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the far turn but evened out in deep stretch. SPANISH MAJOR broke
slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. LETS DANCE SOME MO pressed the pace three-wide
early, was hustled from mid pack on the far turn and lacked a rally.

COHIBA GHOST dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead on the turn, shook clear near the 1/4 pole then held sway, driving. DANCERS GHOST
stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn and raced gamely to the wire. VELOCE was rated at the rear of the pack, was hustled angling from
the rail to three-wide through the turn, cut back to the rail in the stretch and finished gamely. DR. GREEN, in hand early, came two to four-wide through the
turn, chased into the stretch and evened out late. FRAT PARTY raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was in tight at the top of the stretch and finished
with some interest. FINAL ECLIPSE broke outward, dueled on the backstretch, forced the issue on the turn, ducked after being cleared by his rival late turn
then flattened out along the rail in the stretch. CARL G, in hand early in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, dropped back a bit and was steadied
behind rivals at the top of the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied outside and got by late under a drive. DOT'S
VISION stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, gained a narrow advantage upper stretch, was brave but was passed late but held
place. FORESTER'S DESTINY settled in mid pack, angled from two to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined
drive. FOLLOW MY LEAD hit the gate leaving, raced in mid pack, swung off the rail late turn and finished gamely between foes. COURT BATTLE showed
brief speed, forced the pace into the turn, bid along the rail upper stretch, battled, but gave way late. CAPTAIN SIDNEY stalked the pace, angled from three
to five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was up close but did not bid and evened out in the late stages. GORGEOUS KITTEN settled in mid pack,
came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, encountered traffic mid stretch and evened out. WHERE'S THE WIDGET closed quickly on
the backstretch and held a short lead into the turn, set a pressured pace but gave way grudgingly in the stretch. TWO TIMING raced in mid pack, rode the
rail on the turn then finished with some interest. ROCKET PLAN settled off the pace, closed fast three to five-wide late turn, chased into the stretch then
evened out late. TISHINA hopped at the start and settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn then lacked a rally. COOL GIZMO raced from off the pace,
dropped back leaving the turn and offered no closing response.
