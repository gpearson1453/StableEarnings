Footnotes
BLACK CIRCLE unhurried early would trail into the far turn, responded with a mild rally into upper stretch then angled between horses on the inside surging
up in the closing yards. PENCE tracked close up to the far turn rallying to take a short lead in upper stretch angling out toward mid track late ceding to inside
pressure. UNCLE DAVE went evenly in mid pack to the far turn, rallied there moving four wide into upper stretch being carried out to the six path bidding
gamely at the end. PLEASANT OUTLOOK rushed out would make the lead setting the pace under pressure through the far turn, saved ground dueling from
the rail down the lane coming up a bit short. MIND MAGIC slow early circled out to upper stretch giving a mild bid six wide. SHACKLESON hustled out
saved ground tracking to the far turn, chased to upper stretch weakening under a drive in the three path. BOLD CHARMANT was checked near the five
sixteenths pole dropping off on the far turn. CHARMING INDY failed to menace. ABLE BAKER CHARLIE prompted the pace to the far turn then tired into
upper stretch. JOYEUX tracked the pace to the far turn then wilted into upper stretch.

PASSIONATE STAR stalked the pace rallying to lead along the inside in upper stretch drawing out under urging. SLOWPOKE lost ground to upper stretch
rallying seven wide getting up for place. WONDERFUL GAMBLE slow early angled inside to upper stretch coming on late to finish well. RED BEAN SONDE
pressed the pace leading on the turn, dueled to upper stretch weakening late, was vanned off after the race. TIZAAWESOMEDAY sent clear led early,
hooked on the turn dueled to upper stretch weakening late in the two path. NICKI MINUH UH hustled along chased on the turn, extending at mid track in
upper stretch would weaken. LITTLE MAXIMOVA played no factor. MYLADYCHARLOTTE pressured the pace dueling on the turn, wavered in upper stretch
giving way. MY LILY ROSE was always outrun.
