CURL stalked the pace in the two path took a clear lead entering the stretch and drew away to win easily. CHARMING ANGEL was away from the gates
quickly but was allowed to settle on the outside while dropping back raced five wide on the turn was making up ground in the stretch but was too far back
while second best. ELIZABETH'S MUSIC raced midpack while off the rail made a mild bid for third while never a threat to the top two. ALY J was also
caught wide on the turn and could not make up ground. D WITCHES OF O TWO raced along the inside but had no rally in the stretch.
ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY showed the best early speed on the rail but tired on the turn. WHATA GEM raced in the two path on the turn but could not make up
ground. ONTHE WINGSOFADOVE raced in the two path on the turn but could not gain on the leaders. KOOL QUEEN was away a step slow then hustled
along the inside and gave way. FRIED ONIONS was well back and never made a bid. JUSTICE JEAN raced along the inside while never a serious factor.
DOCTOR LISA was a bit rank early and trailed. PER RULING FROM THE COLORADO RACING COMMISSION, CURL WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
POPCORN FOR EDDIE raced wide while just off the pace took command at the top of the stretch and drew clear for an easy win. HUNTINGTONS RITHM
raced six wide on the turn but was no match for the winner through the stretch. MIDNIGHT MAVERICK raced in the middle of the pack came between foes
for the drive and finished well. DEL ARGENT raced midpack for much of the race in the three path and could not make up ground. THIRD DIMENSION was
off a step slow along the inside and made a mild bid. COUNTRY CURE was up close for the first quarter and then faded. MAJOR PERFECT raced three
wide and never mounted a rally. CALL ME MR TE set the pace while just off the rail but faded through the stretch. LAW BREAKER raced wide on the turn
and could not make up ground. GO' N JOY Z dropped back in the early stages and was never a factor. MR. POPCORN was away in good order and up
close but was through on the turn. STUCK ON GEORGE was always well back while racing wide.

Footnotes
REAL HEAT was hustled along the inside to save the rail early engaged for the lead and drew clear in the stretch for the win. FOREVER THE CHIEF was
well back in the early stages mounted a bid in the three path and was finishing with interest while no threat to the winner. SPUR was up close to the lead
throughout while wide but could not make up ground. SILIS showed good early speed while three wide and tired on the turn. DORCHEAT ZARB raced
along the inside but offered no rally in the stretch. PRINCE OF PARIS raced wide on the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch. BILLIE D well back
early and could not make up ground. GO GO PAGOSA was very wide on the turn and could not make up lost ground. PAPA JOE was well back throughout
and not a serious factor. COLONEL GOTHAM raced mid pack and faded in the stretch. ROB'S GOLDEN TOUCH was up close to the pace turning for home
then stopped in the stretch.
