Footnotes
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY chased the pacesetters along the inside into the lane, rallied up the rail and drove cleared through the final sixteenth.
FORBIDDEN FRUIT stepped in at the start, raced through the three path in the turn, came into the lane from the four path, was bothered when another
stepped out near the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. BETCHA set the pace while near the inside into the lane, continued with a short lead outside the
eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and was not good enough. REAL DEPUTEE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid and
was a serious threat inside the eighth pole, was bothered and steadied nering the sixteenth pole and could not keep up. FIRST SQUADRON was never a
serious threat while racing near the inside. LETSBEGREATAGAIN was in the two path through the turn, shifted into the five path for the drive and was never
a menace. NINA'S PROMISE was bumped, squeezed at the start, raced in the six path into the lane and never factored. C J S SUZIE BYU never was a
threat while in the two path through the turn. AFTER A OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #8 REAL DEPUTEE AGAINST THE RIDE OF #7 BETCHA, #7
BETCHA WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN.

Footnotes
CLOSE THE CASE pressed the early pace three wide, was steadied in mid-turn, continued in the three path through the turn and into the lane, bid into
upper lane and steadily wore down the leader, clearing late. PASS THE BISCUITS set the pace along the inside, repelled challenger into the lane, was
joined by the winner outside the eighth pole and was no match for that one late while best of the rest. PRINTER JAM was in the three path through the the
turn, under a strong ride through the lane and kept on well. COMFORT ME NOW was along the inside through the turn and needed more through the final
sixteenth. SPOTLIGHT JUSTICE was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track and never was a threat. ORIENT MAGIC
pressed the pace early from the two path then steadily faded. TWISTED MIRACLE was never a factor while along the inside. S S TROOPER raced in the
three path into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
MISTY EXPRESS chased the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane and slowly edged past the leader. HELP ME OUT set the pace
along the inside into the lane, continued with determination after straightening then could not hold the winner safe while remaining clear for the place spot.
BEAUTILICIOUS was void of speed while off the inside, shifted into the five of six path for the drive and finished with good energy to just get up for the show
spot. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and finished with good energy to just miss the minor share. NAUGHTY
JUSTICE was close up early from along the inside, continued in good position then weakened. WILADENE turned in an even effort while in the three or four
path through the turn and into the lane. LITTLE MAEMI was never a menace while moving well off the inside in late turn. YESTERDAYS KISSES was in the
three path through the turn, was well spotted after straightening in the lane then was empty inside the eighth pole. LUCYDOESTHEHULA raced in the two
path into the lane and tired. WALLAWALLABINGBANG chased the pace into the turn when a contender then steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
UNMOORED chased the pace from the two path, angled three wide into the lane, dueled with two others inside the sixteenth pole then edged clear.
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was unhurried into the lane then found good energy late to rally between several rivals to gain the place spot. SATURDAY TRYST
was four wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and turned in a good effort to just miss the place spot. BAY MUZIK vied for the lead
two wide into the lane then needed more in the final eighth. TOHUI was in the four path through the turn, was moving through the five path inside the eighth
pole and was gaining to the wire. EDGEMONT ROAD was in the four path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a bid. ROLIN WITH OLIN vied for
the lead along the inside into the lane then gave way inside the eighth pole. CAPTURE THE GLORY was near the rail into the lane and never was a factor.
DARK OAK was along the inside into the lane then weakened. STORMIN EL PRADO chased the pace from the two or three path and between rivals into
the lane then tired. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY was outrun while in the four or five path. SKY MIKE was outrun from the five or six path.

Footnotes
VANILLA BEAN BACK chased the pace from the two or three path, moved into the lane from the four path, caught the leader in mid-stretch and drove clear.
DISCERNMENT was along the inside into the lane and gained energy inside the sixteenth pole to be up for the place spot. SHE'S SO LIT was in the four
path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track and saved the show spot while not a threat to the top one. SPANISH PEAKS stalked the pace from
the three path through the turn, bid in late turn to gain the lead into the stretch then faltered after straightening. PLEXUS was in the two to the four path
through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and moved up. DOLCE ANDROMEDA raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane
and improved position. TAP N SWAY hustled early to be a contender into the lane then faded along the rail. TIPAZAR was steadied between rivals at the
start, raced in the four path and never was a factor. MISLED was along the inside throughout and was never in it. MS. DRAGONETTE set the early pace
from the two path then steadily faded. CARLY'S FLIGHT was outrun along the inside. PRECIOUS ARCH steadily faded from the three path.

Footnotes
VOLUBILE was unrushed inside,angled four wide at the quarter pole, rallied and was up in time. LONTANI stalked in the three path, bid at the quarter pole
but yielded. SURGE PRICING led inside to the stretch. UNITY had a mild late bid. CHRISTIANS CITY raced evenly. ROCK ON KITTEN stalked inside
before fading in the stretch. DETERMINANT raced inside and improved late. FRONT PAGE passed tired ones. CHANNEL STRIKE pressed outside to the
stretch. WITCH DOCTOR was not a factor. WHAT A HOOT stalked inside before fading. AIR WONDERFUL was not a factor.
