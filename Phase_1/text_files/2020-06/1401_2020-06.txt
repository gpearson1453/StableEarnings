ED'S DOG set the pace in the three path, continued on his left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. CLIFFY prompted the winner from the four path,
bid in upper stretch but was repulsed and settled for second best. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS chased the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally and held for
the show. GOLD DUCAT stalked the pace four wide and came up empty. SOMETHING BIRD was squeezed back early, saved ground and lacked a rally.
SILENT MISCHIEF stalked the pace inside, was hard ridden around the turn and retreated. BOUND TO BE A DUKE had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
ANIMAUXSELLE settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress between foes around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, was forced out
when CHA CHA HEELS drifted out in midstretch, surged outside and was up on the wire. CHA CHA HEELS saved ground well back early, advanced three
wide around the far turn, rallied through the lane, drifted out in midstretch, took the lead in deep stretch but was nailed on the wire. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY
stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-sixteenths pole and led for most of the stretch before getting overpowered late. SWEET MOOCHIE
lacked early speed while racing two wide, moved up three wide around the far turn and rallied mildly. WHITEHEELGIRL saved ground in range and came
up empty the lane. TORNERO prompted the pace two wide, took the lead between foes midway down the backstretch, set the pace two wide around the far
turn and tired in the drive. MILEY saved ground and failed to menace. GO GIRL GONE set the pace along the rail for a half and retreated. WEST HORIZEN
chased the pace four wide and was through after three-quarters. FIDDLER hopped at the start and trailed inside. The Stewards posted the inquiry sign but
found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
THE GREAT LOUDINI tracked the pace five wide, steadily gained outside and was up in deep stretch. TONEDADDY pressed the pace four wide, dueled
outside a foe through most of the stretch, won that battle but was unable to stave off the winner. SUM OVERTURE disputed the pace three wide between
foes to upper stretch, dug in inside of the top two through most of the stretch and gave way late. UNSPOILED MOMENTS failed to menace while racing five
wide. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW steadied off heels leaving the chute, saved ground throughout and never threatened. RED ROSE CAT steadied off heels
leaving the chute, stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the drive. POLLARD STAR set the pace along the rail and retreated. JIFFY JOSH was
outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
STONEY'S MONKEY settled off the pace while racing two wide through the opening half, angled to the rail entering the far turn, closed up the rail and was
up in deep stretch. MO MARGARITA set a clear pace near the rail, drifted out in upper stretch, held clear to deep stretch but could not stave off the winner
in the final yards. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ broke slowly, saved ground well back early, advanced three and four wide around the far turn and rallied for the
show. PASSIONFORTREASURE went evenly while racing two and three wide. CHICA DIFISEL tracked the pace inside, tipped out nearing the lane and
weakened. SUNNYMEDE DREAM failed to menace while racing two and three wide. WROTE'S GIFT played no factor while racing four wide. TRAP GIRL
leapt at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. TIDAL FIELD stalked the early pace two wide and was through after a half. ENOUGH KISSES was
outrun inside. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and found no reason to take action.

Footnotes
STORM ADVISORY stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. ZORB set the pace two wide
between foes, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly for the place. SMALL FORTUNE settled off the pace along the inside, bid inside of the top
two near the three-sixteenths pole, then flattened out in the final furlong. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally.
LUDINGTON never threatened while racing four wide. RUFFOLO chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

closed outside and was up and clear late. BLACK PRONG stalked the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, put away the pacesetter but
was overpowered by the winner late. ERIC THE SALESMAN set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch and held well to preserve the show. FELIX THE

HEY BIG GUY lacked early speed, pulled hard against stout restraint around much of the first turn and down the backstretch then lacked a rally. GATE
CREW chased the pace two wide and faded nearing the lane. SIMMARDSTRIKE stalked the pace three wide, bid three deep around the far turn, reached
near even terms then tired in the lane. CHILI MAC N CHEESE was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
EARLY DELIGH settled off the pace inside, made and inside bid in about the two path nearing the five-sixteenths pole, seized command in upper stretch
and drove clear. GILDED DRAMA set a pressured pace inside a foe in the three path, was collared by the winner nearing the lane, could not match strides
outside of that one in the lane but held well for second. SUNSHINES OUT pressed the pace in the four path, could not keep pace with the top two from the
quarter pole but lasted for the show. ROSAS WAY raced off the pace two wide and lacked a serious rally. STRIKING HEIR chased the pace four and five
wide and came up empty in the stretch. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS saved ground and failed to menace. MIKADO steadily faded while racing three wide.
FOUNTAINSTREETKID was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. ATTACK ZONE was bumped at the start, saved ground and
played no further factor.

Footnotes
LADY JORDAN set the pace along the rail, drifted out entering the lane, briefly lost the lead in upper stretch, battled on between and dug in to prevail.
MULTITUDE stalked the pace inside, bid two wide nearing the lane, was floated out slightly turning for home, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch but
could not get by. BATI BATI saved ground off the pace, made a rail bid in upper stretch, briefly led then weakened. TEGLA settled off the pace while racing
three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. MS. AMETHYST never threatened while racing two wide. MISS LOTUS
FLOWER broke in the air, raced two wide and made little impact. LOVELY ARABELLA had her head turned at the start, saved ground and played no factor.
LEMON WATER had early speed two wide then retreated inside around the far turn. BOURBON TRACE was outrun while racing three wide. AND I KNOW
dwelt and trailed inside. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and reviewed a trainer's objection from the trainer of MULTITUDE against the
winner for alleged interference in the stretch before allowing the original order of finish to stand.
