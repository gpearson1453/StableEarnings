Footnotes
GOODLUCKCHUCK bumped HEZAWINNERWITHME when coming in leaving the starting gate, circled three deep around the turn chasing the pace,
gained the lead near the eighth pole then drove clear. JUNIOR JUMPER showed speed along the rail, gained a short lead turning for home, weakened late
but held the place. WINSTON'S WAY bumped NITE TRIPPER when drifting out leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in the stretch, raced on
his left lead and had a slight rally. YES MAN saved ground on the turn and failed to menace. EXCITING IDEA bore in on the winner leaving the starting
gate, swung wide in upper stretch and was not a factor. BOOSTER GOLD , wide on the turn, weakened. HEZAWINNERWITHME , bumped around leaving
the starting gate, raced between horses in the stretch and lacked a rally. NITE TRIPPER , jostled leaving the starting gate, was very wide turning for home
and failed to be a factor. FEATURE ACT gave way along the rail entering the turn. CASE CROSSING showed speed in the two path, drifted out leaving the
turn, dropped back while eased in the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
STIVA broke a step slow, recovered and moved up between rivals to take over into the first turn, cleared and set the pace towards the rail, was under strong
handling through the final quarter mile and held sway. DYNAMIC MISS , unhurried early while saving ground, commenced a rail run leaving the far turn,
eased out a bit in the final furlong and rallied inside a pair of rivals to nab the place in the final jumps. SHEZALEMONDROPKID stalked the winner, took
closer order mid way on the final turn, pursued into the lane and kept trying while between runners late. DANCING CONTESSA settled towards the rail,
steadily advanced leaving the far turn, angled out three to four wide for the drive, continued progress past mid stretch but hung late. CHASING HELICITY ,
sluggish from the gate, lagged well back then had belated action towards the inside. ARBUTUS rated off the winner nearing the first turn, chased three wide
into the far turn and faded. VALLE LUNA was steadied repeatedly while between rivals the opening three furlongs, circled four to five wide into the stretch
but came up empty. LOST SCROLL popped the gate open when fractious pre race, settled in mid pack, was under pressure the final turn but failed to
respond. TROIS PONTS , off the pace, lost ground three to four wide, raced between rivals into the stretch but never got on track. SEA CANDY , a bit rank
early while wide, gave some early pursuit and faltered.

Footnotes
YIRA sped to the front, dropped in and set a rated pace, dueled under confident handling from the three eighths to mid stretch, was driven clear
approaching the sixteenth marker and held sway. BROADWAY MELODY settled off the pace, raced two to three wide into the lane, swung out and was set
down past the three sixteenths, finished gamely on her left lead and gained the place in the final jumps. RIVER TRAPPE had speed to the inside of horses,
had to steady off the winner nearing the turn, recovered to stalk inside, eased out then waited near mid stretch, was forced back in and finished willngly.
SUMMER HOURS , three wide early, moved up to engage the winner leaving the far turn, dueled under rating from mid turn, was set down soon past the
three sixteenths, kept up the battle past the eighth pole then hung. FACTORINTHEHEAT stalked the pace between foes, edged up a bit while under
pressure in mid stretch but could not generate the needed finish. VILLAMOURA , four deep into the turn while stalking the pace, circled five wide into the
stretch, ranged up in mid stretch to threaten, failed to sustain and faded late. SUDDENLYLASTSUMMER , rated off the pace, saved ground into the lane,
moved up near mid stretch the kept on willingly behind rivals. POPEYE'S OYL stalked in the clear, raced four to five wide into the lane and offered some
late interest off the heels of a rival. BEACON OF TRUTH broke slowly then wandered inward when a bit green, lagged well back, raced three wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. LEMON DROP KISS , fractious pre race, was sluggish away, saved ground while far back and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ANIMA GEMELLA saved ground while close up early, dropped back some near the five eighths, came under pressure leaving the far turn, was guided out
for a clear run leaving the three sixteenths, leveled off under solid handling and forged ahead in the final yards. BECKON cleared early, set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure heading towards the half mile marker, spurted back away past the five sixteenths, remained well clear under a drive past
the furlong grounds, drifted out some, switched over to her left lead late and just couldn't quite hold. MONA LUNA lost ground four wide, steadily progressed
under urging into the lane, lugged in a bit near mid stretch and flattened out. LADY FOX settled in the clear, was under a ride three wide leaving the far turn,
came wide for the drive and found her best stride too late. PEARLYVILLE stalked outside a rival past the five eighths, moved closer to the inside of a foe
near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. BOURBON AIDA saved ground stalking the pace, eased out near the three sixteenths and faded. SELF
ASSURED , three wide early, bid to challenge near the five eighths, forced the issue into the far turn, shifted in when unable to keep pace with the leader
around the final turn and gave way. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY was outrun. BECKINSALE dropped back. LOVELY SHY ANNE was outrun.

FILLE D'ESPRIT , patiently handled to the inside of rivals while stalking the leader, eased out soon into the lane, responded when put to right handed
encouragement, forged to command a sixteenth out, eagerly widened then was geared down a touch late. DEIRDRE OF LEGEND was nudged clear early,
set the pace two wide into the lane, wandered outward after being collared, faded but remained well clear of the rest. WHY YOU SASSY chased three wide
mid turn, angled five wide into the lane and offered a mild response. NOW OR EVER pursued three deep and came up empty. HOPE TAKES OVER stalked
off the inside, raced between rivals while under pressure into the lane and faded. MOLLY BOLTS stumbled at the break and failed to menace. DIAL EMMA
REILLY broke awkwardly, edged up towards the inside early on, chased to the three eighths then dropped back. A FOOLISH SMILE dwelt at the break and
was outrun.

Footnotes
ITS A JOURNEY settled off the pace while saving ground, steadily progressed under some coaxing mid turn , eased out and found a seam soon into the
lane, forged clear past the three sixteenths, opened up under strong left handed rousing in mid stretch and proved clearly best while kept to task. SO
INNOCENT , unhurried early, swung out five wide entering the lane, straightened away and made a grinding run, battled outside MORTAL STORM through
the final sixteenth and earned the place. MORTAL STORM broke a step slow, was sent hard and to the inside of rivals to gain command leaving the chute,
went clear and set the pace towards the inside, turned away a threat from I LOVE YOU approaching the stretch, could not resist the winner past the quarter
pole but continued to give good effort to the end. MONACO PRINCESS relaxed early while removed from the inside, picked up some momentum past the
three eighths, ranged up, drifted four wide into the lane, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and faded. PRINCESS GEORGIA , off the pace, came four to
five wide for the drive but failed to generate a solid run. I LOVE YOU rated off the leader, bid outside that one near the three eighths, could not match strides
soon into the stretch then retreated.

Footnotes
MINISTER'S STRIKE came out at the break, was patiently rated down the backstretch, circled horses leaving the far turn, swung to the six path in upper
stretch, closed outside rivals and was up approaching the finish. LUCKY RAMSEY stalked the pace, circled horses four wide leaving the far turn, gained the
lead approaching the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. CHOCOLATE RIDE lacked speed, moved up five deep turning for home, challenged for the
lead in mid stretch and finished willingly between the top pair. ELEMENTARY , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed to the far turn,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch, passed tired horses and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. DO WITH PRIDE , along the inner rail most of the trip,
lacked room with run near the eighth pole and finished willingly when finally clear. BEYOND SMART dropped back in upper stretch then passed tired horses
late. DASHING LOU prompted the pace two wide and weakened. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR set the pace along the rail and tired through the stretch. HE'S
ONE WILD DUDE , three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. PRINCE TITO was not a factor.
