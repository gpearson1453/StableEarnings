stretch then came under the whip and drew off under strong urging. JUSTATAPIN bumped hard with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the inside,
steadied near the three-eighths, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out outside the furlong marker then was carried out
more and safely secured the place. TRUE FRIEND was bumped very hard at the start then forced into another foe and dropped back, angled in at the rear,
came between horses into the turn, went two then three wide on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, was bumped and forced out in the vicinity of the
furlong marker then lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. FRILLY FRILL was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced on the far outside
under urging, chased four then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and weakened. GO TWEET
was bumped hard at the start then forced into another foe, recovered to race just off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the
stretch, began to drift out a bit nearing the furlong marker then was carried out more and bumped with a foe then lacked the needed response then steadied
in traffic crossing the wire. MISS FUNNY GUN broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, was urged four wide for most of the turn then dropped
to three wide, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. KITCHEN MATCH chased the pace on the outside, went three then two wide on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired. FAMILY CAMEO broke in and bumped hard with a foe, settled under some urging, went four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LISTEN MYLEE lacked early speed, was urged along at the rear of the field, went around the turn in

Footnotes
QUEEN'SREDBOY went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved out outside the half-mile pole, was roused while four then five wide on the far
turn, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly to make a bid in the final sixteenth, drifted out a bit late and prevailed under good handling. GATO
DEL BANCO went three then four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, went four wide under urging on the far turn, pursued the leader
under the whip into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed while able to get the place. THREE DAY
WEEKEND went around the first turn in the two path, moved up midway down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, pursued the leader
into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. PRINCE JET went to the front, set the clear pace while inside to the
two path, responded well when asked on the far turn, came under a left-handed whip while well clear in upper stretch, maintained the lead while shortening
stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken. B JS ARCH veered out sharply at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went four
then five wide on the first turn, moved in near the five-eighths pole, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. KING BLING was away awkwardly then taken up off heels into the first turn, shifted two then three wide under a bit
of extra left-rein pressure later on that bend, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn and faltered.

through nicely to make a three wide bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead at the top of the stretch, battled outside of two foes in the drive and prevailed
under strong urging. TOMMYTOSHORT showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of three opponents, vied along the rail on the turn, fought on
well under a drive in the stretch but missed while able to get the place. ALGEBRA came away well and showed good speed, contested the pace between
horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the
show. BEST LITTLE MAN came out at the start then brushed with a foe, dropped back while corrected with a grab of the left rein, moved up on the outside,
chased five wide on the turn and came up empty. SPORTY FLYER brushed with a rival while sent hard from the start, disputed the pace on the outside of
three opponents, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. ICEBIRG LET US
contested the pace between foes, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and capitulated. EMPRESARIO settled
under some urging, saved ground under stronger encouragement on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then angled to the far outside and failed to
respond. SATURDAYNITESINNER brushed the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the four path, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
LET'S GO ALAMO showed speed then chased while switched outside of the leader, went two to three wide on the turn, took the lead while drifting out under
a left-handed whip in upper stretch then switched to a right-handed whip coming to the furlong marker and powered away under strong urging. RUN TO
FAME showed good speed then sped clear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was roused for more into the stretch then came under the whip, lost the
advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match but held the place. CAPT. ST. JACQUES bumped with a rival at the start while off
a bit slow, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, lugged inward in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while just up
for the show. HARD TWIST broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came under the whip in upper
stretch and also lacked the needed response. WATERWILD came out at the start, was urged along on the outside, rounded the turn in the four path, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GRAN ROJO veered out badly at the start then was straightened by the rider, was urged along on the
outside in third position, went three to four wide oh the turn, drifted out under a left-handed whip just inside the furlong marker then was switched to a
right-handed whip and came up empty. IRISH MISSILE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start and was off a step slow, was urged along while well
back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. BAGAZO leaned out at the start, was taken in hand early then dropped well behind without
any encouragement and was eased but walked off.

PURE SPECULATION was sent hard from the start, moved clear nearing the half-mile pole, drew off in the three path on the turn, remained well clear into
the final furlong, shortened stride under the whip into the final sixteenth but maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. BAYERN TO BE WILD
ducked in sharply early and checked, was urged along well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch in the three path
under a drive then came between horses into the final furlong, gained fast late and got up for the place. BEAU GOSSE drifted in early then was straightened
by the rider, was urged along between horses, moved out leaving the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn, gained fast on the outside late and just
missed the place while able to get the show. CROW MOUNTAIN showed speed then chased the winner while hard ridden, went around the turn in the four
path, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick then was denied the trifecta. DELIRIUM bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along
in the middle of the field, went four wide for most of the turn then shifted six wide at the quarter-pole, gained fast into the final sixteenth but missed the
superfecta. SMARTY GRIMES was urged along in the front half of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail under a drive into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. MOVE IT broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven
into upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. FIST broke out and bumped with a rival, was ridden along towards the rear, went five wide early on
the turn then moved to seven wide late on that bend and was no factor. PUNCH OUT was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to
threaten. HUMOR CONTROLLER was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turn and showed little. SHAKE IT
lunged badly at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch then
drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and never reached contention. TAP A MIRACLE broke a step slow then was taken up, climbed outward while towards the
rear at the half-mile pole, dropped from four to three wide early on the turn and also never reached contention. WRITTEN PERMISSION was urged along in
the front half of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond.

SIMPLE PLEASURE went three wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made a bid near the
five-sixteenths, took the lead passing the quarter-pole then moved clear at the three-sixteenths, drifted in into upper stretch, drew away under the whip into
the final sixteenths then was placed under a solid hand ride to the wire while much the best. SKIP'S SONG went around the first turn in the three path,
prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader at the seven-sixteenths, took a short advantage in the two path at the three-eighths, lost the
lead while roused passing the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place.
GOODNIGHTLOVING bumped with a rival at the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace under some restraint,
came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired while able to get the show. EYE ON HARPER went two to
three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced in the two path under urging on the far turn and failed to rally. SUNDANCE SEVEN was caught
six wide into the first turn then dropped quickly to the three path, moved to the rail later on that bend, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on
the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. A J'S GRAND went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along
while four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. BALADERA bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was
urged along while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BOBBIES FLIGHT dropped back early, went four to five
wide on the turns, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. SEVEN VIOLETS went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail midway
through the first turn, set the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner passing the quarter-pole and faded. MELODY ROSE
went four wide on the first turn, settled on the inside of a rival, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, fell
further back in the four path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

WISHFUL QUALITY stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage at the three-sixteenths and
edged clear under strong urging. DULCE RIDE showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside, was asked on the turn, lost the lead while put to the
whip at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. AL SHAMKHAH checked
when the loose horse came out in front outside the five-eighths, dropped in under urging, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch and missed
the place while well clear for the show. COMPLETE SENSE settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn and came up empty. BELLA
MOON tracked the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back while two then three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and faded.
HAILEY'S DAY was carried out by the loose horse starting outside the five-eighths, steadied while continuing to be carried out around the nine-sixteenths
then dropped in, went four wide on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then drifted further in and failed to respond. KANTANKEROUS BABY broke out
then was taken up very badly, spotted the front many lengths, darted to the inside at the rear of the field, fell further behind while traveling a bit choppy into
the turn, saved ground on that bend and was eased but walked off. DISTORTED FLASH acted-up just as the gate opened and left the rider in the stall as he
stepped onto the side pontoon, was caught by the outrider after completing the unassisted journey then was walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into
the start, no change was made as DISTORTED FLASH was ruled to have caused his own trouble.

Footnotes
BRANDONS BABE went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, advanced in unison with IN THE RED while inside that foe leaving the
backstretch, made a three wide bid between horses on the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch, edged clear while drifting out under a right-handed whip
in the final furlong and proved best under steady handling. IN THE RED was taken up while in tight early, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, advanced in tandem with the winner while outside leaving the backstretch, made a four wide on the far turn, led past the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage into upper stretch then was carried out, dropped inside the winner inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place.
QUICKPAY set the pace on the inside, was urged along while headed on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and weakened but held the show. LA
VIDA went five to six wide on the first turn, moved further out early on the backstretch, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn and
improved position. CAGED BEAR went five wide early on the first turn, dropped to the three then two path late on that bend, was well placed down the
backstretch, drafted in the two path while passed by the top two early on the far turn, shifted four wide under urging at the quarter-pole, came five wide into
the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. MAJESTIC ICE went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along
while two to three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. SWEET LINDA lugged out four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was urged
along in the two path while between horses on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. JEWEL STREET went five wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, moved out some leaving the backstretch, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn and failed to threaten.
SHALLOW saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
failed to respond. PRINCESS LILLI BUG went six wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, fell towards
the rear while three wide on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and capitulated. FEARLESS DIXIE went around the first turn in the two path, dropped
well behind on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path, came out some into upper stretch and was eased but walked off. (Rail at 20 Feet)
