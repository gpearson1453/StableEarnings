Footnotes
TROUVILLE tracked from off the rail, traveled in the two path around the turn, bid inside the leader in the drive, dueled through the late stages and proved
best under urging. KAELY'S CANDY sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, drifted out into the lane, met the bid from the winner and battled back
from the outside but was outkicked. CANADIAN GINGER stalked outside a rival, went three deep and four wide into the turn, moved closer outside the
leader on the turn and was fanned five wide into the stretch, weakened in the lane but held the show. OUR BONNIE LASS unhurried in the beginning from
off the rail, went four wide into the turn then angled six wide, then lacked further response in the lane. CHROMES LIL SIS forwardly placed from the outside
then went between runners, steadied nearing the three eighths pole, went four wide into the stretch and weakened. SAPPHIRE SILK settled near the inside,
two wide into the stretch, angled in just past the quarter pole and failed to rally. CLEARLY CLASSY stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, made a mild
bid inside near the seven sixteenths marker, dropped back and raced in the two path to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
COALINGA HILLS up close between foes then chased the top pair, came four wide into the lane, gained command and kicked clear near the three
sixteenths pole and stayed clear under urging. COPPER COWGIRL off the rail early, went between runners into the turn, three wide into the stretch, angled
out and kept on willingly for second. WINSINFASHION showed speed from the inside, dueled inside and in the two path, overtaken by the winner in upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. STELLAR WAY settled off the rail in the early going then outside a rival, went four wide into the stretch and
weakened. NIGHT OF IDIOTS lacked early speed and angled to the inside, traveled in the two path into the turn, came out entering the stretch, drifted in
inward in the drive and improved position. DURGA stalked from the inside, lost ground around the turn, kept along the inside to the stretch, drifted inward
near the eighth pole and lacked a bid. MADAME MOUSSE showed speed from the far outside, dueled with WINSINFASHION to the inside, exited the turn
three wide and weakened in the final furlong. BLOOMING HANNAH chased outside a rival then from the two path and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
FLATTERWITHJEWELS chased the speed outside a rival, floated out entering the turn, exited three wide, rallied in the lane, collared rival a sixteenth out
and inched away. QUEEN VERRAZANO broke in and bumped leaving the gate, drifted out entering the turn, chased, four wide into the lane, gained
command and led through thelane but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. WILD ARCH brushed at the start, tracked outside a rival, two wide into the lane,
drifted inward in the stretch, rallied and earned the show honors. I'M SO ADORABLE off a bit slow and shuffled back at the start, trailed the field in the early
going, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive and produced a mild late bid. ENRICHED BY DEB broke out, chased from the outside,
floated out by rival entering the turn, came four wide into the lane and was edged for third. BIG GAME PLAN travled a bit off the rail, three wide leaving the
bend and lacked a rally. BIT OF CACTUS brushed and stumbled at the start, stalked from the inside to the stretch, came out a bit and never threatened.
STORMY SUN sped clear and set the pace, fought back from the two path then gave way.

Footnotes
SCHNELL stalked the lone leader from the two path, drifted into the lane, ranged up and took the lead past the three sixteenths pole, drifted out under
left-handed urging near eighth pole and drew away. DYN O MITE stumbled badly at the start, chased off the inside, went around a rival and three wide into
the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied and was clearly second best. BRONY BOY set the pace inside, overtaken by the winner in mid-stretch and
proved no match for the top pair. FOXBOROUGH shifted in at the start, raced between rivals then two wide on the turn, came out and lacked a bid when
asked. FALCONS FURY raced in the two path to the lane, drifted out in the drive and weakened. GONE ROGUE traveled along the inside, came out into
the lane and was never factor. JEANNE B chased outside a rival, three wide then drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened.

BODEGA went three wide into the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and drew off under urging
then steady handling late. MY SUNSHINE raced a bit off the rail into the first turn, advanced off the inside, bid three deep leaving the turn and was
outfinished by the winner. FORT DODGE trailed the field from the inside to the far turn, swung out leaving the bend, rallied late and gained the show.
PRINCE RICKY raced three deep early then pressed the leader from the outside, lost a bit of ground then came back to gain command and clear into the far
turn, fought back in the lane then gave way. FOUR O'FIVE raced along the inside then two wide into the lane and improved position. MASTER RECOVERY
settled a bit off the rail, bid inside leaving the far turn but tired in the late stages. DERBY STAR stalked a bit off the rail then between runners, came four
wide into the stretch and lacked a response. ZEES EMPIRE went four wide through the first turn, moved in on the backstretch and entered the second turn
in the two path, tipped out three wide entering the stretch and was never a factor. ENDLESS TALE sped to the front and angled over to the inside, inched
away on the backstretch, lost command and chased PRINCE RICKY into the far turn and tired in the lane.
