Footnotes
RED CLAY MAGIC came away in good order, established a good position just off the pace on the inside, saved ground while drafting behind the leading
duo on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, came through a clear rail opening, chased into the final furlong, made a bid outside the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling. GOT MY MO moved out under urging while towards the front, chased three to four wide on the turn,
was driven into upper stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, made an outside bid near the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but
missed while just able to get the place. KATS SECOND SILVER disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead before
the three-sixteenths, was asked for his best into upper stretch, led under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, drifted in closer to the winner when
switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and was caught while well clear for the show. DOMIKATE bumped solidly with a rival at the start
then jostled with that same foe early, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. SWISS MINISTER hesitated at the start, moved up to dispute the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path while still inside that foe
on the turn, was driven into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. PLOT TWIST was taken up nearing the five-eighths, settled at
the back of the field, went four wide under urging on the turn, was carried seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MONYDONTSPENITSELF
bumped solidly with a foe at the start then jostled with that same opponent early, moved up on the outside with a half-mile to run, chased in the five path on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. RED ZENON was urged along towards the back, came under the whip leaving the backstretch,
raced inside to the two path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ROYAL BERTRANDO veered out at the start but broke very fast, showed good speed from the far outside, angled in nearing the seven-sixteenths, moved
clear in the two path on the turn, responded well to an intermittent whip in the stretch and held under good handling. LET'S GO ALAMO showed speed on
the inside, chased along the rail on the turn, came off the inside while in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. RICHMOND
showed speed then chased the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and weakened while able to hold the show.
THAT DUDE was urged along off the pace, started the turn in the three path, dropped to the two path then rail later on that bend, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, moved out in the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick. TOUGH COMPANY was ridden along towards the back, raced inside for most of
the turn then moved to the two path, shifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. NIPAWIN broke in then was hustled, raced off the pace
under urging, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch and came up empty. BEE BRIDGE dropped back early then angled in near
the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path under some urging, came three wide into the stretch, hesitated behind horses outside the furlong
marker, moved in some shortly thereafter and failed to threaten. MR. SCISSORS broke in and bumped lightly with a foe, settled in the middle of the field,
was urged four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY bumped with a rival at the
start, was hard ridden towards the rear on the outside, went six wide on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and was no factor.
NORTHERN HIGHLINE was bumped lightly at the start then forced in, raced near the back under urging, went five wide on the turn, was taken in hand
behind a foe inside the furlong marker then not urged under a protective hold. PURE SPECULATION hit the outside of the gate at the start then bumped
with a rival, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun five to six wide into the stretch, was taken up while lugging out some near the
furlong marker and faltered.

disputed the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch, moved out in the final furlong and lacked the needed
response. BRAVE DAISEY showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and

in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging. WILLTHERESAWAY was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide
on the turn and finished with good energy but was too late while able to safely secure the place. CHIANTI had a shoe repaired in the paddock, bumped with
a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while
just able to get the show. DARPA broke a step slow, settled well off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came between horses late and improved
position. DUSTWHIRL WONDER bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick. HI SKOOL SWEETHART was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, moved up on the inside of rivals, saved
ground on the turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to the three-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and also lacked the needed response. TRUE ALLEGIANCE was ridden along off the pace, went five

Footnotes
SWEET SONG moved in while showing good speed, set the clear pace, dictated terms along the rail on the turn, responded well when set down into upper
stretch, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. RUN BALLERINA was well placed under urging, chased in the two
path on the turn then was driven into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TEXAS RAIN was bumped at the start and
forced out, moved up midway down the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide and lacked the needed kick while best of the
rest. ALWAYS GRACE chased the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. FUNNY
FLOWERS was forced in some at the start, moved up midway down the backstretch, saved ground while ridden along on the turn and failed to respond.
DYNAMIC JULIE broke in and bumped with a rival, settled at the rear, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. VIVA CAT chased the pace on the
outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and retreated. FOLLYS SECRET settled on the far outside under some urging,
went five wide while put to stronger encouragement on the turn and faltered. FOXY BOX was reserved towards the rear then came under urging near the
half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and showed little. KARMA REIGNS was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and also faltered.
