saving ground took short lead inside furlong marker but outfinished late. MINE N YOURS unhurried with no speed to the half, wide rush quarter pole and
hung in the final furlong. FINNEGAN (IRE) saved ground to no avail with a good effort over all. ALL HANDS ON DECK never far back, made a middle move
to contend but flattened out late. DRAGUNOV never a real menace. ARCH YOU READY brief outside speed and faded. CHARLES T close up to the half
with nothing left and faded. INDEPENDENT INDY encountered broken equipment around the first turn and galloped past wire.

DREAMIN' OF MUNNY broke well, inside first turn, three wide into far turn, dueled in the stretch and veered out sharply just before the wire while clear.
FIRST SQUADRON good speed to front, led to deep stretch and stayed game late. MALICED chased pace to quarter pole with little left while brushing with
winner for the show spot. BAYTOWN BABE well placed while never far back with an even effort throughout. INCA PRINCESS had no impact at any call and
passed a couple of tired ones. LOYAL never a factor throughout. HOOSIER GOLD CASE good position to the half and came up empty thereafter. GOING
TO TEMPLE never a factor. GRAMS REVENGE with leaders to the half but stopped to a walk and dropped far back.

FAT MAKER just off leader to far turn, withstood two challenges in the late while game and gutsy to hang on. SLICK AS A PIN inside trip throughout,
accelerated late from inside to just miss while turned back on the wire. BARON IT ALL well placed to far turn, rallied with a three wide rush but could not get
pas in the final furlongt. JERZEES ONE very reluctant to load with a slow start, steady advanced and,gained between late. PRESSONREGARDLESS well
placed to the half with no late kick when needed. SPIKEANDBOWL never threatened. C C THE BOSS dropped far back quickly. ILLUME good speed, led to
the half and gave way readily.

Footnotes
TEMPLEMENT stumbled badly start, recovered nicley outside, rushed four wide to the turn, roused and cleared in a good effort. MINING FOR PEARLS
inside speed to deep stretch, could not hold off winner in the late stages. LADY DAVID with leaders between horses to the stretch, gave way grudgingly to
wire and dug in determinedly through the final seventy yards in a game effort. CYCLONE MILLIE dueled between horses to deep stretch but weakened late.
PERSONAL SERVER saved ground to the stretch, no late kick when needed. IMNOTSMALL through early while never a threat. HIGH STRONG LEAH
never a factor with a rail run throughout. UNSCATTERED lunged at the start and never reached contention. HIDDEN STRENGTH never close.

SIR MICHAEL sprinted clear, nursed along to the stretch with steady urging to widen the advantage late. JAMMING CAMERON good position between
horses to the turn, rallied four wide for the place spot. while no match. RAYO MY KING chased pace to stretch, just could not keep up and held the show
spot. TIO MOSCO between horses throughout with no response when needed. ODIE rushed inside to turn but emptied out from that point. HIGH ESTEEM
never a factor. MASON A. P. pushed on from the start with no response.

Footnotes
DUCHES OF GRACE away well, pessed the pace, rallied to clear with good handling through the final furlong. MOMOS HUMOR good position to turn,
rallied four wide for the place spot. SALLY good position throughout with no late kick when needed. TRULY'S SPIRIT rail trip throughout, finished up with
good energy too late. CHANGE OF CUSTODY speed to the front, collard in the turn, used up and weakened in the stretch run. KEEP THIS KITTEN tried
hard to turn, stayed well through stretch but also could not go and weakened. CLASSY LAURIEANN had a terrible start while far back to the stretch while
well off rail. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE raced a wide trip throughout with nothing for the stretch. DANGEROUS GIRL void of any speed throughout and
never a menace. COOKIES CAT never a menace while far back throughout. ALEXIS ROAD WEST never close. MORNING CHILD had a terrible start and
never recovers while far back at every call.
