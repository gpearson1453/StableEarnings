Footnotes
TOUGH COMPANY broke very fast and went straight to the lead, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, inched away on the far turn then was
asked after the rider took a confident peak behind him approaching the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed whip nearing the furlong
marker, switched to a left-handed whip around the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. BEE BRIDGE raced inside to the two path on the first turn,
was well placed just off the pace, chased inside for most of the far turn then shifted three wide very late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in
the stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. REMEMBER ME TONY was hustled from the start then taken in hand before the first turn, went
two to three wide on that bend, was urged along on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path under strong urging, was driven hard into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. JUST ASK JOEL moved in entering the first turn, went three wide on that bend,
settled in the back half of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, bumped with HUNK OF A HIT at the five-sixteenths then checked, came three wide
into the stretch then moved out and improved position. HUNK OF A HIT was asked some leaving the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the
back, raced inside on the far turn, bumped with JUST ASK JOEL at the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. WICKED REBEL went three wide on the first
turn, dropped back under restraint early on the backstretch then came under urging on the outside before the half-mile pole, chased four wide on the far turn
and came up empty. GEMINATOR bumped solidly with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, was urged along
while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. D C HERO bumped solidly with an opponent at the start,
went five wide on the first turn, moved up on the outside to prompt the pace, vied in the three path on the far turn, dropped back under urging near the
five-sixteenths and faded. THAT DUDE went six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, came
six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. WITTNESS THIS dropped back between horses nearing the first turn then moved in, went four wide on the
first turn, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the far turn and showed little. SEVEN-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS
UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. Race times added after video review

make a five wide bid early on the turn, dropped to the four path around the five-sixteenths then the three path while outside of one foe at the quarter-pole,
drifted to the rail while moving clear into upper stretch, drew away under a right-handed whip into the final sixteenth, switched to a left-handed whip late and
was much the best under strong urging. QUEEN'SREDBOY was completely void of speed, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in
the two path, swerved out over heels of a faltering foe inside the quarter-pole then came six wide into the stretch, advanced into second position into the
final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and secured the place. TRULY BLING was brushed in the hindquarters by a rival at the start, chased the
pace, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied three wide between horses early on the turn then dropped to the two path near the five-sixteenths, moved to
the rail while inside the winner at the quarter-pole then lost touch with that foe, was switched out four wide into the stretch, dropped back while still on his
inside lead and tired but was well clear for the show. MY TEXAS CHROME was sent hard from the start, set the pace under heavy pressure, lost the lead
while inside early on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths then started to angle out, came four wide into the stretch and capitulated. IMA REAL
DEAL bumped with a rival after the start, was hard ridden off the pace, chased the vanguard into the turn, dropped back while four wide on that bend, spun

while still well clear at the furlong marker but was overtaken by the top two while clear for the show. THIRSTY JUNIOR bumped with a rival at the start then
went to the front, dropped in into the first turn, set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the advantage with a half-mile to run, dropped back while
inside at the three-eighths then moved off the rail, shifted three wide very late on that bend and tired. GEORGIA DEPUTY bumped with a foe at the start,
went four wide on the first turn, settled at the back, was urged along while six wide on the far turn and failed to respond. RAMAAH saved ground on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn and also failed to respond. SHOAL BAY was hustled from the start, raced in the three
path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside for a half-mile and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

wide into the stretch and came up empty. REBECCA'S MUSIC was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. MISSISZIPPY BLING was forced in at the start then taken up, raced at the rear, came out greenly leaving the backstretch,
went five wide on the turn, turned seven wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. ADELE'S BLING bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and had nothing left. SAMBORITA chased the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and faded. CLIPPER COVE bobbled at the start then came inward before being corrected by the rider, raced inside under urging, lost
action badly near the three-eighths then checked, saved ground through the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and was no factor.

into the final furlong then drew clear under strong urging. DEFENDER pressed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, battled with that foe while still on his inside lead into the final furlong and proved no match

urging, went six wide on the turn, chased on his inside lead into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then missed the place while able to get the
show. DUST DEVIL brushed with a rival at the start then dropped back, moved in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. SOAP BUBBLE brushed with a rival at the start, dropped back early then was urged along off the pace, went

stretch, rallied on the outside, closed fast to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under steady urging. STALEMATE veered out at the
start and bumped hard with LOVE AND LEMONS, showed good speed on the inside of that foe, set the pace under pressure, vied inside of two opponents
while along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner but
narrowly earned the place. LOVE AND LEMONS was bumped hard at the start by STALEMATE and forced out, pressed the pace on the outside of that foe,
vied in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while narrowly
able to get the show. FLASH N GO leapt in the air and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under
a drive outside the sixteenth-pole and improved position. STREET FLYER chased the pace on the outside, made a bid while three wide on the turn, took a
short lead outside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened. BIG TINY dropped
back while carried in early, moved out late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
