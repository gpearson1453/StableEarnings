Footnotes
CALUSA QUEEN broke well and set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and shook clear late under brisk right handed urging. JERSEY
BOUNCE bumped at the start, split horses two wide on the turn, moved up and finished second best. GRINS N' WINS bumped at the start, track the leaders
outside her stablemate, angled inward through the stretch and finished with good courage in the two path. DIVA POWER vied for lead the lead three wide
and failed to offer the needed response. A FABULOUS KISS pressured the winner into the turn then gave way. SECRET FORMULA was bounced around
and checked between horses at the start then was never involved. A PERFECT SKY had speed for three furlongs then weakened. LEXY ANNA was in tight
along the rail at the five furlong marker causing her rider to steady then was no threat.

Footnotes
CAKE POP stalked the pace from the four path into the turn, circled rivals rapidly, battled until deep stretch and edged clear late under left handed urging.
HE'S NO BULL prompted the pace from the three path, loomed boldly at the top of the stretch between rivals and gamely gained second. MACHISMO was
bumped then forced inward at the start, allowed to settle then closed a gap late in the six path. FRONTLINER unhurried, finished determinedly in the three
path. KING VALERO failed to menace. ROYAL'D away alertly, set the pace to the top of the stretch then tired. KING CREED bore in at the start bumping
MACHISMO, was hustled to press the pace into the turn, stopped and returned bleeding from the nostrils/

Footnotes
CATS VALENTINE bore out at the start bumping TATIS, shifted out and rushed to contention, stalked the pace into the turn, circled rivals in the five path to
make the lead entering the stretch, drifted to mid track and won under mild urging. DIDDY DEW never far back, was steadily gaining ground late in the six
path. HIGH APPROVAL dueled for the lead into the turn, gained a narrow advantage battled into the stretch then was outfinished. LAFLEUR failed to
menace. BUBBA went evenly. TATIS was bumped at the start then outrun. HEREFORD HEAD sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace into the turn then stopped.
