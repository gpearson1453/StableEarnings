Footnotes
LUCKY LOOKIN vied for the early lead along the inside, settled back off the pace, bid two wide into the lane then drove past and slowly widened.
WOLOWITZ raced near the inside through the turn, cut the corner into the lane and moved up along the rail to be second best. AUSTIN RAY was in the
three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the four path could not stay with the winner while saving the show spot. MOLOKAI NIGHT was in the
three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then could not maintain the momentum late. ELI'S COMING vied for the lead two
wide into the turn, was clear in late turn, continued with a clear lead into the lane then faltered the final eighth. GET SOME MUNY was in the two to the four
path through the turn, came widest into the lane and never was a threat. DENVER SKY was fractious in the gate unseating his rider, got off awkwardly and
trailed.

Footnotes
BIG FUDGE pressed then vied with the pacesetter through the turn, continued on near equal terms with pace rival into the lane while entering from the four
path, dueled through the final eighth and inched up late. THATSWHATITHOUGHT vied for the lead while racing in the two path through the turn, continued
to duel with winner through the lane and gave ground grudgingly. UNBRIDLED BEAST chased the pace from near the inside, came off the rail approaching
the quarter pole, entered the lane from the four path then could not gain while keeping on to the wire. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL stumbled at the start and
settled toward the back, raced in the two path into the lane and lacked a serious closing bid. STOP HAMMERTIME was in the three or four path through the
turn, entered the lane from the five path and never was a serious threat. MAX EXPRESS was never a serious factor while in the four to the three path
through the turn. A LITTLE IRRADIC was steadied after stepping to the outside and the start, raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane and
was never seriously involved.

Footnotes
HOLLEE PEACH set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, was joined by another in late turn, dueled with that one after straightening in the lane, lost the
lead outside the eighth pole then dug in gamely to inch up late. TROPHY DOLL (IRE) stalked the pace from the two path, bid in late turn, dueled from the
four path in the lane, gained a short lead and appeared to be on her way then was outgamed in the final forty yards. BEHOLD chased the pacesetters from
the three path through the far turn, was asked to quicken in late turn, took aim on the top two into the lane then could not gain and settled for the show spot.
TWELVE MONARCHS was along the inside throughout and showed some gain in the final eighth. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY was in the three path through the
turns and never was a threat. SASSY ZEEMAN raced near the rail into the lane then weakened in the drive. HOOSIER GOLD CASE raced in the three or
the four path into the far turn then bolted approaching the quarter pole and dropped far back.

Footnotes
TUFFER THAN TUFF set the pace on a clear lead while near the inside, continued clear into the lane, was getting weary late and was all out to the wire to
last. GOOD SUGAR chased the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane after straightening and losing some ground to the top one,
stayed on well and was steadily inching up to the wire and ran out of real estate. BRAVO EXPRESS waited behind rivals through late turn, was free to run
when straightening in the lane then offered a mild gain while finishing clear for the show spot. GO RODNEY was in the four to five path through the turn,
swung into the lane from the five or six path and gained mildly from mid-track. FASHION NUGGET raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane
and improved late. ALL STAR JUSTICE in the four path through the turn, came widest and in the seven path into the lane and finished with energy.
SHOTGUN JUSTICE saved ground and gained belatedly. EXPRESSED was along the inside throughout and lacked a bid. WHO WANTS WHAT chased
the pace through the turn then faded the final eighth. R SOARING LIGHT hustled out of the gate to reach a contending position, continued in touch into the
lane then faded. GUN HILL was outrun while in the four path. RED MOON MIKE reared at the start and spotted the field some six lengths and trailed
thereafter.
