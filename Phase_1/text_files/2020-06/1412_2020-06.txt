DRILLIT prompted the pace three wide to the far turn, made the lead at will then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while taken in hand
through the final stages. LEONA'S REWARD was hung five wide into the first turn, settled just off the dueling leaders, offered a bid four then three wide into
the stretch and finished clear for second. MOONLIT MISSION four wide into the first turn, bid between horses nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished.
CALI DREAM battled for the lead two wide to the three eights pole, chased the winner near the inside until mid stretch then weakened. GRIZABELLA had
speed near the inside for a half then wilted. TOTALLY OBSESSED broke alertly, dueled for the lead along the inside to the far turn then faltered.

VICTOR STORY unhurried near the inside, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and outfinished others. GIFT FROM MOM broke in full stride to set the
pace for a little over a half, had speed into the stretch then weakened. SHACK'S HAREM well placed, failed to respond.

Footnotes
FANCY PANTS settled just off the leaders inside, slipped through to make the lead past the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best while in hand. G Q GIRL was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide into the turn, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole then was
no match for the winner while clearly second best. ANITA MARIE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace in the two path for a half , drifted
to the six path and lost ground. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE trailed into the stretch, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. COOL IRIS was bumped and pinched
back at the start then failed to menace. HAPPY ISSUE also bumped and squeezed at the start, had brief speed. SLEWZER drifted out soon after the start
bumping a rival and causing a chain reaction of bumping to her outside, prompted the pace two wide into the turn then flattened out.
