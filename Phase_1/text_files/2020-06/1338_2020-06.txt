Footnotes
CURLIN BIG BOY away in good order, dueled up front while off the inside, continued to vie to the wire, gained the nod at the wire to narrowly prevail.
BERNIE SPECIAL broke sharp, drifted slightly early, alternated up front closest to the inside, missed. MA CHER AMIO chased the top two from the outside,
had little for that pair late, finished up best of the rest. RATTLESNAKE RIVER went one paced along the inside. CRUSADER EXPRESS settled in mid pack,
lacked a closing kick. STONE DREAMER moved out midway, also failed to produced a closing response. BENBOW CAT hesitated at the start then swerved
in, remained far back.

Footnotes
FETCHING FURY unhurried while outrun early, dropped inside, saved ground through the first turn, moved closer after a half while in hand, briefly waited
while continuing along the inside second turn, got through into the lane, quickly clear, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MISS NEKO forwardly
placed off the inside, shuffled back in some traffic late in the second turn, followed the winner into the straight, roused, finished willingly to be getting to that
one late. DECORATED FOR GOLD lacked early foot, continued back the middle half while three wide through the second turn, shifted out widest when
straightened for home, also closed well to close the gap on the winner in the waning strides. DUEPEG settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a winning
response. CASUAL COOL broke on top, set the pace, rated the middle part then had little left when confronted for the drive. SALUTE ELLE pressed the
issue early, moved to challenge in the second turn, briefly vied then faltered in the drive. BELLA KRISTINA restless in the gate then hesitated at the break,
raced back, crept a bit closer in the five path turning for home then flattened out soon after.

Footnotes
FAMILIAR RHYTHM broke back, lacked early foot as a result, advanced and loomed a threat five wide turning for home, long drive to the wire mid track,
held the runner up at bay in game fashion to not be denied. FRONT DOOR confidently handled toward the front while three wide, headed by the winner
turning for home inside that one, asked soon after, dueled to the wire, outkicked late. DRY WOOD CREEK last away, raced off the pace in the two path,
proved no match for the top two when clear for the drive, held sway for the show. SONG N A CAT forwardly placed from the outside in the run up the
backstretch, advanced to duel through the turn, weakened in the drive. LITTLE TOE forwardly placed early toward the inside, fell back after a quarter while
in some traffic, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. TIN ROOF RUSTED raced in mid pack early and within striking distance, had nothing
for the drive. DOMINANTE moved up to clear early, set the pace, gave way when headed.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF'S MACHINE bumped start, allowed the pace to go early, raced in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, dropped to the inside and
challenged along the rail midway on the final turn, quickly clear into the lane, not threatened in the drive under steady handling. DRILLING REPORT broke
sharply, quickly sprinted clear into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, allowed the winner the inside midway on the final turn while getting out,
continued to get out late in that bend carrying PUTTHEHAMMEREDOWN well out in the strip, outkicked that rival for the second spot while proving no
match for the winner. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN closest to the leader toward the inside, closer before a half, challenged that same foe into the far turn from
the outside, carried very wide turning for home, could not get back to the runner up late, far clear for the show. SINGASONGSAM went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. DUCHESS OF ARABI remained always back. REPOSADO bumped with the winner at the start to be last away,
was well beaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN TURNING FOR HOME, DRILLING REPORT WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
WOMAN WITH A BOOK outrun for six furlongs while toward the inside, roused on the outside for the drive, bid, late duel, best in a game effort.
DREWPOWER settled off the pace and the inside, advanced three wide in the second turn, collared the leader just as the winner was approaching inside
the furlong marker, dueled late with that one closest to the inside, outfinished, clearly second best. COPPER FIDDLE sprinted clear soon after the start to
set the pace, continued to show the way up the backstretch, through the final turn and upper stretch, briefly responded when confronted by the top with less
than a furlong remaining then could not keep up, saved the show. ROYAL ROCKET off a step slow, raced back, displayed a moderate amount of late
interest to improve position. INCA WARRIOR forwardly placed, chased the leader off the inside the middle half, had little left for the stretch run. ATTA BOUY
lacked speed, failed to menace. SLAMMIN' MIKE was finished after a half. SHOWCASE MALL chased the early leader and began a steady fade after a
half. HALF MILE SPLIT UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. Race times added after video review

Footnotes
JAX MAN off the early pace and the inside, advanced into contention in the three path second turn, challenged nearing when straightened for home from
between rivals, dug on late to prevail in determined fashion. HALF A BITE broke on top, set the pace along the inside, headed far turn, continued to vie into
and through the stretch, held on stubbornly to prevail for the place while fully testing the winner. LOUISIANA HERO devoid of early foot, advanced four wide
and outside the winner in the second turn, challenged in upper stretch, vied past mistretch, not enough for the top two late. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE last
away, moved up to a forward position off the inside the opening quarter, pressed onto the backstretch, dueled outside the runner up into the far turn,
gradually weakened in the drive. SWEET AMELIA settled off the pace while in the two path, went evenly the final three furlongs in lacking a closing
response. MY TY FU PEG pressed the issue early, began to fade after four furlongs. SIR POKERFACE was never involved. SMOOTH CURRENT settled in
mid pack for a half and was finished.

Footnotes
IBEAM stalked the pace while racing outside, continued to race forwardly into the far turn, moved to challenge in the three path, gained the advantage upper
stretch, drove steadily clear. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke on top, forward early, steadied across a leader's heels midway on the first turn while moving
off the inside, advanced and dueled into and through the final turn, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one came alongside turning for home,
could not keep up the final turn, held the place. MUFFIN NUTS lacked early foot while four wide in the first turn, advanced four wide through the final turn,
finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. SPECIAL BINGO moved up quickly to contest the issue past the wire the first time, put the other early
speed away as the runner up was challenging just before a half, raced on equal terms with that one through the final turn and began to tire upper stretch.
LES PAUL last to leave, raced back off the back early, moved to the inside and improved position by saving considerable ground through the second turn,
flattened out a bit in the late going to finish up evenly. HALF PIPE in the second flight early, remained within striking distance the middle half mile, came up
empty in the drive to also finish up one paced. GALLOPING BOOTS back early while five wide through the first bend, continued in the five path through the
second turn, had little left for the stretch run. GOING JAPANESE was never dangerous. IT'SMYLUCKYMOMENT in the main body in the run up the
backstretch in some traffic, tired in the drive. BING BING was finished early. ATTEMPTED SIN remained always back while showing little.
RAMOSONECLEVERCON narrowly set the early pace along the inside, stopped, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN LIAISON in the second flight outside, came three wide into the lane, brush, steered out slightly upper stretch, finished with good late energy to
prove best. SNOWBALL settled in mid pack, came into the stretch inside the winner and between foes, brushed with that foe upper stretch, dropped inside,
bid, led, outkicked late. SABER CUT broke back, lacked speed, circled six wide in to contention turning for home, lost some ground to the top two, set down,
finished willingly to be well clear of the others while not a serious threat to the top pair. SHESTHECATSMEOW away in good order, narrowly showed the
way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn, shook off the other speed to be briefly clear exiting the bend then began to falter when confronted by the
top two soon after. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS in the second group between foes early, dropped inside turn, moved closer along the rail late in the bend,
steadied briefly a quarter mile out and then tired through the stretch. RED RED WINE set or forced the pace four a half in the two path and faltered.
KRAFT'S RATE off a step slow, trailed much of the way in remaining back. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS was always outrun. SARAH'S PASSION chased the
dueling leader up the backstretch and through much of the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MANE PRIORITY away well from the outside, raced with the pace, clear by late in the turn well off the inside, continued to show the way past the furlong
marker, dug in late to turn back a bid from the runner up to prevail in determined fashion. GEAUX GOLDEN broke sharp, set the early pace inside, fell back
off the winner while continuing to save ground late in the bend, rebid late rail, outkicked. TENACIOUS FAITH lacked early foot off the inside, raced three
wide through the turn, steered out in upper stretch, finished well while too late outside the top pair. EYE ON THE LADIES within striking distance early while
along the inside, lacked a closing response. CONSPICUOUS LINE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly in the stretch to
be also found lacking late. RARE ONE went one paced throughout. MISSBUDLITELIME forwardly placed four three furlongs, tired in the drive. TWO BAD
SISTAS was never a factor while racing outside. ZUMBERTA forced out at the start, lacked a bid while racing off the inside. SHADESOFGRAYMISS in tight,
steadied at the start, remained always back. GABY VEE trailed far back in showing little, jogged in.
