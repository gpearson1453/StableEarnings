Footnotes
ICE CHEST broke awkwardly and lost a bit of ground, steadied at the rail on the first turn, moved up at the rail on the far turn in a three lhorse duel and led
from the quarter to home. IT'S GAME TIME pressed the leader on the backstretch, was rebuffed, came on again to duel three wide on the turn and got by
faltering horses late to get the place. SMART AND BROKE ran far back to the turn, then made a good advance at the rail all the way home to earn show.
AGGRO CRAG (IRE) broke sharp, rode the rail on the lead, responded to pressure from a foe on the backstretch, dueled inside a pair on the far turn, lost
the lead then faltered at the eighth pole. MR ZYDECO was gapped off the leaders, ran widest on the backstretch, angled in to the rail for the far turn, and
faltered at the eighth pole. FAT MAKER contended to the far turn, was swamped between advancing horses and dropped back. ANOTHER EXPERIENCE
was rank on the first turn, shaken up and wide on the far turn and very wide into the stretch. GET SOME MUNEY flipped in the paddock and was deemed a
scratch by the veterinarian.

Footnotes
LADY VOODOO tracked the leader, fought past that horse in upper stretch and held off a closing foe in deep stretch. PATTI PATTI PATTI chased the pace
off the leader, dove inside in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch, and finding room was game but unable to catch the winner. QUEEN OF CORONA was
last in a strung out field, urged on the turn, and lacked a needed rallly. ROSEBUD'S TIGER led off the rail, was headed at the three sixteenths pole, fought
the challenge but leveled out.

Footnotes
BARTON HALL lacked room between horses at the start, raced unhurried, advanced on the turn, was floated out in the stretch by a foe, and closed fast to
beat a game horse late. STRELLA'S WAR raced mid pack, made a good middle move on the far turn, led at the eighth pole and was nailed late.
SWEEPENO was unhurried to the stretch and gained show past the eighth pole. MORE COWBELL dueled from the backstretch to deep stretch and
faltered. TRICKY TUNE led on the backstretch, dueled nearing the far turn and falterd in the strretch. ARGENTINIAN ROOTS (IRE) was last and gained
position in the stretch. HOOSIER GOLD CASE moved up inside in the stretch, but was no threat. BALLYBRACK LASS contended to the far turn, was urged,
but lacked a strong finishing rally. GRAMS REVENGE dropped out before the far turn. DETOUR was well placed inside off the lead, but dropped back on
the far turn. ULTRA RAYS stalked, then dropped away nearing the half mile pole.

MISS VICKI sprinted to a comfortable lead, rider sitting chilly to the stretch, roused to the furlong maker and geared down through the final sixteenth while
much the best today.. ABOGADA perfect position to the stretch but proved clearly no match for winner. MALEFICENT QUEEN sat well off the leaders to the
far turn and only raced along for show. TENACIOUS SALLY never a factor throughout from outside in the stretch run. NOOK good position to the half but
went empty and dropped far back. KARA'S ANGEL chased leader to the half, started a descent from there and jogged to the wire and walked off.

HYNDFORD was hustled out of the gate, ran behind a dueling trio on the turn, moved up on the rail in the stretch and was all out to hold off foes. IN A FOG
stalked, bumped a horse near the turn, dueled between horses on the turn, was inching forward on the winner in deep strretch, and just missed.
JENNYSREGALMAN led, dueled inside two foes on the turn, shifted out for room in upper stretch and was game but unable to overcome the top pair.
FIGHTING FOR GRACE was off tardy, ran well back and closed to improve position in the stretch. LET'S RIDE was widest on the backstretch and ran even.
STATELY OAK bumped a horse nearing the turn, dueled three wide on the turn and faltered in the stretch. DUJAC was no threat.

TRICKIZAR sharp speed from rail, led every pole while under pressure and held sway to the wire in a game effort. SPEARETTE hustled along from the
gate, bothered a bit and dropped back, made a wide run and gaining fast in the stretch run gamely. MY DARK SECRET shuffled around after the start,
gamely came back and finished game in the final furlong. COUNTRY DREAMIN raced evenly from inside throughout, made a mild bid at the eighth pole but
came up empty. DICHOTOMY chased pace from outside to quarter pole and flattened out in the late going. LIBERTY FIRE dueled winner to the quarter
pole but had nothing left and gave in readily. ARCHIE'S GIRL broke sharp but backed up badly with no visible excuse.
