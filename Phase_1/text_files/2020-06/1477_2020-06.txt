HOTFOOT was rated stalking just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane to bid for command, then kicked clear leaving
midstretch under steady hand urging. BUSHROD hopped at the start, quickly recovered, then was urged to terms with the first flight prompting the pace
three deep racing into the turn, couldn't match the winner late but edged a rival for the place honors. UNCLE GOYLE broke sharply, angled inwards forcing
the pace outside a rival, pressed the issue between foes into the turn to upper stretch but weakened in late stages. SNOOSE GOOSE, urged along the rail
pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, steadily faded in late stages. SERENGETI CAT settled last along the inside tracking the leaders from out of
striking distance early but never gained contention. Race times omitted pending review.

Footnotes
CORRANA EN LIMEN broke readily, attended the pace racing to the turn conceding some position to the leader, advanced nearing the lane to press the
issue, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. GATITO tracked off the first flight outside foes, swung out
four wide racing into upper stretch and bested the remaining field. MINISTER'S GLORY was settled last while angling inwards racing through the
backstretch, shifted off the inside to split foes entering the lane and continued well enough just off the inside to prevail for a share. CLIFTON BEACH, urged
to dispute the pace on a narrow advantage just off the inside racing to the turn, dueled for command inside the winner into upper stretch and gave way.
BEVOLUTION, forwardly placed along the inside, faded into the stretch. LOGAN'S HEROE tracked off the first flight between foes and gave way racing into
the lane. DOUBLETURBO WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE BY ORDER OF THE STEWARDS ACTING ON THE ADVICE OF THE TRACK
VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA LUCKY bobbled at the start, was quickly righted, then urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the first turn, edged forward to a narrow
advantage after a half, dispatched EL TIZAR racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage to the end under firm encouragement. OVERLY
LUCKY tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight, conceded some position after a half, was prompted to advance shifting out three wide
nearing upper stretch, drifted out leaving midstretch but prevailed for the place honors. STITZY angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight,
briefly awaited an opening, then steadied out of tight quarters entering the far turn, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest to
prevail for a share. EL TIZAR, urged to terms with the eventual winner prompting the pace racing to the first turn, pressed the issue into the far turn and
faded in late stages. BIG FALCON ROCKET, forwardly placed between foes in the opening furlong, angled to the inside to track just off the first flight to the
backstretch, continued along the inside through the far turn and came up empty racing into the lane. BYE BYE BENNIE settled outside foes dropping well
off the leaders, was fanned four wide into the lane but offered no rally. TALENT AND TRICKS ducked inwards at the start, settled well off the leaders and
proved no threat. BREEZE E PRADO settled along the inside in the opening half and never seriously menaced. MAS TAKELA, shuffled back out of close
quarters at the start, trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
WILD MUNNY vied for command between foes from the outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into the turn, went clear nearing the stretch
while coming under pressure to extend the advantage and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided. FAIRLY HONEST tracked just off the first
flight near the inside in the opening stages, switched out four wide racing into the turn and continued with interest to prove best of the others. WESTERN
ATTIRE broke sharply, prompted the pace four wide racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the turn and gave way entering the lane
while continuing well enough to earn a share AWESOME SUNSET settled last in the opening stages and never gained contention. ALOTTA SOUL was
urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. HEIGHTEN was urged three deep between foes pressing
the pace to the turn, steadied out of tight quarters midway through the turn and quickly emptied out.

AFTER RED SUN tracked off the first flight flight between rivals in the opening half, shifted three wide entering the far turn advancing on the leaders, bid for
command three deep racing into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm encouragement. GINGER ROSE joined the pace three wide racing to the
first turn, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch while edging forward to a narrow advantage but was collared late. LADY
ORCHID settled in the last flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out four wide racing through the far turn and continued
willingly in that path into the lane to prevail for a share. BEACH GETAWAY, forwardly placed along the rail, conceded the lead after a half, steadied out of
close quarters entering the second bend, came around a rival to bid inside foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked. TIZ LITTLE BULL, rated along
the inside tracking off the first flight, switched off the inside gaining position between foes nearing upper stretch, then altered course racing through the
stretch while lacking a path from which to challenge through the final furlong. RUMPLEMINX, urged between rivals prompting the pace into the backstretch,
angled to the rail racing into the far turn while moving to gain a brief advantage but gave way racing into upper stretch. DICEY dropped out early. Race

advancing on the first flight, bid for command three deep racing through the far turn, went clear under right handed pressure and was gathered up nearing
the wire. DON'S FINAL FINAL, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command inside the
winner through the second bend but soon proved no match while best of the others. SUMMERTIMER settled last racing to the backstretch, saved ground to
the lane and made an effort to improve position late. RAHAAL tracked off the first flight along the inside, switched out three, then four wide racing into the
lane but had no rally. CIAK, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening half, lodged a brief bid between the top pair racing through the far turn
but proved empty in the drive. BLACKS FERRY ROAD tracked off the first flight three, then four wide to the far turn and offered no rally. WEAL tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight but emptied out after a half.

SHANNON C vied for command between foes from the outset, gained a narrow advantage while angling to the rail entering the turn, then gamely held his
rivals into the stretch to prevail under firm handling. MISTER BANJOMAN, urged to terms with the leaders along the inside in the opening three sixteenths,
was eased off the first flight while shifting out racing into the turn, angled four wide entering the lane and continued with a steady effort to challenge the
winner late but proved only second best. SUPERIOR'S BOY tracked off the first flight along the inside from just out of striking position, steadily drew into
contention while advancing between foes entering upper stretch to challenge between foes but was outkicked by the top pair. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS
joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, continued to prompt the eventual winner into the turn and gave way entering upper stretch. SHADES OF
VICTORY settled last, saved ground throughout but failed to menace. THE SEVENTH RACE WAS DELAYED DUE TO HEAVY RAIN.
