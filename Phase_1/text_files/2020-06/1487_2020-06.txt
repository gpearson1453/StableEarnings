Footnotes
PALTARREVENGE stalked the pace for a half, surged past rivals three wide before the far turn, quickly opened a daylight lead, drifted out through the
stretch to the eight path and prevailed under strong right handed urging. FATHER DENNIS unhurried early, rallied determinedly in the seven path through
the stretch and got up for second by the narrowest of margins. B DUBYA trailed far back into the far turn then closed fast in the middle of the racetrack. RED
CHILL never far back, inched closer in the four path on the far turn then came up empty. ISTILLGOTIT vied for the lead three wide led between calls before
a half and gave way in the stretch. LIL MATEO was no threat. TUBA away alertly, set a pressured pace around the clubhouse turn, was headed, came on
again nearing the half mile marker, had speed into the far turn then flattened out. CHASING THE STARS prompted the early pace between horses and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
CUTLER was well handled whiled drifting out a bit at the start, quickly made the lead, set all the pace and lasted under right handed urging. VAN DAMME
never far back, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and got up for second. MAKE THE RULES stalked the pace and finished with good
courage between horses in the four path. DARINGLY BOLD unhurried early, shifted out to the five path at the top of the stretch then passed tiring rivals.
KING VALERO failed to menace. FAT DADDY well placed, failed to respond. SLANTED TRUTH chased the winner into the stretch then gave way. PER
OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-046D, DATED 10/03/2020. CUTLER WAS DISQUALIFIED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

missed hanging on. OFTEN ENOUGH settled mid pack, closed four wide through the stretch, altered inward late but was outfinished. NEVANS well placed,
failed to respond. FASTEST MAX away alertly, set the pace from the four path then along the inside into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DECADENT DOC pressed the pace two wide to the quarter pole then gave way. GRAND KITTEN bumped at the start and was no threat. OUR PETITION

NICKY TWO SHOES stalked the top pair from the eight path down the backstretch, dropped inside on the turn, slipped through with a rapid move to make
the lead at the quarter pole, shook clear and lasted under strong handling. LATIN SPICE prompted the pace from the seven path two wide, angled in on the
turn, was bumped hard by BRILLIANT HOURNEY in upper stretch nearly unseating his rider and was steadily gaining ground late in the six path. UPTOWN
never far back, closed a gap late along the inside. BRILLIANT JOURNEY broke n front, set the pace in the six path down the backstretch, angled into the
twp path on the turn, ducked out at the top of the stretch bumping hard with LATIN SPICE then faded. TRIBUTE TO TOM was no factor.
ROYALANDTOULOUSE had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY AND AFTER REVIEW UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

PEANUTS PERFECTION matched strides for the lead two wide into the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a brisk
hand ride. BARITONE never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished clear for second. DR. ZARNETT with the second flight outside,
went evenly. HERE COMES KYLE settled with the second flight in the four path, bid between horses in upper stretch then was outfinished. LABYRINTH
failed to menace. SKYTOWN CAT was no factor. ZEROED IN contested the lead along the inside to the quarter pole then weakened. JAMAICAN MAGIC
was through early. Fractional times unavailable due to timer malfunction. Final time was hand timed

Footnotes
DESIGNATE never far back, surged in the three path through to turn, made the lead in upper stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the
best under right handed urging. LIGHTNING MISS chased the pace the entire trip, dug in late in the four path and gained second. GUN THING unhurried
early, found her best stride late in the five path. CINS BOSS broke inward bumping BIONDETTA, sprinted to a clear lead, set the pace int the stretch then
tired. LUTZY LU passed tiring rivals. BIRDSTAR checked between horses past the five furlong marker then had speed into the turn and gave way.
BIONDETTA was bumped at the start, closed up for a half then weakened. BETTER VIBES had brief speed.
