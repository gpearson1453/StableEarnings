Footnotes
DOBY raced along the rail the entire race drifted out inside the sixteenth and the rider was in close contact with the rider of Six Cider. After an objection the
stewards ruled that the rider had interfered with the rider of Six Cider and Doby was placed second. SIX CIDER was along the inside on the turn came out
for the drive and then drifted in a bit through the stretch was in tight quarters with Doby and the stewards ruled that the rider of Doby had impeded the efforts
of the rider on Six Cider and Six Cider was moved up to first. FOREST TREASURE showed good early speed in the two path but could not go with the top
two in the final stages. CHOCOLATEICECREAM made a mild bid mid track while never a serious threat to the top three. BLUE TWISTED STEEL was well
back early and had no rally. POPCORN FOR EDDIE was up close to the leaders but faded on the turn. GOLD LABEL lost all chance at the break spotting
the field six lengths and was never a factor.

EYES ON BEHOLD showed good early speed along the inside and edged clear through the stretch. NATIVE BLOOM raced three wide battling for the lead
and was outfinished in the final eighth. SARAH'S STAR showed good early speed between rivals but could not match strides with the top two through the
lane. SWEET AS CARO was well off the pace and made a mild bid through the lane while no threat to the top pair. TOP OF THE PODIUM was making a
move along the inside but was forced to check going into the turn losing ground came back a bit in the stretch in a game effort. LA BELLE AURORE was
always well back and never a serious factor. WASTING MONEY was well off the pace and never mounted a rally. LISTEN SISTER was away slow then
rushed along the inside and came to a stop on the turn.

Footnotes
CASUALITY showed the best early speed and was able to get to the inside opened a good lead in the stretch and just held under a strong drive. JOHNNY
RAY angled out for the stretch drive and found his best stride inside the eight pole and just missed. HE COULD raced midpack then made a move when the
leaders tired and was up for third. CHUCKMATE had the perfect ground saving rail trip to get into contention but tired in the stretch. DANI'S CHOICE made
a three wide bid on the turn to get into contention but tired in the lane. BRETT'S BOY raced in the two path on the turn angled out for the drive but had little
to offer. REVERSALOFFORTUNE raced in the two path and had no rally. SHAWNEE KID was always towards the back and had no rally. MALONE was
wide while well back and could not make up ground. BOURBON PRIDE trailed throughout and was never a factor.
