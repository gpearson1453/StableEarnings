Footnotes
WELL PRO broke readily, was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, took over racing into the stretch and kicked well clear in the closing stages under
firm hand urging. PASSTHECAT angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, shifted to the four path nearing midstretch and edged a rival for the place
honors late. ROVERTON, off a step slowly, recovered to track off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, shifted three wide nearing the lane while
being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final kick. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA, off slowly, tracked the leaders three deep in the last flight racing
into the turn and improved position outside foes late. SHE GLITTERS broke sharply, was urged along the inside disputing the pace through the turn and
gave way in the drive. FIFTHTOWNFLUSH tracked off the second flight between foes into the turn and lacked a rally. C D THUNDER made brief pursuit of
the leaders inside foes but soon retreated.

Footnotes
SLEEPY TURTLE broke readily, angled inwards pressing a rival's pace, edged forward nearing upper stretch, shook clear and was kept to firm
encouragement. PURPLE MONSTER tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane closing the gap on the leader,
drifted out under left handed pressure in late stages and bumped RAJA'S APPEAL on the wire while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. RAJA'S
APPEAL tracked off the second flight racing four wide into turn, found his best stride in that path in the last furlong to close the gap and was bumped at the
wire. SIOUX VALLEY, urged along racing three deep as part of the second flight racing into the turn, faded in late stages. SEANSHINE broke readily, was
urged along the rail disputing the pace through the turn and gave way in the drive. DIRECT IMPACT broke slowly and never gained contention. CAPTAIN
OF SUMMER dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED
PURPLE MONSTER FOR INTERFERENCE PLACING HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
ANGELINA'S HEAVEN raced unhurried while caught five wide into the first turn, made steady progress outside foes on the backstretch, took over racing
into the second bend while angling inwards, went well clear and was kept to firm encouragement. RIGHT ON BY, urged to a forward placing along the
inside, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner along the inside to the lane and proved best of the others. TROPHY BRIDLE was rated between
foes in the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and continued well enough to gain a share. DIGGER HEELS IN,
urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch on a narrow advantage, briefly contested the issue inside the eventual winner into the
second bend and gave way. REAL DE JALPA tracked off the second flight along the inside and offered no rally. A KISS GOODNIGHT settled last to the
backstretch, split foes racing into the lane but made no impact. BANKER NITA, urged to brief contention four wide between foes racing to the backstretch,
gave way early. REMARKABLE CHARM switched out three deep racing to the backstretch making brief pursuit of the leaders but was through after a half.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S FLOWER'S, urged between foes to gain terms with the pacesetter, angled to the rail racing through the backstretch dueling for command, edged
forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch while drifting out to the three path but continued with a steady late response to maintain the advantage
under pressure. MRS. D'S CONCERTO broke readily, attended a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue through the turn, was
floated to the four path racing into upper stretch, continued to press the issue to the end but was outfinished. MIN FREYA tracked off the first flight four wide
racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted inwards to bid inside the leaders nearing midstretch but couldn't gain terms with those foes while edging
a rival for a share. CATERINA IANO, urged to position three wide between foes in second flight in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the
lane but had no final kick. HANALEI SUN tracked the pace between foes just off the inside in early stages, swung four wide nearing upper stretch but had
no late response. EXTRA CHROME settled off the second flight along the inside but never gained contention. MS COMEDY TIME tracked the leaders five
wide early and soon retreated. BLUES TOUCH was settled last early and trailed the field to the stretch. DAVIDSDERBYDAYGIRL, urged to position inside
rivals in second flight in the opening quarter, gave way early.

Footnotes
TABIA, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to prompt the pace along the rail, took over nearing the far turn, opened a clear advantage nearing upper
stretch, lost some momentum to be headed midstretch but responded to stout right handed pressure to regain a clear advantage. IMA HARLEY TOO, urged
to the lead between foes racing to the backstretch, lost the advantage racing into the far turn, continued with a grudging effort to challenge the winner
midstretch but proved no match late. SHIPMAN'S SONG tracked off the first flight to the backstretch, gained position between foes on the far turn, angled
inside entering the lane and edged a rival for a share. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, made brief progress four wide
into the far turn but had no late bid. FLANAGAN settled between foes, swung out four wide entering the lane but had no rally. TRI SPOT settled last, angled
to the rail entering the backstretch to make some brief progress racing to the far turn but proved empty in the drive. FRIDLEY, forwardly placed three wide
prompting the pace, gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
CIRCLE ME BERT broke sharply, angled in dictating the pace on a narrow advantage just outside rivals racing into the turn, widened the advantage on the
turn and drove clear. GONE CRUISING tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight, found his best stride racing past midstretch and edged
a rival for second. MY EASY CASH, urged between foes prompting the pace, was held up momentarily while switching outside foes racing past the half mile
marker, continued in pursuit of the winner three deep into the lane and was just collared for second. SERYY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, gave
way into upper stretch. SAMMY'S NUGGET settled between foes in early stages, split foes four wide racing into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane,
shifted out avoiding CLARK AND ADDISON midstretch and gained some position while making no impact. R DEJA VOO angled inside tracking off the first
flight racing to the turn but lacked a closing response. CLARK AND ADDISON ducked out at the start impeding GONE A LIL LU HU, was righted to race
between foes off the second flight, swerved out in late stages and proved empty. FIERCE HE BE, shuffled back at the start, failed to menace thereafter.
GONE A LIL LU HU, pinched back at the start, never gained contention. EMMETT CAT, urged to brief contention four wide, faded after a half. STONE
COLD HEART tracked off the second flight three wide between foes but retreated early.

TUT'S REVENGE broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside racing to the far turn, shook clear racing into the stretch and was kept to pressure. ALL
UNDER CONTROL tracked just off the pacesetter near the inside racing into the far turn, switched out entering the lane but proved only second best.
BUCKYS PICK, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, weakened into the stretch. SCOOTER'S BOY settled well off the field and
never gained contention.

NEVERBLINK tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in the opening stages, steadily gained on that rival nearing upper stretch, contested the
issue in a protracted skirmish past midstrech and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. FLORIDA TWO STEP broke sharply, dictated the pace on
a narrow margin between foes just off the rail racing into the turn, grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. MR. COUGAR settled last early,
split foes racing into the turn and continued evenly while prevailing for a share. JIMMY'S MARCO, urged inside rivals prompting the pacesetter into the turn,
gave way nearing midstretch. SHATTERED DREAMS was a brief factor four wide in second flight early but soon retreated. VIVACE was urged between
foes in pursuit of the leaders in the opening quarter but dropped out early. Per Ruling #C20064 from the Minnesota Racing Commission Florida Two Step is
Dq'd due to a positive test.
