Footnotes
JIMMY TWO TIMES away in good order, vied early between rivals, narrowly showed the way through the turn well off the inside, three path into the lane,
shook clear, kept to task late. MIZSPELT raced off the early pace while racing outside, was floated four out to five wide turning for home, lost some ground
to the winner as a result, set down, finished willingly to be getting to that rival late. EXTRAPOLATOR broke with the leader, shuffled back along the rail into
the turn, asked along through the bend, came three wide into the lane and rallied for the show. BEAUX VICTORY last away, raced back and off the inside,
four wide through the turn, improved position in the drive while remaining well out in the strip, outkicked late for the show spot. D'FESTIVE CAT lacked
speed, five wide into the turn, dropped inside for the drive, improved position a bit up the rail while not a serious threat. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY settled in
the second flight early, had little left for the drive. MR. CURLIN flashed brief speed out in the strip and gave way before a quarter. PICTURE PAYNTER
raced in mid pack early off the inside, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF CALEDON lacked early foot while under firm restraint early, moved out, advanced three wide to a forward position by late in the final turn,
dueled upper stretch, wore down that rival to edge away late. LOOKING FOR BULL in the second flight early inside, fell back the middle half, asked along in
the second turn, improved inside of traffic into the lane, continued willingly to the finish to earn the place late while remaining along the rail. MACANDALES
broke alertly, set the pace off the inside, gave ground grudgingly to the top two the final furlong. DON'T SPLIT TENS settled off the early pace and the
inside, four wide through the final turn, widest in the drive, bothered a furlong out then improved position late. FLATTER THE QUEEN vied early while
between the entrymates, chased the leader the middle four furlongs, was weakening in the drive when getting out with a furlong to run, finished up evenly
after being straightened. TAKE CHARGE CHASE broke a bit awkward, trailed four six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. HANDSOME HARVE four wide through the first turn when off the pace, advanced to race closest to the leader with a middle move before a half,
vied through much of the final turn before faltering in the drive. TRAPPER PEAK forwardly placed early along the inside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
WICKED CITI broke with the leaders, cleared out of the chute, in hand while continuing to daylight the field up the backstretch, cruised through the turn,
widened through the stretch without being asked for his best. TRAELEE in tight at the start, raced back early advanced three wide through the turn to be
closest to the winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, clearly much the best of the others. LUCKY BIG DADDY brushed
start, went one paced throughout off the inside, no match top two, narrowly lasted for the show. HOPE FOR CHANGE back off the pace along the inside
early, moved out in the turn, set down for the drive, improved slightly, missed the show. SECRET VISTA off a bit slowly, trailed most of the way and was
never a factor. HOUSTON PIPE chased the runaway winner for a half and stopped.

Footnotes
IZZY'S BABY BOY void of speed outside, remained well back through the turn while well out in the course, fanned six wide into the straight, closed with a
rush to be up in time. MIDNIGHT BAYOU in mid pack early, moved closer toward the inside into the lane, cut off, altered course to the outside, late bid
between rivals, missed. OUACHITA pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, showed the way past the furlong marker,
came in to take a hole away from the runner up then could not contain the top two late. LA CLEVER lacked speed outside, raced three wide through most of
the turn, four path into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. CUSTOM READY off a step slow, raced back early, improved position
along the inside into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. BROADWAY JONES broke with the leaders, raced within striking distance in the second
flight early off the inside, fell back turn, not a threat in the drive. SEELEY pressed the issue early, fell back into the second flight turn, fanned five wide while
inside the winner turning for home, lost position then picked up a couple of rivals late while not a serious threat. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER with the pace for
three furlongs along the inside, continued to vie into the straight, faltered. GOLDEN PALACE broke back and was never a threat. I'M LOOKING UP in mid
pack for three furlongs off the inside, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
HEZANOTHERCORREDOR came in soon after the start to tighten up a couple of rivals into the first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch, moved out,
ranged up to challenge three wide into the lane, bothered slightly a furlong out, finished with good determination to prove narrowly best while drifting in late.
NOCOMET pushed out a bit at the start, bothered, slight steady when in tight entering the first turn, fell back a bit, moved out and advanced toward the fore
three wide before a half, vied between horses and inside the winner turning for home, bothered by a lugging winner with a furlong remaining while in turn
being forced out into the winner, was straightened, drove to the wire while remaining between horses, outkicked in the final stages to miss.
FLASHLIGHTSECURITY broke alertly, cleared toward the inside soon after, set the pace inside, responded when the top two challenged exiting the final
turn, lugged out to bother that pair past the furlong marker, held on stubbornly while remaining closest to the inside of the top flight. RUNCIMAN in tight,
checked up along the rail into the first turn, settled off the pace and went evenly to the wire, nothing for the top three late. C F JOHNATHAN lacked speed,
made little impact. UNBRIDLED PULPIT off slowly, remained always back. SWEET SUGAR RAY off slow, was used to move up and contest the pace for a
half, gave way far turn, well back at the end.

MISTY DAY fractious while loading, broke back, lacked speed toward the inside, continued to save ground turn, finished willingly up the rail to prove best.
SHE'S GONE D'WILD lacked speed inside, moved out three wide when straightened for home, challenged late outside, outfinished. MISS JAMIE broke
well, sprinted clear soon after, set the pace in the two path, garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, allowed the winner the rail soon after,
could not match that one late nor contain the runner up. KEEP AMERICA GREAT broke back, moved up into a forward position toward the inside the
opening furlong, under firm restraint into and through the turn, moved out for the drive, came up empty when asked. EXPLOSIVELY HOT in the main group
up the backstretch outside, continued four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick when set down for the stretch run. ARCTIC GUITAR void of early foot
in trailing, failed to muster a closing response. UNDENIABLY DEVINE in the second group early off the inside, fell back through the turn and did not
contend. POPS SHANGHAI broke alertly, chased the leader for three furlongs then gave way in the drive.

NOSHACKLESHERE broke on top, set the pace inside, shook off a pair of rivals into the stretch, kicked well clear. MINI CHUNK broke back, raced three out
to four wide through the turn, rallied well out in the strip to earn the place, no threat to the winner. C'MON VE forwardly placed off the inside, moved to
challenge three wide late in the turn, briefly vied then could not keep up with the winner, could not contain the runner up, fully extended to save the show.
RIDE TO THE WIRE closest to the winner early off the inside, advanced and challenged between rivals turning for home, fell back to chase the that same
rival past the furlong marker then faltered. CHRISTOPHER CAT raced in mid pack, raced three wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive. C C HARRIS
settled off the pace, had little for the drive. MAKING A MARC last to leave, never menaced. I RATE FIRST tired while racing three wide. BLACK JUSTICE
was finished early while five wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
FORESTDUNGONE broke on top, set the pace along the inside, dueled far turn, kicked clear in the drive under steady handling. HIDEAWAY HERO settled
off the pace for a half toward the inside, raced in some traffic when beginning to advance second turn, continued willingly up the inside to be in time for the
place, not a threat to the winner. RESILIENT RICK last to leave, raced back for six furlongs, rallied four wide into the lane, finished well but was outkicked
late for the place spot. KING SNIPER chased the winner early, engaged that one from the outside the middle half mile, could not keep up in the drive,
weakened further late to lose a couple of positions. SON OF A SAINT void of early foot, continued to trail well back into the far turn, came four wide into the
straight, displayed a moderate amount of late interest to improve position slightly, no real threat. WHAT POWER forwardly placed in the early going along
the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. INDEPENDENT WORKER in the main body off the inside, in some traffic between foes onto the
backstretch, continued between rivals into the far turn, came up empty for the drive three wide. MR. GRACEFUL forwardly placed off the inside, moved
closer before a half, pressed into the far turn and began to give way.

Footnotes
BELLA FALAYA off step slow, moved up steadily up the backstretch, challenged three wide out of the turn, took over, clear past the furlong marker, held the
runner up at bay in the late going under steady handling. MISS DAWN in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide into the stretch when moving a bit
closer, chased the winner past the furlong maker, could do little with that rival late, clearly second best. TEN TAP DANCES broke in good order, vied in the
two path and between foes turn, closest to the inside into the lane, could not keep up with the top two in the drive, saved the show. MISS MABELEE void of
early foot, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position without posing a serious threat. MYSTIC GEM moved up to contest the issue inside,
was beginning to tire when put in a bit tight entering the stretch, continued to weaken. SHOULDACOULDAWOULD with the pace for four furlongs in the
three path, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. TIZ DARBY raced back and never menaced. FLOATIE also remained always
back. CAUGHT HIS EYE tired while racing four wide.
