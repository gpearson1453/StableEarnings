Footnotes
NIFTY trailed under urging down the backstretch, advanced mildly in the three path around the turn, swung to the six path turning for home to circle the field,
commenced a rally while lugging in at the three sixteenths pole, then straightened course and drove past the inner tiring leader passing the furlong marker.
HORSE DOCTOR chased the pace from along the inside while under coaxing, shifted to the three path while inside of rivals and behind the leaders in upper
stretch, was no match for NIFTY in midstretch, but produced a late kick to catch FREE ENTERPRISE at the wire for place. FREE ENTERPRISE dueled
inside of MUCH BETTER through the early stages and around the turn, shook loose from that foe at the three sixteenths pole, but drifted outwards at the
furlong marker while being confronted by NIFTY, offered little resistance to that foe, then got nipped at the wire for place. MUCH BETTER dueled for the
lead outside of FREE ENTERPRISE around the turn, but was repelled by that foe in upper stretch, then kept on for a minor reward. TRAVELLING MIDAS
stalked three wide, but weakened between horses while in the four path turning for home. PRINCE PIERCE broke well, but was restrained and wrangled
back to sit off of the pace, stalked four wide outside of horses, but weakened in the five path turning for home.

Footnotes
LEAD GUITAR was off slowly, rated behind and among rivals far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path after straightening
into the lane, and swept past inner rivals passing the furlong pole while drifting inwards. BABY KARATS raced midpack inside of rivals, advanced by cutting
the corner turning for home, shifted to the three path in midstretch to split horses, but was outkicked by an outer foe inside the furlong pole, then kept on to
reach place approaching the wire. TULANIAN prompted the pace setter from the outside, forged an advantage into the turn when her counterpart broke
stride, dug in in upper stretch when that foe made an outside rebid, but gave way at the sixteenth pole. FASHIONABLE LADY swung to the seven path
turning for home and produced a mild kick for a minor reward. ELLE Z set the pace along the inside early on, but jumped a shadow into the turn causing her
to concede the lead, shifted to the two path and rebid for the lead turning for home, but weakened while being put to tight quarters between horses in the
late stages. KODIKOVA (IRE) was caught in the six path around the turn, and failed to make a bid. BENTLEY'S DREAM was forwardly placed three wide
between horses, but weakened into the turn. SHILAH BABY stalked two wide between horses, was rank behind and among rivals from the half mile pole to
the three furlong pole, made a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. LISTEN UP was forwarldy
placed four wide, but weakened in upper stretch. KILBARRY LADY was forwardly placed along the inside while behind ELLE Z, steadied slightly when that
foe jumped a shadow into the turn, moved inside of that foe, but brushed her approaching the five sixteenth pole, causing her own back end to slip out from
under her, lost many lengths due the incident and was eased.

Footnotes
TRIDENT HIT trailed early on, swung from the three path to the six path turning for home while rally, changed leads awkwardly at the three sixteenths pole
and bumped with BELFAST BOY, but sustained his rally through deep stretch to just get up at the wire. DARK WEB dueled outside of a pair of rivals, forged
an advantage and shifted two wide in upper stretch, dug in gamely under a long drive, but was nipped at the wire. INIS GLUAIRE bumped with BELFAST
BOY at the start, dueled inside a pair of rivals around the turn, dug in once headed in upper stretch before giving way in the final sixteenth. THE FEATURE
advanced into the turn to inside stalking position, saved ground turning for home before shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, but drifted out under left
handed pressure at the three sixteenths pole, then lacked a kick to make a bid. MINE THAT STAR advanced while four wide between horses after being put
to a drive into the turn, made a four wide bid turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch. CHASING ANNA prompted the pace four to five wide, but
weakened around the turn. BELFAST BOY bumped with INIS GLUAIRE at the start, saved ground far off of the pace before shifting to the five path turning
for home, but failed to surge through a non-existent hole between horses at the three sixteenths pole, bumped with TRIDENT HILL, then failed to rerally
afterwards. HIGH CRUISE was forwardly placed six wide, made a five wide bid for the lead turning for home, but weakened between horses at the furlong
pole. MULBERRY STREET saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail. WILLFRED dueled two wide between horses early on, but weakened
turning for home and faded. BOURBON TRAIL shifted down from the four to the two path into the turn, but weakened around the bend.

Footnotes
ALKHAATAM lied close up to the pace setter along the inside, shifted off of the rail and was driven in the three path between horse into the far turn,
produced a bid turning for home, forged clear approaching the furlong pole, and held firmly to the wire. BOURBON RESOLUTION shifted from the two path
to the five path into the far turn when LONE SAILOR advanced alongside, sustained a rally and produced a bid through midstretch, but did not have enough
to catch the leader. CORE BELIEFS inched forward into the far turn to be in range of the leader while in the four path, attempted a bid turning for home, but
failed to gain even terms before being outkicked in upper stretch, then kept on through the late stages for show. LONE SAILOR shifted to the six path into
the far turn to commence a rally between horses, then stayed on mildly through the lane, but did not have enough to reach fourth. SCARS ARE COOL was
off slowly after turning his head right before the gates opened, saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted off of the rail in midstretch, but lacked a kick to
split horses and produce a bid. MY SIXTH SENSE stalked two wide before taking over from the weakening early leader into the far turn, but was headed by
the eventual winner in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. RATED R SUPERSTAR took the first turn in the two to three path while far off of the
pace, came under a drive into the far turn. FLOWERS FOR LISA set the pace early on, but weakened into the far turn, subsequently stopped, and was
eased through the lane. ROILAND lagged well behind the field throughout in a dull effort.

Footnotes
FRONT MAN was bumped by a foe at the start, raced midpack, came under a drive between horses into the far turn, altered course to the four path
approaching the furlong pole, sustained a rally, and got up approaching the wire. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY broke outwardly, set the pace along the inside, drew
clear into the far turn, held an advantage through midstretch, but was caught inside the final sixteenth. TWO BY TWO was forwardly placed three wide,
came under a drive between horses around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid and finished up evenly. ALFONS WALDE (IRE) achieved perfect inside
stalking position early on, inched forward around the far turn, tipped off of the rail to make a two wide bid for the lead turning for home, but lacked a kick,
failed to keep pace with the leader at the furlong pole, and weakened in the final sixteenth. PEDDLERS PRIDE swung from the two path to the six path
turning for home, and produced a mild kick outside of rivals for a minor reward. CARMEL BAY prompted the pace setter two wide, vied between horses at
the five furlong pole, but came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn, failed to do so, and weakend. A. K. SAFARI took the first turn three wide in
midpack, was a bit keen turning into the backstretch, and failed to get involved. PIP'S BRASSY BOY broke in and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground
while far off of the pace, but to no avail. AHSAD was rank going five wide into the first turn, pulled keenly and advanced outside of rivals into the
backstretch, bid for the lead at the five furlong pole, but weakened at the half mile pole and faded around the far turn. FIFTYFIVE STRONG was pinched
back at the start and trailed throughout.
