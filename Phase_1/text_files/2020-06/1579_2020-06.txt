SANTA ANA WINDS bobbled at the start, chased the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive,
gained a clear advantage at the eighth pole and steadily drew away. SUMMER EXPRESS forced the early pace from the inside, crept closer entering the
second turn, responded along the rail entering the drive and was up for the place. FLAT OUT FLIRTY dueled from the outside early, battled up the
backstretch, remained forward for the drive but had nothing left. TAPIT BABY dueled from the inside and tired in the drive. Seven eights split time
unavailable due to a time malfunction.

early margin, remained forward entering the drive but could not keep pace. SECRET REDEMPTION chased the early pace outside, advanced through the
turn, responded but was too late. COME ON ARCHIE could only improve position. DISIDE could only pass tired ones. PRETTY GUILTY was no factor.
