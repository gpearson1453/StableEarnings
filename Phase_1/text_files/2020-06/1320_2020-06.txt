Footnotes
BUSTIN TO PLEASE remained towards the two path after the field had been sent off and running, kept watch within striking distance of the two front
runners vying for the top, got set down springing from the five-sixteenths marker, swung approximately five wide into the lane, kicked into her best with a
furlong remaining, finished with a rush in the final seventy yards to get up at the wire. BERTRANDA sparred for the advantage from the two path, tipped
wider and challenged in earnest from path three in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, fought her way to the top by a slim margin at the beginning
of the last eighth, edged away from the nemesis from that juncture onward only to get run down by the winner in the last jump. LETMETAKETHISCALL one
of the quickest out of the gate, retained a prominent position, was gradually worked over to the rail, getting there prior to the conclusion of the backstretch,
led by a slim margin with the second place finisher hitched up to the outside, was called upon for more a short distance beyond the quarter pole,
relinquished and was shaken off, stayed on for the show. MY LAST MILLION raced in midpack stationed in the two path, was under a ride spinning about as
wide into the lane, lacked the needed response. FLAT CALM brushed with FIRST FOREVER in the shadow of the starting gate, got guided over to the rail
right around the half mile pole, tracked the front runners, cut the corner into the lane and faltered. GENTLE ANNIE loped along in the two path, fanned out
into path six from upper to midlane, failed to menace. PEACHES AND SPICE two wide onto the turn, was one path farther off the rail exiting it, launched no
bids. FIRST FOREVER cut over to the rail shortly after making light contact with FLAT CALM right after the start, went on to save ground to no avail.
DRAGONESS hustled after breaking a half length the tardiest, raced three wide on the turn, finished off the half and folded.

Footnotes
REED KAN prompted the pace of LONG MAY YOU RUN from the outside three wide, remained patiently handled applying some pressure to that rival
before being roused when taking command swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the
finish to prevail. BITUMEN two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show
honors. CREATIVE STYLE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. VINEYARD SOUND chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. LAZARUS PROJECT four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along near the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. TALE OF MIST two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing midway on the turn, went four wide for
home and made no impact. LONG MAY YOU RUN coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed just off the inside under some pressure from
REED KAN to the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding command straightened away and weakened.

Footnotes
RHYTHM SECTION three wide on the chute, got steadied early on the backstretch after appearing keen, settled down in a more professional mode soon
afterwards, stepped onto the fuller turn still stationed in path three, inched up as three-quarters was being finished, waited briefly before committing to the
outside at the quarter pole, was in the four path heading on the top of the lane, responded when given his cue right afterwards, inhaled a battling trio to
emerge at the eighth pole as the new leader, edged away, then stayed in the clear, mainly hand urged late. ARITHMETIC secured the pocket slot soon after
the field had been sent off and running, patiently kept watch on the pace for three-quarters, was given its cue for the drive home, shifted into path four during
the opening half of the stretch run, rallied well thereafter to garner the place. MAKE A STAND underwent what was for the most part a three wide journey,
challenged in earnest entering the lane, was beaten by the winner for control, stayed on for the show. TORRES DEL PAINE brushed from both sides at the
start, took up the chase two wide from between foes for a majority of the opening six furlongs, got fanned out five wide for clearance stepping into the lane,
closed in mildly for the final significant slice of the purse. SUPER WICKED CHARM pinched at the start, made it over to the rail by the end of the chute,
tracked the front runners under patient handling, tipped out into the two path for the stretch drive, made no impact. KING OF RANCH brushed with another
after coming out slightly at the start, assumed the advantage and cut over to the inside, showed the way, with STARSHIP BUBBA in accompaniment in the
two path, spun into the lane under attack by an additional rival, succumbed and backed away. STARSHIP BUBBA stung out towards path three on the
chute, settled closer to the rail once on the backstretch, prompted the pace, issued up a bid from between rivals spinning into the lane, kept it up until
midstretch before giving way. PRETENDANT brushed at the start, was three wide entering the backstretch and nudged into path four leaving it, folded after
going six furlongs.

Footnotes
QUEENOFEVERYTHING just off the pace three to four wide in pursuit, advanced on the top pair through the latter portion of the turn and was set down
spinning just off the inside for home, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in tussling with the runner up to the sixteenth marker widening
away from the rest of the field as a pair before inching clear of that rival to prevail. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY prompted the leader from the outside two to three
wide, took over the front just inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths, dug in fighting on to the
finish widening away in tandem with the aforementioned foe from the rest, got shaken off herself inside the final sixteenth while well clear for the place
honors. LOTTIE'S MIZZION settled two to three wide at near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into
upper stretch, angled in towards the rail a furlong out and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. MANI PEDI coaxed from the gate, chased inside
early on before racing in pursuit two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved
position to the eighth pole, then got nailed near the finish for the show honors. WHISTLINGINTHEDARK tucked to the two path shortly after the start settling
near the rear, tipped four to five wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS bumped at the start by ON TO CINCINNATI, who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. LOVELY ESCORT chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the
turn coaxed along from midway, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. IDAKA broke in at the start bumping MOLLY'S SHRINK,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, went three wide for home and tired. FORTUNE'S GIRL hustled from the gate, showed the
way in hand along the inside under some pressure from CHARLOTTE WEBLEY to the outside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and yielded the
front just inside that station, got shaken off spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. KEEP DREAMIN coaxed from the gate, chased along
the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and folded in the stretch. HELEN BY NIGHT coaxed from the start, chased
just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. MOLLY'S SHRINK reluctant to
load, got bumped at the start by IDAKA who broke inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch
and tired. ON TO CINCINNATI broke out at the start bumping SHE'SFIRSTCLASS, chased four to five wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths,
continued four to five wide into upper stretch and never menaced. Due to an Equibase Teletimer malfunction, the five-eighths split was hand timed.

Footnotes
WEGETSDAMUNNYS settled into midpack after the start, stalked the pace while taking the two path, was switched over to stronger handling at the
five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the lane and took off after the ones to catch, chipped away at the deficit, continued onward relentlessly and with
good energy, eventually reeling in the duelers in the last jump. VORTEX ROAD away forwardly placed, established the top in short order, moved over to the
inside route, picked up the tempo significantly after NOOR SAHARA latched on during the setting of the second split, ventured onward with the
aforementioned rival in tow to the outside, was approaching the three-sixteenths pole when asked for more, vied with vigour in a spirited tussle the rest of
the way home, got nailed at the finish line. NOOR SAHARA (IRE) strung out three wide entering the clubhouse bend, worked out a tuck one path closer to
the rail a few strides later, prompted VORTEX ROAD to that opponent's right, kept watch within striking distance, got let loose stepping onto the head of the
stretch, saw a battle between them got ignited soon afterwards, went at it eye to eye with the second place finisher, ultimately had to settle for the show.
BEAU BELLE loosely pocketed, got roused approaching the quarter pole, managed to work its way into the three path from upper to midstretch, narrowing
in all the while with good momentum, gained readily on an embattled pair late, came up short. BEALE STREET chased the pace from the two path, swung
into the lane and lacked a solid closing punch. ELIADE (FR) at the back of the pack at the time, got steered into the two path as the run around the first turn
commenced, went over to the rail on the next bend, came three wide into the lane, had no offering. MISS MUNNINGS two wide during the initial stages,
travelled three wide on the far turn, was maneuvered into path five early during the stretch run, gave way. MATTY'S MAGNUM quickly spotted along the
inside route, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

and clung to the front stubbornly until headed a sixteenth out, then kept on for the show honors. VOICE OF SPRING five then four wide in pursuit, got

Footnotes
CHEWING GUM took up the chase from the two path, angled five getting roused for the drive home, closed in on the runner up during the ensuing furlong,
wrested away the advantage in the final seventy yards and edged away. SAYYAAF away without apparent mishap, had control established well before
leaving the backstretch, sailed along from just off the inside on an open lead, got called upon for the drive home, saw the top one whittle away at the deficit,
relinquished well inside the sixteenth marker. BACKTOHISROOTS took up position in midpack after the start, pursued the pacesetter from the two path on
the turn, swung four to five wide into the stretch, mustered up enough of a response to secure the show. IDENTITY POLITICS loped along for the initial half
while taking the inside route for a good portion of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, was forced to fan out into path six from upper to midstretch for
racing clearance, had a good finish down the center of the course, missed out on third. EXPLORATIONIST settled into the two path after the start, loosely
drafted behind SAYYAAF on the bend, came under a ride as the half was being completed, had no offering. VISION PERFECT spotted along the inside
route, got let loose coming into the lane, worked his way into the three path from upper to midstretch, had no gain. DIRTY rode the rail, never made its
presence felt. FORTUNE'S FOOL off the inside throughout, kept watch on the leader from path three on the turn, was slightly wider coming into the lane
having been asked for more run, was only making a minimal amount of headway at best when pinched in midlane, lost interest and backed away.

Footnotes
FUNNY GUY three then two wide in pursuit, tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, rallied up the
inside to take command over a trio a furlong out, then inched away to the finish kept to task. MR. BUFF bobbled at the break, recovered to settle four to five
wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes to the sixteenth marker and got the nod for the place honors on the wire. BANKIT two to three
wide at the tail of the field down the backstretch, tipped out four to five wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into
upper stretch and closed well to challenge through the final furlong while along for the show honors. BLEWITT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside, tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug
in under threat from a trio, got collared a furlong out and kept on to secure the last major share. BUILD TO SUIT chased three to four wide until tucked to the
two path through the turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PAT
ON THE BACK chased five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home
and weakened in the stretch. HONOR UP five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under
encouragement five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MY BOY TATE six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered. WHISTLING BIRDS
brushed the off side stall at the start, raced sluggish from the gate striding short and was placed to a protective hold, got pulled up in the vicinity of the
seven-eighths pole and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
SHAMROCKET pursued the runaway leader from the inside route, slipped to the outside after halfway around the far turn, came under a ride a sixteenth
later, angled four wide into the lane, gained ground readily, assumed the top in midlane and kicked clear. BAIL OUT sat loosely pocketed tracking the
unaccompanied TIZ ENVY, without benefit of being covered up, narrowed in late on the second bend as the pacesetter began to come back to the field, got
let out for the drive, launched a rail rally to procure the place. AMANO tucked along the rail after being in the two path on the opening bend, continued
towards the inside once onto the far turn, was moved to the outside for the drive home, until approximately four wide, mustered up a good response to
secure the show. ASTRONAUT stalked the pace from the two path, was given his cue spinning three wide into the lane, closed in rapidly, was taken in hand
after coming up too close to TIZ ENVY at the furlong grounds, gained a slim lead that was soon snatched away by the winner, flattened out. SANDRO THE
GREAT raced towards the inside until the midway point of turn two, was already being hand urged tipping to the outside, came about three wide into the
lane, lacked a solid closing punch. SEIZE THE HAY pursued the pace from the two path, went into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
RELIABILITY failed to fire off a ground-saving journey. TIZ ENVY was fighting the pilot hard refusing to rate heading off the homestretch, spurted off from
the two path, while continuing to pull on the bit, saw healthy lead get cut into late on the far turn, relinquished in midstretch and then steadily backed away.
STARE DECISIS at or near the inside until the head of the stretch, failed to respond when asked.
