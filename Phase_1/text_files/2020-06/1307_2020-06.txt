the final sixteenth under a strong hand ride. ROSETTA GRAY vied for the lead along the inside for a half, shifted out to the four path at the top of the
stretch, had a mild late rally and finished second best. BLANCONIA broke in front, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. STAR MABEE failed to
menace. PANAMANIAC pressed the pace into the turn then weakened. RIO BO was outrun. JEZABEL'S CHARM was never close.

PEGGY'S COVE close up from the start, split horses two wide past the quarter pole, rallied inside the leaders to make the lead in the three path at the
furlong marker and drew off under mild right handed urging. EXTRA SALSA never far back, surged three wide on the turn, drifted to the five path, led
between calls then was no match fro the winner. VALID INTEREST pressed the pace two wide into the turn, loomed boldly between horses past the quarter
pole, battled until mid stretch then was outfinished. DARING unhurried early, closed some ground late in the six path. MANHATTAN LADY failed to menace.
BLESSINGSOFLIBERTY stalked the pace from the inside into the turn then faltered. CONGREELY was outrun. ETHEL EILEEN sprinted to the lead near
the five eighths pole, set the pace to the quarter pole then stopped.

CHIEF BIG HEAD pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead, battled to the wire and proved best under strong handling in the four
path. GOLDEN AFLEET trailed down the backstretch, passed a rival outside on the turn, closed determinedly in the six path through the stretch and just
missed getting up in time. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED stumbled a stride out of the gate, shifted outside, loomed boldly four wide nearing the quarter pole,
battled the balance of the trip and was outfinished between rivals. LIME AND TEQUILA was unprepared for the start, rushed up the rail to contest the lead
before a quarter, battled into the stretch then was used up. CONNORRSKIE broke in front, matched strides two wide for the lead for a half then weakened.
CAPT BILLY BUD was through early.

GIANT'S WILLOW away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a hand ride. TROPICAL CYCLONE allowed
to settle, rallied late in the four path and got up for second. UNCLE CARLITO broke awkwardly and finished with good courage in the three path. PIRATE'S
TREASURE passed tiring rivals. VAUGHAN had good early speed then faded. SWIFT PUNCH stalked the pace to the quarter pole then gave way. FRIEND
OF DUBAI pressured the winner two wide for three furlongs then folded.
