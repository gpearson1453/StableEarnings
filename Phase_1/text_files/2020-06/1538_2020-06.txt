Footnotes
PURRFECTLY CLAIRE dueled for the lead outside of a pair of rivals early on, took over and assumed command from those foes turning for home, drew off
in upper stretch, then held safely under driving pressure. SOVEREIGN APPEAL saved ground while far off of the pace after coming under coaxing into the
turn, produced a rail rally in upper stretch to forge place from multiple outer foes at the furlong pole, and proved second best. RAISON D'ETRE tracked the
leading trio of duelers from along the inside, lost a few lengths worth of position into the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, came into the lane
behind a foe, shifted inwards to split foes approaching the furlong pole, but was only third best. LUCKY FIND trailed in the two path into the turn, shifted five
wide to produce a rally turning for home, but flattened out at the furlong pole. CURLS AND BOWS broke outwards, advanced from off of the pace in the
three to four path into and around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. TRACING GOLD dueled inside of a pair of rivals through the turn, but was no
match for the eventual winner at the quarter pole, then weakened between horses at the furlong pole. SEA GARDEN dueled two wide between horses early
on, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY pressed the pace setter from the outside, inched forward into the far turn to vie for the lead, forged an advantage at the five
sixteenths pole before assuming command in upper stretch, then held safe through the lane under driving pressure. DEGROM stalked the pace three wide,
forged place in midstretch, and proved second best. ALTITO raced far off of the pace in the two to three path around the turns, shifted to the five path
turning for home, then offered a late rally past tired rivals for a minor reward. EXEMPLAR shifted in down the backstretch to stalk along the inside, but failed
to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, shifted three wide between horses at the furlong pole, and kept on. HAWAAKOM saved ground while rating
off of the pace, attempted a rail rally through the lane, but failed to threaten. PARADE FIELD was caught in the four path around the turns, advanced slightly
around the far bend, but flattened out between horses in upper stretch. RED AGAIN set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at
the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then weakened at the three sixteenths pole. CURLIN GREY was outrun throughout
and showed little.

Footnotes
HEMP HEMP HURRAY saved ground through the turns while far off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, produced a rally between horses,
split the leaders at the sixteenth pole and a furious surge, and got up at the wire. ZERO GRAVITY trailed early on, advanced in the two to three path around
the far turn before shifting to the six path turning for home, rallied widest through the lane, but was outfinished by an inner rival. KURILOV (CHI) stalked
close to the pace along the inside, advanced into the pocket into the far turn, waited for racing room behind the leader turning for home, shifted two wide
and split rivals effortlessly in upper stretch, built a clear lead approaching the furlong pole, but tired late and was run down in approaching the wire.
LUSITANO vied two wide around the first turn while racing in the bit, took back to stalk at the nine sixteenths pole, made a three wide rebid around the far
turn and vied turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole. CLINT MAROON (GB) bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide,
shifted to the four path around the far turn, then came into the lane five wide, but was outkicked between horses at the furlong pole. NERO set the pace
along the inside, held an advantage turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole. RANSACK was bumped and crowded at the start between horses,
raced far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three to five path before swinging to the seven path turning for home, but failed to factor.
DISCOVERED broke inwards and prompted the pace three wide, got a bit keen into the backstretch, pulled forward while being shifted out to settle, bid for
the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and vied around the far turn, but weakened at the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
WHISKEY DOUBLE vied three wide between horses early on before his outer foe cleared the field at the half mile pole, stalked that loose leader three wide,
then two wide at the five sixteenths pole, inched closer turning for home while letting his inner foe off of the rail, bid for the lead three wide at the quarter
pole, then prevailed late under a long drive. MEDICINE TAIL cleared away from inner foes at the half mile pole, dug in holding an advantage in upper stretch
from multiple foes, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and was bested by an outer foe inside the final sixteenth. WINDCRACKER was forced in at the
start by an outer foe, was forwardly placed two wide, shifted from the four to the three path around the turn, then back to the four path turning for home,
sustained a rally to make a bid, but did not have enough to catch the leaders. NAUTILUS vied along the inside of a trio of foes early on before stalking the
loose leader into the turn, was allowed off of the rail turning for home and bid for the lead two wide between horses at the quarter pole, but failed to keep
pace with those rivals at the furlong pole, and lugged a bit inwards after. NOTARY vied two wide between horses early on, stalked the loose leader around
the turn, then kept on through the lane without threatening. HOLLAND was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide, and showed mild interest.
HALCYON DIGEST pulled forward and was hard to handle early on, tracked from midpack along the inside through the turn, then weakened at the quarter.
SAINT VRAIN broke inwards, saved ground in midpack, but was no factor. ENRAGED was outrun. MR. BANYAN trailed after a slow start, and was outrun.
RUN RABBIT saved ground off of the pace, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
AMANI'S EAGLE vied two wide early on before clearing his inner counterpart at the eleven-sixteenths pole, held a clear margin in hand in the two path
around the far turn, was let out a notch at the three sixteenths pole, and held his margin safely through the lane under mild urging. ASHIHAM hopped at the
start then stumbled upon landing, saved ground while trailing around the first turn, rallied in the three to four path around the far turn, sustained his
advanced to make a place bid in upper stretch, then prevailed over an inner game foe at the wire for that position without threatening the leader.
MULBERRY STREET was forwardly placed three to four wide around the first turn, took back to track from midpack into the backstretch, advanced in the
three path around the far turn to forge place between horses in upper stretch, then dug in gamely for that position inside of ASHIHAM through the lane, but
drifted in at the sixteenth pole and lost the photo for that placing. PIT BOSS was forwardly placed along the inside, but got outmoved by multiple outer foes
at the five furlong pole, advanced back to striking postion two to three path between horses around the far turn, was bumped and crowded between horses
four wide at the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane for a minor reward. ALL ABOUT WILL was far back two wide, and produced a mild rally.
BAKERS BAY vied along the inside around the first turn, but took back to stalk from the inside at the eleven-sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.
IT'S MANDATORY saved ground from midpack, but to no avail. TONALTALITARIAN had a slow start, pulled to midpack in the four to five path around the
first turn, but weakened into the far turn. BELFAST BOY was forwardly placed two to three wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

PARIS LIGHTS prompted the pace two wide, forged a lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, cleared in upper stretch, and widened her advantage under
driving pressure. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN set the pace along the inside, but was headed by PARIS LIGHTS at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match in
upper stretch, then kept on to be second best. CRAZY SEXY MUNNY was caught in the three to four path around the first turn, advanced in the four path
around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, then edged show in the late stages. TIPSY GAL was off a step slow, then forwardly placed two wide
and between horses, then kept on through the lane, but was outfinished for show. COLDWATER stalked three wide early on, but came under a drive to
keep pace around the far turn before weakening in upper stretch. SECOND COMING was far off of the pace two wide between horses around the first turn,
got keen turning into the backstretch, then took the far tun in the three path and failed to produce a rally. RIA MUNK was forwardly placed along the inside,
but weakened into the far turn. STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY got rank while far off of the pace into the first turn, settled into the backstretch, took the far turn two

Footnotes
TOM'S D'ETAT tracked the pace early on, stuck a nose in front near the three eighths pole, was in the five path into the lane then drew away late in the
stretch while ridden out to the wire. BY MY STANDARDS chased the pace early on, made a bid near the three eighths pole, was in the five path into the
lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run but was second best. SILVER DUST raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved
up in the stretch run. MULTIPLIER chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. OWENDALE raced
back early on, was in the five path into the lane and improved position. FEARLESS trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and improved
position in the stretch drive. PIRATE'S PUNCH set the pace early, was in the three path into the stretch and gave way down the lane. ALKHAATAM was
through after a half.
