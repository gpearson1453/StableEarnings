Footnotes
ATHENASWAY was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased out entering the second turn to make a three wide bid, drew clear entering the stretch, then
drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best while being kept to pressure. MICRO MARGARITA was three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace
setter down the backstretch, made a bid with the winner on the second turn, but proved to be no match for that rival, second best. PREMIUM MOTION
stumbled at the start, then raced four wide on the backstretch, came into the stretch four wide to be up late for the show. LA FLAMENCA set the pace on the
inside, then gave way after six furlongs, lost show late. HARD ROCKIN BLUES lacked a rally. GOLDEN CHANCE was allowed to settle three wide, but was
empty. UPPER CHARLIZE DS tracked the early pace, then was well placed towards the inside past the half mile pole but tired.

Footnotes
GLENGAR was rated back early, made a five bid in hand on the second turn then assumed command entering the stretch while moving over towards the
inside, got one reminder past the eighth pole, drew off impressively while under a hand ride for the final furlong. BILETNIKOFF was well placed early, raced
towards the inside for most of the way, swung out wide for racing room at the top of the stretch, rallied well for place. PAYNEFUL stalked the early pace and
made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for the lead, but flattened out, held show award. THEKIDSBACK raced four wide into the first turn, made a four
wide bid on the far turn, but was empty in the drive. PIPPIN lacked a serious rally. TALKING POINT was off slowly, then proved to be no threat. WOWZA
MAN set the pace while racing off the rail, gave way. SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE raced five wide into the first turn, then was not a factor. SINCERE MAN
tired. MOUSETRAP chased the early pace from in between rivals, stopped.

MISTER MISTER dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the far turn to draw clear, then was kept to mild left handed urging to prove best.
SMALL INVASION was allowed to settle while three wide, swung out five wide for the drive while advancing, but needed more to get to winner. FIELD
OFFICER traced the top two early while four wide, then was getting out on the turn, came very wide into the stretch, stayed on well while besting the rest.
JOHNNY JIGGLE was allowed to settle early, angled out in the stretch for racing room but offered only a mild belated rally. METAL MAGICIAN broke
inwardly at the start, rushed up to duel for the lead on the inside but weakened.

ENJOY THE MUSIC was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch, came in sharply just past the eighth pole, bumped and bothered
foe, straightened thereafter and finished well under strong urging. An objection was filed by the runner up horse for interference just past the eighth marker
and was disqualified and placed second. BUSSTER VON TRAPPE was allowed to settle early, moved along the inside through the far turn into the lane,
was bumped and and checked briefly just past the eighth pole and finished willingly late. Busster Von Trappe was placed first through the objection for being
bothered in the stretch drive. GALILEAN MOON raced up close throughout, raced three deep in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. BOLD QUEST
was unhurried early, moved up six wide at the eighth pole and showed good late interest. TEMPLEMORE stalked the early pace, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and weakened a bit late. LASTING IMAGE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide in the lane and had no rally. WALK UP MUSIC
settled off the early pace, saved ground and never was a factor. TIGER KINGDOM pressed the early pace and gave way. INVITATION ONLY dropped back
early, raced three wide around the far turn through the stretch and failed to have a response. PALACE KITTEN was slow early, raced four wide at the
quarter pole and never threatened. ENGLISH TAVERN was slow early and never threatened. CAPTAIN HARLEY failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PALOMAR was bumped at the start, then was well rated while four wide, then when ready made a four wide bid on the far turn to assume
command, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best under mild urging. ROSE OF DUBLIN was allowed to settle early, raced five wide on the
backstretch, then commenced a bid while four wide on the far turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while second best. MISDRIVEN broke
outwardly at the start, then was reserved early, found way to rail on the far turn,swung out five wide for the drive, passed the tiring rivals to best the rest.
INFINITY SKY set the pace while racing off the rail then tired after six furlongs. DIABLO'S DARLING threw the rider and ran off before the loading process,
then stalked the pace three wide and tired. LETMESLIDEBYYOU chased the pace from the inside and gave way. BRAZILIAN SYMPHONY stopped.

MCLEAN HOUSE was settled back early, advanced on the far turn, awaited room past the quarter pole while moving into contention, split rivals leaving
second turn, drew clear in the stretch to prove best under a mild urging. AULD LANGE SYNE was rated early, made a four wide bid on the far turn to gain a
short advantage, but could not go with the winner the final furlong, second best. DAY tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn, but
came up empty in the lane, held show award. MY FRIEND LINUS was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive, raced erratic through the lane
bumping IMPERIAL BREW twice in the lane. IMPERIAL BREW was reserved early, came wide into the lane, was bumped repeatedly in the drive but
offered no rally. DREAMIN N SCHEMIN made a five bid on the turn but weakened. AUTOGRAPH was a bit rank and four wide into the first turn, not a
threat. BLAZE A TRAIL was through after a half. There was a stewards inquiry and jockeys objection concerning the stretch run. after reviewing the tapes
the #5 MY FRIEND LINUS was disqualified from fourth and place fith for interference in the lane.

Footnotes
BROAD STORM was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide in the stretch and finished gamely to just get up under all out pressure. BELLAMY KNOWS
settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside through the far turn into the lane and finished gamely late to just miss. PAOLLA'S HEART stalked the
pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole while racing between rivals and finished willingly to the wire. DAWLISH was unhurried early, moved up along
the inside, was forced to check nearing the eighth pole and had not enough late. CAILIN ALAINN was slow early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch
and showed good late interest. WHISPERING WANDA was slow early, moved up three wide around the far turn through the stretch and improved his
position. SMARTY CAT settled off the early going, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no rally. ALIN AZUL stalked the pace while saving ground and
faded in the drive. OCEAN DELIGHT showed good speed to set the pace and gave way. SMOOCHIN CANDY failed to sustain a bid. MAGICGIRL dropped
back early, took up just past the three eighths pole and never was a factor. TOOGOODOO stalked the pace from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
KID SLIPPER set a pressured pace while off the rail, shook clear on the turn, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best. IN THE LOOP stalked the
early pace four wide, then angled in deep stretch to get up for the place, no match for winner. ACE NINE NINE made a four wide bid on the turn but
flattened out, lost place late. JERSEY AGENDA lacked a serious rally. PADRINO'S HEART failed to menace. CURRENCY CHROME pressed the early
pace on the inside, then steadied entering the turn, weakened. I'MTHETAPITNOW was checked hard early, then proved to be no factor.
