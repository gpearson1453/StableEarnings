Footnotes
MIRIAM'S SKY chased and open length leader inside two rivals down the backstretch, began to close in on the far turn and angled out to bid for the lead as
they turned for home, sprinted clear by the eighth pole and widened to the wire. SEEMEE was two wide chasing the open length leader, moved up
alongside the winner on the far turn to tackle the leader but could not match that one's energy and settled for second money, outdueling the early leader
late. MAJESTIC MELODY cleared quickly, opened up a big lead from midway through the first turn to the far turn, began to tire and was collared as they
turned for home, losing a ding dong battle for the place spot late. CAPE NERO trailed the field early, closed inside into the far turn, angled out to the three
path into the stretch and passed a rival for a minor award late. ABSOLUTION was three wide chasing through the first turn, fell back midway far turn along
the inside, then mildly re-rallied in the stretch losing a photo for fourth late. CALAIS COVE was four to three wide off the pace through the first turn, still off
pace while two to four wide through the far turn and could not put in a bid.

Footnotes
NANA SAV stalked the early leader, bid for the front late on the turn, led in upper stretch and cleared off by the eighth pole, holding safe a rail rallier in the
final seventy yards. SOUPER PECAN trailed early, closed willingly into contention on the turn with a rail skimming ride, had dead aim on the winner inside
by the eighth pole but was no match, clearly second best. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was two wide in chase mode early, rallied four wide to loom up turning for
home but was outkicked by the top pair, levelling off the final seventy yards. LADY SUNSHINE started awkwardly and fell off the pace, rallied two to four
wide into range on the turn but could only inch up for a minor award late without threatening. O LA LA led while stalked by the winner early, pressed and
passed by that same rival turning for home, retreating from there to the finish. SARARENDA was off the pace, moved into mid pack on the backstretch and
was three to five wide on the turn, lugged in down the lane while on her wrong lead and wide. BLAZING BOURBON chased the leaders along the inside,
awaited room late on the turn but had no response when a path developed.

Footnotes
EZME'SGIRL was four wide stalking the early leader into the first turn, opened up a clear advantage out of the first turn and kept it until caught and passed
by the quarter pole, but seemed to be playing possum, re-opening a clear lead in the final sixteenth. SUNSET PHOENIX led quickly, let the winner take over
around the first turn, fell back along the inside down the backstretch but re-rallied up the inside in the stretch to prevail in a place photo. RING IN SILENCE
was mid pack chasing the open length leader along the inside, angled out midway far turn to catch that one and briefly lead, but ducked in in upper stretch
when the winner re-broke and lost the place spot late as well. SPEEDY DEVIL was off the pace and along the inside early, angled out three to four wide on
the second turn when the field bunched up by the quarter pole, but could not menace the top trio, inching up late wide for a minor award. LEGAL IN
CANADA was off the pace and in the two path throughout, in tight between rivals when the field bunched up at the quarter pole, not menacing down the
lane. FEMME SOLDAT was two to three wide on both turns in mid pack, dropped back midway on the far turn and never recovered.

EMBRACE MY UNCLE chased outside early, moved up to loom three wide late on the turn, drove to the lead at the eighth pole, shifted out by the sixteenth
pole but straightened out and held safe. KING OF THE RING was back to last quick, circled three to four wide on the turn, was herded into the seven path at
the top of the stretch, bumping with a rival by the sixteenth pole, prevailing to hold the place while widest. RED ASTAIRE chased along the rail, was
steadied late backstretch, angled out two to three wide by the quarter pole, herded a rival into the seven path as they turned for home, bumping with that
same rival down the lane then losing his path by the sixteenth pole. MR. TODD chased along the rail, bid for the lead inside the eighth pole but levelled off in
the final seventy yards for a minor award. G PRINCE OF SILVER cleared to the lead and held the front until losing it inside the furlong pole, drifting out
under left handed urging and dropping back from that point. LOOKOUT LOUIE stalked the early pace, stumbled badly when between runners late on the
backstretch, fell back quickly and seemed to lose interest. ANIMAL KRACKERS moved up from mid pack to stalk the early leader after a quarter , remained
in contention until the top of the stretch but retreated from there. THE RIDER OF RED ASTAIRE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER IN THE RUN
DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH AND BY THE SIXTEENTH POLE. THE SAME RIDER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER AT THE
SIXTEENTH POLE. AFTER REVIEW ALL THE CLAIMS OF FOUL WERE DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was in mid pack early outside, rallied four wide on the turn into contention, loomed outside the leaders as they turned for home and
drove by while lugging in on his wrong lead by the eighth pole, clearing off and holding safe to the wire. LUCKY STREET chased along the inside, was
shuffled back to second last on the turn, angled out three wide into the stretch and closed determinedly, really picking it up in the final seventy yards to nail
down the place. BYEBYE BYEBYE settled off the pace, was two to three wide with a solid rally on the turn and had a clear second by the seventy yard pole
but was picked off for that spot by a flashy closer. SUNDANCE HIT in mid pack early, closed into range in the two path into the stretch, but his rally levelled
off in the final seventy yards. NORTHERN SOLUTION began awkwardly but quickly recovered and won a scramble for the lead, held the advantage until the
stretch when tackled by the winner, then retreated from that point. BULLET SPEED stalked the leader in the three path throughout and continued in that
position until upper stretch when he began to fade out of the picture. SEASON HALL was pinched back at the start and dropped back to trail, closing very
mildly on the rail to beat one foe. UPLIFTING SPIRIT came up the inside of the leader early, dropped back to rail chase until mid turn when falling back from
there to the wire.

Footnotes
MATA HARRY chased two wide early while hard held, rallied into second by the quarter pole and closed resolutely down the stretch, getting past the leader
inside the final forty yards. GIANT ATTRACTION stalked the early pacesetter before opening a clear lead early on the turn, held his advantage until mid
stretch when he began to tire, losing the lead in the final stages and just holding on to the place. DYNA'S GAMBLE chased along the rail, moved inside the
winner to pass a tiring foe by the quarter pole when steadied, regrouped and rallied down the lane to just miss the place. SOUL N' SPIRIT dropped back
early, moved into mid pack and two wide around the turn but could only close mildly when far back of the top trio. HENRYTHEEIGHTH circled up three wide
into the turn but could not reach contention. SILVER SEABEE led early but was pressed and passed early on the turn, falling back from that point. I'VE
PAID MY DUES lost his rider shortly after the start. The horse walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING I'VE PAID MY DUES
LOSING HIS RIDER AFTER THE START. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. ALSO, THE JOCKEY OF DYNA'S GAMBLE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM.

Footnotes
LADY GRACE moved up to stalk the leader into the turn, took over mid turn, had a clear lead turning for home and was kept to her task, the rider busy to
the wire. MISS SAVVY broke out at the start but led early, allowed the winner the front around the turn and dropped back inside, then re-rallied for the place
inside the final eighth. SILENT RESPECT was last early, commenced a three wide rally on the turn and continued to close widest down the stretch but the
late pace was too hot. FRESH DREAMS was three wide stalking into the turn, had dead aim on the winner at the top of the lane but couldn't match that
one's energy and settled for a minor award. KA GEE GEE in the two path chasing down the backside, was in behind the leaders turning for home but outrun
down the lane. VEIL was taken up at the start when crowded by a rival, rushed up the inside while hard held, held up inside on the turn but had nothing
when clear in the stretch.
