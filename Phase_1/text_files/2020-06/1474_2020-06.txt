Footnotes
TRE while not the quickest early was able to hold the rail going into the turn edged clear from the field and was able to hold the margin for the win.
MONTANA JACK was settled off the pace along the inside and was finishing well to get second. VONSTER made a sweeping four wide move to get closest
to the leader but was outfinished through the stretch run for second. JOJOGOTTAGO sat in the two path off the early pace but could not make up ground.
STRYKER'S DREAM showed good early speed while three deep but tired in the stretch. DON RAMON was quickest early but did not get to the rail and had
to battled for the lead in the two path and tired through the stretch. SKITTISH was always well back while racing along the inside and never a threat.
NOTHARDTOBELIEVE was away a step slow and was always well back and never offered a rally.

CITI SHINER lead every step of the way along the inside and held gamely through the drive for the victory. ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY chased the winner from
the outset in the two path and never could get by that one while second best. FRAN'S EMPIRE had a perfect rail trip along the inside just off the early speed
and was up for third. TIP TAP TIME was three wide on the turn then fanned five wide turning for home and could not make up ground. STAR IN HEAVEN
was up close to the lead in the three path but gave way in the stretch. JUSTICE JEAN was always well back and came wide in the lane. DOWN HOME was
well back of the pace early while racing on the inside. SUNSHINE ELSIE was well back and was eased through the stretch and walked off.

MUSIC GIANT was allowed to settle at the back of the pack made a three wide move up the backstretch to get closer then four wide entering the stretch
and wore down the leader for the win. DURTDOBBR showed the best speed along the inside and held gamely until the final strides. PICADILLY
ROADSTER raced along the inside for the entire mile but offered no rally through the stretch. HYPER DRIVE raced in the two path on the turns came out for
the drive but could not make up ground. WHOA BOY chased the speed in the two path for three quarters and then gave way in the stretch. PARLAY PONTI
dropped back after a half and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SCOTIA QUEEN showed the best speed along the inside opened a good lead and responded when challenged in the stretch. CURL made a bid at the
leader and was cutting into the margin but could not go with the winner in the final strides. TEA AT NOON was four wide on the turn and was able to get up
for third while never a threat to the top pair. OURS TO HOLD raced three wide on the turn but could not hold third. IN CHARGE MARG was off a step slow
rushed into contention but then stopped going into the turn.
