Footnotes
RELISHMENT broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace racing to the backstretch, edged forward when prompted to gain the advantage
racing into the far turn, met the challenge of SILENT MISCHIEF midway through the second bend and held that rival on a narrow advantage to the wire to
prevail under firm right handed pressure in a prolonged skirmish. SILENT MISCHIEF tracked just off the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch,
advanced with a sharp move to challenge the winner midway through the far turn, pressed the issue in a sustained, game effort to the end but couldn't quite
gain the advantage. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS, urged to forward placing while angling to the rail to track just inside the leaders for a half, shifted out entering
the far turn, angled to the four path entering the lane, lost ground to the leaders but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. MS. AMETHYST
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the inside entering the lane and steadily faded. HALEL was settled last to the backstretch,
shifted outside foes then was caught four wide entering the far turn and offered no rally. LIL BULL urged disputing the pace shifting off the rail racing into the
first turn, pressed the issue for a half and gave way midway through the far turn.

VEGAS LIFE broke sharply to gain the advantage while angling inwards, conceded the lead leaving the chute to stalk a rival's pace racing to the turn,
moved to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, then went clear entering the lane under left handed pressure. GOOD ON YA, reserved between rivals
in the opening stages, shifted to the three path racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. PAPA RALPH J tracked the leaders
three wide between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and contested second while just outkicked. LARGE was urged to the lead
inside foes racing past the chute, set the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, dueled for command midway through the bend and gave way
racing into upper stretch. FIRST DEGREE tracked the leaders four wide racing to the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. STUCK UP angled to the
inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ENDURING HONOR raced unhurried near the inside tracking behind the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to split rivals three deep racing into
the far turn to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch and edged forward under steady pressure. AFTERBURNER tracked the leaders
inside foes in second flight, switched off the inside to split foes racing into the lane bidding for command inside the winner but came up second best. NEW
JERSEY JOHN ducked out into the path of D'CRAZINESS at the start, was righted quickly to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the
backstretch, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn to upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair late. TALK TO THE MEDIA broke
slowly, angled to the inside racing to the first turn while settling well off the leaders, gathered momentum while shifting out splitting rivals on the far turn,
swung four wide entering the lane and continued with a mild bid. RUDIGER settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside
foes racing into the far turn, was caught five wide into the lane and offered no rally. REAL ESTATE MOGUL, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the
leaders racing to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. PROMETHEAN settled outside foes in the last flight and failed to menace. BUNSTER
was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the far turn and gave way into the stretch. D'CRAZINESS, forced out at the
start, was righted, then urged in pursuit of the leaders while caught four wide racing into the first turn and came up empty after five furlongs.

CHICK'S SHADOW was prompted from the outset to gain a contending position, tracked off the first flight inside rivals while shifting to the three path racing
into the turn, angled four deep entering the lane and found her best stride in the closing stages to wrest the advantage in time while shifting inwards under
firm encouragement to prevail. BOURBON REBELLION, reserved last near the inside racing into the turn, advanced to striking distance along the rail
entering the stretch, bid for command inside the leaders leaving the sixteenth marker and was just outkicked. BAHAMA PEARL sprinted to the lead from the
break, set the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing into the turn, resisted a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch but yielded late while
prevailing for a share. BUCKY'S DRAMA broke readily, raced in touch with the leader attending the pace on her own courage racing to the turn, pressed the
issue on the turn into upper stretch to strike the front nearing the furlong marker but gave out late. BRIDGE DANCER, caught in the five path tracking the
leaders as part of the second flight in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn but lacked a rally. HONEY MUG tracked off the first flight between foes
while caught in the four path racing to the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
SACCO AND VANZETTI sprinted clear of the field racing to the first turn, set the pace on a comfortable margin racing off the rail to the far turn, then came
under stout right handed pressure through the lane to just maintain the advantage to the end. IRISH MAIL, caught in close quarters, then steadied a bit
racing into the first turn, tracked just off the second flight to the backstretch, gained position between foes racing into the far turn and continued willingly to
close the gap on the winner to the end. NEAT STREET, unhurried along the inside tracking behind the second flight, shifted out three deep on the far turn
and continued to make mild progress while gaining a share. ED'S DOG angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight and faded
into upper stretch. YADI, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter in second flight, gave way racing into the far turn. MORE THAN TEDDY
tracked the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight, made brief progress while shifting out four wide on the backstretch but came up empty entering
the far turn.

Footnotes
HAPPY GUY was settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to split foes three deep racing into the turn, then continued with
a steady late response to wear down IMPERIAL IVOR to narrowly prevail on the wire under firm right handed encouragement. The latter broke readily,
gained terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, moved to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane and grudgingly
resisted the winner's challenge to the end to just miss. NOBLE KING tracked just off the second flight racing five wide into the turn, then continued in that
path into the lane to close the gap on the top pair while prevailing for a share. ERIN GO BRAUGH tracked the leaders three, then four wide as part of the
second flight racing into the turn, was prompted to bid racing into the lane but had no final kick. HEY GRIFF tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight,
made brief progress inside foes on the turn but came up empty in the drive. GALLEON LIGHT, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace to
upper stretch and gave way. NOT TELLING tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded nearing the lane. RICKY RUN,
a bit slow into stride, swung out six wide racing into the lane but had no rally. STARSHIP FONZY proved no factor.

Footnotes
PRIZED WARRIOR, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter racing to the turn, pressed the issue on the turn, took over racing into upper stretch and was
roused clear. EL DUQUE tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to split foes three wide leaving the midway point of the turn,
shifted to the inside racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors. STINGSLIKEABEE, reserved off the second flight in early stages, shifted
out gaining position between foes racing into the lane, briefly awaited an opening while racing behind a tiring foe near midstretch but finished with interest to
edge a rival for a share on the wire. TOMMY TUESDAY tracked off the first flight racing in the four path into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch
and weakened in late stages. REACHNFORASIXPACK sped to the lead, dictated the pace racing off the rail into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's
challenge but gave way in the drive. MY COMPUTER tracked the pace between foes in second flight and emptied out nearing the lane. BOLTER off slowly,
shifted out five wide racing through the backstretch while being prompted to make some brief progress but came up empty midway through the turn.
PRIVILEGIO tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight and gave way after a half. CUP GAME broke slowly and failed to menace.
