MAMA DUNE pressed the pace two wide, seized command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, continued on her left lead in the lane and drew off under a
drive. OUR REVEILLE chased the pace two wide, was no match for the winner but finished well enough to be clearly 2nd best. COIN OPERATED lacked
early speed, raced four wide around the turn and was along for the show. SHAKIN' THAT SUGAR settled off the pace while racing three-wide between foes
and passed tiring rivals. BERNIES ROCKETTE saved ground to no avail. WORKINGONAMIRACLE set the pace along the rail and retreated through the
lane. FAIR WINDS played no factor while racing three wide. LINEA VERDE was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
BLACK STEEL set a pressured pace along the rail, was headed by WINNING SCHOLAR nearing the far turn, regained command inside around the turn,
was headed by THE SEVEN FIVE in upper stretch, dug in inside under left-handed urging and prevailed in a game effort. THE SEVEN FIVE stalked the
pace two wide early, bid three wide into the far turn, reached near even terms midway around the bend, put a head in front in upper stretch but was turned
back by the winner. HE'S A GOLD DIGGER settled off the pace two wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the far
turn, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out. WINNING SCHOLAR pressed the pace two wide, had a brief lead near the five-sixteenths
pole, vied between the top two around the far turn and weakened in the drive. MELDON chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
CHARITABLE VISIT saved ground and faded. JACOB T was outrun inside.

Footnotes
QUEEN BOBBY was outsprinted inside early, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. LOVE YOU
GOODBYE vied two wide down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, drew clear as the pace rival had to check, continued on the left lead
in the lane, drifted out a bit late and led until deep stretch. MANNA FROM HANNAH lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, swung four wide in upper
stretch and rallied. HIDE vied inside down the backstretch, checked near the quarter pole, angled two wide leaving that marker and lacked a further rally.
PLAY CHARADES bobbled at the break, raced three wide and never threatened. VENETIAN DRIVE chased the pace two wide and faded. INFLIGHT was
outrun inside. HERE'S I AM played no factor while racing two wide. Following an objection from the rider of HIDE, LOVE YOU GOODBYE was disqualified
from second and placed fourth for interference near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BOP MARLEY settled off the pace along the inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, steadily closed outside and wore down the leader late.
DOCTOR MCCOY advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared near the half-mile pole, set the pace along the rail from there to deep stretch
and gave way grudgingly. SOMETHING GREAT raced off the pace two wide, began to rally two wide around the far turn, clipped heels near the
three-sixteenths pole then regathered momentum well enough to get up for the show. OFFICER UNBRIDLED prompted the pace two wide and weakened.
ATRANI led early, chased inside and lacked a closing bid. WISH IN THE CASTLE was outrun inside. ANY WAY NOW chased the pace two wide and faded
around the far turn. JACKLIGHTING played no factor while racing two wide.
