Footnotes
PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN got away alertly, set the pace from outside, edged away from rivals three then two wide on the turn, was briefly shaken up at the
furlong marker, subsequently the rider looked back a couple times for competition and found none, was not asked thereafter and drew away while extending
the margin through the gallop-out of her own accord. CHEESE TRAY attended from inside, continued to chase while saving ground on the turn and inside
DESERT BANDIT, outfinished that one to secure the place while no threat to the winner. DESERT BANDIT was bumped at the break, raced between rivals
and exchanged a light brush near the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn and asked for more midway on that bend, was outfinished for the
place. MR. SCRAPPY switched out midway up the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn and was never a threat. INDIAN NIGHTS bumped the
inside rival at the start, exchanged some light contact near the seven-sixteenths, dropped back a bit and moved out at that point, went in the three to four
path on the turn while continuing to lose ground and came up empty. WHISKEY THERAPY broke outwardly then checked and veered in before checking
again at the start, was far back throughout and not persevered with late. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
HEAD FAKE switched outside the leader early while passing the gap, advanced on that rival five then four wide on the turn taking the lead by the head of
the stretch, put to steady urging and edged away. INDIAN DIVA moved forward to set the pace and shifted in a bit up the backstretch, led them into the turn
going from the four to the three path but was overtaken by the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold the place. RED OR
GREEN shifted in, tracked the leaders from the two to three path, kept on inside in the stretch but needed more. MINNIE ME HA broke a step slowly at the
start, moved out up the backstretch, went six wide into the turn but early on that bend shifted in to be four wide while advancing on the leaders, continued to
grind away slowly but was not enough. GHOSTLY TWO STEP was getting out heading up the backstretch and hard to control near the half-mile marker,
went outside seven then six wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. FEISTY HALO shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the rail through
the turn but was not a threat. TERAS SILENCE chased the leaders early, went six then five wide on the turn and came up empty. DIAMOND Z ROSEBUD
switched outside a foe late up the backstretch, was getting out badly on the turn going from the three to about the seven or eight path continued to drift a bit
in the lane.

Footnotes
DIABOLICAL TURN vied between runners but with plenty of space between inside and outside foes and him, moved in a bit to enter the turn in the two path
contending inside a rival, edged clear leaving that bend into upper stretch, held under a drive. BLAZING THUNDER stalked from in behind and off the
inside, went three wide into the turn moving out five deep by the latter part of that bend, gained steadily in the stretch to be second best. SIXTH GEAR was
just a hair slow into stride away from the gate, went outside a foe in the three path on the turn, was gaining in the stretch. OFFICER DONELL was
forwardly-positioned challenging for the lead, dropped back about the five-sixteenths entering the turn and failed to rally thereafter. F S GOLD was
prominent outside, contended four deep on the turn, weakened therafter. K W JAZZN was urged at the break but devoid of speed, went in the three to four
path on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. KABULL was very fractious in the gate tossing the rider out the back, went mid-pack inside on or
just off the rail and came up empty. BROTHER BEAUCHAMP broke just a bit awkwardly, lost ground up the backstretch, was pulled up late on the the turn
and vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
ICED pressed the pace early two to three wide then contended between rivals up the backstretch, continued to vie inside a foe but off the fence late on the
far turn then between rivals still two to three deep, edged clear late under steady handling. INSOMNIA attended the pace from outside three to four wide
early, applied further pressure up the backstretch, bid nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished while second best. TOX saved ground along the inside in
the back half early, moved out to advance in the two path on the far turn moving in to pass a rival midway on that bend before coming back out to bid for the
lead past the three-sixteenths, could not sustain the effort and flattened out in the lane. ALMOST A STORM raced outside foes four to five wide just off the
leaders early, took closer order early up the backstretch, continued five wide on the far turn but starting to lose ground and continued to weaken slightly in
the lane. JEDI WARRIOR raced mid-pack in about the three path through both turns and went evenly while never making a bid. RAMBLIN TOUCH was
bumped at the break then shifted in heading to the first turn going in about the two path at the rear through that bend, continued two to three wide on the far
turn and still trailing, moved out in late stretch to be five wide near the sixteenth pole and improved position. CITY LIGHTS WHO vied inside on or just off the
fence through the early going, dropped back two to three wide near the quarter pole and came up empty. TARGARYCAT was drifting out a bit and in a bit
tight heading into the first turn, shifted in at that juncture ending up on the rail by the end of that bend, saved ground on the far turn as well but failed to
threaten. GERDA'S GONE bumped the outer rival at the start, raced well removed from the inside in the four to five path throughout and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHIO switched outside a rival early and moved up heading up the backstretch pressing into the turn five then four wide on that bend, took a narrow lead by
the top of the stretch, drifted just a bit in the stretch and held sway under steady handling. SECRET SALSA set the pace from off the inside moving in to the
three path leaving the backstretch, moved in a further path on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch but fought on gamely despite drifting a bit. INDIAN
DRAGON was forwardly-placed inside on or just off the rail up the backstretch and on the turn, dropped back leaving that bend, came out in upper stretch
and kept on well late. MAMBO GUY attended the early pace from outside then between rivals into the turn, went four wide on that bend, came out six deep
into upper stretch and offered no extra while running on evenly. GATLING GOLD raced in the back half early, went two to three wide on the turn improving
position into upper stretch but needed more. ATTILA'S FLAG switched outside a rival late up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and
improved position some. FORTY FIVES STORM was close-up mid-pack early, began to lose ground on the turn going three wide into that bend and shifting
out five deep, came out further to be six wide in upper stretch and had no late kick. NO DOUBT raced outside rivals well back early, forced four then five
wide on the turn, swung out seven deep into upper stretch and failed to rally. USING NITRO was inside mid-pack early, dropped back and faded. HIT
BTWEEN THE ICE bobbled just slightly at the break, shifted in early, was outrun racing near the inside.

Footnotes
WHEREDOESTHECASHGO broke outwardly, set a lively pace with outside pressure racing off the fence, went in the two path on the turn, edged clear into
upper stretch and drifted out a bit at that juncture, held under steady handling. CERVEZA settled outside mid-pack, went in the four path into the turn
moving in a path on that bend, shifted in further in upper stretch and closed the gap but could reach the winner. NO PASA NADA chased from outside
mid-pack, was caught five wide on the turn, gained steadily in the lane but needed more. MR. MOOCH chased the pace early from outside, dropped back
four wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the stretch. D E LOVER pressed the winner going three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. E J'S GOLD was
brushed at the break, chased the leaders inside on or just off the rail up the backstretch into the turn and weakened. ANOTHER BROTHER was forced out
brushing a rival at the start, was off the fence in about the three path well back into the turn, failed to rally. TOM T WHO was not a factor while going four to
five wide on the turn. DESERT DANGER broke outwardly, saved ground to no avail, tired.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI KEELY tracked in behind the leaders off the fence, went in the two path through the turn coming out three wide for the drive, found room and
got up late under a drive. PRESLEY broke on top and set the pace from off the rail with some pressure inside and out, was more thoroughly pressed from
inside on the turn going two to three wide on that bend, drifted out in upper- to mid-stretch under a left-handed whip but clear, was outfinished late.
ORNAMENTAL IRON was between rivals late up the backstretch off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to get up for show
honors. FLYIN FALYNN settled last but one, saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch and improved position while never really a threat. LAKE
TIME raced outside foes going five to six wide on the turn, ran evenly in the stretch and failed to rally. TAP INTO BEAUTY moved up inside to press the
pace, applied more pressure through the turn on or just off the rail, gave way in the lane. BEAUTIFUL THUNDER stalked the leaders from outside three to
four wide up the backstretch, steadily weakened through the stretch. SCARLET STREAK was outpaced early, went in the four to six path through the turn
and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SELL BABY SELL was bumped lightly at the break, stalked just off the leaders, went five then four wide on the turn, struck the lead just past the furlong
marker, drew off under steady handling. SASSY KITTY set the pace from off the rail in the clear, was joined by outside rivals going in the three then two
path on the turn, could not kick on with the winner but held the place. ACCLIMATED SONG broke a bid awkwardly, advanced through traffic up the
backstretch to contend for the lead on the turn going four then three wide on that bend, had no extra for the drive. HENNO MOMO raced well back early just
off the fence, shifted five wide into upper stretch and ran on to improve position. IRON TUFF was forwardly-positioned inside foes along the rail up the
backstretch dropped back on the turn and switched out past the three-sixteenths coming three wide to the furlong marker, failed to rally. RED RHUMBA
chased from the two path, shifted to the rail on the turn, weakened. ELECTRICK COUNTY chased briefly from outside, went six wide on the turn and failed
to rally after having dropped back. SPLITS N STRIKES broke a half-step slowly, lacked early speed despite urging, switched out heading up the backstretch
racing in the four to five path through the turn and was not a threat. RAIN MAGIC hopped and bumped a rival at the break, raced off the leaders going in the
five path into the turn then moving in to the three path, was never a threat. BRASS COUNTY reared at the start and lost the rider then was taken hold of by
the starting crew and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
