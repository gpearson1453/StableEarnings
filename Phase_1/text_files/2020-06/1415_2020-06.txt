Footnotes
HAMPTON SPRING quickly to the lead while well handled to stay clear to the wire. SALLY broke well outside, chased winner from the turn while no real
match holding the place spot. WICKED VALENTINE unhurried early, ran up widest from the turn for the show spot. CLASSY LAURIEANN had an awkward
start and passed a couple in the stretch while no real menace throughout. TRULY'S SPIRIT briefly chased to turn, could not go on and wilted back in the
stretch run. CHANGE OF CUSTODY forwardly place to quarter pole and gave way readily. SHEZA MIRACLE BABY lunged at the start and never recovered
while far back at all calls.

Footnotes
A KING'S RANSOM broke a bit sluggish, roused for position early while never far back, rallied through the final three to be along in time under good
handling. OSVALDO broke well, pace to deep stretch, could not hold off winner late. AULD CUP no speed from the outset, rallied from far turn for show
spot. CAPE MARCO DRIVE broke sharp, no speed inside, lost momentum down the backstretch, rallied into the shifted wide and improved slightly.
CHARLES T pressed leader to far turn, used up, faded back in the stretch. GUNNY ROO broke alertly ran up to the half with nothing left from that point.
BEAST MODE broke tardy, raced well off rail throughout while never a threat.

bumped at the start, ran gapped off the pace, moved up on the turn and grinded down the stretch to get up for the place late. MY GOOD GIRL bumped a
horse at the start, dueled inside a pair of foes for the lead, chased the winner down the stretch and got nailed at the wire to lose place. TURING MACHINE

on the turn. MS. MAXIMA was fractious in the gate, raced in the middle of the track while in contention on the backtretch and came up empty.

PETE MARWICK was restrained off of a speed duel on the backstretch, rallied four wide on the far turn, battled a foe to the eighth pole and pulled in front.
MINE N YOURS was brushed by a horse at the start, raced between leaders on the backstretch, kept on to duel the winner down the stretch, angled out late
but could not keep pace and settled for place. KINETIC ART was in tight attempting to move up to press the speed inside on the first turn, dropped back to
race off the lead on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, rallied at the top of the stretch and had good energy down the lane. ALL HANDS ON
DECK brushed a horse at the start, raced wide on the backstretch, moved closer on the turn, and improved position late. WARRIOR'S MARCH dueled
inside to the top of the stretch and faltered.
