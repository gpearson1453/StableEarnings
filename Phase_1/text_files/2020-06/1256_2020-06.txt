Footnotes
A IS FOR ARTIST stalked the pace two wide, swept to command in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and drew off under a drive. FASTDRIVEN
came out and bumped a foe at the start, quickly sped clear, set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and weakened. CYCLOBOMB chased the pace
inside, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, loomed in upper stretch and flattened out. GRANDPA LOUIE raced two wide in midpack and
lacked the needed rally. ROBERT L. failed to menace while racing five wide. NATIVE COURAGE was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened. MAZ'S MAGIC chased the pace three wide and faded nearing the lane. NICALOE was outrun inside. GHOST MINE was outrun while racing
four wide. The rider of NATIVE COURAGE claimed foul against FASTDRIVEN for alleged interference at the start but it was disallowed by the Stewards.
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
AMELIA BEDELIA stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. SKYLAR'S TRICK set the pace
along the rail, was collared by the winner near the three-sixteenths pole, was no match for that foe but continued on well to be clearly second best. LUCILLE
OF TROY tracked the pace inside, made good progress down the backstretch, could not keep pace around the far turn, angled out leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and had a mild rally. FRONTIER WOMAN came out and bumped a foe at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and lacked
the needed rally. FLATTER ME OWEN lagged well back inside, went three wide around the far turn, came six wide into the lane and never threatened.
ALPINE MOON was bumped at the start, raced in range three wide, tired after a half and angled in nearing the lane. VAUNT bobbled at the start, stalked
the pace just outside of the winner in the three path and was through after a half.

Footnotes
LANESBOROUGH was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the rail around the first turn, angled out to bid two wide nearing the far turn, seized
command near the quarter pole, angled in near the three-sixteenths pole and had her heels clipped behind then drew off under a drive. LIL WATTY was
squeezed back at the start, raced well behind the field through the opening furlong, saved ground around the first turn, made good progress down the
backstretch, angled three wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, loomed outside nearing the lane but was no match in the stretch. EL BESTIA settled off
the pace inside, went three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. BARRACUDA broke outwardly and caused a chain reaction at the start, set
the pace in the two path around the first turn, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, was collared near the quarter pole, clipped heels when
LANESBOROUGH angled in near the three-sixteenths pole and dropped back. PENNY PINCHER was bumped just after the start, raced four wide and
failed to menace. SHOOFLY PIE was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and tired around the far turn. Following an inquiry and an objection
from the rider of BARRACUDA, LANESBOROUGH was disqualified from first and placed fourth for interference near the three-sixteenths pole.

WAKES UP HAPPY settled well off the pace along the inside, advanced between rivals down the backstretch, bid four wide around the far turn, closed
determinedly outside and was up on the wire. THUNDERTURTLE raced well back three wide, surged forward widest down the backstretch, rushed to the
front three wide past the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, finished willingly but was nailed on the wire. COLD HEARTED GAL broke in a
tangle, saved ground well back early, circled five wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. MAGIC PIC chased the pace inside and came up empty
in the lane. VENETIAN DRIVE set a clear pace along the rail and tired in the lane. LADYS CROSS FIRST played no factor while racing two wide.
ZANGARVA was caught four wide around the first turn, angled down into the two path nearing the far turn and tired. MIZZBANG chased the pace three wide
and faded. MANNA FROM HANNAH had brief speed two wide. NATALIE saved ground in midpack, checked repeatedly in tight around the first turn and had

Footnotes
UNNAMED SOLDIER set the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn and held clear under a drive. GEORGE TOWN CAT was hustled inside of the
winner early, rated back a bit when in tight quarters nearing the turn, angled out leaving the three-sixteenths pole, could not gain on the winner but was
clearly second best in the drive. GORGEOUS CHARLI was soundly bumped at the start, dropped back far early, circled five wide around the turn and rallied
for the show. CURIOUS CAL saved ground and never threatened. TOO MANY CORONAS failed to menace while racing two wide. ICE KAUFY had early
speed three wide between foes and faded around the turn. MR SHEEN was outrun inside. ROLLING BROOK was bumped at the start then had brief speed
two wide. OPPORTUNITY CALLS had speed four wide but was through early. GUNS AND ROSIES played no factor while racing three wide.
