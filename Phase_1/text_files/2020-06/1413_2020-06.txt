Footnotes
COLLEEN'S SAILOR steadied just out of the gate, stalked from the rail, swept to the lead in the final furlong and widened under a hand ride. DEVIL MAGIC
led into the turn, set a pressured pace from the rail, his rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch but shook clear, was passed just into the final furlong but
held place. JUROJIN, at the rear early, closed two and three-wide on the turn, swung out at the top of the stretch and rallied to no avail. AREOCENTRIC
stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. PHIL IN THE BLANK forced the issue, was hustled
two-wide late turn then chased through the stretch. TOBRUK was sent to a brief early lead, pressed pace and was hustled three-wide late turn but flattened
out in the late stages.

Footnotes
WATER POLO pressed the pace, took command early turn and drew away then held sway under steady pressure. STATION ROCK, in range, closed late
backstretch, chased on the turn and finished gamely. HONDURAS had brief speed, stalked on the turn then chased through the stretch. HYTHE was
pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. THEREALQUAFF
pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn, chased through the stretch but failed to menace. POOL PLAYA, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled
from the rail on the turn, was in tight at the top of the stretch but finished gamely. MEET CUTE ducked out at the start then settled in range, chased two and
three-wide on the turn but did not threaten. COUNT FOREST, prominent early, chased two and three-wide on the turn but faded into the stretch and had no
response when asked.

Footnotes
JACK BEANSTALK settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, rallied willingly and was up late under a drive. HEAD KITTEN raced in mid pack, came two
to four-wide through the turn, rallied outside rivals in the stretch but was oukicked. MATA HARRY, outrun early, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
then closed gamely, but late. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST dueled early, chased two and three-wide on the turn and was determined to the wire. STONEAWAY
dueled, shook clear mid turn, set the pace but gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. GIDEON'S SWORD, close early, angled in from the second path to the
wire on the turn, launched his bid mid stretch but failed to sustain the move. SUNKA WAKAN dueled three-wide, began to fade early turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
WESTLODGE INTRIGUE stalked the speed from the rail, moved off the wood at the top of the stretch, finished full out and was just up. SPARKLE SAMMY
was clear early and set a reserved pace, was under an all out through the stretch but was caught on the wire. BEL TEMPO, away slowly and well back
early, closed along the rail late turn and rallied gamely. MIZZONA, in range early, chased two-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. HUSH BUFFY
settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide through the turn then finished under a determined drive. HASSAH (GB) stalked the pace
two-wide, chased into the stretch then evened out in the final 16th. LADY BELLA, stalked early, was pinched back early turn, rode the rail to the stretch then
finished under an all out drive. CAPE MIST raced off the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely outside. MODUS OPERANDI, off
slowly, stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response.

was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then rallied full out but missed. GLAMOUROUS GIRL, in range early, chased hard four then three-wide on the
turn and finished under a very determined drive. SEAMIALAUGH briefly held a short lead, was headed late backstretch, chased on the turn but weakened in
deep stretch. ELEANOR POWELL settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then closed with some interest in the stretch. BLUSHING BREW
raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn then rallied willingly between foes. BAYOU BELLE showed brief speed then settled in range, stumbled early on
the turn, chased hard to the stretch but failed to menace. ADORE ME had brief speed then pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn and
flattened out with a 16th to run. MUSKOKA LADY, off slowly, closed quickly up the rail, stalked on the turn but evened out in the late stages. LA BONITA
raced from off the pace but lacked a response when asked. QUEEN ANDHER COURT settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but
lacked a rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED AGAINST GLAMOUROUS GIRL BY BAYOU BELLE FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN WAS
DISALLOWED.
