Footnotes
PAPER DOLL forwardly placed early inside, shuffled back rail late backstretch then went evenly thereafter. BLONDIE LOX BABE trailed little while showing
little. GEMODIXIE forwardly placed from the start inside, crept closer and challenged along the rail turning for home, vied to the wire inside the winner,
outfinished while remaining along the inside. LIL' SISTER LOU broke to the outside to bother the winner a bit, raced in mid pack and also failed to muster a
threatening rally. TIZZY'S SONG bothered slightly at the start, moved up to show the way up the backstretch and into the turn, slightly larger lead through
the bend, responded when confronted for the drive, long drive, dug in gamely late to hold the advantage. KEHRON'S CREED last away, lacked speed,
failed to muster a serious rally in the drive. PALMETTOVOWMENOT back off the pace while well wide, advanced into a striking position four wide through
the turn, equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker then hung in the late going. FANCY MALLORY within striking distance out in the strip,
advanced and challenged three wide exiting the turn, not enough for the winner lane, held the place.

SOUTHERN BEAUTY within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the stretch, drifted out a bit to lose contact with the leader nearing the furlong
grounds, late push to be up in time. MISS UNDERRATED broke on top, raced with the early pace off the inside, took over to be clear into the lane,
maintained daylight past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner in the final stride, clearly second best. BALOOK last away, trailed in the run up the
backstretch, began a steady advance into the turn, continued to rally through traffic to finish up best of the rest. LONE STAR DIVA away in good order,
forwardly placed while four wide through the turn, had little left for the stretch run. SPELLBINDING in the second flight while outside, four wide through the
turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. STORMY MERLOT settled in mid pack early, five wide into the lane, improved slightly while not a serious threat.
MI LIA in a bit tight in the early going, made little impact. DECADENT DIAMOND vied up front while along the inside for four furlongs then gave way when
the real running began into the lane. NIN TO WIN remained always back. ABLE CATCH within striking distance in the early going, began a steady retreat
before a half. JO JO'S HALO broke with the leaders, fell quickly back and showed little. Quarter mile unavailable due to timer malfunction. Race times
added after video review

Footnotes
CAJUN CHAOS broke with the field, moved outside, advanced to challenge in the four path into the lane under confident handling, drew steadily clear to win
ridden out. TRIVISTA void of speed for a half, steered out when straightened for home, finished willingly with a late rally to be clear for the place. MAY
HOUR settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, finished up best of the rest. DREWZANO alternated up front off the inside for a half,
briefly raced with the winner in upper stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker then gave way to lose a couple of positions late. DISTINCT QUALITY
last away, moved up early to race in mid pack, went evenly through the stretch. CLASSIC GREELEY failed to menace. DERBY DOG broke on top, helped
set the pace for a half then gave way.

Footnotes
HERE COMES HOMER outrun in the early going outside, advanced steadily in the four path into contention through the turn, took over nearing the furlong
grounds, drove clear. ROSES N' RUBIES settled off the pace, moved out to be three wide turn, moved closer into the lane, could do little with the winner the
final furlong, edged clear for the place. CLEVER RACER broke back, lacked speed, came into the stretch well off the inside, made a late run to be up for the
show in the final strides. HIGHLY CENTSABLE with the pace while three wide, continued to vie through the turn, could not match the winner in the final
furlong nor contain the runner up, caught late for the show. JACK'S KISS went one paced in lacking a closing response. SIX GRAND moved up to vie
between horses before a quarter, narrowly showed the way through the turn, weakened in the drive. CALLMECHAMP broke back, lacked speed, picked off
some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. BETTIN ON BRYAN last to leave, failed to menace. LUKE THE DRIFTER void of speed, five wide out of the
turn, failed to muster a rally. ELLA'S ACTOR tired while four wide through the turn. BIG BOSS MAN broke through the gate prior to the start, flashed brief
speed along the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
CAJUN PINATA broke with the leaders, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled the middle part while in the two path,disposed of the other speed
when straightened for home, drew clear, kept to task. BEN'S MAGIC STONE lacked early foot, came three wide and between rivals into the lane, set down,
finished up willingly to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. LIP SERVICE last away,void of speed for a half, advanced four wide through the
second turn and into the stretch, closest to the winner late, flattened out, nipped for the place. BEAUTY BOY away with the leaders, narrowly set the pace
inside, dueled inside the winner the middle half mile, could not keep up in the drive, was tiring when drifted out under a left handed stick midstretch then
drifted in under right handed urging late to take the rail off FLASHY IMAGE in the late going while still clear of that rival. FLASHY IMAGE lacked early foot,
moved inside, saved ground through the second turn, was going evenly while continuing inside in deep stretch when steadied, maintained position.
DONWELL raced within striking distance, came up empty for the drive. TRIP CANDY was never dangerous. SUPER FACTOR broke alertly, raced forwardly
early, fell back after a half, began to tire soon after. SI FAMILIA remained always back. HOOK was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SWAGG broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, dueled through the turn, headed into the lane and past the furlong marker, battled back
and was edging clear late. FIRE BLASTER closest to the winner, moved up outside that rival to duel through the turn, showed the way into the stretch and
past the furlong marker, hung, outkicked late, fully extended to save the place. ONEHOLYLION lacked early foot, four wide through the turn, set down for
the drive, finished with good energy to be getting to the runner up late. BORN AGAIN GEORGE headed up the second flight for a half, came up empty when
called on for the drive. BIG EM C also in the second group, saved some ground turn, also failed to respond in the drive. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR off slowly,
trailed early, improved position by passing mostly faltering foes. MASTERLY in mid pack for a half, had nothing for the drive. SNAPPER BITE steadily
faded. BUFFON was finished early.

Footnotes
WAR BANDIT raced off the early pace outside, advanced into contention through the turn, challenged four wide into the stretch, dueled the final furlong,
proved narrowly best in a determined effort. LASSIE'S LAST HOUR also lacked early foot after being in a bit tight at the break, advanced then was floated
out five wide between foes turning for home, dueled outside the winner the final furlong, outkicked by that rival to narrowly miss, clearly second best.
GRILLIN in mid pack while racing off the inside, came six wide into the stretch, rallied to be in time for the show, no match for the top two. MY BABY BELE
brushed at the start, void of speed, fanned six wide into the lane when moving closer outside the top two, flattened out a bit in the final furlong to be caught
for the show. COMMERCIAL FLASH well back early, swung five wide into the lane, showed some moderate late interest to improve position. JERRY'S
LEGACY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, advanced and vied three wide through the bend, tired in the drive. SUSURRO made little impact.
AWISHFORGREELEY away well, set or forced the pace for a half along the inside, gave way in the drive. QUEEN LEDA with the pace off the inside, vied
between rivals through the bend, gave way in the drive. AMANDASCHIME tired while racing well off the inside. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL last away, used early
to move up inside, faltered after a half. MORE CLEVER balked at loading, broke with the field, quickly fell back and showed little.
