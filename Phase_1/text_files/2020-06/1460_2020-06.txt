Footnotes
UNSHACKLED CROSS showed the best early speed along the rail in a three horse duel and increased his margin through the stretch for the win. MYSTIC
REALITY came three wide on the turn and was finishing well for second while never a threat to the winner. DEL ARGENT was the outside horse in the
speed duel and could not hold second in the final sixteenth. MR. POPCORN was first out of the gate but quickly settled into position behind the speed duel
along the inside and never mounted a bid. MIDNIGHT MAVERICK raced along the inside the entire race and never mounted a rally. CO CO KID raced in
the two path on the turn and never offered a rally. ANITANEWMERCEDES was in the back from the outset and was never a factor.

ROCKIN O was part of a six horse early speed duel but was in the two path and steadily pulled clear from his rivals for the win. COUGAR PASS showed
good speed along the rail and held second easily. MAN OF FEW WORDS raced five wide on the turn but could not make up ground on the top two.
STARTTHEBUSGUS raced midpack fro much of the race and made a mild bid through the lane. FIVE TITLES got the perfect rail trip and moved into
contention when rivals went very wide but was outfinished. YOU ARE IN LUCK came six wide on the turn and made a mild bid. ANIMAL KING broke best
and was up close with the leaders and then faded. HEIS THE MAN raced along the inside and had no rally. SHOT CALLER raced midpack but was forced
six wide on the turn and tired. BE LIKE BOB was up close for the first quarter but stopped on the turn.

ADAPTATION came to the front in the two path going into the turn and drew clear to win handily while not asked for best. ELUSIVE FLAME came five wide
on the turn to get into contention and while never a threat to the winner was second best. GRANDPA'S RANGER raced midpack made a wide move through
the lane and was up for third. COLOR ME BEHOLD made a four wide move to get into contention but was outfinished in the stretch. SADDLE IN
COMMANDO showed the best early speed but tired through the stretch. FULL OF GOLD was along the inside up close for the first quarter and faded. EZ
EZ EZ raced a bit wide and lacked a rally. FORMER GRADUATE was always well back and never a factor. HARD STORY was always well back and never
a factor.

Footnotes
OUT OF THE SKY made a four wide move on the turn to get into contention came on the outside through the lane and was up for the victory. FIANNA
HILLS was three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the final stages. LIKE A HAINT raced along the inside up close and held on for third. ATOKA GIRL
raced midpack and made a mild bid through the stretch. APRIL'S LADY DI raced along the inside and lacked a winning rally. RATE THE REPUBLIC raced
along the inside came out for the drive but could not make up the needed ground. FEELS RIGHT showed some early speed in the two path but tired on the
turn. SMART RACHEL was well back in the early stages and could not make up ground. FOXY TWIST was away a step slow hustled along the inside and
tired. SOPHIE T was always well back and never a factor. AMERICAN RAISA dropped back very quickly after a few strides and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CHASIN LUCAS was away in good order battling for the early lead drew clear easily on the turn and was geared down the final sixteenth to win easily.
BONITA ANNIE made a good move along the inside on the turn to be clearly second best while no match for the winner. STORMY MUSIC was off a step
slow and then was hustled along the inside came through and was clearly third best. CELEE'S TE showed good early speed in the two path but tired in the
stretch. ATHENA THE GODDESS was off a step slow raced along the inside and passed tired foes. EXTREME CAUTION raced in the three path behind
the pace and offered no rally. GIVE EM FITZ was always well back and not a serious factor. SUPER ONE was up close for the first quarter and then
stopped. LADYSGOTITALL was up close in the three path and stopped in the stretch.
