Footnotes
AZTEC WARRIOR was outrun early, rated to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, eased out for room, rallied once clear, pushed to the front and
held driving. STONE GROOVE lugged out on the first turn, steadied off heels then straightened and chased from the rail to the stretch, rallied to be on terms
with the winner in mid stretch then was outkicked but second best. UNUSUALLY GREEN was allowed to settle to the half, got fanned four wide to the
stretch then could not offer the needed late response. MY FRIEND GEORGE had no speed, saved ground on both turns but also did not offer a closing bid.
ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE hustled to the front, set the pace from off the rail to the stretch then was overtaken in mid stretch and tired. GALLANT HEAT
pressed the pace three wide for six furlongs then also tired.

out late but held second. VIOLENT BEHAVIOR trailed to the turn, was two wide to mid turn, swung out four wide into the stretch then finished willingly but
missed the place. SATANTA pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. TIZ MANNY chased the pace from

Footnotes
REV REE was pushed out to the five path by TIPPY TOP on the first turn, eased in and stalked to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to
the front in mid stretch and held on determinedly. WILLING TO BURN was settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn then shifted out for the drive
and closed with a rush. WAY TO FIRE had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch then was
outfinished late. KISS RIDE GOODBYE broke in a tangle and had no speed, trailed to the second turn, had to circle four then five wide to the stretch, rallied
to loom boldly in mid stretch then was also outfinished. AUGURE steadied in traffic from the seven eighths to the backstretch, stalked to the second turn
then again was boxed in traffic from the quarter pole to the eighth pole but finished in a mild rally. GRAZEN VALOR was on the pace from the outset, saved
ground to the stretch then was tiring in mid stretch, took up leaving the furlong grounds and weakened. TIPPY TOP had good speed, pressed the pace two
wide to the stretch then gave way.

turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, made a bid to mid stretch then was outfinished. PAPAYA broke out and bumped BE LIFTED UP, pulled to the turn,
swung out four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. STARZA pressed the runnerup three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. BE LIFTED UP was pinched back at the start, had no speed and was never a threat. ARIES broke inward to begin, crowded BE
LIFTED UP, had no speed, circled five wide on the turn but did not rally.

Footnotes
SUNRISE JOURNEY had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, dug in stubbornly when challenged by PLATE SIDE in mid stretch and held gamely.
PLATE SIDE pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, rallied to get alongside in mid stretch then could not get by and just held off MY FRIEND TONY for
second. MY FRIEND TONY broke a bit slow and trailed to the stretch then finished in a strong rally. ARGOSY FLEET chased the pace from the rail to the
stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but kept on to the line. SKELTON PASS had no speed, swung out four wide into the stretch but could not muster the
needed response. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL was chasing the winner three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. CONCENSUS also was
chasing to the turn, swung out four wide for the drive but gave way.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE was outsprinted to the half, bid three wide on the second turn, shifted out for the drive then rallied steadily and bested PAPA DO RUN late.
PAPA DO RUN The latter pressed the pace for a half mile, bid two wide to get to terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then could not stall the
winner while not threatened for second. MR. PAPAS stalked the pace for five furlongs, was off the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and
finished evenly. CLASSIC CHAMP settled mid pack for a half mile, came two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE trailed to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but did not threaten. AERIAL DECOY had no speed then saved
ground to no avail. HARDY CHISEL hustled to get the lead and dropped over to save ground, led to the stretch then tired through the drive. UR NOT MY
PRESIDNT settled mid pack for five furlongs then also saved ground but weakened in the lane. FANTASTIC ARAGORN was outrun to the backstretch,
settled to the second turn, tried to rally three then four wide to the stretch but gave way. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD had no speed and was always outrun. Due to a
malfunction of the photo finish camera, the finish was authenticated by the stewards.
