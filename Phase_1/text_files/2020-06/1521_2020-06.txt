TRIPLE POWER controlled the pace from the outset, was given his cue into the lane,drew off to prove much the best while be kept to pressure. ALBERTA
BOUND raced at the back of the pack, made a bid into the lane, proved no match for winner while second best. TRIAL BY NITE hurried away, sat just off
the pace inside of PRINCE AFLEET, chased into the stretch but came up empty in the lane, held show award. PRINCE AFLEET vied three wide, stalked the
pacesetter from the three path and offered to rally in stretch. VISION QUEST settled inside racing into the turn and weakened into the lane.
IMTELLINGYOUMYSON broke slow, stumbling, pulled up leaving the turn, did not finished and walked off.

MOE'SANNIE saved ground inside, shifted out to the two path in the turn, split rivals at the top of the lane, moved up to challenge VICTORY SHADOW at
the head of the stretch and narrowly held off rival late. VICTORY SHADOW sat just off the pacesetter racing three wide, went in pursuit of the leader leaving
the turn, rallied four wide entering the stretch, responded to challenge from MOE'SANNIE and was outnodded. TACTICAL EDGE stumbled leaving, trailed
the field early, angled in sharply at the head of the lane to the rail and held safely for show. CLASSIC TARTAN out sprinted to the turn, chased four wide
leaving the turn and came up empty for the drive. AMBER RIDGE sat off the pace in the two path, obtained a short edge into the lane along the rail and
gave way. SPANISH DIVA broke awkwardly, raced at the back of the pack and offered a late mild bid. INBETWEEN US lacked a serious bid. HI HO
PICOLO sent for speed to show the way through the turn and had nothing left into the lane.

STORMCHASER controlled the pace through the backstretch, remained unchallenged into the lane, drew away into the stretch and won driving.
PACIORETTY reserved off the pacesetters early, took closer order in the far turn, went in pursuit of the leader under heavy urging but was no match for the
winner and finished best of the rest. RAYREADY saved ground early, shifted out into the lane and was up in time for show. THIN LINE chased outside and
left little in reserve for the drive. LONESOME CAT trailed the field and offered a late bid into the stretch. RUCK vied for the early lead, lost ground into the
turn and was done early. XTREME DENIGRAY pressed the early pace inside, was unable to move on with rivals into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
LITTLE BRIAN vied for the early lead, prompted the pace from along the rail, overtook the lead, drew away entering the stretch and was kept to task under
light handling. MOON JUICE rated off the pace outside, swung five to six wide while advancing but needed more to get to the winner. FORTHWITH
reserved early, took closer order into the lane, rallied between foes through the stretch and got up in time for show. AWESOME HIT pressed the early pace
inside, dropped back entering the turn and was edged out for show. JOHNNY RUNNER stalked the pace racing three to four wide, came four wide into the
drive and weakened. CAMINO DEL REY settled outside, rallied wide into the lane and came up empty for drive. POOR RUBEN lacked early speed and
failed to reach contention. MAKEOURDAY broke ground leaving and chased to no avail. ITS ALL GOOD contested the early pace, was unable to move on
with the winner at the head of the lane and stopped.

Footnotes
RAINY BAY shifted out in the backstretch, rated off the pace, moved up entering the lane to challenge the leader, rallied outside of SOLO RING, edged
away and held under a late drive. PRESS GANG stalked the pace from the two path, came three wide into the lane and finished gamely for place. SOLO
RING sent for speed inside, responded to challenge from RAINY BAY and weakened late stretch. WYE CROSS unhurried early, saved ground along the
rail, swung wide into the lane and closed determinedly. SLEWMACH fractious in gate, hustled away, angled towards the rail lodging a bid into the lane but
failed to improve contending position. SUNNY'S BEST trailed the field early and was not able to reach contending position. TOO AWESOME chased,
carried wide leaving the final turn and faded. CATCH ME IF U CAN fractious in gate, pressed the early pace and tired.

Footnotes
MOON KING sat just off the pace, moved up five wide and won driving. DENSE FOG sat just off the pacesetters, took advantage of opening on the rail into
the lane, rallied inside and just held for place. BURNIN' POCKETS sent for speed inside, moved up alongside the leader to contest the pace, rallied through
stretch and was narrowly denied. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR lacked early speed, took closer order then lacked clear running room early stretch and surged
late. HARD TO COME HOME allowed to settle early, swung five wide into the lane, angled inward entering the stretch and finished well. WEST OF
SABINAL vied for the early lead, was challenged by BURNIN' POCKETS and gave way. JOVIAL DESTINY chased through the turn, took closer order but
lacked the bid that was needed. TRANG lost ground early and failed to threaten. DRAYMAGIC showed some early speed and faded. IMPOSING CAT was
outrun.
