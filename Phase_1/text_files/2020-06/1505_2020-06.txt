Footnotes
MAST COVE showed good early speed while racing along the inside, built a long lead through the stretch under mild encouragement to be a handily winner.
U KNOW I B LION pressed the early leader, raced just off the inside throughout and was no match for the winner. JIMA'S GOLD stalked the early pace,
raced three deep in the lane and had no final winning bid. FIRST HOOSIER was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up five wide into the upper
stretch and never was a real threat. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL was slow early, saved ground and never was a factor. MI TIA CHRISTINA stalked the pace, raced
four wide at the eighth pole and weakened through the drive. ADONAI LOVE dropped back early, raced towards the inside throughout and never
threatened. TRACK MAGIC settled off the early pace and failed to have a response.

Footnotes
SANGUINE stalked the early pace, took command nearing the far turn, raced two wide through the stretch and held gamely under strong handling. AUNT
DOROTHY stalked the pace, moved up three wide into the upper stretch to challenge, veered in sharply just past the eighth pole, straightened thereafter to
race four wide and finished second best. PYTHONESS was allowed to settle early, made a strong move nearing three eighths pole, was forced to check
sharply, saved ground through the stretch and had no final winning bid. BIG ANNIE was unhurried early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and had
not enough late. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the lane and never was a factor. MISS WROTE showed good early
speed and gave way. SCHATZI pressed the pace from the inside and tired. EXECUTIVE TIME was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL GUARD set all the pace, saved ground throughout and prevailed late under strong handling. IMPERIAL GREATNESS tracked the leader down
the backstretch, moved up two wide while racing between in the stretch and finished gamely to just miss. AZZEDINE (FR) stalked the pace, raced three
wide and finished willingly to the wire. DRILL BIT was off a step slow, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no late rally. MY COMPUTER settled off
the early pace, raced four wide in the lane and had not enough late. FULL MOON RISING dropped back early, saved ground and never was a factor. FRIO
was slow early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. STERLING JUDGE failed to sustain a bid. CUP GAME settled off the early
pace and failed to have a response. IMPERIAL IVOR dropped back early and showed little.

BIG MONEY MACHINE stalked the pace, moved up along the inside through the far turn into the lane and finished well to get up under strong
encouragement. PERFETTO set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and finished second best. RUDIGER was allowed to settle early, moved
up five wide into the stretch and was closing in on the top pair late. GO HIPPO GO stalked the pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no final
winning bid. SOUTHERN CAL stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and had no response. REAL ESTATE MOGUL pressed the pace and weakened
while racing three deep. FOX ROX reared at the break losing a considerable amount of ground, raced back in the early stages, raced five wide at the eighth
pole and never was a serious threat. DONE ACTING was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. FRONT LINE
PAIGE dropped back early and failed to have a response. CIRCLE AWAY settled off the pace, saved ground and never was a factor.

Footnotes
RED NATION stalked the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn into the lane and finished gamely to prevail under strong pressure. PRICEY
VICTORY stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and finished second best. HAPPY GUY was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide
into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. LEBASI settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside, improved his position through the stretch but
had not enough. ELVIS COLE stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. ETERNAL CROSS showed good early speed
and gave way. FREE DANCER broke through the starting gate pre-race, showed good speed and faltered in the drive. BOX CANDY settled off the early
pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. CRUPI'S PIZZA DOM was off a step slow, raced four deep in the stretch and never was a factor. K C
TWOSTEP was shuffled back at the break and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SPLENDOR BEACH was slow early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get up under all out pressure. SHE BROKE MY HEART
pressed the pace, gained command through the far turn, led inside the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best.
BETTERTHENYOURX showed good early speed, raced just off the inside and weakened a bit late. JAENT was unhurried early, moved up four wide into
the upper stretch and showed good late interest. BIZ MAKER settled off the early pace, raced five deep into the lane and had no final winning bid. SIDNEY
SUE dropped back early and failed to have a response. MINEWELLRECEIVED stalked the pace and weakened while racing three wide. PANTHALASSA
stalked the early pace and faded. OHIO STORM was slow early, raced along the inside around the far turn into the lane and never was a factor. BLAZING
DIVA dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened.
