Footnotes
FAST FRACTION trailed for a half-mile inside, moved out five wide getting in gear around the turn, rallied steadily and wore down the leaders from outside a
sixteenth out. GRAN ETIQUETA was four wide into the turn, moved in lodging a bid in the two-path between horses near the five-sixteenths, could not go
with CRYSTALINA turning for home, then came back on inside to get the place. CRYSTALINA advanced steadily around the turn four then three wide,
reached the front outside rivals after six furlongs, edged away near the eighth-pole, but weakened from there. MIRANDA SOFIA raced two to three wide in
range through the middle stages, and lacked a bid. SIGNING BONUS went up to vie inside TRINNI FLOWER leaving the chute, stayed on to the
quarter-pole and gave way on the rail. TINY TURBO was finished early. DAKOTA BEACH tracked three wide, and dropped back after a brief bid on the turn.
TRINNI FLOWER vied outside SIGNING BONUS for a half, stopped on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch. NERISSA showed brief speed, was pulled
up on the turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
PAPETU outsprinted rivals to the front and crossed over to the two-path, showed the way widening the advantage gradually, and remained on his left lead
unthreatened. LITTLE DEMON chased after PAPETU shifting out three wide and clear of the others late on the turn, made no impression under a drive and
bested the rest. COBB bumped with HACHACHA at the start, brushed with ESPECIALLEA early, raced two to three wide and was clear for the show
through the lane. CONGRATS AGAIN posed no threat inside. GOLOVKIN was three to four wide on the turn, and tired. WICKED BRODY raced widest
early, and was never close. LOVED GLOBALLY bumped with HACHACHA at the start, and lacked speed three wide. HACHACHA was bumped between
COBB and LOVED GLOBALLY at the start, and could not keep up on the turn. INTO THE SUNRISE broke alertly and led briefly inside, stayed on the chase
to the end of the turn and gave way. ESPECIALLEA brushed with COBB early, and showed little.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER bumped with ETANA approaching the first turn, moved out four wide after a dawdling quarter-mile to vie outside BLOSSOM BOW, gained
the upper hand after six furlongs and pulled clear late under a drive. BLOSSOM BOW bumped lightly with I'M THAT BIRD at the start, raced four then three
wide showing some initiative to take over after a quarter-mile, vied inside WITCH HUNTER to upper stretch before conceding, and held the place. KAUFY
FUTURES was outside PAOLA'S TEAM on the front end going into the first turn, lost position and moved inside under a firm hold entering the backstretch,
came back out three wide nearing the stretch, and drifted out late while clear of the remainder. FIAMMA MAMMA tugged and steadied along under a firm
grasp on the first turn, had to be taken out three or four wide approaching the backstretch, stayed in range to the far turn and was empty when roused.
ETANA bumped with WITCH HUNTER going to the first turn, and was never a threat. PAOLA'S TEAM broke open the gate dislodging the rider prior to the
start, came away in good order and was rank with a short lead entering the first turn, steadied along being wrangled back approaching the backstretch,
settled down through the middle stages and was through after six furlongs. I'M THAT BIRD bumped lightly with BLOSSOM BOW at the start, went into the
first turn five wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
OUR FANTASY was allowed to settle early, gained rapidly and shifted out smoothly late on the turn, took over from outside in upper stretch, and drew off on
her left lead under a mild drive. PRINCESS PAO advanced along the rail on the turn, moved out for the drive and finished willingly while never a threat to
the winner. LA GATA NEGRA lagged far back early, began to get rolling in the three-path turning for home, and was going well belatedly. DREAM
ADRIANNA went up to vie inside FLORADO midway up the backstretch, stayed on to the top of the lane and weakened on the rail. CAFFEINE RUSH
prompted the early pace, poked a head in front outside DREAM ADRIANNA after six furlongs, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and faded.
DONA CAMILE chased three wide to the turn, and tired after six furlongs. NATURELL (ECU) was never a factor. FLORADO led early in the two-path, and
faltered after a half-mile. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE was through after a half. CASSEY'S GIRL dropped back four wide approaching the stretch. WHISKEY
SONG broke slow and was always far back. SASSY GIDGET dropped far back after a half. Due to a timer malfunction the times have been omitted.

Footnotes
PERFECTCOMBINATION was innermost of a foursome battling up front early, edged away around the turn, built a commanding lead in upper stretch and
was kept driving. COMMANDING LADY was outrun early, shifted out five wide at the top of the lane, and rallied on her left lead to best the others. AUBURN
was bumped between LIZA and VICTORY CRUSADE at the start, advanced mildly three then four wide to the stretch, and lacked a final bid. VICTORY
CRUSADE bumped with AUBURN at the start, argued the early pace three wide between horses, could not stay with the winner after a half-mile, and faded
late. LUCY'S INTEREST broke out, contested the early pace four wide, and faded in the drive. RACK DADDY was outrun early inside, moved out in the
stretch and passed tired horses. HECHIZADA raced four wide, never got close and improved past tired foes. MAMMEE BAY lacked room through the early
going, raced wide and failed to respond. FLAT OUT COOL raced in midpack for a half-mile, and dropped far back. MAKE A MINT was finished early two
wide. LIZA bumped with AUBURN at the start, contested the early pace two wide between horses, gave way on the turn, and retreated. TRINNI LOVE
retired early.

Footnotes
BIMINI took control early, rated along in the two-path, repelled a challenge from DESCENTE after six furlongs, and kicked clear again in upper stretch.
DESCENTE was forwardly placed early inside, moved out with a bid outside BIMINI late on the turn, was shaken off into the lane and ran on much best of
the others. NOWITNA RIVER raced five then four wide around the turn in range, and weakened into the stretch. TUESDAY'S ROSE lunged out bumping
KINDHEARTED KOTA while unruly away from the gate, moved up between horses three wide after a half-mile, but could not sustain the rally. ITS ABOUT
ME was no factor inside. KINDHEARTED KOTA got bumped by TUESDAY'S ROSE and was slow into stride, and never reached contention. MINESHAFT
MADNESS was four wide and between horses midway on the turn, and was finished soon after that. MYFRANCESCA saved ground and dropped far back
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
JAXON'S GOLDIE broke sharply and angled over on a clear early lead slightly off the rail, repelled a challenge from VALID EXCHANGE late on the turn,
and was driving to stay clear inside on his left lead. SUNDOWN KID lost ground to the leaders on the turn despite urging, gradually got going again after
straightening away for the drive, but could not seriously menace the winner. VALID EXCHANGE lodged a bid outside JAXON'S GOLDIE nearing the
quarter-pole, but weakened through the furlong grounds on his left lead. TRIBUTE FLAG was outsprinted four wide around the turn, and improved mildly on
the far outside. MONEY HOUSE raced four wide, and lacked the needed response. FAYEZ was no threat through an even effort near the three-path.
PATERFAMILIAS steadied on the rail behind BIG'S GRAY DAY near the half-mile pole, moved out around the turn and could not recover. TRINNI DANCER
saved ground to no avail. BIG'S GRAY DAY broke out, moved in from the two-path after a quarter-mile, and tired after three furlongs. ONELETHALCAT hit
the right side of the gate and lacked room behind BIG'S GRAY DAY and FAYEZ at the start, and was always far back. EL LATINO broke slowly and showed
nothing. EL ANDARIEGO dropped far back early.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY lagged well back for a half-mile, kicked in suddenly along the rail approaching the quarter-pole, slipped through and blew by a spent
TWEET AWAY ROBIN in upper stretch, and drew off while mostly hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS was driven around the
turn three then four wide, and rallied to go clear of the rest through the late stages. SWEET MIA tracked outside the battling leaders for a half, and was
empty in the stretch. TWEET AWAY ROBIN dueled inside SWEETHEART DEAL through fast fractions, drifted off the rail turning for home and weakened.
RUN DEVIL swung five wide approaching the stretch, and had no rally. CHEZ PAREE was no factor two wide. SWEETHEART DEAL pressed TWEET
AWAY ROBIN from outside through a sharp half-mile, and was finished nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
KOKOKOMO saved ground unhurried early at the back, was driven with little response on the far turn, stayed inside for the drive, and slipped through inside
JUSTINTHENICKOTIME late to get up. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME waited behind the leaders a quarter-mile out, got through on the fence to take over in mid
stretch, drifted out slightly enabling the winner to get through, and was overhauled near the finish. AFICIONADO edged a bit closer to the leaders after six
furlongs, was in traffic through upper stretch, and finished with good courage to get the show. CADET CONNELLY saved ground on hold entering the
backstretch, was boxed in going to the far turn, got out past the quarter-pole with aim in the four-path, but flattened out late. MECHA CORTA vied outside
DIAMONDS ENJOY for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. DIAMONDS ENJOY vied for command inside MECHA CORTA, and weakened in upper
stretch. RIGGINS was in or near the three-path most of the initial six furlongs, and lacked a solid response. MYSTIC LANCELOT had aim outside the
leaders into the far turn, but weakened after six furlongs.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO settled in midpack early, edged closer to the leaders in the two-path after a half-mile, split foes in upper stretch, moved clear past the
furlong marker and kept SILVERLY ENOUGH at a safe distance late. SILVERLY ENOUGH brushed the left side of the gate to begin a step slow, saved
ground outrun for a half, angled wide into the stretch and finished strongly outside. VINNIE VAN GO was in tight on the rail off the early leaders, checked
just past the half-mile pole, went out four wide advancing at the top of the stretch, loomed through the furlong grounds but weakened in the late stages.
CPT. RHETT BUTLER raced four wide around the turn, had aim outside the leaders through mid stretch, but was outfinished. ARRIVEDERLA lagged well
back to the stretch, and improved belatedly on the far outside. STAR JUANCHO vied in the two-path inside HARRYHEE early, moved to the rail around the
turn, and gave way after a half-mile. HARRYHEE vied outside STAR JUANCHO early, edged clear briefly nearing the quarter-pole, and gave way inside
challengers through upper stretch. UNPUBLISHED leapt at the break coming out several lengths slow, fanned six wide off the turn and could not gain.

Footnotes
MAX K. O. grabbed the lead and rated along through an easy half-mile, picked up the tempo around the far turn keeping ON A SPREE at arm's length, and
had plenty left through the drive to stay well clear. ON A SPREE prompted the pace outside MAX K. O. from the outset, could not cut into the margin under
a drive on the far turn, and ran on second best. NEW YEAR raced in the second flight two wide to the far turn, moved farther out for the drive and was up
outside rivals for third. DOVER CLIFFS raced evenly near the three-path to the lane, and was no threat with an even finish. KING OTTOKAR chased the
leaders inside for six furlongs, and tired. ZIPPY was no factor toward the inside. SURF SHACK raced two to three wide on the turns, and made no impact.
DYN stayed in range three wide to the far turn, and tired after six furlongs. LONG GRAY LINE was outrun three wide. DERBY CHAMPAGNE trailed inside.

Footnotes
WIN WITH PRIDE tracked outside the leaders three wide, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. R MERCEDES BOY settled in the middle of the field
two then three wide early, and was up late outside FRONT LOADED to get the place. FRONT LOADED pressed the pace outside SOUTH SEA, reached a
short lead past the five-sixteenths, could not cope with the winner into the lane, and lost second in the closing stages. UNCAPTURED KING broke a step
slow, was outrun for a half-mile, came five wide into the lane and improved on the far outside. GREEN MANSIONS saved ground to the stretch, and lacked
a rally. FIRST AND THREE was outrun throughout. SOUTH SEA sprinted clear early and moved inside, got collared late on the turn, and folded up.
BENEFACTOR tired around the turn four wide, and was eased up late. INDY RIDE dropped back two wide after a half, and was eased up in the stretch.
