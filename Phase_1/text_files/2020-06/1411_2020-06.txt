Footnotes
QUITE A BABE was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the three or four path and three wide, was a serious threat
outside the eighth pole, moved to near even terms with the next two near the sixteenth pole and slowly edged up. HYPNOTISING set the early pace then
was joined by another in late turn, dueled with that one through the lane, was joined by the winner on the outside, put away previous challenger in deep
stretch but was not good enough to hold the winner safe. VIVIAN pressed then dueled with the runner-up through the turn and into the lane, was between
the top two in deep stretch while still a serious threat then yielded late. QUIET CONTENDER chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the
lane then lacked a closing response. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was never a factor while along the inside. FROSTED JUSTICE was never a menace while
traveling near the the rail. TOO CROWDED was between rivals through the turn when towards the back and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
EVER WONDER set the pace from the outset, widened through then turn and into the lane, shook up nearing the eighth pole then was hand ridden the final
sixteenth. OBSOLETE was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then moved up from mid-track while hand ridden
and second best. FIRST LADY MAGGIE chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the top one and was under steady pressure
to last to the for show spot. SILKEN GOODS chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a response. COUNTRY
DREAMIN was never a factor while near the inside. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS never menaced while racing through the three path on the turn. PICANTE
CALIENTE was pressing the pacesetter into the turn when in tight, checked and dropped well back and was never in it thereafter.

Footnotes
BETTER CHARGE IT chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved closer in late turn, came into the lane from the four path then drove past
the leader and cleared. ONE FOR RICHIE vied for the lead along the inside, repelled challenger and cleared into the lane, was joined by the winner outside
the eighth pole, had no answer for that one and settled for second best. ELZABE'S ON BOARD bobbled at the start then hustled to vie for the lead through
mid-turn, could not keep up into the lane but kept on to be well clear for the show spot. WESTWOOD PROUD was along the inside through the turn, angled
into the five path for the drive and lacked a rally. STEEL SHOT raced well off the inside and in the five path, came in the lane from the seven path and never
was a factor. BEVERLY PARK was close up early from the three path then steadily lost ground. ROOSTER was outrun while along the inside.

Footnotes
SUNSET VALLEY pressed the pacesetter two wide through mid-turn, dueled with two others through the lane, was on near even terms with an eighth to go
then put the other two away in the last seventy yards. SEMINOLE SISTERS was in the three path through the turn, bid there wide into the lane to be on
near even terms for the lead, continued between rivals until inside the eighth pole then could not keep up with the winner late and kept on to save the place
spot. ELITE ATTRACTION was in the three or four path through late turn, bid four wide into the lane, loomed a serious threat while in the six path with an
eighth to go, continued on near even terms inside the eighth pole then hung. TOUCH OF BLESSING was along the inside through the turn and moved up
while not a threat. MARINA NIGHT was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path then drifted to the rail while tiring. SHE'S A
SALTY B was never a factor while moving through the two to the four path in the turn and coming into the lane widest. SUN SEEKER vied for the lead along
the inside and was done nearing the quarter pole. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART was done early from the two path.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S RUMOR saved ground through both turns while racing behind a wall of four rivals, angled off the rail into the lane and into the two path, inched up
on the pacesetter through the lane and edged up late in a perfect trip. PEEKACHO set the pace along the inside while under pressure throughout, shook
clear into the lane, remained clear with an eighth to travel while staying in the two path then could not hold the winner safe while settling for second best.
QUALITY STEP chased then pressed the pace into the far turn, was still a serious threat entering the lane then could not keep up with the top two. MARV'S
MAGIC was near the rail when unhurried, continued near in the inside into the lane then moved up while not a serious threat. IMPERIAL MISSION pressed
the pace down the backstretch, continued to race four wide through the far turn and weakened after entering the lane. NO CENTS LEFT raced inside
through the turns and moved up while never a menace. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, began losing contact
with the top ones after mid-turn then was empty in the lane. FIRST MASAMUNE was done after traveling a half in the three path. BOURBON N LIME was
never a factor while in the two or three paths through the turns. DURRETT LANE was finished entering the far turn while in the two path. THE STORY
BEGINS was fractious in the gate and needed to be reloaded, raced far back thereafter.

PERFECT MISTAKE was unrushed early in the five path, rallied through the stretch and was up in time. PAQUIME pressed the pace in the three path,
dueled through the stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner. INSOFAR pressed the pace between foes,dueled through the stretch but couldn't gain. FAST
BOB stalked the pace in the five path, then rallied late. INNIS raced inside but lacked a late bid. NIAGARA CHARLIE raced evenly in the four path.
ATWATER was unrushed between foes and then had no bid. RUNABILITY was not a factor. WORKIN IT led inside to the quarter pole before giving way.
GRAND DEAL saved ground to no avail.
