inside under some urging and a vigorous hand ride in the drive to gain the lead a sixteenth out and gamely prevailed. CLAIM OF PASSION four wide early,
stalked three deep, bid three wide between foes leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch, drifted in and took a short lead nearing miidstretch,
battled outside the winner in the final furlong and continued willingly to the end. DIA DE PAGO stalked outside, bid four wide leaving the second turn and
five wide into the stretch, drifted in three deep nearing midstretch and held third. KNIFES EDGE stalked three wide then outside a rival, bid alongside the
pacesetter on the backstretch and between foes leaving the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. ROGALLO pulled between horses
then chased outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. GRYFFINDOR tugged along the
inside early, saved ground chasing the pace and weakened in the drive. TACO WACO sped to the early lead and angled in, set a pressured pace inside,
came a bit off the rail into the stretch, drifted in ;late and also weakened.

again three wide on the second turn and into the stretch and gained the lace. CLEARLY GONE angled in and stalked inside, steadied off heels on the first
turn, went between horses to stalk the pace on the backstretch and second turn, continued between foes in the stretch and edged rivals for the show.
KITTYHAWK LASS saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, split rivals in midstretch and deep stretch and was edged for third. DORITA'S
LEMON chased three deep then outside a rival on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and was outkicked for a minor award.
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE angled in and pulled her way along to chase the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and also was outkicked for
a minor share while finishing even for fifth. TEACHERS BIG DREAM was angled to the inside on the first turn, saved ground stalking the pace, inched
forward in the drive, steadied off heels a sixteenth out and split foes late. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace inside,
fought back in the stretch and weakened late. WIND TARTARE (FR) settled off the pace inside, saved ground to the stretch, came a bit off the rail in the
drive and lacked a rally.

to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and proved best. CAPTIVATE tugged along the inside then stalked just off the rail, went outside a rival on the second
turn and three deep into the stretch and gained the place. FABOZZI had speed outside a rival then inched away leaving the first turn, set the pace a bit off
the rail then inside, fought back past midstretch and held third. CONTAGION stalked outside a rival then just off the rail leaving the second turn and into the
stretch and did not rally. PUBILIUS SYRUS angled in and chased outside a rival then off the rail into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response.
THE CREEP pressed then stalked the pace inside, fell back into the stretch and weakened. TOUGH IT OUT settled off the pace inside, saved ground to the
