Footnotes
STERLING MISS was unhurried while racing near the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the two or three path, raced behind a wall after
straightening in the lane, angled to the rail when seam presented then drove clear the last sixteenth. HOPTOWN HONEY set the pace while near the inside
through the turn and under pressure, repelled challenger outside the eighth pole then was joined by others, continued with the advantage approaching the
sixteenth pole then could not hold the winner safe while keeping on to stay for the place spot. HAYNESFEST was in the three or four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the six path and gained energy late to be up for the show spot. NO CACHA NA (CHI) chased the pace from the three path through
the turn, continued in the four or five path through the lane, could not threaten the winner and lost the show spot late. DISCREET BEAUTY pressed the
pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, was still a serious threat with and eighth to go then weakened. PORTAL CREEK saved ground throughout
and weakened late. TELL ME IM PRETTY was in the four to the three path through the turn then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
RIVER ECHO (GB) set the pace while on a short lead, widened into the lane while under hand urging and extended to near the wire and geared down.
CAIRN chased the winner from the three path through the turn, was no match for the winner and was all out through the final eighth to gain the place spot.
ZANESVILLE was off with a slight hop, put in tight and shut off in the first thirty yards, raced in the back while in the three path, came into the lane from the
five or six path and moved up late, just missing the place spot. BLUE STEEL came in soon after the start, moved to press the winner into the far turn, was
asked for more after the three-eighths pole and weakened through the final eighth. ONLYATTHESHOE was bothered early when bumped and jostled
around, raced along the inside through the far turn, came off the inside entering the lane and never was a threat. QUICKSILVER was off to an awkward
start, forced inward by outside rival, continued to be herded inward until checked hard, raced in near the inside through the far turn when tracking the
leaders then tired in the lane. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN JOCKEY OBJECTION #7 BLUE STEEL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH
AND PLACED SIXTH (LAST) FOR ANGLING INWARDLY AND CAUSING #6 QUICKSILVER TO CHECK SHARPLY, SHUTTING OFF #5 ZANESVILLE
AND BOTHERING #4 ONLY AT THE SHOE SOON AFTER THE START.

Footnotes
CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE settled early while off the inside, advanced through the three or four path on the turn, came into the lane with momentum and steadily
wore down the leaders and cleared. MY MAN BECKETT vied for the lead three wide through the turn, shook off two challengers after straightening but could
not hold the winner safe while keeping on to be clear for the place spot. RUH ROH RAGGY vied along the rail through the turn with two others, continued as
a serious contender into the lane then could not keep up with the top ones. RAINY DAY DREAMIN was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and
lacked a closing response. SUNDAY DRIVE raced from the rail to the three path through the turn, came into the lane widest and moved up a couple places
while not a threat. RECTIFIED vied for the lead along the inside through the turn then gave way in late turn. ABE was near the rail and made little impact.
STEPHEN'S TALE was done early while in the four path through the turn.

Footnotes
KRUNCH stalked the two rival duel for place from the three path, was asked for more in late turn, quickly gained the lead after entering the lane and
widened while being kept to the task. DRINKATTHECREEK tracked the duel from the two path into the turn, was well placed while never far back, angled
into the three path entering the lane, shifted further out nearing the eighth pole then could only chase the winner home while clearly second best. PRETTY
ASSETS was unhurried and trailed the field through mid-turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and showed good energy through the lane.
BLACK SAPPHIRE pressed then vied for the lead while along the inside, continued in contention into the lane then gave way. CHRISTIAN MISS vied for the
lead while in the two path through the turn then faded through the lane. MISS TIZCAT was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. MIRACLES
TAKE TIME made no impact while saving ground.

Footnotes
AMAZIMA stalked the pace inside, waited at the quarter pole for room, bid between foes at the eighth pole and drew off late under mild urging. HIGH ROAD
stalked the pace in the two path, then couldn't hold off the winner. LADY STELLA was bumped early, trailed inside, had no room at the quarter pole and had
a mild late bid. WAR CABINET stalked in the two path, then had no late bid. MORE ROSES stalked the pace in the four path, then faded in the stretch.
ZUZANNA stalked in the four path with no bid. TIA FLOR bid six wide on the far turn before fading. FINAL CUT was clear early inside, then gave way in the
stretch.
