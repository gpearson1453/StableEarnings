Footnotes
EMBELLISHER was forwardly placed three wide, inched forward outside of the leading duo to make a bid at the five sixteenths pole, forged a slight lead in
upper stretch from his inner game foe, then cleared away from that rival inside the final sixteenth. SUSPECT set the pace along the inside, dug in gamely
once headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, but gave way in the final sixteenth. UGO advanced in the four path and outside of rivals turning for
home, came into the lane in the five path, but leveled off and achieved show in the late stages without threatening the leaders. FLATTEN was off slowly,
rallied four wide from far off of the pace turning for home, shifted inside of rivals in upper stretch, then offered a mild kick for a minor reward. EPIC WEST
lied close up behind the inner leader through the turn, tipped to the four path straightening into the stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid. BOSS HUGO
was off slowly, trailed the field around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, then passed tired foes with a mild kick. JUDGE JOHNNY saved
ground to no avail. APPLE EMPIRE failed to threaten while racing two to three wide. RIGHT THE WRONG vied for the lead outside of SUSPECT around
the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. CONQUISTADOR SHOW saved ground from midpack, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
SPELLING BEE was never involved. SIGESMUND was forwardly placed two wide between horses early on, but failed to keep pace at the half mile pole,
and was done early.

Footnotes
DARREN'S FORTUNE achieved perfect inside stalking position behind the leading duo into the first turn, raced a bit keen around that bend due to the slow
early place, tracked from the pocket around the far turn, split foes two wide effortlessly as COME ON VENEZUELA's rider let him out at the quarter pole,
then drew clear passing the furlong pole. ROARING FORK set an easy and uncontested lead with his ears pricked down the backstretch, responded once
asked passing the quarter pole, repelled his outer counter part, but was quickly hounded by DARREN'S FORTUNE in upper stretch, then proved no match
for that foe at the furlong pole, and was only second best. PAYNT YOUR EGGS trailed the field around the far turn, swung five wide turning for home, and
produced a mild kick outside of tiring rivals for a minor reward without threatening. LAGOON MACAROON tracked from midpack in the three path around
the turns, but failed to make a bid. HOMEFORTHEWEEKEND was restrained from getting early postitioning at the start, raced far off the pace two wide,
then three to four path around the far turn, but failed to factor. NAPOLEON'S EMPIRE saved ground from off the pace, but came under a drive into the far
turn and failed to respond. COME ON VENEZUELA was sent from the start to prompt the early pace setter, was a bit keen around the first turn due to the
slow early pace, vied around the far turn, but weakened after shifting to the three path to allow racing room for the eventual winner at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MOON OVER MIAMI tracked from midpack in the two to three path around the turns, rallied between horses in midstretch to make a bid approaching the
sixteenths pole, and kicked clear approaching the wire. BUY ME CANDY set the pace along the inside, dug in gamely as multiple foes made bids through
the lane, continued to vie to the sixteenth pole, but was bested approaching the wire. ATTORNEY TIM saved ground around the turns while rating off of the
pace, shifted to the four path in midstretch and offered a good late kick between foes through the final sixteenth, but missed place at the wire. KING THEO
vied two wide, dueled for the lead through midstretch, but weakened at the sixteenth pole. MANTRA stalked along the inside before shifting to the three path
around the far turn, produced a bid in upper stretch, but flattened out at the furlong pole. HELLORHIGHWATER gained ground in the three to five path
around the far turn before swinging to the seven path turning for home, then stayed on mildly outside of rivals. ONAROCK was brushed by an inner foe at
the start, saved ground and advanced along the rail down the backstretch, lied in range of the leaders along the inside through the far turn and midstretch,
but weakened in the late stages. WHERE'S OLIVER trailed the field around both turns, swung to the eight path in midstretch, but failed to factor.
HACKBERRY stumbled at the start, then failed to factor. MOTAGALLY tracked from midpack in the two path, swung to the five path between horses turning
for home, but lacked a kick after switching leads approaching the furlong pole. EL AHIJADO broke outwards, but was forwardly placed two to three wide
around the turns, but weakened through the lane. BANTU tracked from midpack three wide, swung to the six path turning for home, but weakened between
horses at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
PARTYLICIOUS set the pace along the inside, shook loose from foes at the quarter pole when let out a notch, then was driven at the furlong pole to extend
her advantage, responded willingly, and was geared down approaching the wire. MADAME OVERSERVED bumped an outer foe at the start, was forwardly
placed three wide before inching forward to make a three wide bid at the five-sixteenths poie, but failed to match strides with the inner pace setter turning for
home and was headed by MOVIE MOXIE for place at the quarter pole, then dug in and regained place from that foe inside the furlong pole while proving no
match for the winner. MOVIE MOXY brushed the gate while lunging inwards at the start, was forwardly placed two wide, gained ground outside of rivals into
the turn to produce a four wide bid at the quarter pole, reached place in upper stretch, but flattened out at the furlong pole. NORMA JEAN B. was off slowly,
saved ground while off of the pace into the turn, swung to the five path passing the five sixteenths pole, then produced a mild rally without threatening.
SPEIGHTY SHIRL stalked along the inside, got rank behind the leader at the nine sixteenths pole, then again at the half mile pole, tried to bera out while
midpack along the inside through the turn, but was corrected with her head turned left through the bend, shuffled and steadied behind BELLEINTHECITY
turning for home, then failed to factor afterwards. TUFF BIRD failed to factor from the two path. BELLEINTHECITY bumped a foe at the start, vied two wide
early on, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BELLUCCI brushed the gate, bumped an inner foe, then veered outwards at the start, then failed to
factor. CONGRATULATED broke outwards then was bounced around between horses, tracked from the four path, but weakened, then was vanned off after
failing to return to the winners circle to be unsaddled.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRAZY broke well but retreated through the field through the early stages, came into the turn far off of the pace two wide between horses, was
driven turning for home, advanced, but was blocked behind horses in upper stretch, shifted inwards at the furlong pole, and surged between rivals in the late
stages to get up approaching the wire. SPITEFULNESS prompted the pace setter from the two path, forged a lead from that foe at the five sixteenths pole,
drifted to the three path at the quarter pole, held a clear advantage through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, then was bested in the late stages.
DUPLICITOUS stalked along the inside, waited behind the leaders turning for home while a path off of the inner rail, shifted inwards as the leader drifted out
in upper stretch, produced a bid inside of rival in midstretch, but was outkicked in the closing stages. GOLD CREDIT bobbled at the start and trailed the field
early on, advanced three wide around the far turn before shifting to the five path turning for home, and produced a mild rally outside of foes. TAKE CHARGE
ERICA was forwardly placed three wide, made a bid between horses turning for home, but got outfinished. UNFADING BEAUTY was off slowly, shifted to
the four path at the half mile pole, advanced to striking range around the far turn, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole.
READYFORMYCLOSEUP broke a bit out, saved ground while off of the pace through the turn, then failed to factor. ROYAL PRIORITY set the pace along
