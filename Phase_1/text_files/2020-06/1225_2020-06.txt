Footnotes
STAR OF THE WEST initially hustled from the starting gate, was switched over to a lighter hand ride after establishing the top, moved inward, eventually
getting set up in the two path, showed the way, tailed by a pair of opponents to the outside, kicked clear of them as the half was being completed, enough
so as to lead the competition into the stretch by a comfortable advantage, was in vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker when finally asked for more, gave
the desired response to remain well clear. COBBLE HILL leaned from between as the field was sent off and running, underwent a two to three wide pursuit
to the end of the bend, was swung about six wide into the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the place, albeit as no threat to the top one. VERO SUN
off the inside throughout, took up the chase approximately four wide on the turn, was slighter nearer to the rail at the commencement of the stretch run,
lacked the needed response in the final furlong and had to settle for the show. LOST IN ROME achieved position in midpack prior to arriving at the end of
the backstretch, departed it towards path three, got angled five wide early during the stretch run, lacked a solid closing punch. KILMARKNOCK pressed the
winner three wide for a half before giving way. CARNEGIE SONG remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been released, flashed some
interest during the run around the bend, was forced to be kept on hold caught in traffic from around the three-sixteenths pole until midlane, tipped three wide
and into clearance, then continued onward with mild run. WATCH THE DIP two wide chasing the pace until the quarter pole, came up empty. DODGED A
BULLET parked out five wide on the turn, was a couple of paths wider at the head of the stretch, never made its presence felt. TIPAZO sent over to the rail
at the half mile pole, tracked the winner, came under stronger encouragement by the three-eighths pole, went into the stretch and faltered. STATE OF MINE
five wide onto the turn, was more in the six path exiting it, had no rally. WISECRACK attended STAR OF THE WEST two wide until midway on the turn and
folded.

Footnotes
SMILE BRYAN bumped at the start by HONOS MAN who broke inwards, tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home advancing steadily on the front through the latter portion of the turn to take over command swinging three to four wide into upper stretch,
drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, had some of that margin cut into while kept busy to the wire. HONOS MAN broke in at the start bumping the
aforementioned SMILE BRYAN, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and
dug in willingly battling head to head through the final sixteenth with BRAY and just got the nose decision on the line for the place honors. BRAY tracked the
pace along the inside from the tail of the field, came under encouragement midway on the far turn, tipped out two to three wide with five-sixteenths to go
before spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, kicked on with good energy knocking heads to the finish with HONOS MAN but was ultimately bested on
the wire for the place honors while clear of the rest for show. MANDATE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and improved position in the final furlong. FOTIS just off the pace two to three wide down the backstretch, began to get shaken of a
bit into the far turn and came under coaxing three furlongs out in response, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. YES FOR LESS
shied in at the start filling the space left vacated by the breaking inwards HONOS MAN, raced two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field,
came under a ride at the three-eighths, went four wide for home and was unable to make an impact. POLAR BEAR PETE well off the inside out of the dog
legged chute into the backstretch, raced five paths off the rail in closest aim of the early leader before advancing to poke a head in front just inside the six
furlong marker, showed the way tucking inside half a mile from home shaking away while patiently handled to a safe lead, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, got overhauled spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. RIVER KNIGHT established the front from the get go and showed the
way in hand tucking to the inside down the backstretch, came under some pressure and was headed for the front with six furlongs remaining, got coaxed
along through the far turn giving chase two to three wide, went three wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
PRISONER under some hand urging just about from the get-go, became engaged with FAUCI from the shadow of the starting gate onward, cut over to the
rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, raced as a team eye to eye with the aforementioned rival, with the nemesis being the more
confidently-handled of that pairing, got set down a short distance from the quarter pole, came out a path coming up to and then once again leaving the
eighth pole, in each instance from some left side stick work, managed to steadily lenghten away nevertheless, then completed the final forty yards having
been geared down. FAUCI cut over into the two path shortly after the field had been sent off and running, sparred with PRISONER directly abreast, pilot
holding something in reserve all the while, got cued up challenging in earnest as the twosome made their way onto the head of the stretch, shifted one path
wider himself each time the winner went outward itself, this occurring from the furlong grounds until a slight ways beyond the furlong marker, got outfinished.
INDOCTRINATE three to four wide in pursuit of the first two finishers, was more the latter by the top of the lane, proved no match. GAROPPOLO underwent
a ground-saving journey, failed to pick it up when asked at the midway point of the turn. TOURRISTA away the tardiest, was four wide entering the turn and
five wide leaving it, backed away the lane basically going about it under his own power.

honors. MONEYMEISTER four then three wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the
last major share. STONE BREAKER three to four wide just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. PROUD ENOUGH cut the pace under pressure from a pair coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside for home
clinging to the front, succumbed the lead straightened away and weakened. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened. SO SUBLIME pressed the
pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of getting shaken off, faded, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
BUSTIN THE RULES brushed the off side stall at the start when breaking outwards, chased seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
six wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, continued six wide into upper stretch and tired. H MAN three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. LUCKY SIX six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went seven to eight wide
through the turn coming under coaxing midway, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and was eased. MASSEY HALL chased six to seven wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and was eased. TOO FAST TO PASS six to seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, was easing to the finish
when abruptly pulled up inside the sixteenth marker suffering from an injury to the left front and was subsequently vanned off. GAULTIER (FR) stumbled
badly at the start belly flopping to the ground and lost the rider when recovering sharply inwards. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on
GAULTIER before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
STRONGERTHANUKNOW established the top in short order, showed the way rated along, followed by a pair of opponents to the outside, themselves out in
paths two and three respectively, got cued up spinning into the lane, drew out to lead by her largest margin during the ensuing furlong, squandered some of
that sizeable advantage thereafter but held sway. HELENE JACQUELINE took up the chase from the two path, was making her way through the furlong
grounds when asked for more getting into the three path, displayed some willingness en route for the place. FRACTORZATION prompted the winner from
path two, came under a brisk ride springing from the five-sixteenths marker, lacked the needed response. MAGNOLIA'S LADY settled into midpack after the
start, went over into the two path by the half mile pole, was still towards the same path spinning into the stretch, saw the rider take hold and altering sharply
into the five path in midstretch, mustered up a mild kick sufficient for the final significant slice of the purse. CRESCENT LADY underwent a three wide trip on
the turn, was one path farther off the rail entering the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. APOLLO'S ABRAXAS four wide stepping off the backstretch,
was in path five stepping off the turn, made no impact. GOTTA B BOLD tracked the pace spaced at a slight distance from off the rail for a half, had no rally.
SARATOGA LOVE firmly held during the opening phases, stalked the winner three wide, came under a ride attempting to challenge entering the lane,
proved not up to the task at hand and backed away. BOSTON GIRL bobbled after coming out of the starting gate in a sluggish manner, got guided over to
the inside route, went on to save ground to no avail. LEYTE tracked the winner from the pocket, was under urging cutting the corner into the stretch, gave
way. MIZZYS IMAGE along the inside, was never in it. REMOANE in path two pursing the front runners, was through before going a half.

Footnotes
MADITA (GER) bobbled at the break recovering outwards into SAY HEY, tracked three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, began to advance on that
rival and took over command just inside the five-sixteenths, got roused spinning just off the inside for home, edged clear under a drive to prevail.
XANTHIQUE two to three wide in pursuit, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, dug in with good energy dueling to the finish with PASSIVE INVESTING and bested that rival on the wire to secure the place honors. PASSIVE
INVESTING four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, dug in head to head with the
aforementioned foe running on to the finish but was ultimately bested for the place honors while along for the show. BAREEQA chased three to four wide
under tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position in the
drive. REPATRIATED GEM (GB) chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no headway.
HUNGRY KITTEN three then two wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
EXCESS CAPACITY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under growing threat
through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths just prior to succumbing the front inside that station, cut the corner into upper stretch and
tired. SAY HEY (FR) bumped at the start by MADITA who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from
home, offered up a mild bid with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside for home and tired. The six furlong internal fraction has been omitted pending
review. Race times added after video review

Footnotes
INSIDE INFO sparred for command from the two path, got roused entering the stretch, forged its way to the front by midlane and edged away. OUR
TROUBADOUR kept an eye on the front runners from just off the rail, swung three to four wide into the lane, displayed enough stretch energy to procure the
place. APEX PREDATOR rode the rail, was already under some encouragement by the start of the run around the bend, left the five-sixteenths marker
having been set down, made no late headway. BRONZE LION chased the pace from the two path, was slightly wider by the top of the lane, got outfinished
after getting called upon. BRUNATE took up position in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, was under a ride coming approximately five wide into the
lane, mustered up a mild response. LORENZEN gently pinched at the start, got set up along the inside route, was yet on it when forced to remain on hold
caught behind rivals coming up to the quarter pole, became clearer a sixteenth later, failed to fire appreciably when asked for more. MACHO BOY split rivals
early while being hustled along for the top, vied to maintain control from along the rail, was put to a ride for the drive home, got out-dueled by the winner
then steadily backed away. DAITHI had the rider bail off after acting up a bit in the gate, proceeded to break without apparent mishap, departed the
backstretch from path three, stepped into the lane and didn't prove a factor while improving somewhat. LOOK OUT JAYCE strung out four wide on the
bend, lacked the necessary stretch response. KABOB three wide off the backstretch, never made its presence felt. MR. FIDGET inside and devoid of speed
early, was always outrun. JACK RUSSEL hung out in the five path on the turn, tired. FOREST SPIRIT spotted three to four wide on the turn, was asked by
the five-sixteenths pole, folded.

Footnotes
VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) a bit rank early on under restraint behind a rival as a loose foe went on by outside, chased four then three wide from near the
rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command a sixteenth from home,
then inched away to the finish to prevail. CROSS BORDER three then two wide in closest range of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors. DREAM FRIEND showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped out nearing the top of the stretch to circle the loose rival along
the inside and swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive under threat, got collared a sixteenth from home and kept on to preserve the show honors.
HAY DAKOTA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, kept on for the last major share.
FORTY UNDER chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. CONVICTION TRADE chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ARTHUR KITT (GB) just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear,
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride three furlongs out, went three wide into upper stretch and made no headway. THE LAST ZIP three
to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. HIDDEN SCROLL stumbled at the start
pecking the ground and lost the rider nearly tossing him over his head. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on HIDDEN SCROLL before
the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official. .

Footnotes
RUSHING FALL retained the advantage after breaking on top, was rated along towards the two path while showing the way, with GOT STORMY in
accompaniment from the outside, moved onto the inside route for the run around the far turn, with the primary pursuer following suit by moving closer to the
rail herself, was switched over to stronger handling right around the quarter pole, found herself two wide once again soon afterwards, gradually extended the
margin then held sway. CALL ME LOVE (GB) gradually guided into the pocket on the clubhouse turn, kept watch on the winner within striking distance,
proceeded to angle to the outside as three-quarters was being reeled off, wound up in the four path upon completion of the maneuver, had a good finish
down the center of the course rallying for the place. PASSING OUT loped along while mostly on the inside route, flashed some interest closing the gap
leaving the half mile pole, was under a drive cutting the corner into the lane, with a clear rail corridor available, got outkicked late. GOT STORMY bobbled at
the start, stalked the top one three to two wide, got put to a drive for the drive home, lacked the needed response and gave way. XENOBIA (IRE) underwent
a three wide pursuit to the half mile pole, was one path closer to the rail leaving that station, got steered out five wide into the lane, had no response and
backed away.

Footnotes
IN THE LOOP broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand from the three path under pressure from VENTUS to the outside, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under increasing pressure through the turn and got set down spinning just off the inside for home, inched away to the
eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. BEACH FRONT got bumped at the start by JUDITHS COUGAR due to pressure from PRETERNATURAL,
who broke inwards, then got pinched back in a jam of rivals, chased three to four wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home, while well clear of the rest and along second best. OUR
STORMIN NORMAN five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway,
cornered five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. LARCENY broke in at the start bumping SMIDGE
into BIG WONDER, chased four to five wide coaxed along along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
VENTUS pressed the pace of IN THE LOOP from the outside in the four path down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn in concert
with that rival, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went three wide into upper stretch shaken off and weakened in the final furlong. SPLIT
VERDICT broke a beat slow, chased three to four wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
PRETERNATURAL broke in at the start bumping JUDITHS COUGAR into BEACH FRONT and causing pressure that pinched both rivals back, chased four
then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and made no impact. BIG WONDER bumped at the start by
SMIDGE due to pressure from LARCENY, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide for home and tired. AWESOME ADVERSARY chased six to seven wide taking the overland route to no avail and
tired. SMIDGE got bumped at the start by LARCENY and in turn bumped BIG WONDER, raced six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. JUDITHS COUGAR squeezed back at the start between foes, chased three to four wide until tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. KAMPAI showed brief speed five wide down the backstretch,
tucked three then two wide through the turn backing away, spun just off the inside for home and faltered.
