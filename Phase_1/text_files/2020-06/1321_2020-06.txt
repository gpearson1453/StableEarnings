Footnotes
MORTY was the speed inside, ran clear up the backstretch, quickened on the turn, was clear in the stretch and just held off a rival to keep the win.
ABOGADA tracked the leader well off the pace, gave chase around the far turn and closed the gap quickly in deep stretch just failing to get up.
MALEFICENT QUEEN stalked the pace while racing toward the back, rallied heading into the stretch and finished well for the show. SPERLING was widest
through the first turn after starting last and being urged away from the gate, tracked the pace from the middle of the backstretch, rallied wide on the turn and
held off a rival down the stretch to gain fourth. TENACIOUS SALLY was unhurried early, moved up going into the far turn, battled a rival down the stretch for
a minor award and gave way late. MISS FRANK E was prominent early and faltered .

HEAVEN SENT ANGEL tracked leaders to the turn, roused outside in the final furlong to edge off in the final stages under good handling. HEIDI'S BACK
pace closest to rail, stayed well to deep stretch while outfinished to the wire in the waning stages. MY LITTLE LILY raced inside to the stretch, angled out
with a late run for show. LOVELY LADY LINDA pressed leader from two path but weakened in the drive. TING TANG lost best chance at start when swiping
the gate thus never close. MOBIL SONG never a factor at any call.

Footnotes
MR OPPORTUNITY quick to the front, set all pace, cleared through the stretch run and was all out to hold off runnerup. MY MAE DAY had trouble after the
start, raced way back to turn, swung widest past the quarter pole and was flying late while probably best today. ENJOY BASEBALL rushed up to chase
winner but faltered in the final furlong. DANZO close to pace early and backed from quarter pole. AGAINST THE LINE raced a wide trip throughout to finish
up mid track. PENTHOUSE KITTEN well placed to the turn from outside and emptied out in the stretch. MAXIMIZER could not keep up from inside.
ANOTHER EXPERIENCE was off slow and never a menace.

HOPTOWN HONEY moved up four wide on the turn, was under the whip to rally down the stretch and drove clear late to prevail. KAY BEE GEE dueled
between horses on the turn, could not withstand the winner and just held place at the wire. TIA FLOR chased the leaders to the turn, lost touch with them,
came back nearing the stretch and closed fast to just miss place. ALI BLUE went to the front inside, dueled around the turn, and gave way in the stretch.
BIRDACIOUS broke last and was unhurried, then closed late while a bit erratic in the stretch.

CAN'T TOUCH ME unhurried early, circled field turn out of the turn and ran away under vigorous hand urging as much the best. MISS VICKI good inside
speed, close up to the turn, but proved no match for the winner and all out to hold the place spot. ROBOTRON checked hard after the start, rider stood up in
the irons, recovered and responded to the turn while splitting horses inside the final furlong with a gallant effort to just miss the place spot. SPOT A KISS
inside to quarter pole, angled out into the stretch to move up late. PRINCESS DANIELA squeezed back sharply after the start, raced back to the stretch with
a wide move to improve position late. DRAMA RUN speed to the front, set the pace to quarter pole but weakened late. IVY O'DAY leaned in at the start,
rushed three to duel but faltered in the drive. ROSEBUD'S TIGER good position three wide throughout with no late kick when needed. LADY MAUKETTE
had a sharp break, dueled to the quarter pole and stopped badly in the stretch while inside.
