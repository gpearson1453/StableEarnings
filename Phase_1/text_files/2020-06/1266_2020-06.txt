Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION broke fast and was clear early, set the pace two wide to the stretch then responded in the drive and held determinedly. STEELE
ROAD broke a bit slow then hustled to stalk the winner three wide to the stretch, responded when set down and was gaining but too late. PEQUENO
MONTE pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. COOLCROSS was chasing to the turn, eased down to
the two path into the stretch but also could not make an impact. DYE MAKER had no speed and was dull.

I WILL YEAH (IRE) was on the pace from the outset, pushed away from AL MILLON BOB on the second turn, widened to mid stretch and held driving.
SYNTHETIC JOE chased the leaders to the half, was three wide to the stretch then could not catch the winner but was easily second best. NORTH FORK
had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. QUAZE VIPER also had no speed,
trailed to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but was not a threat in the drive. AL MILLON BOB hustled to duel for the lead outside the winner
for five furlongs, was outkicked to the stretch and tired. IRISH OUTLAW was eased in to save ground to the backstretch, remained inside to the stretch but
did not rally. LUCKY TWICE chased the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.

SIERRA SUNRISE tracked the leaders to the turn, was outside two others and three wide to the stretch then responded when set down, surged in the final
sixteenth and was up in time. CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE) dueled for the lead from the rail to the stretch, was headed in mid stretch but fought back
bravely but was nipped for the win. PRORIKA attended the pace outside a rival to the stretch, rallied to take a short lead to mid stretch, could not shake
loose and was tagged on the line. COLONEL DEERING was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on late.
INDIAN DANCER had no speed, came two wide on the turn then swung out widest for the drive and closed a gap. HOLD MY HOOPS stalked the pace two
wide to the stretch then gave way.

GIVE ME THE LUTE hustled to the front, kicked away in the two path to the stretch and held driving. FUENTE (GB) stalked the winner to the turn, was
fanned out to the four path to the stretch then was not a threat to the winner but bested the others. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE pressed the winner early, was
outkicked three wide to the stretch and finished evenly. DETANGLER was outrun to the turn then saved ground to no avail. POTENTE ALBA chased the
pace three wide, was outrun to the stretch and not a factor. SOUND JUDGMENT had no speed and was never a threat. TOMAHAWK TUESDAY was
always outrun.

Footnotes
DESERT DUDE was outrun to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then responded when set down, finished steadily and won driving. VASTLY DEEP
dueled for the lead early, pressed a rival from the rail to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch then could not stall the winner but gamely got the
place. DANGERSMYMIDDLNAME was on the pace outside a rival, inched away to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch then was outfinished. KONA
SKYE chased the pace to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive and gained some ground late. THE FILTER tracked the pace
three wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then lacked the needed late bid. CAJUN BETTOR had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but was
boxed inside the winner and behind the leaders from the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole and lost any chance.

going away. MEAL TICKET was allowed to settle to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive, was outfinished for the win but dug
in late to grab second. WICKED OLD FASHION stalked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to duel to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then was
weakening late. MORNING CYNN chased the pace to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. BOUNDFORJAMAICA set the pace to the second
turn, was overtaken at that point and did not rally. BLUE DIVA chased the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LET'S REJOYCE broke clear and was quickly in front, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded to pressure and held driving. DYNAMIC DUO
chased the winner from the rail to the stretch then finished gamely inside for second. AUTISMS WORLD tracked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then missed the place. A. P. PHAROAH was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. CAMZUL hustled to press the winner three wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. ISLAND HEAT got bumped
and took up shortly after the start, was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. PORT SAINT JOE was crowded
by HAWK HILL, bumped into ISLAND HEAT, chased the pace to the stretch then tired. INQUISITION broke out sharply into EXETER, bumped that one, had
no speed and was not a factor. HAWK HILL was bumped hard by EXETER, took up, had no speed and did not recover. EXETER was bumped hard by
INQUISITION, knocked into HAWK HILL and lost any chance. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and disqualified INQUISITION from eighth to
last for interference.
