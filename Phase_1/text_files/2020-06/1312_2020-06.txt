Footnotes
SWITHER'S SHORTCUT shifted to the three path into the turn to stalk the leading duelers from the outside, was roused to inch closer around the bend,
sustained his grinding rally in upper stretch to produce a three wide bid at the furlong pole, and edged an advantage approaching the wire. FIREHORN
dueled for the lead inside of QUEST FOR FIRE from the onset, edged clear of her outer foe in upper stretch, but was caught by SWITHER'S SHORTCUT in
the final stages. QUEST FOR FIRE dueled for the lead outside of FiREHORN around the turn, but failed to keep pace with rival in upper stretch, then was
outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong pole. CADRON FLATS was off two lengths slowly and trailed the field in the five path early on, shifted to the
inside into the turn, then back to the four path while inside of foes in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly without threatening. SOUTHSIDER saved ground
while trailing around the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane. SPARKYS SURPRISE stalked the pace four, then three, wide early on, but came
under a drive once weakening into the turn. TOWN DRUNK was bit keen two wide and between horses early on while forwardly placed, but failed to keep
pace with rivals into the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THOUGHTFULLY prompted the pace three wide early on, made a two wide bid for the lead while still in the three path at the five sixteenths pole, took over
from inner rivals in upper stretch as the rider searched for competition, and drew off readily through the lane while under mild hand urging. PRODIGY DOLL
came under coaxing while in range of, and behind, the leader passing the three furlong pole, shifted to the three path in upper stretch. failed to keep pace
with the eventual winner while staying on to prove second best. NAUGHTY NELLIE tracked from far off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, then
stayed on mildly through the late stages to get up for show at the wire. TRIP TO SEOUL was reluctant to load, set the pace along the inside early on, but
was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, then weakened further at the furlong pole before being nipped on the wire for show. CLEAR STEPS
bobbled a bit at the start, lied in range of the leader in the four path around the turn, but hung on her left lead through the lane and weakened at the furlong
pole. SUMMER WAR was forwardly placed along the inside early on, but was taken up and lost multiple lengths of position at the half mile pole due to the
rider steadying when TRIP TO SEOUL cleared and crossed over in front of her path, then weakened into the turn. AMERICAN INDY stumbled at the start
and trailed the field in the four path early on, split foes three wide into the turn to commence a rally, spun to the five path turning for home while outside of
the leading group, but flattened out in upper stretch. LITTLE EMPIRE broke on top, but failed to keep pace with inner foes after a furlong, then weakened
into the turn. GOLDEN GLASS raced in midpack inside of rivals early on, but retreated to trail the field after a furlong and was done early.

Footnotes
SWEET CAROLINA set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from ADDISON around the far turn, dug in and gamely forged a wider margin from
that rival in upper stretch, then held off that foe's rerally in the late stages. ADDISON was bumped by C'EST MARDI at the start, stalked two wide before
inching forward between horses into the backtretch to vie for the lead, vied outside of SWEET CAROLINA around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with
that rival in upper stretch, somehow refound stride passing the furlong pole while between horses, came again in the late stages, but missed at the wire.
LEMON CHILL was a bit slow to get going after the gates opened, advanced in the two path around the far turn, made a three wide bid turning for home, but
failed to kick past, hung through the late stages, and was outfinished by an inner foe for place. LADY MCKENZIE was forwardly placed along the inside, cut
the corner turning for home and commirted to the inside, but failed to make a bid and weakened. ELUSIVE RIDE shifted off of the rail to the four path down
the backstretch, but failed to threaten. SHE'S HOT TODAY trailed early on, saved ground around both turns, but to no avail. C'EST MARDI broke outwards
and bumped a foe with her hind quarters, pulled keenly to vie for the lead outside of the eventual winner while in the three path into the first turn, settled and
stalked the pace approaching the five furlong pole, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
WHITE WOLF was forwardly placed three wide, inched forward and dueled with a pair of inner foes around the turn, forged a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, then held that margin from his game inner foe through the lane under a long drive. TAINO HOUSE pulled early on to set the pace along the inside,
dueled inside pair of rivals into and around the turn, but was headed by his outer foe in upper stretch, dug in gamely and battled on through the lane, but
failed to regain even terms. ITASCA lagged well behind the field through the turn, but sparked interest in midstretch to produce a belated rally inside of foes
for show. BOURBON BRYCE saved ground around the turn in midpack before veering out to the four path approaching the furlong pole, rallied between
horses while hanging on his left lead, but missed show at the wire. GOOD CLEAN FUN shifted from the two path to the rail while coming under a drive into
the turn, tipped to the three path while forging show in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid outside of the leaders, and was outfinished between
horses and got nipped at the wire for show. ARCHRIVAL raced off of the pace three to two wide into the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home to
attempt a bid, but only produced a mild kick outside of rivals. BROTHER MARTIN swung from the three path to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to
make an impact. MR. CLASS bobbled at the start, raced off of the pace two wide between horses, and failed to factor. YAMATO broke outwards, raced far
off of the pace three wide around the turn, swung to the five path turning for home, but failed to make an impact. SIETE LEGUAS prompted the pace two
wide, vied between horses into the turn as WHITE WOLF made a three wide bid, but weakened between horses turning for home and subsequently
stopped.

Footnotes
HARD BELLE set the pace along the inside early on, shook loose from rivals in upper stretch to build a clear margin approaching the furlong pole, and held
under driving pressure. P R RADIO STAR stalked from along the inside while just behind the leaders into the turn, waited for racing room turning for home,
stayed inside and forged place from outer foes at the three sixteenths pole, tipped off of the rail to be outside of the leader passing the furlong pole, and
sustained a late rally, but was fended off. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL was reluctant to load, broke outwards and was sent in the early staged to vie for the lead
two wide between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader in upper stretch, then kept on to secure show. PAT DADDY shifted from
the three path to the five path while midpack turning for home, produced a bid for place at the furlong pole, but flattened out and hung for minor rewards.
TOUCHING RAINBOWS shied mildly from BOYFRIEND MATERIAL breaking outwards at the start, but was restained and taken back to trail due to the
incident, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, swung to the six path turning for home, and failed to factor. HOONANI ROAD saved ground
while far off of the pace, but to no avail. CHARGE THE LINE was restrained back early on to trail the field into the turn, shifted from the two path to the four
path around the bend, but failed to factor. DURANGO KID prompted the pace three wide, made a bid for the lead in the four path turning for home, but
reacted awkwardly to vicious crosses thrown by the rider in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole.
