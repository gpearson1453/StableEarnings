Footnotes
FLYIN' EASY was ridden along in third position, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up while still on his
inside lead into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. WILDCAT'S BLING was hustled to the lead, set the pace under heavy pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear coming to the three-sixteenths, responded well under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a
right-handed whip outside the sixteenth and was caught late while clear for the place. SILVER AND ACES was ridden along towards the front on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. A MIDNIGHT GIFT was coaxed along off the
pace, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. FORTI broke a bit slow, settled near the middle of
the field, was urged three wide early on the turn, moved four then five wide later on that bend, came six wide into the stretch, continued on his inside lead
until inside the sixteenth-pole and also finished willingly. INFINITE JETSETTER showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path
on the turn, dropped back approaching the three-sixteenths and weakened. COLONEL BOWIE was hard ridden off the pace, moved in midway down the
backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to rally. BERN BAN dropped back while urged along,
went two then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TEXAS STORM CHASER was urged along while well back in the field, saved ground on the turn
and was no factor. TEXAS GOLD RUSH was ridden along on the outside, dropped from five to three wide early on the turn and was no factor. CHODY N
DANIEL was off slow and tossed his head while taken up badly, spotted the front many lengths, angled in at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and
trailed.

Footnotes
CYPRESS POINT broke in the air and was off slow, spotted the front about three lengths, moved up under urging, raced inside early on the turn, shifted
three wide near the quarter-pole then rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out under a
left-handed whip at that point then was switched to a right-handed whip and powered clear under good handling. ZABETTE was ridden along while well
back on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then angled out and
finished with good energy to just get the place. LYNAH RINK was hustled from the start then hard ridden off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn,
steadied behind a rival coming to the furlong marker, gained momentum outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to just miss the place
while narrowly able to get the show. EMMPORT brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside, vied four wide on the turn, took the lead in
the five path into the stretch, led into the final furlong, bore out badly from that point and was overtaken then missed the trifecta. BLINGIN' ROSE angled in
at the rear near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, gained into the final furlong, idled behind horses then
altered course to the inside of foes outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with late energy. DRIP BREW was hustled to the lead, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside foes on the turn, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled into the final furlong and
weakened. TEXAS MUSIC pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied between horses in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. SWANKY brushed with a rival at the start, was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
under the whip and came up empty. (Rail at 20 Feet)

MOMMA G was reluctant to load but broke very fast, lost the lead while out-sprinted by CHEME, entered the turn in the two path, shifted three then four
wide while chasing the leading duo, advanced to take the advantage in the five path into the stretch then kicked clear and maintained a safe advantage
under steady urging. TWICE SMITTEN bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up when foes crossed in front at the half-mile pole, went three wide under
urging for most of the turn then shifted four wide around the quarter-pole, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to secure the
place. LADY LUTE bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response
while able to get the show. MIDNIGHTONTHEBAYOU bumped with a rival at the start and was last away, moved in at the rear, climbed into the turn, saved
ground on that bend, moved out in the final sixteenth and improved position. CHEME bumped soundly with a rival at the start then reacted inward, was
hustled to the lead and contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn and tired. MY PRINCESS ELLIE was urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the five path, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LITTLE SAMURAI was hard ridden on the outside, rounded

Footnotes
ABOUT OUR TIME chased the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then carried out in pursuit of the leader, rallied
to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling. TRIPLE CREEK was well placed under urging, chased in the two path on the
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole and just missed while able to get
the place. O'L RED angled in while showing speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear along the rail on the turn, was set down into
upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the show. EXCITING was urged along at the rear of the field, saved ground on the
turn and improved position. BANJO BILL was ridden along off the pace, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. CALL ME RICHARD broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, raced towards the rear under urging, lugged out from the two path to
the four path on the turn and failed to threaten. PROUD ITALIAN settled on the far outside while towards the back, went five wide for most of the turn,
dropped to three wide late on that bend and was no factor. COWBOY BREEZE chased the pace on the outside, went five wide early on the turn then
dropped to three wide, was carried six wide into the stretch and came up empty. ELKHORN POET pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on
the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. (Rail at 20 Feet)
