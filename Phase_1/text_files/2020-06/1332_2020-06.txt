Footnotes
PASAMONTE MAN stalked from outside, took closer order into the turn still outside foes to contend four wide, took a narrow advantage turning for home,
inched away while being kept to the task late. ALMOST A STORM switched outside the leading foes midway up the backstretch then advanced rapidly
between rivals past the seven-sixteenths, vied between through the turn, put away inside rival at that juncture but was no match for the outside one while
continuing on gamely. A CEE DOO CEE was forwardly-positioned between runners, dropped back when in just a hair tight near the three-eighths then
asked to pick it up, went in the three then four path on the turn, came out a further path for the drive and kept on running late. TEXAS SWAGGER vied
outside a rival early then inside foes just off the fence into the turn, weakened gradually from the three-sixteenths on. STORM ON was outpaced early racing
last but one and well off the inside, went in the four to five path through the turn and had no rally. INSOMNIA briefly vied inside for about three furlongs,
steadily dropped back and weakened. EL BONGO broke a step slowly spotting the field a length out of the gate, trailed early, went two wide and outside a
rival on the turn and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
MY BOY ZAYN settled off the early leaders, began to advance on the turn in the three path, swung out leaving that bend and lightly bumped BUMBLEBEE
near the top of the stretch, took command and drew off under steady handling. BUMBLEBEE raced outside rivals mid-pack, went four wide on the turn
edging closer leaving that bend, was brushed lightly near the furlong marker by an inside rival, proved no match for that one but was second best. TALEGA
DE ORO contested the pace outside SICULO, lost ground on that one while three wide on the turn, regained control briefly at the head of the lane but was
no match for the top pair. SICULO forced the pace inside a rival but off the fence, edged clear on the turn, weakened gradually thereafter. WAY OFF
COURSE broke just a step slowly, settled outside toward the rear, kept in the four path on the turn, swung six to seven wide turning for home and gained
mildly. VIVARO was inside foes in behind the leaders, dropped back a bit early on the turn, shifted out passing the three-sixteenths, came into the stretch
four to five wide and ran on. INDY WAY broke just a step slowly, lacked early speed, raced just off the fence on the turn and was never a threat. ENROUTE
chased from inside rivals into the turn racing on or just off the fence, gave way and faded. Following an objection by the rider of BUMBLEBEE against MY
BOY ZAYN alleging interference at the top of the stretch no action was taken.

Footnotes
SUPER ACCORD bumped the outside rival at the start, coaxed forward in the two path heading into the first turn, pressed from inside a rival but off the
fence, moved to a narrow lead by the seven-sixteenths, shook clear on the far turn still just off the rail, was well clear into upper stretch and kept to the task.
KEEP ON ZENON ON exchanged some light brushes at the break, shifted in and raced inside into the first turn coming just off the fence a bit on that bend,
moved out further early up the backstretch racing a few paths off the rail but inside rivals, moved back in to the two path before the far turn, fought on inside
a rival to get up for place. MASTER RULER set the early temp from outside three wide, challenged by an inside rival up the backstretch, asked to keep up
with that by the five-sixteenths going three wide on the far turn, lost place late. HUSH'S STORM exchanged light brushes at the start, settled last but one in
about the three path on the first turn, advanced two to three wide on the far turn, moved out at the top of the stretch and ran on. REBACK HOME was just a
touch fractious in the gate, broke well and settled in behind the leaders while outside foes going three to four wide on the first turn, continued along outside
into the far turn going three to four deep on that bend and failed to rally. RIVER HEAD saved ground along the rail through both turns and inside foes while
mid-pack early but to no avail. EMBELLISHING BOB was hard to load, bumped at the start, raced at the rear moving off the inside early on the first turn
continuing in the two then three path on that bend before moving out wider still leaving that bend, continued a couple paths removed from the rail on the far
turn before shifting out six deep turning for home, failed to produce a bid. FINAL THUNDER chased from outside three to five wide throughout, came up
empty and faded.

Footnotes
TSURUOKA set the pace from off the rail facing outside pressure, went in the two to three path on the turn kicking clear of rivals turning for home, kept to a
drive and just lasted. SELL BABY SELL was bumped at the start then steadied, allowed to settle, entered the turn well back and in the two path, gradually
shifted out to the four path by the three-sixteenths before swinging widest to be seven deep at the top of the stretch, was gaining late but just missed. LEIGH
WHO lightly brushed a foe at the start, raced mid-pack off the inside, went two to three wide on the turn, came out a bit further turning into the stretch while
advancing between foes, kept on late but needed more. SHESAFASTCRICKET was just a touch fractious in the gate, raced off the leaders from outside,
went in the four path on the turn losing a bit of ground, came out six wide into the stretch and ran on evenly late. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM exchanged
brushes with inside and outside foes at the start, shifted in early up the backstretch, advanced inside to within striking distance, steadied just slightly at the
five-sixteenths and posed no late threat. CANCAN bumped the outside rival at the start, saved ground racing inside on the turn and ran on evenly.
REDHEAD STRONG was off slowly, raced last but one well off the inside early, shifted in from the five to the three path early on the turn and failed to
menace. RAIN MAGIC pressed the winner from outside, went three wide on the turn and came up empty for the stretch. TULAROSA STORM reared at the
start then steadied when in tight, was well back early racing off the inside in about the three to four path on the turn and failed to threaten. TELLINGLY
exchanged a light brush at the start, raced well off the inside toward the back going in the five path through the turn and failed to rally.
