Footnotes
SMASHVILLE broke well laying close up through the turn, surged clear in the four and five paths upper stretch holding firm the final eighth. PLAYLAND
tracked the pace emerging off a loose leader in the four path upper stretch chasing that one home saving place. FLEETING KITTY slow early saved ground
to upper stretch giving a solid finish along the rail. DREAMINGOFROSEALLA chased the pace weakening in upper stretch finishing evenly in the three path.
MISTERKAPLAN pressured the pace dueling through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. VERRABELLA dueled through the turn then wilted in upper
stretch. KYLESNORTHERNSTAR raced mid pack through the turn fading in the eight path upper stretch. TIMES GHOST was always outrun. GLEN'S MY
FRIEND offered little.

HIDE AND STREET stalked the pace pressing to put a head in front on the far turn, dueled abreast rival along the inside the final eighth edging clear late.
SHE'S THIRSTY broke sharply setting the pace being hooked along the inside on the far turn dueling in upper stretch ceding grudgingly along the rail.
VOLUPTUOUS a step slow to the far turn gave a mild rally five wide in upper stretch angling in finishing with even action, was vanned off after the race.
MISS OTIS slow early raced five wide down the lane improving some late. SILENT SOFIA raced mid pack failing to menace. MIDNIGHT LEAP played no
factor. BABY ISABELLA veered out leaving the gate. LIL' SMARTIEPANTS stalked the pace through the far turn, lost path steadying briefly near mid track
in upper stretch fading from there. WELLS NOTICE tracked the pace to the far turn then tired into upper stretch.

MY LITTLE STORMY unhurried early saved ground gaining to upper stretch, swung off the rail a sixteenth out arriving just in time. LOUPACATE (FR)
stalked the pace bidding clear on the far turn, widened in the three path upper stretch digging in late to no avail. BROKE FINANCING pressed to an early
lead would cede into the far turn weakening in upper stretch managing enough to hold off the others. MY BLACK BEAUTY hustled in pursuit chased to the
far turn wearing down six wide in upper stretch. CHASING THE KITTY tracked the early pace weakening into the far turn. MATT'S HONEY was never
involved. THORCERESS and GP'S AMAZING GRACE were always outrun. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter mild split was unavailable. Race times
added after video review.

Footnotes
I'M A LAWMAN tracked evenly through the turn bidding near mid track in upper stretch extending late three deep to prevail. SPOTTY ZEALOUS pressed
then chased on the turn, dueled abreast foe taking a late lead ceding to wide pressure in the closing yards. TWINSANITY chased the pace looming to upper
stretch rallying late to bid between horses in the closing yards. POLISHED STEEL sent hard was worked on pace through the turn, hooked on the inside in
upper stretch would weaken. MARTY WHO slow early lost ground to upper stretch giving a mild rally to improve eight wide. IF I raced evenly failing to
menace. DIAMOND RIDER raced mid pack wearing down to upper stretch. BIG HUNK played no factor. CUSTOM INFINITY was always outrun.
