Footnotes
SWEET BELEN hopped then was in tight at the break, hustled to clear after setting the pace widening on the turn, threatened near the quarter pole
responded holding gamely on the inside. PRINCESS KIAH a step slow through the turn rallied five wide in upper stretch closing in at the end. CECILIA'S A
GEM came out causing close quarters at the break, stalked the pace edging closer to loom near the quarter pole, lost momentum in upper stretch wavering
in the four path. SENSING MISCHIEF chased the pace through the turn weakening along the inside in upper stretch. DYNACASTLE pinched at the break
played no factor. SMASHVILLE was never involved. QUEENS WORLD offered little. DIAMOND LOVE raced mid pack giving way to upper stretch. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF DYNACASTLE AGAINST THE RIDERS OF CECILIA'S A GEM AND SWEET BELEN FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE
START WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
PERPETRATOR pressured the pace dueling to upper stretch extending up late near mid track. LIL BITTY ROAD hustled along chased through the turn
bidding six wide in upper stretch rallying up late to save place. BIRD CALL pressed the pace dueling along the inside to upper stretch extending late ceding
to outside pressure. RALLY WITH CLASS sent hard pressed the pace dueling on the inside to upper stretch ceding grudgingly late. MOOVIN ON MACHEN
hustled along chased on the turn, weakened in upper stretch finishing evenly. ABIE slow early played no factor. HEAT ROAD pressed early then faded on
the turn. STARSHIP THOR played no factor. OUT AT EIGHT chased while racing wide tiring in upper stretch. AMERICAN COTTON was always outrun.
