Footnotes
CHAMPITO was bumped first by the inside rival then a bit harder by the outside one at the start, was nevertheless forwardly-positioned pressing the pace
up the backstretch, went into the turn off that rival in about the four path but moving in a path soon when challenging, took the lead near the three-sixteenths
pole, edged clear into upper stretch then drew off under steady handling. MAIL MAN M G bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, settled into stride at the
rear while shifting in, advanced along the rail inside a rival early on the turn then moved out a path on that bend, swung four wide turning into the stretch and
moving between foes then continued to rally to secure the place. MORO MAN stalked from outside just off the leaders racing in the five path heading into
the turn, moved in just a bit early on that bend, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. IT'S MY BLISS exchanged a light bump at the
start, moved forward to dictate terms on a narrow advantage racing off the rail, was challenged by an outside foe through the turn still a path off the rail but
weakened thereafter. S S DIAMOND pressed the pace from outside five then four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. CROWN N BULL exchanged a
light bump at the start, raced in the back-half of the field from off the inside, went in the two path on the turn and was never a threat. GIVE IT AWAY bumped
the inside rival at the start, was ridden along from the three path by the three-eighths but offered no response. CHET WHO thrashed about in the gate for a
bit but after settling down broke well, chased the leader up the backstretch from between runners, began to drop back leaving the backstretch and was
asked for more by the five-sixteenths early on the turn while in the four path through that bend, had no response and came up empty.

Footnotes
STORMY WORLD pressed from outside going five wide into the turn and moving in a path on that bend, lost a touch of ground out of the turn but regained
command just outside the sixteenth pole and edged away under steady handling. MEGAN'S REVENGE prompted the pace from inside rivals but off the rail
entering the turn in the three path on moving in a bit while drawing on even terms inside MERITTRIS, dispatched that rival and edged away from STORMY
WORLD late on the turn while coming out a path turning for home, was challenged by that latter rival again in upper stretch and outfinished.
CITYONTHENILE reared at the start spotting the field a couple lengths, was allowed to settle and gradually advanced from off the inside going four then five
wide on the turn, swung six deep into the stretch now nearly in striking distance but evened out. MERITTRIS set a pressured pace between rivals early,
began
to
be
overtaken
by
inside and outside rivals late on
the turn dropping back in the four path and continued to weaken
some.
PEACEOUTYOURHONOR raced off the early leaders mid-pack along the inside, steadied when in just a hair tight past the three-sixteenths and ran on
thereafter. ROLLWITHTHEMUSIC shifted in heading up the backstretch, raced outside the aforementioned two deep through the turn coming in just a hair
late on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. WHAT A SURPRISE was not a threat racing in the three path on the turn. LITTLE RED RUBY hopped at the
start, chased six wide and came up empty. ANGELAFAR was kept wide racing well back, went in the six path on the turn and a couple paths wider into
upper stretch while never a factor.

Footnotes
MY INDIAN WARRIOR exchanged a light bump with the outside rival after the start, vied between runners well off the inside up the backstretch into the turn,
went four wide on that bend still between and contesting the lead, was headed in upper stretch, drifted out a hair under left-handed urging and exchanged a
brush with HANDSOME LAD but dug in to edge that rival. HANDSOME LAD exchanged a light bump with the aforementioned at the start, chased from
outside, edged a touch closer five wide on the turn, put a short head in front in upper stretch, drifted in a hair and exchanged a brush with the
aforementioned and was denied by that one. DEL MAR SUMMER vied between rivals early then inside foes but off the fence in the three path on the turn
coming out a bit into upper stretch, was still in contention nearing the sixteenth pole then yielded. DAKOTA broke just a step slowly, raced inside to the end
of the backstretch then moved out a path, came out a further path on the turn, advanced past rivals in upper stretch but could not rally on the top three.
LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM was up close in behind the early leaders racing off the inside, went three wide into the turn shifting five wide by the end of that
bend and failed to rally. FLY FIRST CLASS pressed from inside rivals but off the fence in the two to three path up the backstretch into the turn then
gradually weakened. LEATHERNECK threw his head at the break consequently spotting the field about three lengths, shifted in and saved ground on the
turn. CHARLIE COMANCH broke a step slowly, kept off the inside up the backstretch while trailing, went three wide into the turn swinging six wide into
upper stretch and failed to produce a bid.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DUBAI broke a step slowly, switched out in the early going to race wide up the backstretch, went in the three to four path through the turn
edging closer coming out of that bend when shaken up, was five wide and struck the lead past the furlong marker, strode clear while being kept to task.
HOLLYWOOD HENRY set the tempo from outside TAPPIN FORA DANCE as that rival applied pressure, went three then two then three wide on the turn
still with a narrow lead and coming out a further path into upper stretch, was overtaken past the eighth pole and no match for the winner but held the place.
NUMEROLOGIST was in just a bit tight at the break, moved out heading up the backstretch to be widest, went four to five deep through the turn coming six
wide into upper stretch and gained show honors. TAPPIN FORA DANCE broke outwardly just a bit, pressed from inside HOLLYWOOD HENRY but off the
fence, moved nearer the rail through the turn before coming back out again, could not kick on through the final furlong. D E LOVER raced in behind the
leaders outside a foe two then three wide on the turn, came out a path into upper stretch and ran on mildly. CATS SURFIN tracked from inside and failed to
rally. TRUE VALOR raced close up early, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went in the four path on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GERDA'S GONE was forced five to six wide on the first turn outside rivals, was still outside and in the clear up the backstretch into the far turn when
beginning a move entering that bend five wide, took over outside the quarter pole while shifting in to the three path, drifted out in late stretch and held.
BUCA SARABI was caught four to five wide on the first turn, continued between rivals up the backstretch, was still four to five wide through the far turn into
the stretch as GERDA'S GONE got the jump but closed the gap on that one while running out of real estate. TRUST N PRAYER lacked early speed despite
some encouragement from the break and having gotten away a half-step slowly, went three to four wide and somewhat between rivals in the early going,
continued three to four wide on the far turn now asked for more and advancing some, swung six deep into upper stretch and continued to grind away on the
leaders. WAR PAINT BRAVE was bumped at the break, raced well off the leader going in the three path on the first turn, continued between rivals up the
backstretch, moved in a bit while losing position two deep on the far turn and ran on evenly in the lane. EYE FORTY was caught outside rivals five to six
wide through the first turn, edged closer on the far turn going five wide, reached nearly striking distance after that advance to the head of the lane but
flattened out while shifting in. GOLD NOTE tracked inside rivals off the lone leader racing on or just off the rail early, dropped back and lost position on the
far turn, angled out five wide leaving that bend and failed to menace. SEBASTIAN CAPE raced in the two path while lacking early speed, shifted to the rail
at the half, saved ground on the far turn then angled out turning into the stretch but failed to rally. TRACTOR MAN bumped the outside rival at the start,
quickly sped clear opening up several lengths, raced inside, was overtaken on the far turn and weakened. MALUSITA'S HOME was bumped into the outer
rival at the start, raced in the two path on the turns and came up empty while never threatening.
