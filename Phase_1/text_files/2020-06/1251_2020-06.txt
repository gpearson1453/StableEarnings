Footnotes
UNFADING BEAUTY tracked the pace setters from the three path, advanced three wide around the turn to bid for the lead turning for home, dueled through
the lane as her inner rival dug in, and prevailed gamely at the wire. TAKE CHARGE ERICA set the pace inside of SWEET N WICKED early on, dug in inside
of that rival and UNFADING BEAUTY turning for home, shifted off the rail at the furlong marker while gamely holding a narrow advantage, but was nipped at
the wire. LADY BY CHOICE broke a bit outwards and brushed HOLLY GO LIGHTLY at the start, shifted off of the rail while stalking the leaders down the
backstretch, got outmoved by HOLLY GO LIGHTLY and UNFADING BEAUTY into the turn, took back between those rivals to trail at the three furlong pole,
shifted out to the four path turning for home, but failed to make any late headway on the leaders. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY was brushed by LADY BY CHOICE
at the start, advanced along the rail to stalking position into the turn, waited for racing room along the inside in upper stretch, but came up empty when the
rail opened up at the furlong pole. SWEET N WICKED rushed to vie for the lead outside of TAKE CHARGE ERICA early on, but weakened between horses
turning for home, and faded.

Footnotes
SUNNY ISLE BEACH tracked from midpack in the four path outside of rivals through the turn, advanced while being floated to the seven path turning for
home, shifted inwards as leading foes drifted out through the lane, then rallied inside of rivals in the final sixteenth to get up at the wire. CARSON'S KITTEN
dueled for the lead outside of BOSSY MOMENT early on, but failed to keep pace with that rival at the three furlong pole, came under coaxing to keep pace,
drifted to the six path turning for home, and somehow rerallied in midstretch to produce a late bid, but missed at the wire. BOSSY MOMENT dueled inside of
CARSON'S KITTEN early on, drew clear of that rival passing the three furlong pole, held a large advantage through midstretch, but drifted outwards when
the rider switched to left handed pressure in the late stages, and was caught between horses at the wire. MANIA saved ground while forwardly placed, and
finished up evenly for a minor share. RUBY ROUND HERE was forwardly placed in the three path, but hung on her left lead through the lane, and finished
evenly, but was outfinished for a minor reward. MISS MAGDALENA tracked from midpack two wide, lugged in between horses in upper stretch, switched
outwards in side the furlong pole when her path was shut off, but failed to menace. I'LL MAKE IT COACH hesitated at the start, trailed early on, took the turn
in the four path, and produced a mild kick. MISS SKY CAT was outrun and trailed the field early on, the showed mild late interest through deep stretch
without threatening. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED took the turn in the three to four path, but lugged in greenly through the lane. DECAF was off a step slowly,
saved ground from midpack, but weakened into the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
GENTLE RULER rated well off of the pace through the first two turns, advanced in hand to stalking position in the two then three path around the far turn,
tipped to the five path turning for home, rallied determinedly while hanging on her left lead with ROMANTIC PURSUIT to catch in midstretch, and wore that
rival down approaching the wire. ROMANTIC PURSUIT settled in midpack, shifted to the two path into the backstretch and advanced to stalking position,
inched forward in hand around the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, surpassed inner foes in upper stretch to forge an
advantage at the three sixteenths pole, dug in gamely at the furlong marker as GENTLE RULER ranged up alongside, but failed to keep that foe at bay to
the wire. VEXATIOUS prompted the pace along the inside into the first turn, but took back to stalk turning into the stretch for the first turn, reengaged the
leader from the outside into the third turn, vied two wide around that bend, but met a challenge from ROMATIC PURSUIT turning for home, got outkicked by
that foe and GENTLE RULER approaching the furlong pole, and held show from her entry mate through deep stretch. ENGLISH AFFAIR stalked along the
inside, advanced to the pocket into the third turn, shifted off of the rail to split foes in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid. JOY NIDERA (ARG)
shifted from the three path to the five path turning for home while well off of the pace, and never got involved. OVER THINKING saved ground while trailing,
but never got involved. JULIANA (PER) set a tempered pace through the early stages, held an advantage from VEXATIOUS around the far turn, but
weakened turning for home. Due to a timer malfunction, the time for the opening quarter is unavailable. Race times added after video review

Footnotes
ISLAND SONG was forwardly placed along the inside, surged through a rail opening turning for home, built a clear lead in upper stretch, and was ridden out
to the wire. WHISKEY CHASER broke outwards, then vied two wide between horses while in the three path, held position turning for home, but was no
match for an inner rival in upper stretch, and edged place late. CELTIC MISCHIEF broke sharply and quickly angled down to the two path, set the pace
inside of rivals while a bit off of the rail, left the rail open turning for home, which allowed the eventual winner to take charge in upper stretch, dug in for place
through the lane, but didnt have enough. LITANY was bumped at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four to six path around the turn, and produced a
mild kick for a minor reward. FANTASTRY (BRZ) was forwardly placed three wide in the four path, made a four wide bid turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with inner rivals in upper stretch. COUNT YOUR PENNIES was bothered at the start, rushed between horses to be forwardly placed into the turn, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BROTHER AARON was pinched back at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail.
EGOBUSTER was bumped between horses at the start, stalked in the five path, but came under a drive into the turn and faded in upper stretch.
MOBILIZATION stumbled at the start and never got involved. SKATINGONTHINICE took the turn in the three path and failed to get involved. FLUG
stumbled inwards at the start, raced midpack, but came under a drive into the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S MASON prompted the pace setter from the outside, made a two wide bid form the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage turning for
home, drew off approaching the furlong pole while hanging on her left lead, and was geared down approaching the wire. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH stalked the
leading trio early on, was roused while shifting to the three path into the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and stayed on outside of rivals to edge
place approaching the wire. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD set the pace along the inside, but was headed by QUEEN'S MASON turning for home, gave way to that
rival approaching the furlong pole, then lost place in the late stages. BOOYAKASHA raced close up to the early leader along the inside, got rank when
BAUDETTE BLIZZARD put her into tight quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, waited for racing room from the pocket around the turn, tipped three wide
turning for home, but lacked a bid. UGO was off a step slowly, advanced in the four to five path around the turn, came into the lane in midpack in the five
path, then stayed on, but failed to threaten. LOAN SHARK had a slow start, trailed early on, shifted to the five path and was driven outside of rivals into the
turn, but failed to menace. FLATTEN hopped at the start and was off slowly, shifted from the two to the four path turning for home, but failed to make an
impact. HARDING PARK took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace and never got involved. TWO DOT took the turn in the two path while far off
of the pace and never got involved. NOBLE COMPANION raced midpack along the inside early on, but weakened into the turn and stopped. INGENICO
raced two wide in midpack, took the turn in the three path, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
PINSON tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and won the nod at the wire. HOUSE LIMIT set the
pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive down the stretch and was out-nodded at the wire. CONQUEST LEMONRAID raced back early
on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. CANDY CARLOS hopped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into
the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the drive. ONE MEAN MAN chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and flattened out late
in the stretch drive. ALTITO was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position down the lane.
