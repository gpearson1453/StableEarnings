POSH HOLLY (IRE) lagged to the half, bid two wide into the second turn, swung out five deep for room into the stretch then responded determinedly and
wore down MULHIMA (IRE) late. MULHIMA (IRE) was settled early, commenced a bid leaving the half, was three then four wide on the second turn, rallied
to the front in mid stretch then could not stall the winner. LORETTA set the pace under pressure to the second turn, dueled from the rail to the stretch, was
passed in mid stretch but the runnerup and weakened. SUGAR CRUSH tracked the leaders to the second turn then saved ground to no avail.
CALLMEJESSIEJAMES attended the pace outside of LORETTA to the half, dueled that one two wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired.
MISS MONIQUE was chasing for a half mile, tried to respond in the two path on the second turn but gave way after six furlongs. Due to a malfunction in the
timing system, the race was hand timed.

in the late stages. CHARMING LASS had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed the gap but was not a serious threat. FLYING HOME
chased the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and just missed second. BANK OF MANY also was outrun to the
turn, raced three wide to the stretch but could only pick off foes in the drive. TWISTY LUCK broke inward and was taken up to correct, tracked to the turn,
came two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MANY BANKERS saved ground to no avail. TAHOE BLUE chased to the turn, was two
wide to the stretch then gave way. SWEET RYAN flashed speed inside the winner to the turn but also gave way in the drive.

got the nod for second. WINE AND WHISKY chased the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but was outfinished by
the winner and got tagged for second. BLAISIN' EAMON dueled inside to the stretch then was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. OPERA GHOST
was a pace factor outside of BLAISIN' EAMON and two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then also weakened. ABOVE THE MOON broke
slow and was never a threat.

Footnotes
NOWHERE MAN had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and held driving. KATZUMOTO was settled to
the half, came two wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and closed steadily to tag TURNAROUND for second. TURNAROUND pressed the
winner to the second turn, tried to engage two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and got nailed late for the place. RATE FOR ME was also
allowed to settle to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch then shifted out and was gaining ground belatedly. COOL HUNTER tracked the
winner from the rail to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and hung. MR. PAPAS had no speed and was never a threat. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY
lunged from the gate then was rank and taken outside rivals early and was not a factor.

FELONY ONE broke alertly and went right to the front, set the pace from the rail and held under steady urging. HOPSCOTCHY chased the winner from the
rail, shifted out once in the stretch and finished steadily to get the place. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had no speed then circled four wide on the turn and
finished in a rally. COASTAL STARLITE pressed the winner to the turn, was outrun to the stretch then was tiring in the late stages. CASH FOR CASS got
outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was closing well late. VACAVILLE SPECIAL was also outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. SHE BEGAN AGAIN had no speed, saved ground to the stretch and closed a gap to the line.

Footnotes
GOLD CRUSHER was sent for speed and set a pressured pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down and held stubbornly. SLAM DUNK
SERMON had no speed, saved ground to the stretch, shifted out for room and closed steadily for second. EUSTACE also had no speed, was three wide to
the stretch then shifted widest for the drive and closed well. SHARP WARNING hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed a threat to mid
stretch then was outfinished. MISTER MCLEAN was used early to press the action, bid three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and did
not rally. SUNNY RIDE chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch, was boxed in by MISTER MCLEAN nearing mid stretch, checked then finished
evenly. TRUMP UM also chased the pace early, was fanned four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. TADEO had no speed
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DARK PROOF chased the pace to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch, shifted out for room, rallied once clear and dug in late to gamely get the nod.
LORD VADER had good speed, was dueling two wide to the stretch, responded to pressure then battled on late but was nailed on the line. HULA KING had
no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch then was rallying in the drive, surged but was too late. KNOWN got outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the
stretch, was inside of OLYMPIC SILVER and had to steady when crowded by that one a sixteenth out and finished evenly. OLYMPIC SILVER contested the
pace from the rail to the stretch, came out slightly in upper stretch then was drifting in late, checked and lost ground. MR. NASTY had no speed, was off the
rail to the stretch then shifted out for room and closed willingly to the line. SMILING RED was chasing the leaders two then three wide to the stretch but
could not muster the needed late response. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was mid pack early, saved ground to the stretch but also did not threaten. DARTMOOR
had no speed and was always outrun. The jockey on OLYMPIC SILVER lodged an objection against the jockey on LORD VADER for alleged interference in
deep stretch but the claim was not allowed by the stewards.
