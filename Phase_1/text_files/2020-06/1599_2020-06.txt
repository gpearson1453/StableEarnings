RISE TO POWER stalked the pace for a half, went up to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole, matched strides until deep stretch and responded
under right handed urging to win going away. IMPAZIBLE MINK broke in front, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. EOWYN'S
PARADISE checked early on the first turn, saved ground and went evenly. PLUS SIZE VALUE failed to menace. TURKICANUS FREAK chased the pace
from the four path into the second turn then gave way. EVEN IF was no factor. LOVELY LEE broke outward, raced widest of all, stopped on the far turn and,
jogged to the wire. LUTZY LU was through early, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off.

DELIGHTFUL PRIDE broke alertly, contested the lead two wide into the stretch then responded readily when set down to win going away while under a
strong hand ride late. WEEKEND AT LAST vied for the lead four then three wide but was no match for the winner. BAINBRIDGE had speed between horses
from the gate, dropped back a bit before a quarter, angled in, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch then went evenly. THE CALICO LADY trailed
into the stretch, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the middle of the racetrack. WAY BACK WHEN was no factor. VAQUERITA had speed into the turn
then faded. OPALESCENT dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, stopped abruptly, completed the course, pulled up injured past the wire and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
THIRTYSILVERPIECES prompted the pace three then two wide into the stretch, responded under left handed urging to make the lead past the furlong
marker and finished full of run to win going away. EXCLUSIVE REWARD broke in front, set the pace near the inside until deep stretch then was no match
for the winner. FLIGHT MISSION broke inward bumping ARTAKSEZ, was hustled along the rail into the first turn, steadied at the six furlong marker,
dropped back a bit then went evenly. ARTAKSEZ was bumped at the start then failed to menace. WAR AT SUNRISE was no threat. MISTBINDER was
outrun. TIGER PAW was through after a half.

dropped inside, set the pace to the quarter pole, steadied and altered course outside the winner in mid stretch, drifted to the six path and was well clear for
second. RIGGED UP hopped out in front, set the pace for nearly a quarter, chased the pace into the stretch then faded. GOLDEN MONEY passed tiring

SWITHER'S SHORTCUT unhurried, swung wide, closed with a burst of speed out in the nine path through the final furlong and got up in the final strides.
DAHIK broke inward bumping SMOKIN HOT ENERGY, settled within striking distance, closed determinedly in the eight path through the final sixteenth and
just missed getting up in time. WINCHESTER LIMIT pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was
outfinished. THE COOKIE MAN lacked room along the inside early, shifted out on the turn, loomed boldly four wide in upper stretch and was also
outfinished. BAR STOOL BUDGET away alertly, dueled between horses until mid stretch then weakened late. SMOKIN HOT ENERGY was bumped start,
steadied entering the turn then passed tiring rivals. EMPIREMEISTER failed to menace. GIANT'S WILLOW dueled for the lead along the inside until mid
stretch then weakened. STORM PEAK had speed along the inside into the turn then gave way. I AM IRON MAN had brief speed.

OCCUR chased the pace from the six path into the stretch, dug in late under strong handling and got up in the final strides. GOES TOO FAST sprinted to
the lead soon after the start, set the pace off the rail in the five path, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
MASTER LEGIONAIRE was unprepared for the start, trailed into the stretch then closed with a rush in the five path through the final furlong. IRON MEN OF

Footnotes
BLACKTIEANDTUX prompted the pace while hung outside in the five path, dug in under strong right handed urging and got up in the final strides. BOOT
LEGGER vied for the lead along the rail into the far turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace while drifting out to the five path and just missed
hanging on. CRAFTY CHIEF went evenly. TYPOTHETAE broke in front, set a pressured pace off the rail in the four path into the far turn then weakened.
MY MAN ARCHIE trailed.
