Footnotes
IRRITATOR set the pace inside a pair of foes through the turn, shook loose from those rivals in upper stretch, built a clear lead, and widened under driving
pressure. PARK RIDGE BENNY was a bit crowded between horses at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace into the turn, produced a rail rally
inside of rivals turning for home, forged place passing the furlong pole, but was only second best. MOST MISCHIEF stalked three wide before inching
forward to vie for the lead outside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, then held show in the final furlong.
STRONG YEN stalked along the inside of a pair of rivals through the turn, shifted off of the rail approaching the quarter pole, which allowed PARK RIDGE
BENNY to surge through, then weakened between horses in upper stretch without making a bid. BARRY LEE vied two wide and between horses around the
turn, but weakened in upper stretch. HOMEVIEW tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted to the four path turning for
home to be outside of the leading trio, but weakened on his left lead in upper stretch. ALL HANSENS ONDECK broke a bit outwards at the start, raced in
midpack outside of a pair of rivals while staying in the four path around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. DARK ARDEN trailed throughout
and showed little. Due to the timer being early, the half mile fraction was omitted. Race times added after video review

Footnotes
LADDIE BOY set the pace along the inside from the onset, cleared away from the field when responding to pressure in upper stretch, then was handily
ridden through the final furlong. COUNTY COURT was caught three wide between horses around the first turn while far off of the pace, split foes into the far
turn to commence a rally, cut the corner turning for home to make a rail rally through the lane, but was only second best. SENOR FRIDAY settled off of the
pace in the four path into the first turn, split foes in the four path into the far turn and produced a place bid turning for home, but did not have enough to
secure to. CARMELO was forwardly placed two wide between horses around the first turn, switched three wide around the far turn, held striking position in
upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong pole. WILD ABOUT YOU trailed the field around the far turn, swung to the seven path turning for home, then
offered a mild rally outside of rivals, but failed to threaten. GOLD HAWK stalked three wide around the first turn, inched forward, but came under a drive
around the turn, chased the leader turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. STAR DOG was never involved. NEW YEAR'S LUCK failed to factor
after taking the far tun in the two to three path. OFF SIXES was forwardly placed along the inside, but weakened into the far turn and faded around it.
KRISTO tracked from midpack three to four wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S WARRIOR vied early on inside of PETIT VERDOT, took back to switch outside into the turn, reengaged that foe at the five sixteenths pole,
cleared away in upper stretch, and won under driving pressure. THERIDEOFALIFETIME came under a drive two wide between horses while midpack into
the turn, cut the corner turning for home before altering back to the three path at the furlong pole, then stayed on to prove second best. PETIT VERDOT set
the pace outside of JACKIE'S WARRIOR early on, cleared from that foe into the turn, but was headed by that rival turning for home, and weakened late.
PRIVATE ISLAND trailed around the turn, then produced a mile late rally along the rail. COUSTEAU tracked three wide from midpack, inched forward to
make a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. PICO D'ORO chased the pace along the inside, but weakened into the
turn before drifting outwards turning for home. FROSTED PRAYER raced far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CHANGE OF CONTROL tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, commenced a rally in upper
stretch to produce a bid between horses in the final sixteenth, and prevailed at the wire. WINNING ENVELOPE trailed early on before passing a tiring rival
into the turn, took the bend in the three path before swinging to the six path turning for home to be widest of all in upper stretch, then rallied outside of rivals,
but was outfinished by an inner foe in the late stages. MISS GOSSIP (IRE) took the turn in midpack in the three path before shifting to the five path turning
for home, came into the lane between horses and was put to a bit of tight quarters in upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival approaching the furlong
pole, altered outwards without losing momentum, then sustained her grinding rally through deep stretch to achieve show approaching the wire. JO JO AIR
prompted the leading duelers three wide, inched forward to make a bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage approaching the furlong
pole, but yielded to outer foes in the late stages. MIDNIGHT FANTASY achieved perfect inside stalking position, came into the lane behind the leaders,
finally shifted out to the four path at the furlong pole. but lacked a kick thereafter. MT. BRAVE dueled inside of MORTICIA early on, but was headed by that
foe at the five sixteenths pole, dug in and fought back inside of multiples foes in upper stretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. ON PROBATION saved
ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail. MORTICIA dueled two wide between horses from the onset, held narrow advantage turning for home, but
weakened between horses at the furlong pole, stopped, and was eased.

LIGHT UP NIGHT tracked from midpack along the inside, surged through the rail when INDAWIN vacated it turning for home, produced a bid inside of rivals
in upper stretch, then drew clear from MALIBU ANTHEM in the final furlong. MALIBU ANTHEM broke outwardly, stalked the leading duelers from the three
path, inched forward and made a three wide bid for the lead turning for home while in hand, but failed to change leads through the lane, and was outkicked
by an inner rival inside the furlong pole. INDAWIN dueled inside of a foe down the backstretch, held a narrow margin turning for home while shifting off of
the rail to meet MALIBU ANTHEM's bid at the quarter pole, but allowed racing room for LIGHT UP THE NIGHT in the process, then weakened between
those foes at the furlong. FRESHMAN CLASS trailed early on, took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, then failed to threaten while passing
tired rivals. CAREFREE HIGHWAY raced off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path turning for home, then failed to factor. COLD HEARTED WENCH
bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, and never got involved. COMPLETE SURPRISE lunged inwards at the start, recovered to
duel for the lead outside of INDAWIN down the backstretch, but came under an all out drive to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened turning
for home.

HEART RIVER was unruly in the pre-start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was gaining on the
winner in the final stages. BETWEEN THE HEDGES was last away from the gate and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane with a late gain
in the stretch run. WHOVILLE was a bit slow at the start, dueled early on two wide, was off the rail into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. JUST FLY
bobbled at the start, stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. ONE STEP chased the pace early, was in the
three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. CARONDELET was through after a half. CLASSY JUSTICE was steadied into the lane and
