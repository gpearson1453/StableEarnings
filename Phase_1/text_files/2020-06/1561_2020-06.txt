Footnotes
BOLD PAYNTER moved to striking position up the backstretch, poked a head in front outside KINGSVILLE after five furlongs, dueled inside THIRD ARMY
turning for home and was brushed by that rival, and prevailed through a long drive. THIRD ARMY was driven four wide to contention after six furlongs,
challenged outside BOLD PAYNTER and lugged in brushing that one in upper stretch, continued to lug in and finished with good courage on the rail.
LONDON WEREWOLF stumbled badly and brushed into MR. CESCO at the start, swung four wide rallying off the turn, and went clear for the show while
lugging in. QUASAR MOON stumbled badly and bumped into EARTHQUAKE at the start, lagged far back early, advanced four wide on the turn, and went
past tired horses to land a share. BEAU TRACE lodged a mild bid three wide on the turn, but stalled out by upper stretch. KINGSVILLE set the pace inside,
got overhauled by the winner near the three-eighths, and gave way. GETTININTOMISCHIEF tracked the leaders three wide to the turn, and came up empty.
BLUESKY KITTEN was always outrun. EARTHQUAKE got bumped by QUASAR MOON at the start, and was through early inside. MR. CESCO was
brushed by LONDON WEREWOLF at the start, and lagged far back four wide. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE TRAINER OF THIRD
ARMY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ROYAL HABIBI advanced rapidly four wide on the turn, ran by ROCK WITH ROBIN to take over from outside a quarter-mile out, and drew off under a drive.
KATIESDREAMGIRL raced three wide to the stretch, and finished well to go clear for second. LITTLE NESSO was outsprinted early, cut the corner into the
lane and was along for the show. ROCK WITH ROBIN sped clear soon after the start, was powerless to fend off ROYAL HABIBI after three furlongs, and
weakened through the stretch. SKY chased the pacesetter in the two-path early, and was through after three furlongs. CEVICHE tired off the turn four then
five wide. BELLA BASORA was outsprinted away from the gate, struck the rail going by the half-mile pole, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
STORM THE BRIDGE broke out bumping EAST CODE, led early inside, deferred to WAR OF DECEPTION while holding his spot at the rail, was roused to
engage for command again late on the turn, took over into the stretch and was driving to stay clear. EAST CODE got bumped into WAR OF DECEPTION by
STORM THE BRIDGE at the start, was crowded early inside WAR OF DECPETION, raced three wide off the leaders around the turn, and finished well to
clearly best the remainder. SUNDOWN KID broke in bumping RESTLESS ROCKER, took up sharply out of tight quarters between foes nearing the half-mile
pole, angled to the three-path finding his best stride into the stretch, and rallied mildly for the show. RESTLESS ROCKER got bumped into JACK EL
BARBARO by SUNDOWN KID at the start, bumped with JACK EL BARBARO early, came five wide off the turn and posed no threat with an even finish.
WAR OF DECEPTION was bumped between EAST CODE and EAGLES DAWN at the start, angled inward causing crowding up the backstretch, held a
short lead outside STORM THE BRIDGE through the turn, could not keep pace with the latter and lugged in to the rail in upper stretch, and faded inside.
JACK EL BARBARO got bumped by RESTLESSS ROCKER at the start, bumped with that rival again early, and tired inside. EAGLES DAWN got bumped
by WAR OF DECEPTION at the start and was slowest away, raced four wide and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAN OLD PARR sped to the front after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, and was driving to the finish. SOUPER SHENANIGAN raced three wide
around the turn, and finished well to best the others. DEO FORTE pressed the pace outside GRAN OLD PARR to the stretch, and weakened. AWESOME
ENOUGH broke slowly, rushed up into traffic and took up sharply while striking the rail near the three-eighths pole, came two wide off the turn and ran on
with good courage for a share. FELON moved inside around the turn, and faded through the drive. WILD ONE FOREVER bumped with EL GRAN CACAO
at the start, steadied just outside AWESOME ENOUGH entering the turn, and made no headway widest in the stretch. EL GRAN CACAO bumped with
WILD ONE FOREVER at the start, and was outrun inside. MONEY COME showed speed between horses into the turn, but tired approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
ARRIVEDERLA broke sharply and led for a few strides before letting JAMAICAN go on with it, closed in from outside after a half-mile, took over through
upper stretch and drew away under good handling. BLACK PEPPER was outrun early, swung four wide off the turn, and rallied outside for the place.
KAREN'S COVE advanced mildly three wide after a half, and was one-paced through the lane. RESIDENT saved ground early, came two wide off the turn
and lacked a solid response. JAMAICAN became agitated in the gate, came away in good order and took over from ARRIVEDERLA soon after the start,
could not hold the latter off into the stretch and weakened on the rail. EARLY DELIGH chased the leaders toward the inside early, and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN THE CITY was hard to load, prompted the pace outside SHE'S JUST QUALITY, turned up the pressure leaving the half-mile pole, dueled
through the last quarter-mile and prevailed in the closing stages. SHE'S JUST QUALITY took the lead soon after the start, rated along setting an even pace
inside for a half, responded when hooked by SUMMER IN THE CITY on the far turn, and battled gamely on the rail to the finish. PSEUDONYM saved
ground rank under restraint through the early going, settled into a more relaxed rhythm midway up the backstretch, moved out three wide getting roused at
the top of the stretch, and could not reach the leaders with an even finish. STARSHIP MALLOMAR brushed with FALL MOON entering the first turn, moved
out to the three-path tracking the pace up the backstretch, and lacked a solid response after six furlongs. FALL MOON brushed with STARSHIP
MALLOMAR and YOU'RE THE BEST while in tight between those two nearing the first turn, stayed in range to the far turn, but faded after six furlongs.
YOU'RE THE BEST brushed with FALL MOON widest into the first turn, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CAPPY HOUR broke to the lead, steadied off the heels of SMELL OF ROSES with that one intent on reaching the top nearing the first turn, moved out to
chase the pacesetter up the backstretch with daylight on the rest of the field, bid from outside at the top of the lane, wrested command through the furlong
grounds and edged away. MYSTICAL MOON was four wide early, moved in a bit within range for six furlongs, rallied on his left lead and prevailed in a
multi-horse scramble for second. MASON'S SONG waited for room heading into the far turn, moved off the inside to the two-path after six furlongs, rallied
through the lane and finished well between horses. UNLIMITED DATA broke out bumping BYE BYE MAN at the start, lagged far back for six furlongs,
circled five or six wide approaching the stretch, and rallied outside too late. SMELL OF ROSES was sent hard after the start, crossed over in front of CAPPY
HOUR heading to the first turn, set a brisk pace for six furlongs, and began to weaken from his early efforts in upper stretch. DEVOTED KITTEN raced three
to four wide outrun to the stretch, and lacked room nearing the finish behind horses. AWESOME PARTY bumped with IM THE CAPTAIN NOW at the start,
then bumped with BYE BYE MAN a stride later, saved ground trailing early, and never got close. TETSU was finished early. MONMOUTH DR raced evenly
in the second flight to the stretch, and had no rally. IM THE CAPTAIN NOW bumped with AWESOME PARTY at the start, advanced four wide on the far
turn, but could not sustain the bid. RESIDENT LIBERAL stayed in range early three wide, and tired. BYE BYE MAN was bumped between UNLIMITED
DATA and AWESOME PARTY at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LURE HIM IN prompted the early pace outside GENGHIS, took over in the three-path approaching the quarter-pole, and widened through the stretch under
a drive. TONS OF GOLD raced four wide around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane, but finished gamely between rivals for the place.
BLESSED JOURNEY was in the second flight for six furlongs, swung widest for the drive and rallied mildly on his left lead. GENGHIS set the early pace well
off the rail, faced challenges from both sides near the five-sixteenths, stayed on with good courage to upper stretch, and weakened late. INDY'S JEWEL
brushed with KID DRAMA at the start, stayed close early, made a brief run along the rail after five furlongs, but fizzled out by the top of the lane. KID
DRAMA steadied behind horses leaving the chute, saved ground to the turn, and drifted six wide dropping back nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGH NOON RIDER bumped with DONJI after the start, went along unhurried early, began to get rolling three wide on the far turn, set sail after SHARM EL
SHEIKH through the stretch and was up outside nearing the wire. SHARM EL SHEIKH set the pace being pursued by DONJI, disposed of that one coming
to the head of the stretch, neglected to change leads until about 70 yards out, and could not hold on. MORNING STRIDE raced far back early, began to take
closer order after six furlongs, rallied through the stretch but could not reach the top two. DONJI bumped with HIGH NOON RIDER at the start, felt the whip
coming away from the gate and went up after SHARM EL SHEIKH, stayed on the chase to the end of the far turn, and gave way. FAST FIRE raced widest
up the backstretch, and failed to menace. REMEMBER THE MAINE saved ground early, moved to the two-path going to the far turn, and posed no threat.
ESPRESSO CALIENTE steadied along the rail near the three-eighths pole at the back, and never got close. ALIEN INVASION saved ground and tired after
six furlongs.

Footnotes
LOVELY LUVY became a bit unsettled under a firm hold on the first turn, settled down covered up through the middle stages, maneuvered out four wide for
clear sailing after six furlongs, rallied determinedly outside and was along late. YESTERDAYONCEMORE (IRE) broke out bumping INDICIA at the start,
was reserved early inside, gained some ground in the two-path on the far turn, stalled in traffic through upper stretch, altered course to the rail and finished
gamely. DRINKS ON ME raced in easy striking range three wide, reached a short lead outside EAST COAST SWING in upper stretch, and was outkicked
between the top two. KEY BISCAYNE lunged and ducked in at the start, raced well back for six furlongs, came widest for the drive and finished with good
courage. INDICIA got bumped into EAST COAST SWING by YESTERDAYONCEMORE at the start, saved ground at the back for six furlongs, advanced
into some traffic turning for home, found room between horses a sixteenth out and finished evenly while moving inside. PASSION PLUS was held up in
traffic outside the quarter-pole, and was one-paced between horses through the lane. EAST COAST SWING was bumped by INDICIA at the start, prompted
the pace under a hold to the far turn, challenged for command into the stretch, but weakened a furlong out. LADY NINA cleared to the early lead inside,
came under attack from multiple challengers after six furlongs, and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SNAP HOOK led early, deferred to LAST PROMISE soon after going a quarter-mile, stayed in pursuit from outside to the stretch, rebid and took command
coming to the sixteenth-pole, and edged away all out. CANDY CRUSHEM advanced four wide after six furlongs, rallied into second 70 yards out, and just
saved that position. TRAPPEZOID moved up four wide to the middle of the field approaching the stretch, found his best stride late and just missed outside
CANDY CRUSHEM for the place. KRACHENWAGEN was close up early, lost position toward the inside around the turn despite urging, and rallied mildly on
the rail through the lane. LAST PROMISE took over inside SNAP HOOK up the backstretch, drew clear heading to the turn, began to labor a furlong from
home, and drifted out while yielding a sixteenth out. IL FARAONE lagged far back early inside, came widest for the drive and gained without threatening.
PEPPI THE HUNTER stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and faded. CANDY COVE dropped back four wide on the turn. AREYOUTALKINGTOME
was finished early inside.
