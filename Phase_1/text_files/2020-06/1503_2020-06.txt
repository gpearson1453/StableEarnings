Footnotes
PECOS BILL raced three wide into the turn, came out into the five path midway on the bend while rallying, remained wide into the stretch, reached the front
just before five furlongs, drew clear in midstretch then held. POCOPSON STATION lagged after a slow break, circled into the stretch and closed a gap
through the final yards. SHAZAM was prominent early outside, dueled three wide around the turn then faltered in the drive. OFFENDER showed speed
between horses from the outset, angled closer to the rail while dueling then weakened in the lane. FOLES was slow early, stayed inside and weakened.
THE LAST YANNUZZI showed speed between horses, steadied in tight between horses entering the turn then weakened. A TO Z raced between horses in
the first flight into the turn, remained close to wide to the stretch then stopped. PAINTED CLOWN dueled along the rail into the turn, stopped suddenly and
was eased up through the lane while bleeding and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CARAVEL was slow leaving the gate, lagged inside early, rallied two wide between rivals into the stretch then quickly ran clear from the outside through the
final yards. KAZ'S PRINCESS was bumped between rivals leaving the gate, moved to a short lead soon after, stayed close to the inside around the turn,
held gamely into late stretch but was little match. DARK LIGHTNING ducked out into KAZ'S PRINCESS leaving the gate, tracked in the three path around
the turn, drew even with KAZ'S PRINCESS past midstretch but lacked a further response. OUR FLIRTATION came in on the winner leaving the gate,
advanced four wide on the turn then gained mildly outside rivals late as the rider stood up before the finish. LA LIMONADA came out three wide on the turn
and continued evenly between rivals. OVER THIRSTY wasn't far back two wide into the stretch then weakened. RAGAZZA CARINA was no factor. MY
LION EYES angled to the inside on the turn and lacked a strong closing. R CHERRY pressed two wide outside the early leader to the stretch then tired.
LUSCIOUS LOLA was finished early.

I GOT A ROCK reared in the gate prior to the start and had to be reloaded, showed speed from the start, drew clear from the inside on the turn and held
under urging. HYMN'S SYLVIA was bumped leaving the gate, wasn't far back early, raced two wide around the turn then gained steadily through the lane.
VICKSBURG BLUFFS wasn't far back in the three path around the turn then gained mildly to the finish. GONE INZANE angled early to the inside, steadied
in tight approaching the lane, came out in midstretch and finished willingly. FLY E DUBAI was bumped into HYMN'S SYLVIA leaving the gate, trailed to the
stretch and made up ground late. PURE SPRING was no factor. ANY SUGAR HONEY dueled outside the winner into the turn then tired. CAPTAIN MAD
JACK ducked out into FLY E DUBAI leaving the gate then was no factor. ANYTIME ANYPLACE was finished early.

Footnotes
BOWTIE DIVA was slow to settle, rallied two wide around the turn, split rivals through the lane and quickly ran clear through late stretch. VIBRANT GINGER
showed speed from the outside, moved two wide to a clear lead midway on the turn, remained clear to the final sixteenth then weakened. SNEAKY
COWGIRL improved position under urging in the three path on the turn but lacked a closing kick. NAUT A GIVER stayed close to the inside around the turn
and lacked a rally. LYDIA SWEETIE broke in the air, chased briefly, bore out on the turn and faded. WEEKEND SERENADE stayed inside and failed to
menace. PUPPET was outrun after a slow break. PATTY MAC'S GIRL was hustled along the rail to duel early, stopped and was eased up late. SOBEIT
SYLVIA bobbled leaving the gate, trailed and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
INDIGESTION went after the early leader from the outside entering the stretch and took over late. HARPER P M showed speed from the outset, edged clear
from the inside on the turn and gave way grudgingly. CHITOWN was slow early, made a four wide run around the turn, was bumped in early stretch, lugged
in sharply, impeded GET THE POINT entering the furlong grounds then gained slowly to the end. Following an objection by Hernandez, CHITOWN was
disqualified and placed sixth. MANIPULATE was slow early then rallied the rail. NORMANDY BEACH pressed the early leader while along the rail then tired.
GET THE POINT bore out into CHITOWN entering the stretch then checked at the eighth pole when that one came in. SAVE ME PAULA was no factor.
INDISPUTABLYLINKED was wide and outrun. JOHNNY JUNIOR bobbled leaving the gate then was outrun. SOCAROO wasn't far back outside to the turn
then stopped.
