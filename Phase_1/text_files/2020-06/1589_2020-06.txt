Footnotes
SUMMER'S WINNER rated just outside BOBBIE TOO TOO, took over when allowed leaving the bend, drew away with hand urging upper stretch and
received only one reminder inside the last eighth. COMMANDING MIDAS was kept close between horses, came three wide into the stretch, took over
second then could only hold her position. TWO TURN TAMMY hesitated then was bumped at the break, came off the rail some on the turn, swung widest
for the drive and steadily advanced to gain third nearing the wire. LIPLINER well placed inside, swung four wide into the lane and gradually wore down the
final eighth. COUNTRY JO somewhat difficult to control on the backstretch, faded three wide on the bend. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke in stride, was
challenged approaching the half mile marker and gave way the last quarter mile. PLAY TWENTY broke slowly and inward, bumping TWO TURN TAMMY,
soon bore to the outside, bolted on the turn, was brought back in leaving the bend and had little to offer through the lane.

Footnotes
GUSANO broke outward, bumping DROOP'S M D B, pressed the pace from outside, stayed in path three through the turn, battled between rivals through
the stretch and gradually edged ahead the last eighth. W W CRUSADER also bumped with DROOP'S M D B at the start, soon had the advantage between
rivals, moved clear on the turn but drifted out badly leading the bend, fought from the middle of the track to hold on in the lane but did not have enough left
through the waning yards. BE AN INSPIRATION progressed five wide on the turn, angled outside W W CRUSADER upper stretch and closed well.
EUGENE in contention just off the inside, had the rail on the turn, floated out entering the stretch, altered inside MONFORD approaching the eighth pole,
had every chance but finished evenly. MONFORD disputed the pace from inside, did not keep up on the turn, drifted out to path three into the lane, came
again to duel for the lead but slowly wore down deep stretch. KAPCORI ROAD in midpack early, was three wide on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch,
threatened with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. TOUGH COMMISH bumped with JITU at the break, chased from between rivals and had no late bid.
JITU bumped with TOUGH COMMISH at the start then showed little in a ground-saving trip. DROOP'S M D B was bumped from both sides at the break,
stayed off the inside and also showed little.

Footnotes
RIPE ATTACK broke inward, bumping MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET, soon had a clear lead, showed the way staying off the inside and maintained full control
under a drive in the lane. PETEIZUM prominent toward the outside, fanned outside RIPE ATTACK for the stretch run and gained second late.
MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET bumped at the break, raced in contention just off the inside, was no match for RIPE ATTACK in the stretch and slowly yielded in
the late going. BAD MOON advanced from outside on the bend and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. AMAROQ in contention early, saved ground
taking the turn and flattened out the final furlong. TABADDOL trailed from inside then gradually angled out through the lane. PATCH'S LUGH was an early
factor toward the outside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend. Due to a timer malfunction, the first quarter fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
MIZ BLUE was quickly clear, showed the way in hand, lengthened her lead when put to a drive in the lane and was kept to urging until the last sixteenth.
FOX FREY forced into the gap some shortly after the break, was hustled up from inside, steadily advanced under urging, moved clear for second upper
stretch then could only just hold her position. BETTER ANGELS chased from outside, did not keep up five wide on the bend, showed a willingness to run
late from outside in the stretch and pulled away for third in the late going. CAROLINA BEAST forwardly placed between rivals, was two wide taking the turn,
weakened for the drive but was easily best of the others. RUNNING SCARED raced in contention toward the outside on the backstretch but began to fade
four wide on the bend. BELLA MY ELLA was prominent from outside for a half mile, came three wide into the stretch and gave way. B REWARDING
reluctant to load, was never a factor. G CITY WARRIOR tried to drift into the gap shortly after the start, was corrected, showed little staying off the inside
and was allowed to coast through the lane. BURKHART soon trailed and did not respond to urging through the stretch.

Footnotes
I LUV THIS BAR boxed in early, got through two wide on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, edged ahead and held on with steady urging.
CATANIA pressed from just off the inside, did not keep up on the turn, angled outside I LUV THIS BAR inside the last furlong, closed well but came up
short. CREAL DREAMER vied for the early lead from inside, moved ahead on the turn but slowly wore down for the drive. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was
hustled along on the backstretch to stay close, three to four wide taking the bend and found best stride too late in the lane. LADY DI disputed the pace from
outside on the backstretch, began to drift out on the turn, bolted leaving the bend and lost all chance. TAP'S LULLABY advanced just off the inside on the
turn, angled outside ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE upper stretch then drifted out further. TWELVE RED ROSES showed little in a ground-saving trip.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE was a factor between horses on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
CROCE D'ORO vied for the lead from between horses, was two wide on the bend, moved ahead under a drive upper stretch and lengthened his lead while
kept to urging the last eighth. SERIOUS TALK without early speed from outside, advanced along the rail on the bend, rallied through the lane and took over
second with a sixteenth left. PEACOCK MAN stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn then gradually wore down in the
lane. CALEB'S HEIR in contention toward the outside on the backstretch, angled in some near the quarter pole, swung out four wide for a clear path upper
stretch and slowly closed the gap the final furlong. HELLOFAGUY chased from between horses, was just off the inside on the turn, swung out behind
CALEB'S HEIR entering the stretch, altered in some for a clear path inside the final furlong and improved position. W W KAN DO was caught in tight
quarters early, jostled briefly with STORMY PACIFIC nearing the five furlong pole, settled back some, was just off the rail on the bend, swung out five wide
for the stretch run and leveled off. COOL AMBITION void of speed, though urged along from inside, picked up his pace on the turn and weaved around
some traffic to advance in the stretch. GO FOR SHERRIE was a contender running widest from the start, improved position four wide on the bend, was
forced out further into the lane then flattened out. STORMY PACIFIC jostled briefly with W W KAN DO approaching the five-eighths marker, recovered to
dispute the pace along the rail but tired for the drive. GREEN MEANS GO fractious in the gate, hesitated then broke in the air when the gate opened and
showed little.

Footnotes
GALAHAD KID hesitated then made a slight hop from the gate, was settled well back, picked up his pace on the turn, swung out into the lane, altered out six
wide with a furlong to go, was all out and got up at the wire. LEE LA DEW settled just off the inside, commenced his bid on the turn, angled out four wide
entering the stretch, rallied to gain a narrow lead in the waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort. SEQUINS STORM was quickly clear, showed the
way just off the inside, began to wear down inside the last furlong and was gradually drifting out in the late going. DONNER PASS without early speed,
progressed along the rail on the turn and found best stride too late from inside deep stretch. PRIME NITE forwardly placed from outside, was three to five
wide taking the bend and weakened for the drive. KEY VOYAGE chased from outside, was four wide on the turn, drifted out to the middle of the track
entering the lane and had no late bid. CHIPOLLINO well placed from inside, came off the rail some on the turn and flattened out between rivals through the
lane. HONEYDOLIST was void of speed, though urged along in the early going and failed to menace. CHILLY RED ACCOUNT raced in contention on the
backstretch from between horses but gave way on the bend.
