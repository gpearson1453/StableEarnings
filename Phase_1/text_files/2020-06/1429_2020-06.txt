Footnotes
EASTERN OCEAN pressed the pace outside then stalked the leader, bid outside on the far turn and gained command nearing the quarter pole, went clear
into the stretch and held gamely. LANE WAY chased off the inside then outside a rival, angled out into the three path, closed through the lane and
threatened the winner late but could not get by. TALLIEN (IRE) stalked from the inside, came out in upper stretch and bested the rest. EXHORT away
quickly at the start and set the pace inside a rival moved clear, challenged around the far turn and lost command approaching the quarter pole and gave in
the lane. EXETER raced a bit off the rail then settled inside, saved ground around the turn and into the stretch and lacked a rally. TAPITUTION trailed the
field from a bit of the rail, came out in the stretch and improved position four deep at the wire. FRASARD (GB) chased from the inside, went between
runners into the stretch, came out near the eighth pole and lacked rally. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) unhurried in the beginning, traveled in the two path
then moved out further off the rail, went four wide into the stretch, bumped by inside rival near the eighth pole and had little left in deep stretch. MUNNINGS'
PILOT raced three wide then outside a rival, continued three wide into the stretch, floated out by inside rival and bumped foe near the eighth pole and

inside, moved forward inside a pair of rivals, saved ground into the lane, rallied along the inside and missed. REAL GOOD DEAL vied between for command
then stalked three deep around the turn and into the stretch and edged rival for the show. VIOLENT SPEED vied three deep then cleared inside rivals,
angled over to the inside, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, lost command near the eight pole and was edged for the show. SINDY'S REVENGE broke
out then lacked early speed, angled to the inside, saved ground then came out in upper stretch and could not rally. TRUTH PREVAILS contested the early

SLY saved ground stalking the pace, inched forward leaving the backstretch, came off the rail past midstretch and rallied under left handed urging to get up
in the final stride. FENGARI sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace inside, inched away on the second turn, kicked clear and held on well but was
caught on the line. MOST SANDISFACTORY chased between horses then a bit off the rail, continued inside into and on the second turn and into the stretch
and bested the others. LEPRINO pressed the pace outside the runner-up, stalked leaving the second turn, was alongside the winner into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. CAMPS BAY bobbled some at the start, angled in and saved ground chasing the pace to the stretch and lacked a rally.

first turn, chased three deep then outside a rival, went three wide on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened. NEGOTIATOR pulled inside then
