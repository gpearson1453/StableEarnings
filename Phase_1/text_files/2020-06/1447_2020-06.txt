Footnotes
UTALKNBOUTPRACTICE broke in then pulled alongside the leader and then cleared, inched away around the turn and held sway under right-handed
urging. CAERULEAN bumped and lost path at the start, tracked near the inside, angled three wide on the turn and was up for second three deep at the wire.
HAMMERING LEMON veered in and bumped rival at the start, stalked two wide then between in the lane and got edged for second. COUNT ALEXEI sped
to the front then dueled inside, chased into and around the turn and finished willingly from the along the inside. EL DIABLO ROJO off a bit slow and
bothered at the start, saved ground to the lane and never threatened. ME MACHO bumped and forced in leaving the gate, settled early, went four wide into
the stretch and never responded to urging. HOLLYWOOD'S BEST chased two wide, angled three wide then back to the two path and failed to rally.
CALIFORNIA TENGA off a bit slow and shuffled back between runners, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. After a review, the Stewards
disqualified HAMMERING LEMON from third to sixth for veering in and causing interference to CAERULEAN and ME MACHO at the start.

GYPSY SPIRIT in upper stretch, moved clear near the eighth pole and drew away. RED LARK (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, traveled outside a rival then
in the two path, kept in that path on the second turn then came out four wide, rallied and bested the rest. QUERELLE threw head and off slow at the start,
angled to the inside, held the rail chasing the pace out upper stretch and was edged for the place. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) pulled early from off the rail chasing
the pace, went three wide around the first turn, moved outside the leader then cleared that foe to assume control, inched away on the backstretch, led clear
into the lane, overtaken a furlong out and weakened late. KEEPER OFTHE STARS dueled from the inside then stalked the leader, raced three wide and

from the whip in deep stretch and held gamely. JAN'S RESERVE pressed the pace three deep, stalked outside a rival leaving the turn, came three wide into
the stretch and held second between foes late. VANDER KELEN stalked a bit off the rail then outside a rival into the turn, continued off the inside, swung
three wide into the stretch and was edged for the place outside foes on the line. OH MARVELOUS ME bobbled in a slow start, saved ground chasing the
pace, continued inside on the turn and through the stretch and was edged for third. ADENS DREAM prompted the pace between horses then stalked just off
the rail leaving the turn and into the stretch, was outside a rival past midstretch and weakened some in the final furlong.

rival then a bit off the rail, went up three deep into the second turn, continued alongside a foe leaving that turn and into the stretch and could not quite

stride, angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, came out a bit in the stretch and had nothing left for the drive. BAM BAM AGAIN pulled and dueled

Footnotes
VODKA TWIST stalked inside then a bit off the rail, ranged up to take command outside the pacesetter leaving the second turn and won clear under left
handed urging and steady handling late. HAPI HAPI pulled inside then bore out into the first turn, angled in and chased outside a rival then three deep into
the second turn, was four wide in midstretch and was clearly second best. KAZANSKY chased inside then a bit off the rail, split horses into the second turn,
angled in, slipped through inside in midstretch and picked up the show. ENDLESS TALE had speed three deep then kicked away and angled in, set the
pace inside, relinquished command leaving the second turn, was between horses in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. ULTIMATE MYSTERY
chased three deep then outside a rival or off the rail to the stretch and did not rally. FABIO stalked just off the rail, dropped back on the second turn and
gave way.

Footnotes
SHADOW SPHINX stalked outside a rival then bid alongside the pacesetter on the backstretch and second turn, took the lead into the stretch, inched away
under urging and held. BOOGALUTE three deep on the first turn, angled in and chased a bit off the rail then inside on the second turn, came out leaving
that turn and three wide into the stretch and gained the place. GOLDEN DOUGHNUT pulled inside to stalk the pace, went outside a rival on the second turn
and three wide into the stretch and just held third. HOOTIE hopped slightly at the start, angled in and chased a bit off the rail or outside a rival, swung five
wide into the stretch and was edged for the show. MYSTERY MESSENGER saved ground chasing the pace, split horses in midstretch and could not
summon the needed late kick inside. WORTHY TURK hopped a bit at the start, chased outside a rival then three deep, angled in alongside a foe on the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SPANISH HOMBRE chased outside a foe then a bit off the rail, found the inside on
the second turn and into the stretch and did not rally. ROYAL INSIDER drifted out into the first turn then angled in and saved ground, dropped back on the
second turn and had little left for the drive. BLACKOUT (FR) had speed outside a rival then angled in and set the pace inside, fought back on the
backstretch and second turn and weakened in the drive.
