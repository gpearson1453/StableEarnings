Footnotes
MISS BOMBON vied for the lead from the three path early, went up to contest the lead two wide before a half, matched strides the length of the stretch and
proved best under strong handling. LIGHTNING MISS rushed to lead soon after the start, battled with the winner along the rail and finished gamely, second
best. EOWYN'S PARADISE unhurried, was in tight between rivals on the turn, checked at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the six path then closed
determinedly through the stretch. PLUS SIZE VALUE close from the start, advanced in the five path on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. EVEN IF
swerved leaving the chute bumping TOLLY CLUB then failed to reach contention. GUN THING had speed into the turn then weakened. ZIPPNINTHECITY
bumped a rival at the start, prompted the pace into the turn then gave way. TOLLY CLUB was bumped leaving the chute then outrun. LUTZY LU was
bumped at the start, squeezed between rivals leaving chute then never involved. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

or the trip and wore down rivals in a game effort. DAPPER JACK prompted the pace two wide for a half, dropped back on the second turn, came on again
along the inside while in the three path through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. LEO D hopped at the start, moved up steadily four then three
wide, made the lead past the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then was outfnished. FATHER DENNIS unhurried early, moved up two wide on the far
turn then leveled off. DINESEN close up from the start, rallied three wide to make the lead past the quarter pole, battled until mid stretch then came up
empty. ANGEL'S KNIGHT failed to menace. TYPOTHETAE was hustled along to set a pressured pace for a little over a half mile then tired. RED CHILL

Footnotes
CHIT CHATTING never far back, closed with a burst of speed in the six path through the stretch, drew off and won in hand. WOLF EYES trailed into the
stretch, closed willingly along the rail and got up for second. MISS IRISH BOSS chased the pace into the stretch and was outfinished in the five path.
JOHANNA'S PET sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path then shortened stride late. MAGNA
MONEY failed to menace. SUSIES WHO broke awkwardly and failed to menace.
