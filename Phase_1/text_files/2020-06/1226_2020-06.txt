Footnotes
BEACH TRAFFIC followed closely behind the leaders up the backstretch, took over from outside in the three-path soon after completing six furlongs, and
drew off under pressure on his left lead. SWEET GIANT went up to vie for command outside SKYLINE VIEW after a quarter-mile, could not withstand the
winner near the five-sixteenths, and ran on clearly best of the others. SKYLINE VIEW took the lead four then three wide around the first turn, contested the
pace inside SWEET GIANT through the middle stages, gave way approaching the stretch, and drifted out badly while able to salvage third. CAB BEEF
brushed with IAMBUTTER soon after the start, swung four wide improving position after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. THIS IS SPARTA broke
slowly, raced four wide around the first turn, and gave way after six furlongs. IAMBUTTER was bumped and brushed between TERRY JADE and CAB
BEEF after the start, and faded steadily inside leaving the far turn. TIMING broke slowly, checked sharply in the three-path behind IAMBUTTER midway on
the first turn, and faltered after six furlongs. TERRY JADE was briefly fractious and unseated the rider behind the gate, loaded and broke without further
incident, bumped with IAMBUTTER shortly after the start, dropped far back into the stretch and was eased up.

BLESSED JOURNEY trailed while not far back early, was shuffled back and steadied on the rail past the seven-sixteenths, went out and around with a
four-wide run through the turn, took over outside JOE BENJAMIN at the top of the stretch and drew off under a mild drive. JOE BENJAMIN hustled up to get
the lead, showed the way slightly off the rail through the first half-mile, could not hold off the winner after six furlongs, and ran on best of the others. MAINE
prompted the pace outside JOE BENJAMIN, and could not respond to urging by late on the turn. MONEY COMETH raced three wide, and tired after six
furlongs. CALL BROS stayed close up the backstretch, faltered around the turn, and dropped far back.

WAR GIANT took command after the start, rated along well removed from the rail, drifted out under left-hand pressure while clear in deep stretch, and held
on. TWO STEP SLEW took a brief run at the leader from outside midway up the backstretch, got shaken off, stayed on the chase outside and was gradually
closing in late. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER raced four wide around the first turn, moved inside and could not gain on the rail through the drive. MR. CREATIVE
raced in the two-path on the turns, and posed no threat. MR CHAPLIN saved ground and failed to become a factor.

Footnotes
CLASSY OF COURSE pressed the early pace before going up to vie outside HELEN HAYES, took over early on the turn, lost the advantage as DANA
GRACE came by outside near the five-sixteenths, moved out to rebid in the stretch, and finished determinedly to get up in the closing strides. DANA
GRACE tracked outside the leaders, took over in the three-path late on the turn, pulled clear into the stretch, but yielded in the final yards inside the winner.
JANET B DOESIT ALL raced widest about five paths out from the rail, lacked a solid final bid and was up for the show. ALGODONAL advanced four wide
around the turn, and flattened out in the lane. FEATURE CREATURE moved up after a half-mile, tried to move out from the two-path after six furlongs but
was prevented from doing so by ALGODONAL, and faded through the drive. BLAME THE GODS was forwardly placed early, and tired after a half-mile.
HELEN HAYES sprinted clear early, was joined from outside by CLASSY OF COURSE up the backstretch, and steadied in the process of giving way on the
turn. AGUAS COLORADAS was through early, and dropped far back after six furlongs. BREAKFAST POND hit the left side of the gate at the start, and
retired early.

Footnotes
FAST CATALINA vied outside OUR LITTLE DEVIL into the turn, disposed of that one and drew away in the four-path, was roused to extend the margin
through upper stretch, and stayed clear under pressure. SEAMIALAUGH came off the rail around the turn, and finished well in the two-path while inside the
winner. VINDA MACHINE came four wide off the turn, and was along for the show without threatening for anything more. CAMELLIA GAL failed to menace
three wide. OUR LITTLE DEVIL vied inside the winner early, and could not keep pace by midway on the turn. CABRINA refused to break, eventually came
out unruly with the rider losing the right iron, was pulled up and escorted back. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

LEGAL DEAL vied early inside BRIDOLOGIST, shook that one off as the rider glanced back late on the turn, widened the lead under a drive in upper
stretch, and drifted out steadily while well clear. BRIDOLOGIST pressed LEGAL DEAL from outside, got shaken off approaching the stretch, but ran on
willingly inside. MOZANO saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, and was up for the show between horses. CHILL HAZE tracked inside the leaders to the
turn, moved out three wide with aim at the top of the lane, came up empty and yielded third late. TRINNI ENERGY raced two wide on the turn, and made no
headway in the stretch outside. DIAMONDS PROSPECT saved ground into the stretch, and could not gain on the wrong lead. CHURCHILLS VICTORY lost
ground to the leaders three wide after a half-mile, and lugged in through upper stretch on his left lead. KATZ ME AT NOON was outrun four wide.

inside, overhauled the leaders past the eighth-pole and drew away under pressure. PATRIOT DRIVE tracked behind the battling leaders, came through
between them and poked a head in front after six furlongs with the rider looking back, moved out four or five wide in upper stretch, could not withstand the
winner and dug in to hold the place. NEW YEAR stayed well off the early pace, rallied to loom menacingly outside PATRIOT DRIVE in the five-path turning
for home, flattened out and was outfinished for the place. BELGRANO was off the rail dueling inside JAY'S WAY early, got the best of that one past the
five-sixteenths, but yielded to challengers approaching the top of the stretch and dropped out of it. JAY'S WAY dueled outside BELGRANO, drifted out while
giving way around the turn and was eased up through the lane. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ASSERTIKO contested the pace outside COUNTRY SINGER from the start, edged away entering the final furlong and drove clear. COUNTRY SINGER led
briefly early inside ASSERTIKO, pressed that rival around the turn and into upper stretch, and yielded grudgingly. LUDINGTON was in range between
horses entering the turn, moved out for the drive and was along for third without menacing the top two. POSEIDEN tracked outside the leaders, had the
rider drop the whip at the top of the stretch, lugged in and weakened. QUIJOTE saved ground into the turn, moved out widest into the lane and faded. BOLD
ENVOY dropped back entering the turn in the two-path.

HE'S INCREDIBLE bumped with TAKE CHARGE DUDE at the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, rallied steadily and caught GO GONE GONE
past the sixteenth-pole. GO GONE GONE argued the early pace outside ALLEGEDLY PERFECT and R MERCEDES BOY, took over after three furlongs,
stayed on to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. R MERCEDES BOY battled up front between rivals into the turn, was out-moved approaching the stretch,
and ran on with good courage inside the top two. TAKE CHARGE DUDE balked at loading, bumped with HE'S INCREDIBLE at the start and was
outsprinted early, came widest off the turn and could not gain. CRYOGENIC shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a rally. ALLEGEDLY
PERFECT dueled inside R MERCEDES BOY and GO GONE GONE early, and gave way turning for home.

MAGNOLIA BLVD pressed the pace outside MR. VECCHIO, wrested command in upper stretch, pulled clear into the last furlong and had enough to hold
sway late. TONY SMALL was outrun for a half-mile near the three-path, moved further out rallying through mid stretch, and was closing in outside the top
one. ELITE MISSION chased between horses in the second wave of pursuers for a half-mile, and finished evenly. BULKCARRIER raced within striking
range inside to the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. SIGNIFIED advanced five wide around the turn, but flattened out in the stretch. EL DUQUE saved
ground outrun early, circled five wide approaching the stretch and passed tired horses. MR. VECCHIO sped to the front after an alert beginning, set the
pace to the stretch hounded by the eventual winner, and gave way after relinquishing the lead in upper stretch. KHATTAF broke out at the start, raced four
wide and tired after a half-mile. MITHRA brushed the left side of the gate and was off slowest, came six wide off the turn and made no impact. CAPITAN
FOFO was finished early inside. TRANSFORM UP chased early between horses three wide, tired after a half and was eased up in the lane.
