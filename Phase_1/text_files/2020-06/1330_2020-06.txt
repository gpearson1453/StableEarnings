Footnotes
NICK PAPAGIORGIO stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead mid way on the far turn, was challenged on his outside by LUCKY
RAMSEY approaching the eighth pole, dueled with that one and determinedly prevailed. LUCKY RAMSEY , three wide the first turn, moved up four deep on
the far turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and hung. BOWSPRIT lacked speed, raced four wide leaving the far turn and offered a slight rally outside horses.
CORT'N ASONG saved ground around the far turn, stalked the pace but failed to rally. BONDURANT , five deep leaving the far turn, passed tired horses.
BELTWAY BOB was outrun. NO KNOCK RAID , three wide the first turn, chased the pace and weakened. CHIEF EXCHANGER sped to the early lead,
angled in entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail and faltered.

Footnotes
START WITH YES settled outside a rival, commenced a run as the pace became more contested mid way on the turn, circled six wide into the lane, rolled
up outside rivals to take command in mid stretch, kicked clear under a drive heading to the sixteenth marker then cruised home in the final yards. STREET
PRAYER tracked three wide under rating, bid three deep past the five sixteenth, gained a short lead while battling into the lane, fought on after being
headed in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards and saved the place. GONE HOME , four wide stalking the leaders, took closer order
five wide into the lane, chased past mid stretch and continued with effort. WICKED SON sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a pair
of foes mid turn, dueled into the lane, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded. HONOR RUN bobbled at the break, recovered and prompted the pace
two wide, bid between foes leaving the three eighths, vied on a short lead past the quarter pole, remained a presence to the furlong grounds then gave way.
INDIAN GHOST , off the pace while saving ground, angled out in the drive and had belated action. DANZ A REBEL broke slowly, saved ground off the
pace, was under pressure mid turn but lacked a bid. JOHN'S PROMISE gave early pursuit towards the inside, came out some around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HAY BOY , angled in mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, eased out near the three sixteenths pole, swept to command in mid
stretch and eagerly drew out. RISING PERRY stalked the pace two wide around the turn, eased outside in mid stretch and rallied. SKYJACKED lacked
speed, raced between horses in upper stretch and rallied mildly. HAZ A NOTION hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled outside near the eighth pole

Footnotes
TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY , under a snug hold outside a rival early, moved up four wide nearing the four turn to take aim, cleared in hand mid turn, was put to a
stout drive in upper stretch, wandered outward when meeting a bid past the furlong grounds, kept on tenaciously and proved best. CORNETTA'S CHOICE
bore out at the break, corrected and dropped in, was steadied along nearing the three quarter pole, regrouped and stalked, shifted out near the far turn,
circled five wide into the lane, ranged up to threaten the winner nearing the sixteenth marker, battled gamely but was kept at bay. R AWESUM BETTY ,
bumped at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out mid turn, came three wide for the drive, shifted back in near mid stretch and
churned on. SAND IN MY SHOES , bumped at the break, stalked two wide, waited behind foes nearing the three eighths, angled out, circled into the lane
and kept on trying. GIULIANA VEE prompted the pace three wide, bid between rivals after a half mile, pressed the issue, chased leaving the three eighths
and gave way in upper stretch. TEA IN CHINA set a pressured pace two wide and faltered in upper stretch. RACING MY FATHER rushed up inside early
on, forced the pace for nearing a half mile then faltered. FREE FALLING broke slowly, was eased in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
PATAZ tracked a contested pace about three wide, was fanned five wide entering the lane, forged to command three sixteenths out, responded when set
down, drew clear a furlong out and was solidly hand ridden through the final sixteenth. CREATIVE GENIUS settled off the pace while removed from the
inside, swung out six wide for clear sailing soon into the lane, straightened away, closed steadily and got up for the place late. FIVE CARD DRAW saved
ground chasing the leaders, edged up a bit past mid stretch, kept on with interest but was nabbed for second money. OUTSIDE THE BOX lagged off the
pace, raced three wide into the lane, shifted in and lacked a solid finish. STRIVE FOR A CURE set a pressured pace inside, wandered outward a couple of
paths entering the stretch, fought on past the furlong grounds then gave way. FORTHEGREATERGOOD forced the pace outside of STRIVE FOR A CURE,
was floated out by that one entering the lane and weakened in the final furlong. GREAT COUNTRY , bumped at the break, pursued three to four wide and
came up empty. IRISHTOWN came out at the break bumping a rival and failed to menace. BANDOLINI broke a bit slow, edged up nearing the half mile
marker, chased between rivals mid turn and gave way. THE MINIT I SEE U broke a step slow, raced inside rivals nearing the turn, remained towards the
inside and failed to respond. TOM TERRIFIC , bumped at the break, was shuffled back soon after, lost ground and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GREELEY'S BANKER stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, took the lead inside the eighth pole and drove
clear. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET , in the three path between horses on the turn, steadied in tight quarters in upper stretch, worked between rivals in the
stretch and closed gamely. WALK AWAY JOE lacked speed, eased out on the turn, was fanned seven deep turning for home and had a mild rally outside
foes. ALWAYS FORGIVEN broke sluggishly, moved up four wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and flattened out. SEISMIC JOLT
chased the pace two wide around the turn and weakened the final furlong. TAPPAHANNOCK raced in the two path around the turn and failed to rally in an
even effort. DIRTYFOOT , brushed leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. YONDERING , steadied in close
quarters along the rail leaving the backstretch, was not a factor. LET'S RUMBLE bore in at the break, rushed to the front, set the pace along the rail and
tired. SOUTHERN SEA , well placed three wide on the turn, angled to the five path turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
NO MO LADY was steadied off heels in the opening furlong, recovered and rated outside a rival, crept closer past the five sixteenths, swung out from
behind rivals to be about five wide into the lane, responded to a few taps and rolled past the leader leaving the furlong grounds, eagerly cleared and was
under mild coaxing through the final seventy yards. TASS , away well, was taken back off the leader nearing the first turn, dropped in towards the fence and
rated forwardly, eased out mid way on the final turn, went on the attack a sixteenth later, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, could not contain the
winner but stayed gamely for second. KAILEE (IRE) saved ground under patient handling, eased out to advance nearing the quarter pole, worked her way
between rivals leaving mid stretch and finished with decent energy. I'M LISTENING rated in range, moved up between runners nearing the far turn, had aim
into the lane but went even in the final furlong. JABUTICABA cleared without much asking, angled in to set the pace, was taken on entering the lane, battled
past the three sixteenths, faded and steadied late. SAFFRON SPIRIT , in a bit close soon after the break, raced three to four wide and churned on.
WILDCAT CARTRIDGE saved ground off the pace, eased out around the final turn but lacked a serious kick. EBULLIENT stalked the pace outside, moved
up leaving the far turn, was under pressure with aim into the lane, failed to kick on and weakened in the last eighth. ARTFUL SPLATTER saved ground, was
lightly shuffled near the three eighths, quickly regrouped, remained inside for the drive but lacked a bid. DOLORES WESTWORLD failed to menace. DIXIE
CANNON stalked the early pace, eased back from between runners approaching the far turn, shifted five wide, pursued into the stretch then gave way.
MORTAL STORM broke slowly, raced well wide near the five eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
ANNIKA GOLD stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead outside HASHTAG SELFIE near the eighth pole then lasted under urging. SO
INNOCENT broke slowly, raced wide around the turn, was six deep turning for home and rallied outside the winner. OUR STAR , four wide turning for home,
flattened out between horses. STAY SPECIAL showed speed along the rail, weakened, raced on her left lead in the drive and drifted out near the sixteenth
pole. HASHTAG SELFIE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch, drifted in upper stretch and tired the final furlong. CAT
GIUMARELLO , no factor, saved ground on the turn. DAZZLE ME raced inside horses and failed to rally.

Footnotes
POWER BACK , under a snug hold about four wide early on, commenced a run mid turn, circled into the stretch, bid outside rivals in mid stretch, dueled
with STROLLED ON BY through the final furlong and edged ahead late. STROLLED ON BY , fractious pre race, stalked the pace three wide, bid between
foes to gain a slim lead in mid stretch, battled gamely to the inside of POWER BACK and missed in a sharp effort. SECOND ENCORE chased off the rail,
circled four to five wide into the lane and closed steadily. SPIDER BITE chased two to three wide and churned on between foes. CONFECTIONER ,
bumped at the break, was lightly steadied nearing the turn, eased off the inside in the drive and worked his way between rivals late. KUKULKAN vied
outside a rival before going clear into the turn, set the pace off the inside into the lane, was collared nearing the furlong grounds and weakened. DITEN
drifted out at the break, rated behind a rival mid turn, altered out past mid stretch and finished with decent energy. MORE TWIRL broke slowly, recovered
and showed good speed to reach contention, chased three wide into the lane, drifted a bit near mid stretch and faded. EAGLE KEEPER , towards the inside
while in mid pack, eased out in upper stretch the steadied off heels inside the furlong grounds. HAIR OF THE DOG had speed to the inside of KUKULKAN,
was rated back nearing the turn, edged back up into the lane, lacked some room past mid stretch, steadied when in close then faded. ROYALIAN , pushed
out at the break, raced wide and failed to menace. MIGHTY SOLDIER gave some early inside pursuit and faltered. Due to a timer malfunction, no internal
fractions were available. The final time was hand-timed.
