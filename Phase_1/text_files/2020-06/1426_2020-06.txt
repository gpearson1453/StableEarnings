Footnotes
BOY HOWDY pressed the pace four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front when set down then held under steady urging. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE set the
pace under pressure from the winner, was three wide to the stretch then was collared in mid stretch, headed by CASH LIMIT but battled gamely to save
second. SIERRA DANCE chased the pace four wide to the stretch then responded in the drive but missed the place. CASH LIMIT was also chasing the
leaders, came two wide to the stretch, rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch then hung late. ROMAN ROCKET had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch
and made up ground belatedly. TUSCAN WARRIOR was pinched off early, took up, trailed three wide to the stretch then shifted widest and closed some
ground.

PAMMI DEAREST never far back to the turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, responded when set down and gradually wore down SWEETENER
late. SWEETENER attended the pace to the turn the pushed away three wide to the stretch, resisted the winner to the sixteenth marker but could not hold
while not threatened for second. PACIFIC SILENCE set the pace to the turn, was outkicked by the runnerup to the stretch then came up empty in the drive.
BRITE TAN had no speed, was two wide on the turn and closed the gap without being a serious menace. ANGRACIA broke a bit slow, lagged two wide to
the stretch then did not threaten in the drive. PAPA SAID YA chased the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
DELTA FORUM had good speed, set the pace two wide, kicked away to mid stretch and held under steady urging. BABY YOU GOT IT had no speed, was
forced to circle five wide on the turn then was no threat to the winner but gamely got the nod for the place. DOUBLE TIGER was outsprinted early then was
rank leaving the half, lost ground to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished in a mild bid but was too late for second. STARTENDER was
chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. MONSTRODAMOUS also chased the winner but was
forced to circle five wide to the stretch and weakened in the drive. RAINDANCE RULES attended the pace inside the winner to the turn, got outrun while
saving ground to the stretch and tired in the lane. HONG KONG COWBOY chased the pace early, dropped back on the turn in the four path and did not
menace.

ZELAIA pressed the pace three wide to the stretch then pushed to the front in mid stretch and held determinedly. DANIEL THE DREAMER stalked the
leader to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then finished willingly but could not catch the winner. THUNDER WOMAN broke in a tangle then
recovered and chased the pace two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. ACADIA FLEET had no speed, was four wide to the stretch and also
did not rally. TONI TWO POCKET hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then could not resist the winner and tired. STREUSEL took
up when squeezed between rivals in the early stages, trailed to the turn, shifted off the rail but came up empty in the drive. GIFTY had no speed, was four
wide on the turn and not a factor. MAUI MAGIC had brief speed only.
