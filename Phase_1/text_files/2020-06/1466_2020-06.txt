Footnotes
G J BUSTER pressed the pace two wide through the turn, asked for more in late turn, quickly cleared into the lane then widened through the final eighth.
O'PRADO PERK was in the three path through the turn while unhurried, bid into the lane and was up for the place spot. FIVE GRAND saved ground
through the turn and into the lane, came off the inside in the lane and could only be up for the show spot. INTERFERENCE set the pace through late turn
while under pressure, could not go with the winner then gave way along the rail through the final sixteenth. RUSHED raced in the two or three path through
the turn and improved position through the final eighth. C JS BILLY BYU was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. GIFTED JUSTICE
chased the pace from the three path through the turn then faded through the lane. BIG JOHN O was outrun while in the two path. PER RULING FROM THE
INDIANA RACING COMMISSION, G J BUSTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT PRIZE pressed the pace two wide, bid in late turn, cleared into the lane then widened through the lane. WHITE WOLF was in the two path
through the turn, angled into the three path entering the lane, was no match for the winner then saved place late. DEVIL'S RULE was unhurried while in the
two path, angled into the five path entering the lane, was bothered inside the sixteenth pole when another came out then continued on from the seven path
to miss the place spot. GET ALONG dueled for the lead through the turn, could not go with the winner then weakened inside the eighth pole. WILL KNOWS
was along the inside through the turn, came off the rail entering the lane, was a bit erratic late when angling out and was never a serious threat while turning
in an even effort. ZIPAWAY was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and weakened through the final eighth.
FUGIWHARA was in the two or three path through the turn when well back, came into the lane widest and never was seriously involved. HOWARD OF
LUCK vied for the early lead into the turn, chased the pace into the lane then faded. SKY MIKE was outrun while in the three path.

Footnotes
MR MANNING set the pace into the turn, cleared in late turn, was joined by another before the eighth pole, dueled with that one through the final eighth and
just prevailed and lasted over the closing runner-up. JOVA was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and
was closing in on the dueling leaders through the final sixteenth and just missed. FLOWERPECKER chased the pace from the two path, bid into the lane,
moved to near even terms with the winner, was still a serious threat and needed more late while between the top two. OPERATION STEVIE was void of
speed while saving ground, came off the inside while passing a tired one near the eighth pole then finished with good energy to be closing in too late.
BLACK SALT was in the two path through the turn, was in the eight path for the drive and offered a mild gain. I WILL STAND weakened along the inside.
TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER chased the pace from the four path through the turn and slowly lost ground. ITS JUST FATE chased the pace from the three path
then faded through the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN COMMAND pressed then chased the pace from the two path, bid two wide into the lane, moved beside the leader under a drive just outside the
eighth pole then quickly widened through the final sixteenth. BACKSTREET LADY set the pace from the outset while in the two path, was clear entering the
lane, no match for the winner the final eighth and settled for second best. CARMELLA KEY saved ground through the turn then lacked a closing response
while finishing best of the rest. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL chased the pace from the three path into the lane then weakened. CAKE INA CAN was in the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was never a serious threat. D D SEVEN THIRTY raced along the inside through the turn
and into the lane and was never a threat. AZURITA lost her path early when outside rival stepped in at the start, raced in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane widest and from the eight path and finished with good energy. PLAYFUL JUSTICE was along the inside through the turn and into the
lane and never was a factor. MATILDAS MAGIC raced in the four path through the turn and tired. MYA in the three or four path through the turn and tired in
the lane. MAGNIFICENTREVENGE was outrun while in the three path. BACKHAND was done early while in the two path.

Footnotes
JOHNNY UNLEASHED pressed the pacesetter then settled to chase that one into the lane, gained the lead nearing the sixteenth pole, quickly cleared then
held on. LIBERAL LUNACY was unhurried while near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and finished strongly to be
closing in late and quickly led soon after the wire. DANCE PROUDLY chased from the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path
and was gaining to the wire. STRIKE raced in the two path through the turn, came further off the inside down the lane and offered a mild gain. REVEREND
AJ set the pace from the two path through the turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane, had his largest lead with an eighth to go then faltered.
HOMEBRED was last away and settled to the back, raced in the three path and offered a mild gain while not a threat. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND saved
ground through the turn and lacked a bid. CONFIDENTIAL trailed the field and lacked an impact while saving ground.

HERBIES TOYS was clear early and kept the advantage under mild urging. AWAKENED stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths mark,
bumped a foe thrice in the stretch, then couldn't get to the winner. SUGGESTED stalked inside but couldn't close late. INDOCUMENTADO pressed outside
of the leader, was bumped three times in the stretch and was taken up. BETTER TAPIT stalked the pace between foes, but had no closing bid. DISCIPLE
was not a factor. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR saved ground to no avail. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
INDOCUMENTADO, AWAKENED WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.
