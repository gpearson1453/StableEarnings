DRENA'S BULLET stalked the leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. BIG CLASSIC
set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and held place. GREENFIELD was unhurried early, hustled along on the turn
and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. DISTINCT PASSION tracked the leader from the inside and was roused on the turn but had
no late kick. CONQUEST ELIMINATR was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.

CHILITO PIQUIN set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch proved best. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was in range,
roused on the turn and was clearly second best. LOVE THAT LUTE stalked the leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path
at the top of the stretch needed more. SOPHISTICATION broke poorly and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled
off. TOP HAT TRICK forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty. LEO THE RABBIT was off the pace
and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
WRITTEN set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a slim lead from the four path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. TRULY HONOURED
was in touch, a factor on the turn and had a bid from the five path through the stretch but was outgunned. I HAVE FEELINGS stalked the early leader and
was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MEET YOU AT HOME was well back, closed the gap on the turn and
passed tired foes through the stretch. GET SAUCY was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. OUR PETUNIA was up close early
but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

Footnotes
BABY LUNA set the pace, took command on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch proved best. LIGHT OF CONGRATS was in range, a factor
on the turn and had a bid from the four path through the stretch but was no match for the winner. MINTAKA BELLE was off slow, gained ground on the turn
and from the five path through the stretch was up for show. PRINCESS MORO was in touch and saved ground on the turn but had no late kick. SAVOIA
forced the pace but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. MOON ROVER was unhurried early and showed little in
a dull effort. STELLATARA was off the pace and showed nothing while outrun.

CHICK BEAR set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. SINGING THE BLUES was in
range, moved up on the turn and gained gradually through the stretch. WELL YOU KNOW was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. TALKING LEAVES was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. PARTY DRESS was away alertly and
raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. KLASSY DELIGHT had no speed, chased on the turn and was not
a factor. TARAVILA was well back, showed nothing and was never in contention.
