maintained his advantage under brisk handling. TAPAWAY pressured the winner two wide and finished second best. ONE CRAZY RIDE bore out, bumped
the winner at the start and stalked the pace in an even effort. REINVESTEDINTEREST was bumped at the start and had a mild late rally in the four path.

Footnotes
BELLAMY BROOKE a bit slow out of the gate, surged rapidly between horses to make the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook
clear under confident handling and maintained her advantage under a brisk hand ride. WILLOUGHBY GAP stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, was
carried out to the seven path, bumped late but got up for second in the final strides. HADA MADRINA bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide into
the stretch, drifted out to the six path under left handed urging, bumped with the runner up late and was outfinished. SOUTH BEACH GIRL vied for the lead
near the inside and went evenly. MISS VERO bumped at the start and failed to menace. MRS. ROBINSON was no factor. MISS IRISH BOSS was outrun. A
FABULOUS KISS was no threat. NATALIA'S TEMPLE showed little. PINK HALDER was no factor.

DELIGHTFUL PRIDE with the second flight inside, finished second best. OPALESCENT never far back, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and
finished determinedly. SASSY SISTER allowed to settle, swung wide and closed some ground late in the six path. BAINBRIDGE was outrun. WILD TILLIE
with the second flight two wide, lacked the needed response. BACCARAT pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then gave way. WEEKEND AT
LAST had speed into the turn then weakened. TOM'S TUNE broke awkwardly and was never close. THE CALICO LADY was outrun.

Footnotes
FRONTLINER never far back, closed with a burst of speed four wide through the stretch and was along in time. HIGHLAND PARK HERO made the lead
soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch and held on for second. JOE BAILEY allowed to settle, swung wide and closed some ground late in the
six path. EMPIREMEISTER well placed, inched closer along the inside through upper stretch then leveled off. LOVELY HEIR chased the pace until deep
stretch then faded. RED CHILL broke in a tangle and was no factor. I AM IRON MAN was through after a half. TYPOTHETAE had brief speed.
