GIANT MINE set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. NARROW ESCAPE was unhurried early,
moved up on the far turn and had a bid from the four path in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. MAGICAL BREEZE was in touch, raced evenly on
the far turn and was the best of the rest. DIVINE AMI had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. GET MY GIST stalked the early
but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty. TWO STELLAS was off the pace and showed little while outrun.

best. WALKINAROUNDMONEY was hustled early and dueled on the turn but was second best in a good effort. UP N ADAM showed no speed, closed the
gap on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. STONE KING dueled early and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left. J
