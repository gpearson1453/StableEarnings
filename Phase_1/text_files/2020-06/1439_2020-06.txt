Footnotes
STACKSDENERO was shut off near the half-mile pole, dropped well back, advanced along the rail around the turn, tipped out to rally two wide through the
lane and was up late. BRET'S LEGACY chased the pace three wide, rallied outside but was outkicked. CELTIC MISSION was bumped hard near the
half-mile pole, raced four wide off the pace and rallied for the show. JUST GO WITH IT had early speed two wide and faded around the turn. MOUNTAIN
EXPRESS veered out early and slammed a foe near the half-mile pole, had early speed, checked while racing erratically nearing the turn, raced three wide
around the bend and lacked a closing bid. TUN TUN sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, took a bad step in deep stretch, lost the
rider, returned lame and was euthanized on the track. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident in the stretch and took no action.

AWESOME FU set the pace along the rail, drew off down the backstretch, drifted out in the stretch and held clear under a drive. CANTAKEITANYMORE
lagged well back inside, advanced two wide around the clubhouse turn, bid two wide nearing the lane and finished willingly while unable to reel in the
winner. EL EMANUEL settled off the pace while racing three wide, lacked a bid and was along for the show. GLEN'S CASTLE saved ground to no avail. I
NEED YOU played no factor while racing two wide. THE PREDICTOR chased the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. ONCE MORE EH
prompted the winner two wide and retreated.

Footnotes
MY LOVELY GIRL vied two wide early, cleared leaving the three-eighths pole, drew off along the rail around the far turn and held well clear under moderate
urging. CARPE AMORINA chased the winner three wide, lacked a serious rally but held clear of the rest. TUNSTALL saved ground while chasing the
winner, lacked rally and held for the show. WILLA lacked speed, saved ground, tipped out in upper stretch and never threatened. LA DUQUESA vied inside
of the winner early, angled two wide when that foe cleared and faded around the turn. CRYPTOMNESIA failed to menace while racing two wide. PENNY
PINCHER was outrun inside. LADY TOSCANOVA played no factor while racing three wide. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN had brief speed outside.

Footnotes
BACOLI set the pace in the two path, responded immediately to bid from the runner-up midway down the backstretch, re-cleared around the far turn and
widened while well in hand through most of the stretch. COMPROMISO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn,
advanced four wide around the clubhouse turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the five-sixteenths, was no match for that foe but stayed on willingly to be a
clear second best. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled in leaving the quarter pole, moved into a clear third around
the far turn and maintained that position. WALL saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. MERRY MERRY MOJO
was bumped at the start, lacked speed inside, went three to four wide around the far turn and never threatened. DEPUTY DREW was outrun inside. BAY
HILL steadily faded inside. BANISHMENT stalked the winner two wide and was through after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CATAUGA COUNTY settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed determinedly and was up in the final
strides. GIO LEMON settled off the early duel two wide, bid three wide into the far turn, seized command leaving the three-sixteenths pole, briefly cleared in
midstretch, dug in inside of the winner but yielded late. MARCH TO MY TUNE lacked early speed while saving ground, advanced four wide around the far
turn and rallied for the show. HARASAN raced off the pace inside, made progress two wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. AWESOME BUZZ
dueled two wide for five furlongs and weakened. SOUL MACHEN dueled inside and tired in the lane. A. P. D'ORO was outrun inside. VALADIER had brief
speed inside. OUTVOTED played no factor while racing three wide. BLIMEY LIMEY was in a nice spot stalking the duel three wide and had no response.
