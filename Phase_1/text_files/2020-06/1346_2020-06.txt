MALIBU JUNE broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, responded when challenged entering the
drive, opened a clear advantage and held sway. SILVER TAKE CHARGE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second
turn, challenged the winner entering the drive but could not match strides. WIDOW OF NAIN forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward,
responded but could only gain the show. GILDED APPLE chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid but was outfinished for the show. INFINITE
SOLUTIONS was never a factor. CAZADORA forced the early pace and faded.
