Footnotes
MISS FLYING SUN settled within range early inside, got steered four wide approaching the stretch, took over outside MADAME MOON and TONED UP
entering the final furlong, and was geared down through the last 70 yards. TONED UP advanced to contention four then three wide around the turn, bid for
command in upper stretch, and could not match strides with the winner while best of the others. MADAME MOON was never far back, challenged outside
midway on the turn, shifted in battling with TONED UP into the lane, and weakened inside. SWANEE BEACH vied for the lead inside for nearly six furlongs,
and weakened through the stretch. INEDATEQUILA contested the pace outside SWANEE BEACH early, and gave way between horses after five furlongs.
SUMMER SHORE stumbled at the start, stayed close outside to the turn, and retreated. DA DOOP was slow into stride, and dropped far back near the
stretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BEAUTY QUEEN steadied between horses past the half-mile pole, advanced three wide late on the turn, caught the leaders from outside through the lane
and kicked clear. SILVER PACKAGE was three wide into the turn, went up to contest the pace outside R LOVE ON THE RUN before completing a
quarter-mile, battled into the stretch and came up second best. R LOVE ON THE RUN sped to the front after the start, dueled inside SILVER PACKAGE
from midway on the turn into the stretch, and weakened. SENNEBEC SUMMER saved ground around the turn, angled to the far outside in upper stretch,
and lacked a solid response. INPENDING BREEZE moved inside early, and was no factor. KIRTAN broke slowly, and was never in the hunt. SHE'S
CLASSY showed brief speed two wide, and could not keep pace around the turn.

COMBINATION was content to sit off the early leaders, took over readily outside WHYRUAWESOME and SWAGGER midway on the turn, drew clear after
a half-mile and widened on his left lead in hand. NATIVE HAWK was driven three wide on the turn to get going, and took the battle for place inside FOURTH
DESIGN while never a threat to the winner. FOURTH DESIGN was put to pressure on the turn four wide, and rallied mildly outside. STARSHIP APOLLO
broke slowly, trailed to the stretch, and passed tired horses. WHYRUAWESOME set a pressured early pace, and weakened on the rail through the drive.
SWAGGER argued the pace between horses, and weakened through the drive.

Footnotes
ZABAVA was reserved early outside, rallied four wide coming off the far turn, rallied steadily and was up in deep stretch. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON trailed
early inside, remained well back four wide approaching the stretch, moved to the far outside and finished well. CODRINGTON was on hold toward the back
for six furlongs, and found her best stride belatedly between horses in the two-path to get up for third. BIG TINA tucked in behind the leaders for six furlongs,
came off the rail to the two-path at the top of the lane, moved past CHARLOTTE THE BRIT and went back inside with a bid entering the final furlong, and
did not have enough. TOWA prompted the pace outside CHARLOTTE THE BRIT, challenged for command on the far turn, reached the lead in the
three-path through upper stretch, and was outfinished from both sides. BELIEVE INDEED broke a couple lengths slow, advanced mildly after six furlongs,
and gained some ground gradually late without threatening. AUGUSTA MOON was four wide entering the backstretch, split horses getting roused after six
furlongs, had aim outside the leaders in upper stretch, but weakened through the late stages. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT set the pace inside for six furlongs,
and folded up. ADAMANT tracked outside the leaders, and gave way three wide approaching the stretch. BROADWAY CAT faded steadily inside after a
half-mile. MINESHAFT MADNESS was two then three wide on the first turn, and was through early.

Footnotes
HONEST GAL stayed close three wide from the start, took over outside MORE DIAMONDS after three furlongs, and held sway under a drive. SHEZ STUCK
UP raced two to three wide around the turn, exchanged bumps and brushes with NENITA from upper stretch to inside the eighth-pole, and outfinished that
rival for second. NENITA bumped with IMPRESSION GIVEN at the start, raced four wide around the turn, was outside SHEZ STUCK UP jousting with that
foe through a good part of the stretch, and finished evenly. MORE DIAMONDS dueled outside FEATHER'S SECRET early, got the best of that dispute, but
could not cope with HONEST GAL turning for home and weakened inside. LEISHLANICK saved ground on the turn, moved out for the drive and could not
gain. PERSONALLY trailed for three furlongs, and never reached contention. IMPRESSION GIVEN bumped with NENITA at the start, and faded four wide
approaching the stretch. CAPELINE was never involved. FEATHER'S SECRET dueled inside MORE DIAMONDS early, and weakened midway on the turn.

Footnotes
MUGGSAMATIC bumped lightly with KROY at the start, saved ground reserved for six furlongs, was under a drive making little headway around the far turn,
slid off the inside to the four-path with a sixteenth remaining, and kicked in on his left lead to run past the leaders. GALLEON MAST saved ground well
within range to the far turn, crept closer to the leaders after six furlongs, was guided out three wide with aim at the top of the stretch, rallied to the lead
outside through the furlong grounds, but was overhauled nearing the finish. WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO was on the lead inside when he leapt awkwardly
midway up the backstretch, regrouped and continued on with a slight advantage over CLASS AND CASH to upper stretch, and stayed on stubbornly along
the fence. KROY bumped lightly with MUGGSAMATIC at the start, stayed close three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing response on the wrong
lead. CLASS AND CASH prompted the pace outside WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO, turned up the pressure challenging for command after six furlongs, and
weakened between horses in deep stretch. LAST JUDGMENT was four wide early, moved inside and was finished on the far turn.

Footnotes
LIFE IN SHAMBLES moved widest beginning to go after GUMP after a quarter-mile, ranged up clear of the others with the rider glancing back near the
five-sixteenths, took over from outside turning for home and drove away. FORTUNE COOKIE was between horses entering the turn, moved out four wide
past the quarter-pole, brushed with ALL AROUND at the top of the stretch while outside that one, and was along for the place. ALL AROUND advanced on
the turn three wide, brushed with FORTUNE COOKIE into the lane, and finished evenly. GUMP sped to the front after an alert beginning, rated along in the
two-path through a quick half-mile, was no match for the winner turning for home, and weakened inside. RACK GIN struggled to keep pace four then three
wide around the turn, and gave way. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN hustled up early along the rail, but retreated around the turn. STRONG ONE showed speed
three wide for a quarter-mile, dropped back on the turn and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
KELSEY'S CROSS was taken off the inside well back leaving the first turn, remained unhurried through the middle stages, swung out to the five-path getting
in gear after six furlongs, rallied through the lane and drew clear late out past the middle of the course. CROWN AND SUGAR cleared to the inside with the
lead approaching the first turn, rated along through a manageable pace to the stretch, could not withstand the winner but held well. PICARA stayed close
inside to the stretch, moved out through the furlong grounds and finished evenly. MIDNIGHT SOIREE settled in midpack for six furlongs, waited behind
horses past the quarter-pole and through upper stretch, moved to the rail and did not have enough. ONYX was outrun early inside, swung four wide into the
stretch and improved position outside. BIENVILLE STREET hugged the rail, was shuffled back and lost position around the far turn, remained in traffic
through upper stretch and could never be fully set down. BELLERA lagged well back for six furlongs, circled five wide and lacked a closing bid. RAKI
prompted the pace outside CROWN AND SUGAR to the stretch, and gave way between horses a furlong out. STARSHIP BONITA was in the second flight
early, advanced four wide to loom a threat with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out. LADY PANDA tracked outside the leaders three wide, and gave
way between horses approaching the stretch. HOTTY TODDY was unsettled and leapt at the break to get away behind the field, moved inside and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
UP IN SMOKE was jostled lightly between WE MISS SUSIE and MALIBEAUTY at the start, advanced out of last after a quarter-mile, rallied outside
BOERNE and COMPENSATE four or five wide at the top of the stretch, wrested command from BOERNE past the eighth-pole and drove clear. BOERNE
vied outside WE MISS SUSIE for a half-mile, battled inside UP IN SMOKE turning for home, yielded in mid stretch and held the place. ADDILYN got
sandwiched at the start between VAST and COMPENSATE, lagged well back for a half, came widest into the stretch and rallied to go clear of the rest.
MALIBEAUTY brushed with UP IN SMOKE at the start, came off the inside around the turn, and went through between horses past the furlong marker
improving mildly. WE MISS SUSIE brushed with UP IN SMOKE at the start, was sent up to vie for command inside BOERNE for a half, and gave way in
upper stretch. COMPENSATE bumped with ADDILYN at the start, eyed the battling leaders into the turn, lodged a brief bid three wide between horses after
a half, and tired in mid stretch. VAST bumped with ADDILYN at the start, stayed in range for a half in the two-path, and weakened. DREAM MARIE became
edgy in the gate briefly dislodging the rider, broke sluggishly and was through early.

Footnotes
VITA DOLCE advanced rapidly five then four wide around the turn, took over outside TAYLORSINITIATION in upper stretch, stayed clear under a drive,
then pulled up in distress after the finish and was vanned off. MOON PISTOL waited behind horses approaching the quarter-pole, moved out to the
four-path through the stretch and finished well. TEXTPECTATION brushed the right side of the gate and was off two lengths behind the next-to-last horse,
got taken outside trailing up the backstretch, came widest into the stretch and rallied for a share. TAYLORSINITIATION brushed with AT THE BEACH at the
start, ranged up four then three wide to loom a threat after a half-mile, but flattened out approaching mid stretch. MONEY COME briefly lost his footing while
breaking alertly, moved inside setting a pressured pace for a half, and yielded to multiple challenges through upper stretch. POPPY'S DESTINY pressed the
early pace, bid between horses midway on the turn, and faded through the drive. GONE DIESEL tracked outside early, bid mildly three wide midway on the
turn, and faltered into the lane. MAJOR KELLY moved inside early, and was outrun. AT THE BEACH brushed with TAYLORSINITIATION at the start, and
was outrun.
