Footnotes
CHAOS THEORY raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and edged clear three wide in the final stages. BATTLE
STATION chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a late bid from between horses in the stretch and was caught in the final stages.
CHAPS chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a late bid in the stretch from the inside but was caught in the final stages.
SECRETARY AT WAR raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and finished willingly in the final stages. I CAN DO
ANYTHING stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane four wide, was slightly bothered inside the eighth pole and
weakened in the final stages. FIG JELLY pressed the pace early, took over command near the lane, inched clear in the stretch, came out a bit inside the
eighth pole and yielded in the final stages. EARLY MISCHIEF was in tight after the start, raced along the three path into the lane, was slightly steadied
inside the eighth pole and had a minor gain in the final stages. POWELL trailed the field early on, was on the inside into the lane with a belated gain in the
stretch run. FAREEQ was never a threat. BYE BYE BIRDSTONE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane.
JAZZY TIMES was never a factor. TOMMYTOM was bumped at the start, had early speed then gave way down the lane.

GUSKA MON SHOES vied outside of the early pace setter while in the three path, took over from that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, built a clear
lead turning for home, and held firm through the lane. TRES EQUIS tracked from midpack three to two wide around the turn while between horses, shifting
inwards after passing inner rivals to make a bid inside of the leader in midstretch, but failed to make late headway on that foe, then proved second best.
CRUSH IT was pinched back at the start, advanced inside of horses down the backstretch to lie right behind the inner leader into the turn, was shuffled back
behind that rival at the five sixteenths pole before tipping two wide turning for home, then finished up willingly inside of foes for a minor reward. FLIGHT
TIME (BRZ) prompted the pace three wide while in the four path, made a bid turning for home as GUSKA MON SHOES took over, but proved no match for
that foe in midstretch, then got outfinished for minor rewards. MATCH PLAY advanced from off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, came
into the lane in the five path, but flattened out in midstretch. JUNIOR GILLIAM tracked from midpack two wide between horses, but was shuffled back at the
five sixteenths pole when RED BLUE AND TRUE weakened, came into the lane three wide, but had no rally. LONG ON LUCK trailed the field through the
turn, then improved past tired foes without threatening. FRIDAYNITESTAR hit the gate at the start, raced far off of the pace two to four wide, and never got
involved. RED BLUE AND TRUE set the pace inside of rivals while staying a path off of the rail, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole and faded
through the laen. PETE MARWICK took the turn in the five path while midpack and outside of horses, but weakened through midstretch. CEEKY had a
staggered step start and broke multiple lengths behind the leader, then saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
HEAVENS WHISPER tracked from far off of the pace in the three path, shifted down to the two path around the turn before cutting the corner turning for
home, produced a bid inside of rivals in upper stretch as the leader left the rail open, surged clear passing the three sixteenths pole, and drew off under
driving pressure. PRINCESS TRINA was forwardly placed along the inside, swung to the four path turning for home to be between horses at the quarter
pole, but shifted accross SUNSET PAULA JO's path in the process, made a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe approaching the furlong
pole, then held place between horses while hanging on her left lead. ITS COLD IN DEHERE tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened and lost
position starting at the half mile pole, finally refound stride while far off of the pace turning for home, then produced a rerally inside of rivals through the lane,
but did not have enough to reach place. BIG BASE tracked from midpack in the four path, produced a bid turning into the lane in the five path, but was
outkicked by an inner rival, then got outfinished for minor rewards. CARINA bumped with SUNSET PAULA JO at the start, trailed in the two path into the
turn, swung to the six path turning for home, and passed tired foes. SUNSET PAULA JO bumped with CARINA at the start, tracked from midpack in the
three path between horses, but steadied when PRINCESS TRINA cut across her path at the quarter pole, then failed to menace thereafter. HERO FOR
HIRE set the pace inside of J D'S GIRL early on while staying a path off of the inner rial, but left the rail open for the eventual winner turning for home in the
process, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. J D'S GIRL prompted the pace setter while being kept in the three path by that rival, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CATCH A BID set a soft pace without pressure while staying in the two path, widened her advantage when let out a notch in upper stretch, then continued to
draw off under a confident hand ride. TEMPLE CITY TERROR rated off of the pace in midpack two wide and between horses, was driven to the four path
turning for home while inside of MINTD (IRE), and produced a rally through the lane, but was only second best. MIGHTY SCARLETT stalked along the
inside, forged place from outer rivals at the three sixteenths pole, but was outfinished by TEMPLE CITY TERROR through the late stages. MINTD (IRE)
raced far off of the pace three to four wide through the turns, was floated to the five path turning for home by TEMPLE CITY TERROR, got outkicked by that
foe in upper stretch, then kept on mildly through the lane. DELTA'S KINGDOM was forwardly placed three wide while in the four path, but weakened
between horses at the furlong pole. AUNT HATTIE (IRE) was restrained back crossing the wire for the first time, steadied going into the first turn when
MAGIC STAR lost her rider, then was very rank behind horses around the first turn and until the nine sixteenths pole, then saved ground around the far turn
and failed to play a factor. WILDLIFE trailed in the four path around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, and was never involved. SOLAR
KITTEN was forwardly placed outside of the pace setter while in the three path, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. MAGIC STAR raced far off
of the pace along the inside down the frontstretch for the first time, but took an awkward step going into the first turn, lost her rider, fell, and was vanned off.
Following a Steward's Inquiry into the actions of MAGIC STAR into the first turn, no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
BANKS ISLAND tracked the pace from the three path between horses early on, inched forward in hand to loom behind the leading trio at the five sixteenths
pole, made a four wide bid turning for home, batteld on outside of a pair of rivals in midstretch, then edged an advantage in the final sixteenth under a long
drive. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY prompted the pace setter two wide, vied between horses passing the half mile pole as WELL CONNECTED made a bid,
forged a narrow advantage from his inner foe in upper stretch while inside of WELL CONNECTED and BANKS ISLAND, but was outkicked by the latter
inside the final furlong, then held place from ANCIENT WARRIOR late. ANCIENT WARRIOR was solidly bumped by NIGHT TIME at the start, raced far off
of the pace in three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in midstretch, and produced a rally, but missed place. WELL CONNECTED inched forward
at the half mile pole to vie for the lead outside of a pair of rivals, continued to challenge to upper stretch, but was outkicked by BANKS ISLAND to his outside
approaching the furlong pole, then gave way in the late stages. TOLEDO was caught in the five path around the turn while far off of the pace, then produced
a mild kick outside of rivals through the lane, but failed to threaten. SHIPPINGPORT was forwardly placed along the inside, tracked closest to the leading
trio around the turn, shifted to the four path in midstretch, but failed to make a bid and weakened. NIGHT TIME was jostled between horses at the start,
pulled while rank to midpack in the early stages, took the turn in the four path while between horses, but failed to factor. HIGH PROOF bumped an inner
rival at the start, set the pace inside a duo of foes around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. BACKGROUND failed to get involved after taking the turn
in the three path. PRINCE JERSEY TOWN was off slowly and took a bump from an inner foe, trailed through the turn, and never got involved. THE GRAY
BLUR bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced midpack inside of rivals, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
DUPLICITY broke a bit outwards and bumped a foe at the start, vied three wide, then two wide into the turn, forged a lead while drifting to the three path
turning for home, then drew clear in the final furlong under driving pressure. OAK HILL advanced three wide around the turn to produce a bid turning for
home, but failed to match strides with DUPLICITY in upper stretch, then kept on to secure place. BORN GREAT bumped an outer foe at the start, saved
ground while in midpack through the turn, then produced a mild rally along the inside in midstretch before splitting foes in the late stages to get up for show
approaching the wire. MASTER RYAN bumped an inner rival at the start, raced midpack two wide, shifted to the five path turning for home, and rallied mildly
outside of rivals, but missed show at the wire. SKY RIDE was forwardly placed two wide between horses, produced a bid for place in upper stretch after the
leader kicked away, but was outfinished for minor rewards in the late stages. SCOBY set the pace in the two path down the backstretch before clearing an
inner rival and shifting to the rail into the turn, dug in after DUPLICITY forged an advantage turning for home, but weakened in the final furlong.
SUBSTANTIAL was bumped between horses at the start, raced inside of a rival in the second flight early on, but faded in the two path around the turn and
never got involved thereafter. HIGHLAND BOSS was squeezed back between horses at the start and trailed early on, took the turn in the two path while far
off of the pace, and made no impact. ASHER'S MUSIC was bumped on both sides at the start, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and
was no factor. HOOF PRINCE vied inside early on, but took back to stalk into the turn, then further weakened in upper stretch. JUPESTAR brushed an inner
foe at the start, trailed in the four path into the turn, and never got involved.
