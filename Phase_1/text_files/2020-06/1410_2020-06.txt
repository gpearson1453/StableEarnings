Footnotes
KOPP CAT settled off the duel along the inside, came through an opening at the rail nearing the lane, seized command in upper stretch and drove clear. U.
S. MILLENNIUM tracked the early pace four wide, bid outside midway down the backstretch, pressed three wide between foes rounding the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and held second. CAST A STONE stumbled and bumped a foe at the start, rushed up four wide around the first turn,
took the lead near the half-mile pole, set the pace in the two path from there, weakened between foes in the lane and held for the show. UNBELIEVABLE
STORY lacked early speed while saving ground, made good progress down the backstretch, steadied when in tight near the quarter pole, saved ground
around the far turn, angled four wide nearing the sixteenth pole and rallied belatedly. VILLAGE PRINCE was squeezed back at the start, raced two wide
early, made a four wide bid around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the lane but weakened in the drive. IRISH WORRIER saved ground
off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. MAD MINER was bumped at the start, had early speed three wide between foes,
dropped back midway around the first turn, chased two wide and lacked a rally. HOUSE OF POWER was bumped at the start, raced two wide and played
no further factor. PROSPECT TOY vied between foes around the first turn and was through after a half. JACK'S DREAMER set the early pace along the rail
and retreated.
