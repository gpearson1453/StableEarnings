Footnotes
BIG RUNNUER dueled with rival to the inside for command, cleared that foe and inched away around the turn, urged right-handed in the drive and held
safely. MESUT angled to the inside in the early stages, saved ground around the turn, angled out near the sixteenth pole and rallied for the place.
TOROSAY dueled inside BIG RUNNUER up the backstretch, could not keep pace and chased the winner into the drive, kept on willingly but was edged for
the second. YES I AM FREE stalked outside a rival then went three wide around the turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. SPARKY VILLE chased the
top pair from off the rail then moved into the two path, raced in that same path and between rivals into the lane and never responded when asked.
ULTIMATE BANGO stalked two wide through the bend, came out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. PORTANDO lacked early speed, took the turn two
wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
SALVATOR MUNDI tracked the leader two wide, raced between foes into the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, took the advantage nearing the
eighth pole and drew clear. BUD KNIGHT forwardly placed just behind the lone leader, stalked in the two path, bid outside and led briefly in upper stretch
but was outkicked by the winner. EAST RAND raced between early then steadied into the first turn, moved to the inside then swung out in upper stretch and
finished willingly for the show. CAJUN TREASURE chased inside, moved closer into the far turn, bid along the rail in the lane and weakened in the late
stages. FACTORIAL away quickly from the outside and angled in, set the pace from the inside, moved out a path entering the stretch and gave way. BIG
CITY BANE traveled three wide then moved out a path on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn and came up empty. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE
settled off the pace, traveled in the two path to the lane and weakened.

YOUR ROYAL COIL stalked a bit off the rail, bid outside the runner-up leaving the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, battled outside that one in midstretch
and inched away late under some left handed urging. MUCHO MACHO WOMAN had speed outside the winner then edged away and angled in, set the
pace inside, fought back along the fence leaving the turn and through the stretch but could not quite match that one late. MISS BENNET saved ground
chasing the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and bested the others. FLYING BUSINESS stalked between horses then a bit off the rail, angled in on
the turn, came out leaving the turn and three deep into the stretch and lacked a rally. BLUEGRASS SKY settled just off the rail, came out in the stretch and
did not rally. REMEMBER TO SMILE stalked four wide then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and weakened. AWESOME AMANDA close up
stalking the pace three deep between rivals on the backstretch and between foes on the turn, continued off the rail leaving the turn and also weakened.

Footnotes
WARREN'S SHOWTIME three deep early, was forced four wide into the first turn then stalked outside a rival, came out four wide into the stretch, gained the
lead outside a rival in upper stretch, drifted in and inched away under urging in midstretch, battled outside that one in deep stretch and gamely prevailed.
SMILING SHIRLEE came out into the first turn, bid three deep to duel for the lead, took a short advantage into the stretch, drifted in and fought back in the
drive and continued willingly. BIG SWEEP also came out into the first turn, bid between horses to duel for the lead, continued a bit off the rail into the
stretch, continue along the fence in the drive and edged a foe for third. HOMEHOME between horses early, was forced out into the first turn then angled in
and stalked a bit off the rail then inside on the backstretch and second turn, came out leaving that turn and into the stretch and was edged for the show.
KRISTI'S TIGER angled in on the first turn then chased off the rail, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. REIWA had speed outside a rival then
angled in and dueled inside, fought back on the second turn, fell back leaving that turn, steadied in tight into the stretch and weakened. A claim of foul by
the rider of HOMEHOME against SMILING SHIRLEE for alleged interference into the first turn and a stewards' inquiry into the same incident resulted in no
change when they ruled the latter was coming out off the heels of BIG SWEEP and that the incident did not alter the original order of finish.

handed urging four wide past the eighth pole and won clear. NAUGHTY EVELYN broke in and bumped a rival, sped to the early lead and angled in, set the

three deep to the stretch, bid between foes in midstretch and was edged for the place. KATSAROS stalked off the rail, bid outside the pacesetter into the
second turn, bid again between horses in midstretch and was edged for the show. STAR OF AFRICA a step slow to begin, drifted four wide into the first turn
then chased outside a rival or off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and found her best stride late. HOLA CHICA chased between horses then a bit off
the rail on the second turn, swung out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ARYA'S DAGGER tugged inside then stalked outside a rival, was
between horses into the stretch and weakened. I GIVE UP settled off the pace inside, split horses leaving the second turn and could not offer the necessary
response. MOREAVINO chased between horses then a bit off the rail, continued outside a foe on the second turn and three deep into the stretch and did
not rally. WINE AT SUNSET had speed between horses then saved ground stalking the pace to the stretch and weakened. TIGER'S PRINCESS pulled and
steadied toward the inside early, chased along the rail, dropped back on the second turn, gave way and was eased in the stretch.

WITH THIS VOW dueled between horses then inside on the turn and drew clear in the stretch under left handed urging and steady handling late. SAVING
SOPHIE settled outside, angled in and split horses into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was clearly second best. COSMIC COWGIRL chased
inside then a bit off the rail, steadied into the turn, came out three deep on the bend and into the stretch and picked up the show. TRUE MISCHIEF had
good early speed and dueled inside, dropped back on the turn and gave way. APACHE PASS bobbled at the start, dueled three deep then outside the
winner on the turn, drifted to the inside in the stretch and also gave way. M FAST stalked a bit off the rail then inside into and on the turn, dropped back into
the stretch and also gave way. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER stalked outside then alongside a rival, was between horses leaving the turn, drifted out into the
stretch and had nothing left for t he drive and was eased in the final furlong. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the run into the far turn between the
second and third finishers but made no change when they ruled the incident did not alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
BLITZKRIEG sped between horses to the early lead, angled in and set the pace inside, kicked clear and held under a couple late cracks of the whip.
BOWIES HERO angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, moved up inside in the stretch, waited briefly in midstretch then split horses and finished
well. SHARP SAMURAI chased a bit off the rail then three deep into and on the second turn and into the stretch, drifted in a bit and held for a share of third
between foes. SOUTER (GB) settled three deep then chased outside a rival, continued three wide on the second turn and into the stretch and got up for a
share of the show. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) pulled along the inside then saved ground stalking the pace, continued along the rail into and through the stretch
and was edged for a minor share. BORDER TOWN off a step slow, settled outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch
and found his best stride late. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE saved ground off the pace, came out some in the stretch, was in a bit close off heels in midstretch
and lacked the needed rally. KING OF SPEED angled in and chased outside a rival, continued between foes on the second turn and through much of the
stretch and could not offer the necessary late kick. BOLO three deep early, stalked off the rail, was between horses leaving the second turn and weakened.
