Footnotes
CANNES stalked the pace a bit off the rail, raced two wide around the turn, bid inside the leader, took over just past the sixteenth pole and edged clear.
FANCY TERRACE set the pace three wide up the backstretch, cut the corner entering the turn, came out a bit into the drive, relinquished the lead in the
final sixteenth pole but finished a clear second. CASH ENCOUNTER forwardly placed from the outside, pressed three wide into and around the turn, came
out a bit in upper stretch and went evenly to hold third. PAPA CABALLERO settled off the inside, angled in on the turn, summoned a mild late bid and
missed the show. IRISH JACK off slow and veered in at the start, chased from the inside around the turn and lacked a rally. ZINZAN raced outside a rival or
five wide up the backstretch, angled in entering the turn, three wide into the lane drive and had little left for the final furlong.

Footnotes
PRIVATE KITTY prompted the pace from the inside then dropped back a bit to stalk the leader, moved to the outside and bid between rivals into the turn,
gained a short lead on the turn, drifted out into the lane, responded when challenged from the outside and held gamely. ANNITASHEAVEN chased off the
rail, bid three deep into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, closed outside the leader but got denied. SEA GLASS chased from the inside to the lane
and outfinished LIL' A. J. for the show. LIL' A. J. set the pace under pressure from the inside, inched away and angled to the inside, lost command around
the bend and fought back from inside to the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MERGIE TROID tracked outside a rival, came out entering the
stretch, drifted in through the final furlong and never threatened.

STORMIN TRICK hustled to front and set the pace from the inside, opened up a comfortable advantage up the backstretch, continued clear into the lane
and held late. WALK ON WATER chased between rivals, floated out by inside rival around the turn, then finished willingly from the outside to prove a game
second. KENNY BENNY chased from the inside into to the turn, drifted out around the bend and held the show. MO DINERO settled in the early stages,
traveled three wide then angled in on the turn turn and lacked a rally. HOT N'FAMOUS fractious prior to the start, broke awkwardly at the start, trailed the
field to the lane and made no impact.
