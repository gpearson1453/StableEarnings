SMART N INTUITIVE broke sharply, seized command from the outset, responded to his cue and held sway in the stretch. MAHOMES settled well, angled in
on the turn and finished well along the inside rail. CHOOS UR ADVENTURE chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and raced evenly.
NEW GOSPEL unruly behind the starting gate, was outpaced and managed a late five wide bid. HE'S A BIG DILL chased the pacesetter and weakened in
the stretch. JOHN R was awkward at the start and proved no factor. TOUSSAINT bore out on the turn and faded.

ETHAN'S FURY settled, lodged a bid on the turn, rallied, lugged in under right-handed pressure in the last sixteenth, was snatched up and hampered GIO
NASTY ONE. The latter was reserved, advanced on the turn, was shut off late, steadied hard as a result and kept on after recovering. CALLME MR
MISTER outpaced, moved closer on the turn, rallied while four wide and was bothered late. CACTUS RULES gained the early lead, held well into the stretch
and gave way late. LATER LOVER BOY vied between foes and came up empty. COMEGETSOME stalked the pace and weakened. SCRATCH N SNIFF
showed little. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND, AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, ETHAN'S
FURY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED SECOND.
