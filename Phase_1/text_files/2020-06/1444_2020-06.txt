A SALUTE TO LT DAN hustled to the front, set the pace then drew clear on the turn in the two path, remained clear to mid stretch then was tiring but held
on. VASTLY DEEP chased the winner early, got outkicked on the turn, was two wide to the stretch then finished willingly but too late. CARTERS BLUE had
no speed, circled five wide on the turn and was gaining late. SURE PROOF got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then did not threaten.
TRUE REGARDS was sent for speed, got outsprinted by the winner, pressed that one to the turn then was outrun in the three path to the stretch and tired.

MISTER MCLEAN brushed with GLORY CALL in the opening furlong, pressed the runnerup three wide to the stretch, was on terms in mid stretch, could not
shake loose but dug in gamely to prevail. SIERRA MELODY hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded when hooked by the
winner in mid stretch, battled stubbornly but was bested late. JU JU GUY had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two.
CIRCUS ACT also was outrun to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. GLORY CALL brushed with the winner in the
opening furlong, stalked the pace to the turn, was caught four wide to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. OPERA GHOST tracked the pace early
then was fanned out to the five path on the turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
HARDY CHISEL was permitted to set pedestrian splits to the second turn under a rating hold, raced two wide to the stretch then enough in reserve to
prevail. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT tracked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner then battled CANDY'S
MARTINI through the final furlong and got the place by a whisker. CANDY'S MARTINI stalked the winner to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the
stretch then fought CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT tooth and nail through and long drive for second but was nosed out. ON THE KEY was five wide to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. MY MAN DRAYMOND had no speed, was well
wide throughout and not a threat. NATIVE CHIEFTAIN settled to the half, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. DIZZY DANCER
chased the pace to the second turn while four wide then gave out.
