Footnotes
QUEEN BESS vied for the lead from the three path into the turn, settled back to chase the pace into the lane, entered the top of the lane from the seven
path then slowly wore down the pacesetter and cleared late while drifting in a couple of lengths to the wire. TAP N SWAY vied for the lead from the two path
through mid-turn, cleared into the lane, was still clear and had her largest advantage with an eighth to go then yielded late. MAJESTIC CLIMB pressed the
pacesetter through mid-turn, came into the lane from the five or six path, had aim on the top one through the final eighth then weakened a bit late.
MOONLIGHT DANCING was in the three path through the turn, dropped to the rail into the lane and was slowly gaining at the wire. SHE'S SO LIT was in
the two path while chasing the pace, was bothered a bit nearing the five-sixteenths pole when another came in, steadied near the quarter pole and was
never a threat thereafter. LILY CHASER was in the four path through the turn then tired through the lane. KEE SHE made little impact while along the
inside. AFTER A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUNNING OF THE RACE THROUGH THE TURN AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER
OF #3 SHE'S SO LIT AGAINST THE RIDERS OF #4 MOONLIGHT DANCING AND #7 QUEEN BASS FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE TURN, THE
STEWARDS FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO MAKE A CHANGE IN ORDER.

Footnotes
QUE SERA SERA broke out sharply at the start bumping outside rival, raced in the three path approaching the turn, gained the lead before first call, cleared
into mid-turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane, rider waited to ask for more until inside the eighth pole then urged left-handed to the wire while
remaining clear. PRINCESS TRINA was unhurried while near the inside through the turn, came off the rail and into the two or three path through the lane
and could not cut into the deficit while saving the place spot. FIELD LETTERS was bumped hard soon after the start and forced out into outside rival, settled
to near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and offered a mild rally. GIRO KATE set the early pace before the first call,
chased along the rail into the turn then weakened. SERENA'S HOPE was bumped at the start, raced in the three path through the turn, came widest into the
lane and lacked a bid. TAPJEN bobbled at the start,chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn then faded after entering the lane. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF THE RACE FOUND NO REASON FOR DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
DA HIGH COMMISSION set the pace from the outset, cleared into the turn ,widened through the turn and into the lane and extended the advantage through
the lane while being kept to the task. CAMBIO chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the top one and was
kept to the task to save the place spot. CUBBIE BEAR was fractious in the gate, raced along the inside through the turn, came off the inside for the drive
and was closing in on the place spot while not a threat to the top one. KATIE GIRL was in the three path through the turn, came widest into the lane and
improved position while not a threat. DYNASTY OF GOODS was in the two path through the turn and weakened late. PREMIUM PASSION chased the
pace along the inside through the turn then faded through the lane. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU was in tight and checked early, settled to the back and never
was seriously involved. CRAFTY JUSTICE saved ground and never made an impact. THE QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL was unhurried while in the two path through the turns, angled into the six path entering the lane, gained momentum once
straightened then steadily closed in on the leader and edged clear late. MAX EXPRESS was in the two path through the turns, bid three wide entering the
lane, was edging up on the pacesetter and may have made the lead near the sixteenth pole then could not finish with the winner. HERE COMES TREY set
the pace along the inside into the lane then yielded along the rail. STARSPANGLEDXPRESS stalked the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, had
aim on the leader entering the lane then tired once straightened. STOP HAMMERTIME was along the inside through the turn when not far back, continued
along the inside into the lane and was empty near the eighth pole. THE STORY BEGINS was outrun while along the inside. HE'S A WARRIOR was in the
three path through the turns and was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
APRIL'S NO FOOL stalked inside of rivals, bid three wide at the quarter pole and was clear late under steady urging. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE stalked in the
three path, then bid belatedly. NAUGHTY JUSTICE vied between foes, then faded in the stretch. BEAUTILICIOUS and IMA N H LADY CAT improved
position late. CANDY EMPIRE was off slowly. PRINCESS LENNY pressed the early pace inside before giving way. WILADENE saved ground before fading.
EUROPUNKSTAR showed speed for a half mile before giving way.
