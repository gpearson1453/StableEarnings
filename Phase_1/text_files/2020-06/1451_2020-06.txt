Footnotes
DREAMALILDREAMOFU set the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, cleared away from an inner rival into the backstretch, held a loose lead
without pressure around the far turn, then widened when let out a notch in midstretch, and was ridden out to the wire, then pulled up quickly into the
clubhouse turn. HOW IRONIC tracked from midpack in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn to produce a bid for place turning for home,
forged place in upper stretch, but failed to match strides with the leader in midstretch, and was second best. AUCTION FEVER vied along the inside of the
leader around the first turn, took back to stalk along the inside into the backstetch, shifted out and chased the loose leader two wide around the far turn after
coming under a drive, came in to the lane between horses as HOW IRONIC and IVYETSU made place bids to her outside and inside respectively, was
bested by her outer rival for place in upper stretch, but fended off her inner rival to hold show in the late stages. IVYETSU dwelt at the start, trailed while a
bit keen around the first turn, shifted inwards and advanced inside of rivals around the far turn to make a bid for place inside of a pair of foes in upper
stretch, but flattened out. HEY KITTEN was forwardly placed outside of the pace setter in the four to three path around the first turn, but weakened in the
four path around the far turn. SHELLEY'S GEM raced far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, then weakened in the five path into the far
turn.

Footnotes
ATMOS vied for the lead two wide in the three path around the turn while between horses, forged a lead approaching the quarter pole, then fended off a pair
of outer rivals through the late stages under driving pressure. NOT NOW RAND broke a bit inwards, then was crowded a bit between horses, advanced in
the six path and outside of rivals into and around the turn to be in striking range six wide turning for home, sustained his rally through the lane, but was
repelled late. CRITIC was forwardly placed two wide between horses, tracked from behind the leading group around the turn and was blocked turning for
home, shifted four wide in upper stretch and split foes while hanging on his left lead, changed leads at the furlong pole and sustained his rally, but did not
have enough between horses late. OUT COLD was off slowly, saved ground while far off of the pace through the turn, shifted three wide at the furlong pole,
and stayed on between horses for a minor reward. LANSE MITAN advanced four wide between horses while in the five path around the turn to bid for the
lead at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened while hanging on his left lead at the furlong pole. TO THE FRONT set the pace in the two path, held a slight
advantage inside of multiple foes around the turn, but was headed approaching the quarter pole, and faded at the furlong pole. TRUE TO DIXIE failed to
factor after shifting from the rail to the four path turning for home. CREEKMORE vied along the inside early on, took back to stalk at the half mile pole, was
bottled up inside of rivals while right off of the leader at the five sixteenths pole, produced a rail bid in upper stretch, but weakened. SPIN LIGHTNING was
never involved. RUSTIC RICK hit the gate at the start, tracked from the two to three path, but weakened in upper stretch. UNCLE MOMO was forwardly
placed four wide, produced a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole while between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
C Z ROCKET hopped a bit at the start, advanced from off of the pace four to three wide into the turn, commenced a three wide bid approaching the quarter
pole under confident handling, took over in upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire under a mild drive. SHASHASHAKEMEUP was squeezed back at
the start and trailed the field by a distance around the turn, advanced turning for home, split foes five wide at the furlong pole, and offered a good late kick to
get up for place inside the final sixteenth. K J'S NOBILITY broke a bit inwards forcing an inner foe to be squeezed back, tracked from midpack two wide and
between horses, was bumped to the three path by an inner foe bullying his way out at the nine sixteenths pole, took the turn in the four path while outside of
rivals and in range of the leaders, forged place in upper stretch, but lost that position in the late stages. PETE'S PLAY CALL raced in midpack along the
inside early on, bullied his way to the two path at the nine sixteenths pole, bumped with K J's NOBILITY and caused BY YOUR SIDE to be pinched back in
the process, then shifted to the four to five path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid. RUBUS was bumped between horses at the start, stalked
close to the pace in the three path, chased the leader two wide while under coaxing around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival turning for home,
then weakened. BY YOUR SIDE broke well, but failed to respond to urging in the early stages, dropped back to track from off of the pace three wide and
between horses, but was pinched back when PETE'S PLAY CALL forced his way off of the rail at the nine sixteenths pole, then took the turn in the four path
and failed to factor. MALPAIS prompted the pace setter from the inside early on, took back to stalk into the turn, but came under a drive at the five
sixteenths pole, and failed to respond. HOLLIS set the pace in the two path early on before shifting to the rail into the turn, but was headed at the quarter
pole and wilted through the late.

Footnotes
LADY KATE established a clear advantage coming out of the chute while staying a path off of the rail, held that advantage in hand around the turn, had the
rider take a look back for competition at the five sixteenths pole, then held firm through the lane under driving pressure. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) broke inwards
and forced SHESOMAJESTIC inwards at the start, stalked close to the pace setter along the inside, attempted a rail bid in upper stretch, but failed to gain
even terms and chased the leader home. LOUNGE ACT hopped at the start, was forwardly placed two wide while in the three path between horses, shifted
outside of her outer foe into the turn to take the bend in the four path and outside of rivals, came into the lane in range of the leader, but lacked a kick to
make a bid. FROND raced far off of the pace along the inside through the turn before shifting to the four to five path in upper stretch, but was no factor.
MOLTO BELLA prompted the pace leader early on from the outside, stalked that rival while in the three path through the turn, but weakened between
horses in upper stretch. SHESOMAJESTIC was forced inwards at the start by an outer rival, then trailed the field by a distance throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
COASTAL DEFENSE tracked from midpack outside of rivals, advanced into the turn to stalk three wide around the bend, inched forward to make a bid for
the lead turning for home, forged an advantage approaching the furlong pole while drifting outwards from left handed pressure multiple times, then held
LOOKING AT LIBERTY at bay under driving pressure. LOOKING AT LIBERTY was away a bit awkwardly, advanced from midpack outside of COPPER
KING down the backstretch, but steadied in tight quarters into the turn, lost multiple lengths of position due to the incident, saved ground around the bend
before shifting four wide turning for home, then rallied through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leader. BACKSHOT dueled inside of a foe
early on, cleared away from that rival at the nine sixteenths pole, held a clear margin through the turn before being confronted by COASTAL DEFENSE
turning for home, dug in in upper stretch after being headed by that foe, then gave way inside the final furlong. CIVIL SERVANT stumbled at the start,
prompted the pace three wide, then two wide between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, then
stayed on through the late stages for a minor reward. COPPER KING rushed inside of rivals down the backstretch to be forwardly placed along the inside
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the quarter. UNCLE KICK trailed early on, advanced five wide around the turn, came into the
lane in the six path, and produced a mild kick without threatening. FALKIRK raced midpack three wide between horses, but weakened at the half mile pole.
WARTIME HERO advanced to be midpack in the four path around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but lacked a kick to make a bid. DECISION
MAKER was never involved. NEWSCASTER was sent from the start to duel for the lead two wide, but weakened at the nine sixteenths pole, wilted through
the field around the turn, and was eased through the lane.
