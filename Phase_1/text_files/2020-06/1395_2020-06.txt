Footnotes
ANNUALIZED settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, split foes when moving to challenge while drifting
slightly midstretch, late bid, up. GOLDEN V C within striking distance, continued to stalk in the two path through the turn, closer in traffic upper stretch,
stalled, late push, not enough in the late going. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way through the
turn and into the stretch, proved stubborn to the end. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE pressed the issue from off the inside, challenged in the turn and upper stretch,
continued to vie inside the furlong marker and also gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late. GUMWRAPPER in the second flight, saved ground into the
stretch, lacked room for most of the stretch run while boxed in along the rail. LAST APPEAL steadied at the start, remained always back while racing wide.
NINE SHOTS prompted the issue from the outside, gave way while four wide into the stretch. ACT OF DONATION off a step slow, failed to menace while
remaining back and also well out in the course. .

Footnotes
GUEST APPEARANCE unhurried in the early going inside, moved closer while saving ground through the turn, switched out when straightened for home
and finished with good resolve to be up in time on the outside. D'WILD BARONESS closest to the early leader, moved up to duel through the turn in the two
path, shook off that foe to be well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. IRISH PRIORITY went one paced
throughout, lacked winning response, finished well clear of the others. ROSE RUNNER cleared to the inside after breaking in good order, showed the way
into the turn, dueled through the bend inside the runner up then weakened in the drive. BIND ME UP last away, moved out to race four wide into and
through the turn while well back, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. CALAJA went one paced throughout while three wide.
MADEFORLIFE behind the leaders toward the inside, between rivals through the turn, lacked a kick in the drive. KOHENSRISING was finished early.

Footnotes
ANGEL CAT outrun for six furlongs while racing off the inside, began to move midway on the second turn, four wide into the lane, engaged the leader past
the furlong marker, kicked clear late under firm handling. LAURALEE COCODREE closest to the leader while just off the inside, took over from that one
turning for home, offered brief resistance to the winner a furlong out then could not match strides the final sixteenth, clearly second best. DORI'S BIRDIES
void of speed, rallied through some traffic nearing midstretch, dropped to the inside, along for the show in the late going while no match for the top two.
THINKING OF HER settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. CATBALEE forwardly placed toward the
inside behind the leaders, also came up empty for the drive. MADISON'S PLACE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace, gave way when headed
by the runner up turning for home. FINEST KYLIE off a bit slow, never menaced.

Footnotes
TEMPLE OF ROSES with the early pace off the inside, dueled through the turn, disposed of the other speed to be clear a furlong out, came out to bother
SUNSHINE DEELIGHT soon after, clear again, came out a second time in the final strides bother that same foe a second time. SUNSHINE DEELITE in the
main body off the inside, came three out to four wide out of the turn, set down for the drive, bothered inside the furlong grounds when the winner came out,
recovered and was trying to get back to that same foe late when bothered again in the final strides. LEXI EM lacked early foot off the inside, moved closer in
the two path turning for home, flattened out in the late going to finish up best of the rest. PREEMPTIVE broke with the field, moved up to set or force the
pace for three furlongs, gradually weakened in the drive. ITSNOTMYJOB settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground behind the leader
through the turn, failed to muster a response when called on for the drive. JOLIE GEE in the second flight while racing outside, four wide exiting the turn,
tired through the stretch. THAT'S A SONG was never a threat while racing off the inside. LIL MS BOSSY PANTS lacked speed while racing outside, was
four out to five wide turning for home, had nothing left for the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP
STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF SUNSHINE DEELITE AGAINST TEMPLE OF ROSES FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE LATE GOING, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
JALEN HURTS shuffled back at the start, well back early as a result, made a good gain three wide into contention late in the turn and into the stretch,
engaged the leader a furlong out, wore that foe down while fully extended. TEN BROWNIES close from the start off the inside, dueled through the turn in the
two path, continued show the way past the furlong marker while being challenged by the winner, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, well clear of the
others. LIAM SKYE in the second flight while off the inside, three wide through the turn, could do little with the top two in the final furlong, finished up best of
the rest. VICTORY BIND showed the way out of the chute and up the backstretch along the inside, dueled through the turn while remaining closest to the
inside, weakened steadily in the drive to lose the show late. CACHITO void of speed, was asked along in the two path late in the turn,steered toward the
outside for the drive, improved position slightly. WHISKEY'S GONE settled in mid pack along the inside, saved ground to no avail. FLASH DANCERLUCK
forwardly placed early off the inside, began a steady fade before a half. HALOS PRAYER hesitated at the start, raced four out to five wide in the turn, failed
to muster a rally in the drive. VIVINSKY was finished early off the rail.

Footnotes
HAWKS PEAK unhurried early while saving ground through the first turn, moved out and circled into contention five wide into the stretch, took command
soon after and drew out to win going away under a firm hand ride. QUALITY PRODUCTION four wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, headed up
the second flight in pursing the leaders up the backstrech, was four wide again turning for home, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner, proved no
match the final furlong, clear of the others. RANDY PAUL tucked in when lacking any early foot in the first turn, continued to race in the two path when
improving late in the second bend, finished up best of the rest. CRIDER CASH settled off the pace while racing toward the inside, angled out to be three
wide turning for home, lacked a serious response to finish up evenly. BUCK DYNASTY closest to the leader early, moved up to join that one after a half,
dueled through the final turn then faltered in the drive. FROM NOW ON squeezed at the start to break back, void of speed, improved position after the issue
had been decided. CAMERON RULES last away, well back for six furlongs, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. ACTIF ONE tired after a half.
HOT'N NOTTY sprinted clear after the start to show the way through the first turn, dueled the middle part then gave way in the drive. SWEET KAYDEN
stopped after a half and finished far back.

Footnotes
ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE devoid of any early foot in trailing well back in the run up the backstretch, advanced toward the inside in the turn, steered out to
the far outside in upper stretch, closed with a late surge to be up in time. JAZZ IT UP a pace factor from the start toward the inside, shook well clear when
straightened for home, continued to hold a daylight advantage late, nipped in the final strides, remained clear of the rest. ALAN'S ARGUMENT bumped at
the start, raced back early as a result, moved closer three wide late in the turn, proved no match for the top two late, saved the show late. CHAMPAGNE'S
ON ICE in mid pack early while racing outside, moved closer to become a threat four wide by late in the turn, closest to the runner up past the furlong
marker, hung late. PAYNT BATTLE broke out, bumped foe, settled off the pace, lacked a serious response in the drive. TOO MUCH BOURBON forwardly
placed along the inside for a half, in some traffic late in the turn, faded through the stretch. SAVING ARGUMENT raced in mid pack early, had little for the
drive. MUSADA pressured the pace for four furlongs then gave way when the real running began turning for home. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER lacked speed,
was six wide out of the turn and remained back. LITTLE WISE GUY was always outrun.

Footnotes
DREAMY ART closed up from the start off the inside, moved up to duel through the turn, pulled away through the stretch under steady handling. MEMORY
MAGIC within striking distance while racing three wide, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. LIL ALLIE DANCER last away,
raced back, began a steady advance after a quarter, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. HEART OF SOUL forwardly placed toward the
inside, remained in the second flight through the turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. REALMENTE CALMADA turned in an even effort while racing
off the inside. PRESLI'S ARGUMENT settled off the pace, came up empty for the drive. CONSPICUOUS WOMAN failed to menace with a four wide trip.
JEWELS OF SORCE remained back. TAMARIU was never involved. PEGGYS OUEST broke well, cleared to the inside to show the way up the
backstretch, dueled inside the winner turn then gave way in the drive. D'FREAK NASTY broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.
