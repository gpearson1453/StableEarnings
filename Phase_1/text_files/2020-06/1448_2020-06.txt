Footnotes
RAPUNZEL'S DREAM brushed the gate at the start and settled behind the two early leaders, rallied three wide on the far turn outside the eventual place
finisher, seemingly tightening that one's path late on the turn when moving into contention, got to the front runner inside the eighth pole and needed the wire
late. HEAVENLY JOY was three to two wide off the pace through the first turn, moved inside the winner on the far turn when steadying between runners,
regrouped to find her best stride late and was getting to the winner at the wire. FLASHY PRINCESS trailed along the rail into and around the final turn
before commencing a late rally for the show, finding her best stride in the late stages. SHE'S GOT MOVES won an early duel for front, sprinted into a long
advantage down the backstretch, leading until the eighth pole and then fading in the late stages. MARTINI SUE pressed the early leader before taking back,
tried to re-rally inside two other closers on the far turn when steadied badly along the inside, falling back from that point to the wire. NAKED ILLUSION was
sluggish at the start and fell off the pace and three wide on the first turn, rallied late backstretch when three wide but could not enter contention.THERE
WERE TWO CLAIMS OF FOUL. THE RIDER OF MARTINI SUE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER LATE ON THE FAR TURN AND THE RIDER
OF THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER IN THE SAME SPOT.BOTH CLAIMS OF FOUL WERE DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
PINK LEMONADE dueled briefly then shook clear into the turn, drew off, widened when asked in the stretch and finished under a hand ride. BLESSED
TWO raced in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. HARDY CANDY away alertly, settled in mid pack, came two to
four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but weakened late. CHESTERMERE in range early, was hustled from mid pack on the turn and failed to
menace. HOPE VISION settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail then two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MIRIAM'S SKY settled off
the pace, trailed on the turn and lacked a strong closing response. TRANSFER PRICING moved up to duel early, chased on the turn then tired at the head
of the stretch.

Footnotes
WEDGEWOOD raced in mid pack, was from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, took command a furlong out and held sway under
a steady drive. DESOLATOR broke a step slowly and settled off the pace, chased two-wide late turn then finished under a full out rally. NESTLETON HUSH
settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn and finished all out between rivals. FIRST SPRING settled in mid pack, raced three then two-wide
on the clubhouse turn, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied belatedly on the outside. WHISKEY VICTOR led quickly, set a reserved pace,
took a bit of a breather on the backstretch then quickened through the far turn, was under a drive into the stretch but was passed a furlong out and tired.
JAMMIN STILL stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn then flattened out along the inside in the stretch.

clear into the stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. KING CAUSEWAY raced in mid pack, closed four to six-wide through the turn, was
involved in some bumping with GOOGLE IT upper stretch then evened out late. ENGLISH CLASSIC settled off the pace, was hustled late turn, chased into
the stretch and finished gamely. GOOGLE IT, in range, came three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, bumped with KING CAUSEWAY
then evened out late. GIANT CRITIC raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, angled out into moving into the stretch but lacked a rally.

brief speed then stalked the pace, chased into the stretch, was blocked in traffic, angled out and rallied gamely but the window had closed. STRIKE A BEAT
stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, launched a bid upper stretch, but was lugging in and was outkicked. LOVE OF MINE dueled, came
two and three-wide on the turn, was passed mid stretch and evened out. IRVING dueled from the rail and tired mid stretch. SWANKY KNIGHT stalked the
pace, rode the rail then moved two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. KNOTTY BY DESIGN was pinched back at the start and trailed throughout.
