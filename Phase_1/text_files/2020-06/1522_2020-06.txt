Footnotes
HOLD ME BLACK set the pace inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, shook loose from those foes passing the quarter pole, then held SPIKE SHIRL at
bay under driving pressure. SPIKES SHIRL saved ground from midpack, shifted three wide to commence a rally at the five sixteenths pole, forged place in
upper stretch while HOLD ME BLACK shook loose, then chased that foe home with making minor progress. NOMO RON was forwardly placed along the
inside, but failed to make a bid before the leader shook away in upper stretch, then stayed on to prove third best. STAY HOME trailed the field by a distance
around the turn, shifted to the six path in midstretch, then passed tired rivals. AROUND THE DIAL took the turn in midpack in the three path, was floated for
wide at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten. TOP BRASS bobbled at the start and raced far off of the pace in the four path into the turn, shifted to
the five path turning for home, and failed to factor. SHARP ART stalked three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. FLAT LUCKY was outrun while taking
the turn in the two to three path. LADY'S WEEKEND vied for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole
and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
FABRICATE bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside right behind the leader, shifted to the two path at the quarter pole to pass the
inner tiring leader, forged ahead of her outer drifting foe at the furlong pole, and held BAHAMA MISCHIEF at bay through the late stages. BAHAMA
MISCHIEF shifted from the two path to the four path turning for home, then to the five path in upper stretch, sustained a rally through the late stages, and
was gaining on the leader, but did not have enough. YOGURT vied for the lead outside of TIZ A BIT LUCKY while being kept in the three path by that rival,
took over and drew clear passing the quarter pole, but drifted out while beginning to tire in upper stretch, hung on her left lead, then was headed at the
furlong pole and weakened. MIDNIGHT COCKTAIL bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, then two wide around the turn, but failed to
make a bid and finished evenly. TIZ A BIT LUCKY set the pace inside of YOGURT while staying a path off of the rail, but weakened at the quarter pole and
gave way while hanging on her left lead. FORTUNA ADIUVAT was off two lengths slowly, trailed the field around the turn, then failed to factor. MISS SKY
CAT was bumped at the start, then was outrun while saving ground. WENDY'S FINE WINE raced far off of the pace in the three to five path around the turn,
and was no factor.

LOCALLY OWNED stalked the pace from along the inside, waited under a tight hold in the pocket around the far turn, surged through a rail opening in upper
stretch, forged a narrow advantage from multiple foes passing the furlong pole, and held BEAU LUMINARIE at bay through the late stages. BEAU
LUMINARIE was caught three wide while far off of the pace around the first turn, commenced a rally in the four to five path around the far turn to make a
four wide bid in the five path turning for home, sustained his bid through the lane under a long drive, but was outfinished by an inner rival. MR. QUALITY set
the pace inside of foes while staying a path off of the rail, but yielded between horses at the furlong pole, then held show. HOMBRAZO vied two wide and
between horses while in the three path around the far turn, forged a lead in upper stretch, but gave way between horses at the furlong pole. JOB SECURITY
checked off of heels while far off of the pace into the first turn, trailed in the three path, advanced mildly between horses down the backstretch, but never
threatened. WHAT A COUNTRY advanced outside of horses down the backstretch to make a four wide bid for the lead in the five path into the far turn, vied
around that bend, but weakened in upper stretch. GIGGING was forwardly placed three wide, made a three wide bid between horses while in the four path
when WHAT A COUNTRY forced his hand into the far turn, then weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. ALL WEST was off slowly and took a
bump at the start, got rank into the first turn while far off of the pace, then saved ground around the turns and never got involved.

Footnotes
WILD LOVE prompted the pace setter from the outside, inched forward to vie into the far turn, put away her inner counterpart turning for home, and widened
under driving pressure through the lane. MAJORETTE broke inwards, raced in midpack two wide in the three path between horses around the first turn,
chased the dueling leaders around the far turn, then kept on through the lane to achieve place. SHE'S A DEAL trailed early on, advanced in the three to four
path at the half mile pole, then sustained a mild rally through the lane to achieve show, but failed to threaten. MESSINA set a moderate pace along the
inside, but was no match for the eventual winner turning for home, then weakened on her left lead through the lane. SKYHAWK stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace down the backstretch and weakened around the far turn. ANGEL DE CORA was bumped between horses at the start, got rank passing
the wire for the first time, then saved ground while off of the pace and weakened around the far turn. RISOTTO was caught four wide around the first turn
while far off of the pace, and was outrun thereafter.
