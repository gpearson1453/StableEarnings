CLASSY SCARLETT was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and with a bid from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. COURT
REPORTER tracked the leader from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was no match for the winner. PASTURE
CURFEW had no speed and gained ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. BLU COLLAR ROMANCE showed
speed from the outside and set the pace but was headed on the far turn and came up empty. SPEEDING STARLET was in touch but chased on the far turn
and failed to fire.

CHAIRMAN'S VENOM set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch prevailed. KINZUA was in range and a factor on the
turn but from the four path through the stretch was second best. MISS TEA BLONDE was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. MUNCH AND CRUNCH was off the pace, raced evenly on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up
for a share. FOREST FAIRY was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. LINDATALKS was
away alertly and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. WISE CHANCE was up close early but lost ground on the
turn and was empty.

Footnotes
DUKE OF HEARTS showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch just lasted. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was
unhurried early, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch rallied late. STROLLING POSSE was in mid pack, had a mild gain
on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. JORDANS WAY was in range and forced the pace on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch needed more. DOCTOR ROBERT was in touch and a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
flattened out. CEPELINAS had no speed and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. TEXAS BOY was
off the pace and showed little while outrun. WHATSONEMORE stalked the early leader but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

turn and finished well. STOLEN IDENTITY was away alertly and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. COLLEEN'S
