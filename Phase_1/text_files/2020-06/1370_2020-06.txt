the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, lacked room at the eighth pole, angled out but was too
late. STUMBERG outrun early, advanced inside, responded and rallied but too late. PITCHER could only improve position. OURGOLDSHALAYLEE chased
the early pace from between foes but came up empty in the drive. BERNADETTES VISION was no factor. DRAMA SPECIALIST dueled from the inside and

Footnotes
OUR SLICK CHICK chased the early pace from the outside, inched closer up the backstretch, dueled through the second turn, shook loose entering the
drive and was much the best while never asked. BRAHMS' REGAL GAL broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the
backstretch, battled through the second turn but was no match while clearly second best. KAYDEES IN TOWN chased the early pace from the inside, crept
closer entering the second turn, responded but could only gain the show. MEG AND CLAIR pressed the early pace inside but could not keep pace. LADY
FITZGERALD forced the early pace outside, made a bid but faltered in the drive. SATTERSFIELD was never close. MISS CISSY was never a factor. Due to
a timer malfunction some fractions are unavailable.

down for the drive and was along in time. ELIJAH GHOST pressed the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded
when asked but could not keep pace while holding the place. NO KA OI dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained
clear through the second turn, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace. MEGA MAX well placed from the inside, held a forward position

Footnotes
SENATOR CON broke sharp from between foes, gained the early margin, dueled up the backstretch, gained a clear margin through the second turn, widen
the effort at the eighth pole then was all out to last. AL TAWEEL unhurried early from the inside, advanced inside through the second turn, responded when
sat down for the drive but just missed. GOOD INTENT stalked, the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded and was
along for the show. WRECK EM forced the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch but could not keep pace. C H JAY forced the early pace
inside but had no late responde. THUNDER AND RAIN broke awkward and could only improve position. CRESCENT FLYER chased the early pace and
tired. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE was never a factor. GUITAR KING was never close. DIPLOME showed little.
