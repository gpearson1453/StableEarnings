SMART ARCH tracked leader to the half, dueled to far turn, took over to clear and held on to the wire. LUCKYINKENTUCKY well placed while never far
back to far turn, rallied too late inside. CASS CITY good position throughout with no late kick in the lane when needed. HIGLEY O'PRADO stumbled at the
start, secured good position, came four wide past the quarter pole with no late gain. HEY RAY rough start and never reached contention throughout.
DIAMOND DREAMER good speed from outside but gave way after the half.
