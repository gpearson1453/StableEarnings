KALAKALA was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. ALL POWERED UP was bumped at the break, lacked early
foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and did not menace. TRUST N LIBERTY was pushed in at the start, raced off the
leaders early, angled out nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. INTELICRYPT disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. FAIR

VROYSKY was off a step slow, rushed to the lead, opened a clear margin and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. BRETT was reserved just off
the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, was no match for the winner but held on well to save the place. CANDIED LUTE was off slow,
raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. URBAN SPLENDOR lagged
early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished with some late run. SOVEREIGN NATION chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ATTA BOY BILLY was forwardly placed from between foes and gradually weakened. COUGAR GRAY
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FREESTONE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the
fore with sixteenth to run and was going away late. ALWAYS WORKING chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, led but could not resist the winner late. DERBY DREAMING was off slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn,
angled out nearing the quarter and finished with late interest. MY FIRST TRIP was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to
gain in the drive. ROUGH RIDE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. MOVETOTHERIGHT
pressed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and weakened. MOKI DUGWAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. SA LUTE MR. H was off slow, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. SHARK HARBOR lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ABRAA JABRAA was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held sway to the wire.
GRAZEN VALOR was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could not match strides with that rival in the drive but
finished well to be second best. SALSA VERDE lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy.
TAP THAT SPOT was bumped at the start, then was forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response.
SIGRID'S GOLD broke in, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. SALTY LITTLE LASS
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. CALESE raced off the pacesetters, moved four-wide through the turn, was
carried out further nearing the quarter and weakened.

Footnotes
O'S SO SERIOUS was off a step slow, circled the field while racing four-wide, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and was going away late. PORT
LIONS was bumped at the start, sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the lane but could not match
strides with the winner late. CLOCKER'S CHOICE was bumped at the break, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the turn and finished with
some late run. ON YOUR TOES settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. DRAGON LADY
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHOE PHONE raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. QUIK COOKIE was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. TRICKEY
DAHLING was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. KDEE showed brief speed and weakened.
PLATINUM PEACH was bumped at the start, chased the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.
