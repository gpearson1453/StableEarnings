DREAM FEVER stalked pace four then three wide into the stretch, engaged the leader before the furlong marker and proved best in a strong drive. PINK
PAJAMAS away alertly, set a pressured pace near the inside until deep stretch, dug in gamely and just missed hanging on. MISS LAURA LOU was bumped
hard between horses at the start and finished with good courage along the rail. ARROWSPHERE battled for the early lead two wide, kept pressured into the
stretch and faded late. STEPHANIE'S FAITH unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground late in the middle of the racetrack. I FLY FIRST CLASS failed to
menace. QUEENA ESTHER was bumped hard at the start then outrun. BLACK BUTTE was no factor. HASTY LADY bore in at the start bumping hard with
rivals then was through early.

LEOMBRUNO was hustled up to battled for the lead along the inside soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened the balance of
the trip under left handed urging to win as much the best. BEAUTIFUL GAME broke in front, stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly along the
rail and got up for second. DARINGLY BOLD with the second flight, finished with good courage three wide. SOUL OF DISCRETION failed to menace.
SPECTACULAR ROAD matched strides with the winner into the stretch then weakened. ALEX THE DUDE had brief speed. MADEYE bore in badly hitting
the rail unseating his rider at the start, went over the rail and left the course. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MIA PROMESSA never far back, rallied four wide on the turn and into the stretch, gained a narrow lead before the furlong marker, battled to the wire with
the runner up and proved best in a stiff drive while fully extended. RYOAN vied for the lead from the start, went up to challenge the leaders before a half,
battled the balance of the trip and just missed in a game effort. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE bobbled at the start, was allowed to settle then had a mild late rally in
the six path. BACKSPLASH unhurried early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the eight path. CREATE AN EDGE broke in full stride to set a pressured
pace into the stretch then weakened. TRACE chased the pace from the inside for a half, checked when in tight past the quarter pole nearing the top of the
stretch and dropped out of it. ACCOLADES GALORE had good early speed then faded. CIPHERIN' SUE trailed.
