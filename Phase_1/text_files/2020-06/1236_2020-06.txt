Footnotes
WALKOFF away without apparent mishap, cut over to the rail a short distance from the conclusion of the backstretch, flashed interest at the midway point of
the turn, with the runner up likewise springing to life, although several paths to the outside, maintained the momentum cutting the corner into the lane, went
by the leader at the three-sixteenths pole in unison with the second place finisher, saw that rival shift inward so as to be directly abreast at the beginning of
the last eighth, finished gamely to prove best. MACHA'S REWARD made contact with the side of the gate after leaning in at the start, loped along in the two
path during the trip leading up to the half mile pole, picked it up modpoint on the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, closed in, overtaking JACK BO a
few strides later, all the while getting worked to the inside, giving the mount a good view of the nemesis, fought well in the last eighth, but had to settle for
second. GRIT AND GLORY underwent a two wide pursuit, angled about five wide into the stretch, proved no match. RUCKSACK hand urged on the chute,
got switched to a rating hold once off if it, travelled three wide on the turn, got cued up for the drive home, fanned out into the five path from upper to
midstretch, lacked the needed response. JACK BO disputed the pace from path two, paired up with BOOBY TRAP during the initial stages, edged away and
showed the way thereafter on a loosely-contested advantage, felt an uptick in pressure late on the bend, arrived in the stretch and was asked for more, got
hauled in right around the three-sixteenths marker and faltered. INCLUNATION four wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, gave way. HIZAAM
along the overland route on the turn, folded then was allowed to fade away down the lane. BOOBY TRAP disputed the pace from along the rail, went into
the three path after getting shaken off late on the backstretch, failed to regain prominence, swerved out four wide from left side pressure coming into the
lane, then was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
TILTINGATWINDMILLS tracked just off the inside just off the pace, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in
under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish. MINIT MAUS
skygazed rank under restraint early on forwardly placed two to three wide, settled once established the in the two path down the backstretch in closest
pursuit of the leader, got set down angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared
near the sixteenth marker, and ran on to just preserve the place honors from a fast closing rival in a good effort. SECOND BITE bumped at the start by
WOOD BEE who broke out a step, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
home and kicked on belatedly for the show honors just missing for the place. APPRECIATE broke out a step at the start brushing WOOD BEE, settled just
off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot. ALLEY
TO CALVARY three wide in range of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the
finish but was outkicked. WOOD BEE broke out a step at the start bumping SECOND BITE before being brushed by APPRECIATE to the near side, raced
three then two wide in pursuit under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and was outkicked. PETALITE established the front shortly
after the start and showed the way crossing to the inside and settling in hand down the backstretch, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared just outside the furlong marker, weakened
through to the finish. POSITIVE SKEW saved ground at the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper
stretch and made no headway. INTOXICOLOGIST three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride midway on the far turn, went five wide for home
and tired.

Footnotes
POWERFUL VENEZUELA took up position in midpack after the start, chased the pace from the two path, was put to a drive for the drive home, fanned out
the extremest of all during the stretch, until approximately seven wide, all the while closing the gap, got engaged in a late duel with BOOTLEGGER and got
the job done. BOOTLEGGER (FR) well off the inside throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, got turned loose coming into lane, angled six wide into it,
gained ground as did a host of others, found itself locked in a belated battle with the winner, wound up the one to be denied. LIAM LETS GO along the
outside, was in the four path creeping up to the front runners late on the bend, commenced the stretch by tipping one path wider, struck the front in
midstretch, but with quite a few others in hot pursuit, gave in to the heavy pressure a sixteenth down the road, held the show. SCARF IT DOWN got guided
onto the inside route, launched a rail rally sufficient enough to claim the last major check. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced around the turn from the two path,
was moved out towards path six once into the stretch, gained but without much impact. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY three wide entering the turn, got sent out
six to seven wide exiting it, didn't offer enough to make an impact. VINCERO remained stationed along the inside, argued for control against a pair of
opponents to the outside early, then went at it one on one matched up with THE FORTY FACTOR on the turn, having MAJESTIC AFFAIR lurking
dangerously in the three path, was set down spinning into the lane, relinquished to the onslaught that followed and backed away. EARNED SUCCESS set
up along the rail at the half mile pole, moved out three wide into the lane, failed to gain ground appreciably. THE FORTY FACTOR contended for the top
from path three as the outermost of a threesome early, got steered into path two at the top of the turn and into a duel, was put to a drive heading home
between rivals, gave in and backed away. MAJESTIC AFFAIR forwardly placed three wide, unleashed an abbreviated bid coming into the stretch, couldn't
cement itself to the lead and faltered. BRIMSTONE argued for command from path two in between rivals to the half mile pole, backed away steadily
thereafter. SPARTY BOY placed along the rail coming up to the end of the backstretch, stayed put on the turn, cut the corner driving to no avail.

Footnotes
COPPER CHALICE off to a sluggish start without incident, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear, went four wide through the
turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide at the quarter pole before tipping out two to three paths straightened away, then angled
out two additional paths near the eighth pole, closed well outside to just get up over a trio hitting the wire together in the very last jump. FARRAGUT five to
six wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through the final furlong
and just missed one the wire surging at the end. MR. BUCKLEY six paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked three wide through
the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking narrow command a furlong out, knocked
heads to the finish with MIDNIGHT WHISKEY to his inside, came under late threat from a trio outside and was nailed at the finish by a pair. MIDNIGHT
WHISKEY coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside through the turn, came
under pressure near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside tenaciously but
was ultimately bested by a trio in the final jumps. TOP OF THE MINT bumped at the start by FROZEN ACCOUNT who broke outwards a step, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to tepidly
threaten in the late stages. MAJESTIC VIEW prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home between foes, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PATEGORY ONE hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside
nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired foes. BLACKJACK
DAVEY brushed the near side stall at the start getting away slowly, chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn
under a ride from midway, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. FROZEN ACCOUNT broke out at the start bumping TOP OF THE
MINT, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. BANK GALA chased three to four
wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under encouragement from three furlongs out, went four wide for home and offered
no kick. SENOR PHELPS coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled seven to eight wide for home and
weakened. COMPETITIVE CLOUD chased four wide until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and tired.
KAMIKAZE RED coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in pursuit under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and was unable to
make an impact.

Footnotes
IDLE TIME got placed along the inside route, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, inched its way to the outside heading home, espied an open
inside corridor right afterwards and dove back to the rail, slipped by LOADED JOE at the three-sixteenths pole and eventually into the lead, came under
heavy pressure late but dug in well to stay in the clear. PRINCE OF CAPS save ground for three-quarters, angled four wide into the lane for clearance,
closed in with good energy, had aim on the winner belatedly but was staved off. WINNING FACTOR got yanked over to the rail after the field had been
released, was along it for six furlongs, waited late on the bend before getting roused and angled to the outside, eventually going three wide for the drive
home, become stuck in traffic shortly afterwards, bobbled seeming to clip the heels of MR EVERYTHING, recovered then weaved about from the furlong
grounds to inside the sixteenth marker for racing clearance, ran out of space moving with willingness behind the first two finishers coming up to the finish
line . SIR CHUBBY brushed with MONKEYSEEMONKEYDO at the start, took up position towards the back of the pack, departed the backstretch from the
two path, inched up under his own power as third fraction was being completed, went on a venture towards the middle of the strip, wound up approximately
eight wide when done, displayed some energy nailing down the final significant slice of the pot. LITTLE MAZZY unhurried while stationed in the two path,
was eventually swung out wide during the stretch run, made no late headway. HEIRLOOM KITTEN pursued the pace from the four path on the turn,
wandered out nine wide down the stretch mildly improving. LOADED JOE disputed the pace from along the rail, made his way into the stretch and gave
way. BASIE spotted three wide on the turn, lacked the necessary stretch response. TOLAGA BAY within striking distance three to four wide on the turn, was
maneuvered into the six path from upper to midlane, tired. MR EVERYTHING drafted along while saving ground during the opening phases, got tipped into
the three path at the top of the fuller bend, got set down coming up to the quarter pole, appeared to get from behind a few strides down the rail, failed to
claim the front and folded. MONKEYSEEMONKEYDO bumped with SIR CHUBBY after lunging in at the start, was three wide stepping off the chute,
disputed the pace from path two after settling on the backstretch, got roused entering the stretch, gave in and backed away. ABRUPT strung out three wide
on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
TRIBECCA established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for
home, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. MOUNT TRAVERS two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. AMUNDSON coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from
midway on the turn, continued four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. INSTAGRAND broke in at the start brushing with THE RIGHT PATH, chased
four to five wide down the backstretch and then five to six wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and closed in late with a mild bid. THE RIGHT PATH brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. READY TO ESCAPE five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs out,
continued five wide into upper stretch and weakened. TOPPER T chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
THE IMPORTANT ONE strolled along in the two path during the opening half, was fanned out spinning into the lane, shifted wider and wider for clearance
until in the neighborhood of the nine path by midlane, began to close the gap completing the run through the furlong grounds, found herself in a one on one
contest with the runner up in the final seventy yards and came up the victor over a determined opponent. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS got worked into the
two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, departed it appearing unsettled, raced between foes while pulling a bit during the run around the bend, had
the rider commit to the outside for the drive home after momentarily waiting behind others, eventually being maneuvered into the six path, rallied with good
energy striking the top well inside the sixteenth marker, vied with vigour against the winner in the last seventy yards, wound up denied. ANCIENT BROWN
sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, stayed put on the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and rallied for the show. HOLMDEL PARK underwent a two
wide trip on the turn, got sent out into path seven from upper to midstretch, finished willingly down the center of the course for the last major check. AMOS
gained real estate in the lane following a ground-saving journey. WINIFRED J sparred for the top from the two path, got let out coming onto the head of the
stretch, offered resistance before yielding with under an eighth to go, then weakened. VIOLENT POINT attained a prominent position after losing its footing
springing from the starting gate, disputed the pace from the inside, kept at the task until about a sixteenth remaining before losing position to stronger rivals.
HAPPY MUSIC three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, lacked the needed response. STRETCHTHESTORY saved
ground for the initial half, failed to fire when tipped out towards the two path in upper stretch. QUEENDOM spotted along the inside on the turn , got sent out
eight wide during the stretch run to no avail. QUESTEQ chased the pace in close range from path two, was driven into the three path for entrance into the
lane, backed away. GRUDGE went out into the two path after saving ground for the opening half, had no offering.

Footnotes
HONEY I'M GOOD away without apparent mishap, established the top in short order, was rated along in the two path, chased by a firing squad of four a
short distance behind, shifted into the three path when put to a drive entering the stretch, dug in well to hold sway. ROYAL CHARLOTTE took up the chase
from the three path between rivals on the turn, was let loose for the drive home, commenced the stretch slightly wider, got staved off. PACIFIC GALE at a
considerable distance from off the rail throughout, travelled five wide on the turn , was about as wide during the stretch run securing the show. MOTHER
MOTHER settled into midpack after the start, sat parked out five wide on the turn, fanned out into path six heading home, gained, but all accomplished
without posing a threat. LAST TRUE LOVE remained along the inside route once the field had been sent off and running, was asked for run racing on the
turn, went more into the two path for the drive home, lacked a solid closing punch. PIEDI BIANCHI in the four path in pursuit of the front runners, had no
rally. SLIMEY brought up the back of the pack stationed in the four path, got sent out seven wide becoming the widest of all early during the stretch drive,
made no headway. NISHA forwardly placed four wide, gave way. GYPSY JANIE in the two path stepping onto the turn, failed to menace.

UNCLE GEORGE bumped at the start by the breaking in BREITHORN, chased three then two wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing well outside to get up and prevail in the final jumps. ITS A WRAP three to
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, came under an off sided stick and came inwards bumping
COMPLEX SYSTEM at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive to take narrow and brief command inside the sixteenth marker before being nailed on the
wire. COMPLEX SYSTEM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, dug in under a drive and was
bumped solidly by the aforementioned foe at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. PROPENSITY chased three
to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat
and was collared inside the final sixteenth and battled on to the finish. ELSTON chased just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths and passed tired rivals in the stretch. BREITHORN broke in at the start bumping UNCLE GEORGE, chased along the inside
under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner for home and offered no response. CARIBBEAN GOLD broke in at the start bumping NEW FRONTIER,
raced just off the inside in aim of the front under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and weakened. G C CAM chased
three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. NEW FRONTIER bumped at the start by
CARIBBEAN GOLD, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure, tipped to the two path three furlongs out, cut the
corner into upper stretch, dug in and yielded command near the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. POINT OF HUMOR chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths and tired. CALL HOME four then three wide in range of the leader, advanced on that rival and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on ITS A WRAP as well as a
Jockey's Objection by the rider of COMPLEX SYSTEM alleging interference against ITS A WRAP at the three-sixteenths pole. After review, it was deemed
that ITS A WRAP had interfered with COMPLEX SYSTEM and as a result ITS A WRAP was disqualified from second and placed third before the race was
declared official.
