Footnotes
TWO LAST WORDS set the pace from the two path through the turn while under pressure from the runner-up, remained with a short advantage into the
lane then gamely held the lead to the wire. CLASSY COWBOY pressed the winner while two wide and in the three path through the turn, continued as a
serious threat into the lane then could not get past the top one while turning in a good effort and settling for second best. BANDIDO DE AMORES chased
the pacesetters from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then needed more late. MEROCKETMAN was in the four path
through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and lacked a closing kick. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER was forced in early and steadied into gap,
raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain. REDYORNOTHEREICOME was bumped at the start,
raced in the two path through the turn and never was a serious factor. SOLITAIRE GAME chased the pace through the turn while along the inside then
faded through the lane.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT JUSTICE moved to the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled with another into the lane, shook clear near the three-sixteenths pole and
was not threatened while under a hand ride to the end. HARD LUCK JUSTICE set the early pace along the inside, deferred the lead to two others nearing
the three-eighths pole, came into the lane from near the rail, shifted into the three path and finished with good energy. HARBOR COURT moved with the
winner through the turn, continued with that one into the lane then yielded outside the eighth pole. BENNY BOO BOO was never a factor while along the
inside. PLAY UP was away slowly and spotted the field some three lengths, hustled to reach the field into the turn, raced in the three path and never
contended. CROSS OF GALILEE chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was checked sharply nearing the three-eighths pole when moving
inward while another was moving out, dropped back and was never in it thereafter. A STEWARDS INQUUIRY REVIEWED THE RUNNING OF THE RACE
NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR MAKING A CHANGE IN ORDER.

LASTCHANCEFORLOVE vied for the early lead while in the three path, cleared into mid-turn then widened into the lane then was ridden out to the wire
while much the best. MYEERAH vied for the lead while in the two path, could not keep up with the winner in late turn then kept on well to save the place
spot. KAY BEE GEE was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide into the lane, continued with good energy to the wire and was closing in on the place
spot while not a threat to the winner. JOSIE was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS
chased the pace from the three path through the turn then was empty through the lane. LAS RAMBLAS broke well then was bumped solidly early, settled to
the inside and never contended. UNUNDERSTANDABLE was done after the three-eighths pole while near the inside. QUEEN OF VERONA stumbled badly
start then trailed.

Footnotes
AZILOOK stalked the two rival duel through the far turn while in the three path, moved into the lane from the four path and when asked swept past the
pacesetter, quickly cleared and widened while being kept to the task. FIRST SQUADRON vied for the lead along the inside, put away dueling challenger
into the lane, was no match for the top one but kept on well to be well clear for the place spot. REAL DEPUTEE vied for the lead two wide through the far
turn, could not keep up with the runner-up int the lane but continued on to be clear for the show spot and best of the rest. SNAPASELFIE was near the rail
throughout and improved along the inside through the lane while never a menace. MABEETHISTIME raced in the two path through the turns and never was
a factor. FRENCH VANILLA chased the pace along the inside, continued near the rail into the lane and was empty inside the eighth pole. FORBIDDEN
FRUIT was in the three to the two path through the far turn when in mid-pack then had nothing to give after entering the lane. TROUBLENSHELBYVILE was
outrun while near the inside.
