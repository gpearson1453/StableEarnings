VIVA LA SECRETA stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, gained the margin entering the drive, opened a clear
advantage at the eighth pole and was in hand the final furlong. BEAUTIFULANDWILD chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn,
responded and closed with a rush for the place. DYNAMIC JULIE pressed the early pace from the inside, crept closer through the turn, responded and was
just up for the show. TWN PALMYSDESTINY dueled from the outside early, remained forward but could not keep pace. CADILLAC MAGIC dueled from the
inside early but had nothing for the drive. BLACK PATENT SHOES was never a factor. MARGIE'S ROUXBEE dueled from between foes and faded.
