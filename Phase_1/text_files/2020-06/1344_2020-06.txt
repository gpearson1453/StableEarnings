Footnotes
AULD LANGE SYNE saved ground around the turns, swung to the four path in upper stretch, gained a short lead outside CURLIN'S KNIGHT near the
eighth pole, drifted in near the sixteenth pole, dueled with that one and prevailed. CURLIN'S KNIGHT , a forward factor down the backstretch, was asked for
run inside the three eighths pole, brushed with VICTORY GIVEN approaching the eighth pole, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was out finished.
EASTPORT advanced four deep leaving the backstretch, remained wide around the far turn, weakened and passed a tired foe late. VICTORY GIVEN ,
three wide entering the first turn, was taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear mid way on the bend, set the pace along the rail, tired in upper stretch and
bumped CURLIN'S KNIGHT when drifting out approaching the eighth pole. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN hugged the inner rail around the far turn but was not a
factor. FIVE STAR PERFECT was outrun. COFFEE PLEASE , three wide on the turns, faltered. GOLDEN CHANCE was outrun.

Footnotes
SINGAPORE FLASH rated kindly about two wide nearing the half mile marker, followed NOBLE LION while advancing towards the rail past the five
sixteenths, angled four wide into the lane, leveled off when put to left handed encouragement, reeled in the leader in deep stretch then edged clear at the
line. TAUBER broke a beat slow, was nudged on and eagerly cleared nearing the first turn, dropped in to set the pace, widened a bit while under pressure
nearing mid stretch, could not resist the winner's charge but stayed gamely to remain clear of the rest. REAL FACTOR , three wide the first turn, stalked the
pace, edged up to the inside of a foe nearing the far turn, pursued towards the rail into the lane and gave effort to the wire. TOE CURLIN' KISS bore out at
the break, lagged off the pace, came under a solid ride leaving the far turn, swung six five to six wide into the lane, straightened and closed willingly. NOBLE
LION settled in the clear, made an inside run past the five sixteenths, shifted out with aim into the lane, lugged in near mid stretch and came up empty.
ABSALOM , pinched back at the break, regrouped and rated towards the inside, moved up into the lane, angled and flattened out. FAST MASTER , outside
a rival past the three quarter pole, failed to respond when put to pressure. STAND MY GROUND broke slowly, settled well back, split rivals near the quarter
pole, shifted in and lacked a solid follow through. PARATYCACHACA failed to menace. IRISH CROSSING , a bit keen early, saved ground and was not a
factor. LECTRIC CHOKE was outrun. HARDEST PART (GB) , away alertly, stalked the pace, was under a ride past the three eighths and gave way
approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
LUCKY NINETY NINE , rated inside horses stalking the pace around the turn, raced in the two path through the stretch, split horses in mid stretch and drew
off. TRULY RED , four wide on the turn, advanced to reach contention in upper stretch and flattened out. TRAP CITY sped to the early lead, set the pace
along the rail and weakened late. SEVILLA SANGRIA , steadied in close quarters along the rail entering the turn, lacked the needed late response.
CREATIVE ALIBI hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to be menace. TENDERNESS chased the pace, was four wide turning for home and
weakened. RONA , seven wide in upper stretch, was not a factor. WHY YOU SASSY floated to the six path in upper stretch and weakened.
MEGALOMANIA was no factor. FREEDOM QUEEN was outrun. AWESOME PAL drifted to the eight path turning for home.

Footnotes
DENDROBIA , unhurried early, crept a bit closer three wide into the lane, swung six wide for the drive, leveled off under pressure, forged ahead in the final
yards and went clear at the wire. SOMETHING MAGICAL snugly in hand between horses early, advanced four wide when given her cue into the lane,
ranged up to join the leader with a furlong to go, took over soon after, edged away some inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but could not fend off the
winner. FLY saved ground off the pace, worked her way outward in the drive and closed steadily. GIFTED HEART had speed three deep, emerged in a duel
outside MAYBE AN OMEN around the turn, shook clear past the quarter pole, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, battled past the sixteenth marker then
faded late. HIP HOP broke through the gate pre race, had speed then eased back off the leaders, saved ground into the lane, edged up past the three
sixteenths, steadied off heels in mid stretch, altered out and kept on with some interest. TARAWA had speed between runners, rated back off the dueling
pair into the turn, chased into the lane, moved up some near mid stretch then faded late. MADAME X. lagged inside, angled out past the furlong marker and
had some belated action. MAYBE AN OMEN dueled inside, ceded command soon into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then surrendered. NEVER
ENOUGH TIME , three wide between rivals early, failed to kick on past the three eighths and faded. ALWAYS SOMETHING , four wide, faltered.

Footnotes
MARGIE'S HEAVEN rushed up between horses down the backstretch to take the lead approaching the half mile pole, set the pace off the rail, opened up in
mid stretch and was kept to her business. LADY FOX , wide on the turn, was fanned seven deep in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. DECO
STRONG , a forward factor along the rail down the backstretch, rated back entering the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and flattened out.
QUEEN OF TOMORROW stalked the pace, floated to the six path in upper stretch, raced on her left lead and failed to rally. IT'S TIMELESS worked
between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SELF ASSURED , four deep leaving the backstretch, prompted the pace outside the winner
around the turn then gave way. BREVIARY hugged the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, swung outside mid stretch and showed a late move.
GIULIA AMMANNATI saved ground around the turn and gave way in the stretch. POPEYE'S OYL saved ground on the turn and weakened. TALIYAH
stumbled leaving the starting gate then was outrun. EMPERADORA , fractious behind the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
I LOVE YOU pulled her way clear into the first turn, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away mid way on the final turn, responded when set down in
upper stretch and held firm while kept to task. SHREW MEANING was steadied in close quarters while saving ground into the first turn, eased out a bit near
the five eighths, took closer order angling three wide in upper stretch, kept on willingly and just got up for second. SHAKE D MOON stalked three wide,
moved up some into the lane, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds, flattened out late and was nabbed for the place. ACIANO broke outward and
bumped with a rival, corrected and saved ground off the pace, moved up some into the lane, altered out near mid stretch but lacked a serious finish.
WICKED T , bumped at the break, edged up between runners early, raced four wide into the stretch but came up empty. ANNIE BOO BOO stalked the
winner off the inside, was under pressure as that one got away past the five sixteenths, stayed in touch to upper stretch then faded. HEY MABEL failed to
menace. PEARL GEM wide, was not a factor. ORTINOLA , five wide into the first turn, chased off the rail, faded and was lightly steadied in upper stretch.
EYE OF THE WILDCAT lagged inside, swung wide into the lane but lacked a rally. GRAND BANKS was steadied steadied off the heels of ICY LADY
nearing the first turn, angled out leaving the far turn but failed to kick on. ICY LADY broke sharply, rated close up inside, steadied briefly near the three
quarter pole, chased while saving ground into the far turn then retreated before going six furlongs.

Footnotes
BLACK STETSON stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch, drew away under urging and switched leads twice the
final furlong. CASH EXCHANGE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner but willingly held the place. MINERS
QUEST saved ground on the turn, eased out in mid stretch and showed a mild gain. IWISHIWASPECIAL saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail for the
drive, chased the pace and bumped with CAPE LOOKOUT when drifting out near the eighth pole. PRAISE THE MOON stumbled leaving the starting gate,
swung wide in upper stretch and steadied to avoid CAPE LOOKOUT in mid stretch. GYPSUM JOHNNY bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground on
the turn, eased out for the drive and was taken up behind CAPE LOOKOUT in mid stretch. CAPE LOOKOUT , bumped and pinched back leaving the
starting gate, was four wide leaving the turn, drifted in inside the eighth pole and stumbled when bumping with IWISHIWASPECIAL. PEP TALKING , sent
down the backstretch, prompted the pace two wide and gae way. HOT N SPICY LOVE bore out leaving the starting gate, was well off the rail in the stretch
and checked with run behind GYPSUM JOHNNY inside the eighth pole. PARADE OF NATIONS saved ground on the turn, angled out approaching the
stretch and was not a factor. FRENCH'S QUEST , outrun, drifted to the eight path turning for home. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run in mid
stretch but no action was taken.
