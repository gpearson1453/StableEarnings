Footnotes
SEAL TEAM TWO was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in upper stretch prevailed. DANNY'S RUSH was in touch, raced evenly
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. FAFA FOOEY was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path
through the stretch passed tired foes. ONE POUND STERLING broke poorly and saved ground on the turn but needed more. EBORACUM was unhurried
early, chased on the turn and was not a factor. BLINDSIGHTED was away alertly and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch but leveled off.

Footnotes
MARCUS showed no speed, gained ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up in time. BRADY O'BRADY was in touch,
roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. SUMMER RETREAT forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but from
the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. OMI'S BOY set a pressured pace and had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch
and gave way. TALE OF RONIN was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but was no real threat. CRIME WAVE was off slow and showed little in a
dull effort. KING KINGO was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SUMMER RETREAT
AGAINST MARCUS FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SILENT CONSORT was hustled early and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. KINZUA was in touch, moved up on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch gained gradually. WISE CHANCE was in range, saved ground on the turn and was up for show. FOREST FAIRY
was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. DIAMOND BREW was off the pace and roused
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. DIAMONDSINHEREYES had no speed and showed little while outrun. BOLD
BONITA was up close and a factor on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
