Footnotes
HOODOO BROWN leaned in at the start and brushed with a foe then was hustled, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the inside of
a rival, moved up midway down the backstretch to prompt the pace loosely between foes, was asked in the two path on the far turn, battled between horses
late on that bend, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, moved in while chasing the leading duo into the final furlong, gained very determinedly under
a vigorous left-handed whip into the final sixteenth then took the advantage and proved best under strong handling. GLOBUS leaned out at the start then
was hustled, went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, made a bid in the three to
four path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then moved clear while dropping in a bit into upper stretch, lost the lead to BALLYHACK into the
final furlong and was out-kicked but just earned the place. BALLYHACK was bumped at the start then taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, saved
ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, was roused near the half-mile pole, chased the leading trio while three wide for most of the far
turn then moved four wide, gained outside into upper stretch, took the lead at the furlong marker, led under an all out drive into the final sixteenth but was
overtaken then caught for the place while well clear for the show. MULA WILD went five wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, was ridden
along passing the half-mile pole, went four wide on the far turn, dropped to three wide nearing the three-sixteenths, drifted further inward in upper stretch
and failed to threaten. WILLY SPECIAL CATS was bumped shortly after the start, dropped back while in tight briefly off heels on the initial straightaway,
raced in the three path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went two to three wide on the far turn then
moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. REACH THE MOON broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, went five wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY was bumped
soundly at the start, went six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back under urging with a half-mile to run, went five to six wide on the far
turn and capitulated. KATAMA BAY brushed with an opponent at the start, disputed the pace on the inside, was asked under severe threat on the far turn,
lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. PAPA TANGO broke in and bumped with a foe then came out and
bumped with another rival, dropped in behind an opponent nearing the first turn, became rank under stout restraint in the two path on that bend, leveled out
on the backstretch then was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated. HIGH NOON TYPHOON
broke out then was taken up with a snatch of the left rein, spotted the front a few lengths, was hard held while very rank in the three then two path on the
first turn, continued very rank onto the backstretch, leveled out midway down the backstretch then dropped far behind and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ATTENTIVE went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, rallied while moving from four to six wide on the far turn, closed strongly
while dropped back to five wide into the stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker then drew away under strong urging. VAPORMAN was taken in
hand while behind a rival nearing the first turn, tossed his head while rank under restraint early on that bend, was rated just off the pace, leveled out midway
down the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, made a brief bid outside the furlong marker but
proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place. PODEROSO EQUS went five wide for most of the first turn then dropped to three wide, settled
off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the far turn, shifted three then four wide late on that bend and lacked the
needed response while able to get the show. APALACHEE BAY was carried in nearing the first turn then taken back behind the leader, came out three wide
into that bend, contested the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the far turn, moved clear at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, was headed outside the furlong marker and weakened then lost the show. CATDADDY dropped in nearing the first turn, contested the pace
on the outside, came under a strong hand ride late on the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired. SOCIAL
MISFIT steadied along the rail nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled just off the pace, dropped back while urged along three then two
wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to respond. PROMISING SHOES broke a step slow, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the
rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. POTOMAC leaned out at the start, was caught six wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped back while moving from three to five wide on the far turn and came up
empty.
