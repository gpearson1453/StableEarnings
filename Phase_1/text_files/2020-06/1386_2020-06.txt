SONG with the second flight three wide, faded in the stretch. JAMAICAN DON bobbled inward at the start, settled close up in the three path, was shut off
nearing the seven sixteenths pole causing his rider to check, dropped back then trailed THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER

GIANT BOO BOO drifted out at the start bumping a rivals, made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then drew off under a strong
hand ride. JOSIE'S RIDDLE was bumped at the start, never far back, circled rivals four wide entering the stretch and finished second best. GOT GRIT
trailed into the stretch then closed a gap late in the five path. LEM ME TEL YA broke in front, gave up his advantage, stalked the pace from between horses
into the stretch, drifted out a bit brushing the JOSIE'S RIDDLE then faded in the final furlong. DOUBLE TAKE vied for the lead along the inside and failed to
offer the needed response. SOUTHERN SPIRIT pressured the winner two then three wide past the quarter pole, was brushed causing his rider to steady
entering the stretch then dropped out of it.

two wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. EMPIRITA went evenly three wide. LEDGER failed to menace.

TEAM HUCKY prompted the pace two wide for a half, matched strides into the stretch, drifted out to the six path then widened the balance of the trip under
right handed urging to win as much the best while taken in hand nearing the wire. STONE COLD CAT away alertly, set a pressured pace for a half, battled
with the winner into the stretch then was no match while clearly second best. DAWN'S LIGHT trailed for a little over a half then passed tiring rivals in the six
path through the stretch. BLANDA with the second flight inside, failed to respond. TAPAWAY also with the second flight two wide, weakened in the stretch.
NORESTFORTHEWICKED was a forward factor in the five path for a half then stopped..
