Footnotes
CHICOUT D'TIGER gained the lead into the turn, drew clear into the lane and was ridden out. LADY RORSCHACH allowed to settle early, rallied in the two
path into the stretch and was up in time for place. NORTHERN BREEZE lacked early speed, launched a rail bid into the lane, angled out sharply at the top
of the stretch and edged out rival for show honors. DURA'S HALO was out sprinted to the turn, saved inside through the turn and faded gradually through
the stretch. MARYAM stalked outside and lacked the bid that was needed into the lane. FIT FOR ROYALTY chased the pace and gave way into stretch.
BLUEBELLEJAM offered little. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY hustled inside, shifted outside mid turn, was eased into the lane and walked off.

OJO DEL MAR vied outside for the lead, dueled outside of REDNECK REMARK leaving the turn, disposed of rival at the top of the stretch and held under a
late drive. MIDNIGHT SHAKE away slow, saved ground, took closer ordering in the final turn, gained ground late but was unable to reach the winner under
steady urging. BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the pacesetters, was roused into the lane and was along in time for show. REDNECK REMARK vied inside
early, dueled inside of OJO DEL MAR, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and was rundown late. REFLECTIONOFVALUES settled mid pack
and produced a late bid through stretch. REMARKABLE VINTAGE broke slow, trailed and offered a late kick. CODE EIGHT reserved off the pacesetters,
came under a drive into the lane, evened out and late running room in the final yards. STAR CZAR lost ground in the the turn and offered little into the drive.
MR. IRRELEVANT dropped back and passed tiring rivals. HORST raced wide through the turn and offered no response when asked. BIONIC BIRD pressed
the early pace inside, lost ground along the rail through the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
DEUCES ARE WILD controlled the pace early and was never threatened. THIS TIME LUCKY sat just off the pace early, chased in vain but was no match
for the winner. TORCHLIGHT settled inside early, rallied into the stretch and held for show. WICKED FORTITUDE chased outside, rallied into the stretch
and weakened late. ROLL THE STONE lacked early speed, shifted out into the lane but failed to threaten. ADRIEN'S AURORA reserved off the pacesetters
and faded. RYANWATER lacked a serious bid. GROOMED raced four wide in the early stages and roused to no avail. COMMISSION MAN was outrun.
