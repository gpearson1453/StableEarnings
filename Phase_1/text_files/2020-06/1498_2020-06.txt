Footnotes
THENEXTBESTTHING was never far back, challenged for command between horses a quarter-mile out, took over in upper stretch and drove clear on his
left lead. COLD WARRIOR broke out bumping SWINGIN ON A STAR, waited for room along the inside around the turn, shifted to the three-path for the
drive and was along for second. TOOK A CAB advanced three wide to loom a threat approaching the stretch, but flattened out. MAQUIAVELO saved
ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved out a bit and improved without threatening. MAKINALEGACY was slow at the start and far back early inside, and
passed tired horses on the far outside late. SWINGIN ON A STAR got bumped by COLD WARRIOR at the start, and was no factor in the two-path. HAPPY
DANZA raced three to four wide, and tired. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL crossed over inside with a clear early lead, and gave way readily after three furlongs.
WORDMAN lacked speed and showed little. MYMAGIC broke slow and trailed inside.

Footnotes
SON OF A BEAST moved inside approaching the turn dueling with TOP BOSS, shook that one off but was joined right after that by TIGER, dug in along the
rail and held gamely to the finish. TIGER ranged up three wide to challenge outside SON OF A BEAST with a quarter-mile remaining, tested that foe
repeatedly through the lane but could not get by. TOP BOSS got outdueled by the winner around the turn, and ran on through the lane to be well clear for
the show. HOT BLOODED bobbled and steadied a few strides from the gate, raced three wide and was no factor. TORETTO was a step slow at the start,
and was never prominent five wide. FREELANCE showed brief speed and tired inside. AWESOME BEACH was a step slow at the start, and outrun four
wide. FLORALA AL moved up mildly along the inside on the turn, but was through by the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
CREA'S BKLYN LAW was scrubbed along through the turn on the rail, stayed on through a long drive and was just up inside rivals. CHARLIE THE GREEK
dueled outside DROP KICK, was floated out to the four-path by that one turning for home, led through most of the stretch but could not hang on. DROP
KICK dueled inside CHARLIE THE GREEK, drifted to the three-path at the top of the lane, and stayed on with good courage between the top two.
CONGRATS THIS raced two wide between horses to the turn, and lacked the needed late response. DIZZY GILLESPIE tossed his head and lunged at the
break to spot the field several lengths, attempted a four-wide rally midway on the turn, and flattened out. HONEST TO GOODNESS lodged a mild bid three
wide on the turn, and gave way before reaching the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction all times have been omitted.

Footnotes
SOUPER COURAGE brushed with THE GREEN MO'STER at the start, settled in the middle of the field unhurried early, swung four wide off the far turn,
and rallied steadily to wear down SPEED FRANCO from outside. SPEED FRANCO pressed the pace from the outset, wrested command outside
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR in upper stretch, edged clear past the furlong marker but could not hold on. THE GREEN MO'STER brushed with SOUPER
COURAGE at the start, steadied between horses approaching the quarter-pole, moved out a bit in upper stretch and finished willingly. SOVEREIGN
WARRIOR set the pace inside to the stretch, and weakened. GINS AND TINS raced in striking range from the start, came under a ride with five-sixteenths
remaining, and weakened through the lane. SHENDAM (FR) moved up in the two-path after six furlongs, and was empty inside through the lane.
MARYLAND PRIDE was never prominent. ROCK THE CAUSEWAY raced three then four wide around the far turn, and could not make an impact.
CRYPTO GOLD was always outrun. MACHIAVELLI was never close. JOYFUL HEART broke slow, went into the first turn four wide, and never made his
presence felt. HE'S SUPER LUCKY broke slowly, trailed under urging early, and had no response.

Footnotes
MO OF THE WEST tugged along a bit around the first turn, settled down in striking range through the middle stages, had a clear shot three wide into the
stretch, and responded well to prevail outside AIZU. The latter saved ground for six furlongs, tipped out to the two-path in upper stretch, rallied between
rivals through the furlong grounds, and was outdueled inside the top one. AWESOME ELLA advanced while shifting out four wide to the top of the stretch,
finished willingly outside the leaders but did not have quite enough. BASELINE DRIVE hopped slightly and was off slowest, took closer order after six
furlongs while moving out three then four wide, and offered a mild response for the last major share. BY HIS GRACE was four wide into the first turn, moved
in a couple paths and took over outside ART OF LAW after a quarter-mile, cleared inside up the backstretch, showed the way to the stretch and gave way in
the last furlong. RASPBERRY BALLET raced in the second flight and made no impact. RACHEL'S WISH saved ground to no avail. ART OF LAW cleared to
the early lead inside, deferred to BY HIS GRACE and moved out leaving the first turn, stayed on the chase to the top of the stretch and tired between
horses.

Footnotes
DESERT GENERAL lagged well back for a half-mile, skimmed the rail advancing around the turn, continued to edge closer to the leaders in upper stretch,
moved off the inside near the sixteenth-pole, collared TWO STEP SLOW from outside and pulled clear. TWO STEP SLEW emerged with the lead out of the
chute, rated along inside to the stretch, was clear into the final furlong, could not hold on but saved the place. SOLAR WARMING chased outside TWO
STEP SLEW to the stretch, had aim through the lane and finished one-paced. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was slow into stride, and improved in the two-path
without becoming a factor. NACHO PAPA raced four wide, and lacked the needed rally. KAHRAMANI gave way before reaching the stretch. PANGO was
forwardly placed three wide early between horses, and tired after six furlongs. BASELINE raced four to five wide, and was finished on the turn.
MANHATTAN PROJECT showed little.

Footnotes
VEGAS KITTEN vied for command inside CARBON DATA for six furlongs, shook away turning for home and was driving to stay clear. ROCKET JOE
COPPER saved ground under a firm hold for a half-mile, advanced around the far turn gradually shifting out to the five-path, and finished well to go clear of
the others. POSITIVE PHIL stayed in range for six furlongs in the two-path, moved inside rallying mildly into the final furlong, and saved the show.
HIEROGLYPHICS hugged the rail for six furlongs, waited for an opening from the top of the stretch to a sixteenth out, split horses for clearance in the
two-path and finished well too late. WINGMAN was in or near the three-path much of the way, and offered a mild late response. COLONIST lost some
position out-moved around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and passed tired horses. PATRIOT DRIVE raced four wide throughout, edged a bit
closer between calls on the far turn, but was one-paced through the drive. BOURBON IN MAY raced three wide early, was bottled up behind horses through
the lane and could never be set down. JUST THE FACTS saved ground throughout, and faded in the stretch. TIMMY M. raced wide throughout, and was
never close. CARBON DATA vied outside VEGAS KITTEN to the top of the stretch, and faltered. TROPICAT raced three wide, loomed outside the leaders
approaching the stretch, but had nothing left soon after that.

Footnotes
MACHO D'ORO took over inside before completing an eighth of a mile, left KORCZAK and everyone else behind midway on the turn, extended the margin
under a drive through upper stretch, and was wrapped up 70 yards out. MINTZ raced three wide around the turn, moved into second through the furlong
grounds, and held for that position. WAR ACT was four or five wide around the turn, and finished evenly. THREE DEEP raced three to four wide, and lacked
a solid response. ROAD TO PEACE weakened after a half-mile inside. KORCZAK vied briefly outside the winner leaving the chute, got shaken off on the
turn and retreated. QUALITY ON TAP dropped far back after a half, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
HAPPY LOUDON sped to the front and cleared inside early, shook off a bid from SUGAR BOLT turning for home, and was driving to hold on. HERA got
bumped between horses at the start and was off slow, moved up around the turn three wide, had aim through the drive and edged closer outside the winner
to the finish. TRUE HEIRESS broke out, saved ground improving position after three-eighths of a mile, rallied between horses through mid stretch and kept
on willingly. SUGAR BOLT was outsprinted to the top by HAPPY LOUDON, challenged from outside approaching the quarter-pole, got shaken off into the
lane and weakened. ROYAL JEWEL saved ground throughout, and lacked a final response. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT was bumped between horses at the start
and off slow, came five wide off the turn and passed tired horses. TAKE THE OVER was no factor four wide. FAITH N HOPE came four wide off the turn,
and made no impact. MANDAMUS chased three then four wide to the end of the turn, and tired through the lane. SILVER TUNES was bumped into
TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT by FOXY LADY at the start, and could not keep up by midway on the turn. FOXY LADY hit the left side of the gate and bumped
SILVER TUNES at the start, steadied along getting shuffled back early on the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
DREAMIN OF SEVILLE got bumped by FIRST IN LINE at the start, closed in on INACEPTABLE around the far turn, poked a head in front outside that foe
just after completing six furlongs, battled inside MOUNTAIN BREEZE through the stretch and gamely prevailed. MOUNTAIN BREEZE raced three wide,
advanced outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, dueled outside DREAMIN OF SEVILLE through a long drive and could not get by. IAMBUTTER
saved ground to the far turn, moved out two or three wide after six furlongs, and finished willingly. EXPRESS BOY broke out, dropped inside before the first
turn, angled wide well back approaching the stretch, and improved without threatening. INACEPTABLE set an ambitious pace inside for six furlongs, and
gave way. FIRST IN LINE broke out bumping DREAMIN OF SEVILLE at the start, entered the first turn strung out five wide, and passed tired horses late.
SKYLINE VIEW raced three to four wide, and failed to become a factor. D'GUAPO chased after the pacesetter to the far turn, and tired after six furlongs.
BIG TREASURE was four wide into the first turn, and never reached contention. ALPERES broke three lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and was
always outrun. FUEGO lacked room and steadied in tight between horses on the first turn, and tired.
