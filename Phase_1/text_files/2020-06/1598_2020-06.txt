TALK NICE pressed the early pace, gained command through the far turn, dug in in the upper stretch to retake the lead and held gamely late while racing
along the inside under strong handling. MINEWELLRECEIVED stalked the pace, raced three wide at the quarter pole, moved up two wide through the
stretch drive and finished second best. CHICA DIFISEL showed good early speed while saving ground and weakened through the stretch. MACHITA settled
off the early pace, raced three deep at the eighth pole and never was a factor. BLAZING RUBY was slow early and never was involved. MALIBU RUN
settled off the early pace, was pulled up down the backstretch and had to be vanned off.

J'S FLASHY HALO pressed the early pace, took command nearing the far turn, raced in the three path through the stretch and was clear under steady

the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. BEST BUD was slow early, saved ground throughout and never was a factor. GILDED DRAMA was hustled

Footnotes
HIGH CLASS PLAYER stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn into the lane and finished well to be clear late under strong
encouragement. GET BACK HOME was slow early, moved up five wide into the stretch and finished second best. DREAMINOFDASIES was unhurried
early, raced towards the inside, angled four wide in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. VUYELWA dropped back early, raced in traffic nearing the
eighth pole, found a clear path while racing three wide and finished willingly late. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE settled early, saved ground and had not enough
late. LITTLE MS BROADWAY stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and weakened a bit late. MAIDU raced five wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. RUNNING GIRL stalked the leader, raced three deep and failed to sustain a bid. MYSTIC MOON stalked the early pace, was fanned
seven wide into the stretch and never threatened. ONE SHOT showed good early speed, was getting out in the early stages down the backstretch and tired.
The official race time and internal fractions were hand timed.

MANCORA stalked the pace, moved up along the inside around the turn into the lane and finished well to be clear in the final stages under steady handling.
ADONAI BLESS was unhurried early, saved ground throughout and finished well late to finish second best. LANGUE LIEE stalked the early pace, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW dropped back early, moved up five wide into the lane and never was a
factor. MARDI GRAS GIRL broke awkwardly, stalked early, raced four wide at the eighth and never threatened. WEST HORIZEN was slow early, raced six
wide through the lane and never was a factor. TORNERO set all the pace while racing along the inside and gave way. RETURN THE FAVOR failed to
sustain a bid.

ELLA'S ISLAND set all the pace while racing along the inside down the backstretch, raced three wide through the lane and held gamely under strong
encouragement. DONNAMEUP stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside to challenge in the upper stretch and finished second best. NOSTALGIA
was allowed to settle early, angled to the inside at the quarter pole and finished willingly while continuing to race along the inside. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW
tracked the leader while racing two wide, raced in the three path through the stretch and weakened a bit late. BELLABOO hesitated at the break, was slow
in the early stages, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. BUSINESSINDUBAI settled off the early pace, raced three deep in the
lane and never was a factor. TIDAL FIELD dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened. TRINNI SUNSET failed to have a response. TRAP
GIRL failed to sustain a bid. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR raced far back, was eased up on to be distanced and walked off the track under her own power.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT stalked the early pace, moved up wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. CASPIAN TALE hopped at the
break, stalked the pace, raced five wide through the lane and finished gamely late. I DREAM OF LOIS stalked in the early stages, angled to inside down the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn into the lane and finished willingly to the wire. BIG ANGEL was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and showed good late interest. ASHLEY'S ROSE tracked the leader while racing just off the inside, raced three deep in the lane and weakened a bit
in the latter stages. CROWN OF JOY was slow early, raced towards the inside and had not enough late. ALLURING APPROVAL broke awkwardly, was
rushed to to take the early lead, was well clear down the backstretch and was empty in the latter stages. LAPULGA was slow early, raced five wide around
the first turn and never was a factor. EYERISH INSPIRED raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CHOLLA dropped back early and
failed to have a response.
