Footnotes
SHIRL'S READY went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide later on that
bend, swung six wide into the stretch, unleashed a furious rally under a left-handed whip into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up under strong
handling. HEAT FLASH went three to four wide on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch to contest the pace, vied in the three path on the far turn,
moved clear nearing the three-sixteenths then came under a drive while the girth strap came loose and dangled in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth
but was overtaken with the girth strap still hanging down but was clear for the place. LAWLESS WEST went around the first turn in the three path, contested
the pace outside of a rival then inside of the runner-up starting around the five-eighths, moved to the inside into the far turn, dropped back nearing the
three-sixteenths, came out under a drive nearing the furlong marker and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. BO TEE bumped with rivals on both
sides shortly after the start, became keen off heels under stout restraint into the first turn, went two to three wide under a hold on that bend, was rated more
kindly on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path, was roused near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick then just missed the
trifecta. MAV MASTER was hustled from the start, contested the pace while inside to the two path on the first turn, dropped back inside the five-eighths,
saved ground on the far turn, passed the quarter-pole under restraint then was asked at the three-sixteenths, came under a drive with a clear rail opening in
upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. YOUVESAIDITALL went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside,
was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, angled out significantly in the vicinity of the furlong marker and
gained late but failed to seriously threaten. MR. NICKELS went four wide on the first turn, dropped in while settling mid-field on the backstretch, rounded the
far turn in the two path, was asked while three wide into the stretch, raced behind foes under urging into the final furlong and lacked the needed response.
THRASHER bumped with a rival just after the start, raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, settled towards the rear while inside of
two foes, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground for most of the far turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch
then steadied behind horses, moved out near the furlong marker then drifted out and also lacked the needed response. KILLEEN went five wide on the first
turn, was rated just off the pace, traveled three wide around the far turn, was asked late on that bend, chased into the final furlong and came up empty. RED
ZENON went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside then came under urging before the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the far turn
and capitulated. WOULDA COULDA DID bumped with a rival at the start, went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor.

Footnotes
M AND M GIRL was well placed behind the vanguard, drafted two to three wide under restraint on the turn, was asked when a hole opened up wide at the
top of the stretch, accelerated to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a left-handed whip into the final furlong then powered away under
steady urging. TOP HAT CHARMER disputed the pace between horses, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked while in front into the
stretch then headed by the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. BREW CASA was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside,
steadied at the three-eighths and dropped off the pace, saved ground on the turn, took awkward strides against the rail and steadied inside the quarter-pole,
moved off the rail under a drive near the furlong marker and got up for the show. WICKED EKATI was hustled from the start, showed speed between
horses, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide under urging on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. WIDDLE GIANT broke out and bumped with a rival, was coaxed along off the pace, steadied while taking awkward strides in a crowded space
between horses into the turn, went four then five wide under strong urging on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. OKIE TOAST was
last away, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, made a bid passing the quarter-pole, was carried five wide into the stretch and tired.
FAST DOWN THE LANE bumped with a rival at the start then was sent hard, disputed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn,
spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under steady urging. CONGRATS GIRL tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn,
took the lead outside the three-sixteenths, came under a drive into upper stretch, drifted out while clear coming to the furlong marker, had the rider fumble
his whip then catch the whip by pinning it against the shoulder of his horse, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match
while just able to hold the place. WITTS QUESTION was urged along in third position, saved ground on the turn, paused behind the leading duo outside the
three-sixteenths, moved out while put to a drive into upper stretch and finished with good courage to just miss the place but was able to get the show.

stretch then was put to a left-handed whip and flattened out. LAURA BELLE broke out a bit, showed good speed, moved in while going clear early,
remained clear in the two path on the turn, was challenged nearing the quarter-pole, lost the lead while asked coming to the three-sixteenths and gave way.
DARE TO BE STORMY broke out then was taken up, raced off the pace under some urging, was taken up behind horses around the seven-sixteenths,
saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. BLUEGRASS DIXIE broke out at the start, was ridden along near the back on the outside, went seven then
six wide early on the turn, dropped to five wide late on that bend then four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. FAMILY CAMEO broke in and bumped
hard with a rival, was urged along off the pace, dropped back while three wide on the turn, moved out inside the furlong marker and failed to respond.
FUNKY JUSTICE broke out and bumped hard with a foe then nearly unseated the rider, had the rider regain his spot in the saddle after dangling over the
right side, settled under some urging, dropped back fast on the turn and was pulled up then vanned off while reported to have bled.

Footnotes
ROCK THE DEVIL was bumped on both sides at the start, moved in while establishing a good position down the backstretch, advanced inside on the turn
then inherited the lead from the wayward pacesetter inside the five-sixteenths, drifted out when put to a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a
right-handed whip while clear coming to the furlong marker, swapped leads back and forth outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging.
MAINTAINANCE MATT broke a step slow, was urged along towards the back, advanced in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch, came out
approaching the furlong marker then bumped with a rival and finished willingly for the place. SOURNOIS was corrected with the left rein at the start, raced
on the outside near the back under urging, was caught seven to eight wide on the turn, gained outside in the final furlong and finished with good courage to
get the show. RUSTY CAGE was hustled to the lead, lugged out while setting the pace, was guided around the turn under heavy left-rein pressure while five
then six wide, relinquished the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch, chased on his inside lead into the final furlong and was
out-kicked. JEGGYJEGGY broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch,
was bumped nearing the furlong marker and came up empty. ON TILT bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the far outside, was carried six
to seven wide on the turn, chased into the final furlong, had his path taken while weakening late and capitulated. MY TRUE REWARD was a bit reluctant to
load, dropped back while urged along, rounded the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail while put to the whip in upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL GEM showed good speed, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked when confronted by the runner-up early on the turn, dueled with that foe
under a drive into the final furlong, disposed of that opponent into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. LIL RED VETTE broke out at the
start, was urged along on the far outside, advanced leaving the backstretch, made a five wide bid early on the turn, dropped to four then three wide while
outside of the winner later on that bend, dueled with that foe under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. FRUHL'N
AROUND chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, was driven into upper stretch and weakened but held the show. DREAMIN TIGER was
ridden along towards the rear, went three to four wide early on the turn, moved to five wide inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back to the four path into the
stretch then drifted further in and improved position. SKYLAR'S WAY chased the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under
a drive and lacked the needed response. PRIMARY PAULA settled off the pace, angled in late on the backstretch, was roused in the two path early on the
turn, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker and failed to rally.
RIKKI'S GIFT chased the pace, dropped back passing the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn and retreated. NAPA CAB showed no speed while
ridden along, went five to six wide on the turn and was no factor. LAURAS CENTRALBANK was sent hard from the start then urged along on the inside of a
rival, dropped back while four wide on the turn and faltered. OUR LIL RASCAL broke a step slow, was ridden along towards the rear, saved ground on the
turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GOVERNALE broke out then was corrected by the rider and hustled, saved ground while well placed just off the pace, drafted behind the leader while along
the rail on the final turn, was asked in the two path while given room at the three-sixteenths, rallied to the lead just inside the furlong marker, disposed of
BANDIT SWANSON into the final sixteenth then was quickly encountered by the runner-up and held gamely under strong urging. SEATTLE SOUL angled in
early, went four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly but missed while clear for the place. BANDIT SWANSON went to the front, moved clear in the two
path under restraint on the first turn, set an uncontested pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn then roused for more at the quarter-pole, turned into
the stretch under the whip, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while
able to get the show. DA GOLD ROOM went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, steadied behind
horses at the three-sixteenths then dropped to the inside while roused just before the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the last spot in the
superfecta. BATTLESHIP BEVO bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under urging late on the
backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CARPE EROS went around the
first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, passed the eighth-pole in the
two path under the whip and also lacked the needed response. INTO ORBIT went five then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch and tired. TAPSOLUTION went three wide on the first
turn, settled just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the far turn, came under urging outside the quarter-pole then moved to the three path, was
kept in behind a rival turning into the stretch and had nothing left. GOLIATH RIDGE was taken under a tight hold early, raced inside early on the first turn
then moved to the two path, lagged at the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor.
MAX PANDOWDY went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn then carried seven wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. CASCADE KING bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped to the rail ,
settled near the back, dropped to the rear in the two to three path on the far turn and showed little. FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER
