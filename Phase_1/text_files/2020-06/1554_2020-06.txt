FLAP JACK was well placed, on the inside, angled out off the rail at the quarter pole, drew off late under steady urging. FOX ON THE RUN set the pace
with a clear lead, was no match late for the winner but was second best. ATTUCK was well placed, and saved ground, angled out in the stretch and failed to
mount a bid. DISCLOSURE was off slowly and passed tired rivals while no threat. FRITTONS GOLD had no early speed and was no factor. SUPER
VALENTINE pressed three wide and was through after a half. NOBLE BEHAVIOR had brief foot, and gave way. GOD'S WILL BE DONE was outrun.

Footnotes
CHIEF RANDEL was fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke alertly, stalked the pace for six furlongs, rallied three wide to engage the leaders on the
second turn, dueled until deep stretch and shook clear late under left handed urging. LIBERATE broke well, dropped inside, set the pace around the
clubhouse turn two wide, took back and shifted outside of BETCHAIWILL before a half, drew on even terms for the lead two wide nearing the far turn,
dueled until deep stretch and was no match for the winner. BETCHAIWILL bore in at the start bumping IT'S OFFCIAL, rushed to the lead two wide, dropped
to the rail before a half, set the pace into the far turn, dueled briefly then faded. OHIO EAGLE failed to menace. ONE CRAZY RIDE was in tight at the start
then failed to menace. IT'S OFFICIAL was bumped at the start, remained a forward factor for six furlongs then gave way. BLANDA trailed. THE RIDER OF
LIBERATE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW
THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DEAN MARTINI broke alertly and battled for the lead along the rail into the clubhouse turn, dropped back a bit, came back through the inside after a half, set
the balance of the pace, shook clear in upper stretch and lasted under right handed urging. SOUTH BEND unhurried for six furlongs, closed steadily outside
rivals, surged five wide through the final furlong and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late while clear for second. STORM THE COURT vied
for the lead four then three wide the entire trip and finished with good courage. ROWDY YATES contested the lead two wide through the clubhouse turn,
maintained strong pressure while saving ground into the stretch then finished evenly. SPRAWL broke outward, was allowed to settle, offered a mild bid in
the four path into the stretch then leveled off. LEBDA battled for the lead three then two wide into the second turn then gradually weakened. ROGUE
ELEMENT trailed through the far turn then passed tiring rivals. UNRIGHTEOUS with the second flight four wide, failed to offer the needed response.
INFORMATIVE broke a step slow and was no factor. BEAR ALLEY was brushed at the start then through after a half. CODE RUNNER broke inward
brushing BEAR ALLEY and was outrun. ESTABLISHED vied for the lead three wide and was through after a half. DACK JANIEL'S with the second flight
three wide for four and one half furlongs flattened out.
