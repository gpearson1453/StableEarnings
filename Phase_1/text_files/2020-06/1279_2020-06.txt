Footnotes
PEKA showed good speed after breaking alertly, dropped back inside the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the three path, rallied four wide into the
stretch, closed well on the inside of the runner-up to make a bid at the eighth-pole, drifted out a bit while battling gamely with that foe in the final furlong and
prevailed under strong urging. GRAY ZONE moved out while urged along in the back half of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied five wide
into the stretch, closed strongly outside of the winner to make a bid at the eighth-pole, battled outside that foe while being carried out a bit in the final furlong
and missed while clear for the place. MOM'S PASS was ridden along near the back on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then was carried five
wide, dropped to four wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong, was carried out outside the sixteenth-pole and reached her best stride too late while
up for the show. AWESOME GALAXY disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path while inside of a foe on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, battled into the final furlong and weakened. SLINGSHOTSLEW was hustled from the start, dropped back under urging nearing the
seven-sixteenths, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, dropped in inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. SCATTERED
MIST disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong, drifted out
outside the furlong marker and tired. MY MONEY HONEY was in tight briefly early, raced under stout restraint while inside of a rival at the rear, went three
wide while given some free rein on the turn, moved out under the whip around the furlong marker and failed to rally. WITTS QUESTION showed good
speed, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, dropped back while taken up early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and had nothing left. FUNKY
JUSTICE was hustled from the start then taken up briefly near the half-mile pole, went five to six wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
IMPASSION was hustled from the start then ridden along in second position, gained on the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage inside
the quarter-pole, drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch then was switched to a right-handed whip, responded well in the final furlong and drew
clear under strong urging. KEEP AMERICA GREAT was ridden along on the inside, gained in the four path on the turn, made a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths, was carried out some by the winner in upper stretch, drifted in behind that foe outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while well
clear for the place. BROADWAY BURN was ridden along off the pace, raced between horses passing the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the turn,
was driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. ALOHA DREAMER was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
raced off the pace while urged along, was taken in hand while moving up near the half-mile pole then came back under urging, rounded the turn in the two
path and lacked the needed response. LAURA BELLE showed good speed and set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path, was headed by the
winner inside the quarter-pole and faded. CONGRATS GIRL was urged along while off the pace, saved ground on the turn and faltered. GOLDED SILVER
was off slow and spotted the front many lengths, drifted out while falling well behind, moved in leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two
path and trailed. Following the race, the rider of KEEP AMERICA GREAT claimed foul against IMPASSION for alleged interference in the stretch. After the
stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish.

GREAT AFFECTION came out in front then darted quickly towards the inside, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside that foe while along the
rail on the turn, fought on even terms for the lead into the final furlong, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. STILL OF
THE NIGHT showed speed from the outside, disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two to three path on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the whip, clung to a narrow advantage into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to hold the place.
NOT ENOUGH BLING chased the leading duo from third, went around the turn in the three to four path, loomed a major threat late on that bend, ducked out
six wide at the top of the stretch then swerved about and weakened while racing very greenly but held the show. BEBOP BABY ducked in at the start,
steadied briefly inside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then angled out more and finished with interest while
improving position for the last spot in the superfecta. THATSALOTOFBLING was bumped at the start and forced in, raced towards the back under urging,
went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. REBECCA'S MUSIC was urged along on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn and tired.
BLING ON THE LIGHT veered in at the start and bumped with a rival, was urged along near the rear, went four wide on the turn, ducked out seven wide at
the top of the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CARLOS SIXES prompted the pace on the inside of three foes, was asked to move up coming to the seven-sixteenths then took the advantage, vied along
the rail on the far turn, shook clear into the stretch, drew away under the whip until just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the
wire while much the best. CANADIAN GAME went around the first turn in the three to four path, moved up to contest the pace, vied in the three path under
urging on the far turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. HOUR CITY went four wide on the
first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response
while just able to get the show. GHOSTLY WHO was caught in the five to six path on the first turn, raced just behind the vanguard under some restraint,
was asked in the two path early on the far turn, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. TAPITOR
broke a step slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, was urged along on the backstretch, went five wide under strong urging on the far turn, floated
seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. G'S TURN went around the first turn in the four to five path, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back
under urging while four to five wide on the far turn and capitulated. SMACK RIDGE went two to three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, traveled around the far turn in the two path and failed to respond. MOMENT was hustled to the front, dropped from
the three to the two path on the first turn, set the pace with company to both sides, lost the lead inside the seven-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path
on the far turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
MISTER KELLY bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, moved closer in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the
three-sixteenths, shook clear under a drive into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. ROBO was urged along early then taken in hand near
the half-mile pole, went two then three wide on the turn, was carried six wide into the stretch and improved position to garner the place. SANGIO VASY was
fractious behind the gate, showed good speed and set the pace, was guided around the turn with extra left-rein pressure, lost the lead at the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. COWBOY RIDGE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along
off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. IM JUSTA BACHELOR settled towards the rear,
bobbled inside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NO
QUARTER bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and also
lacked the needed kick. REMEMBER ME TONY broke a half-step slow then was hustled, settled near the back, steadied around the half-mile pole, went
four to five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path into the stretch and failed to threaten. END ZONE broke out and bumped with a foe, raced just off the
pace under urging while inside of the winner, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. RAGING
MOON was unsettled in the gate then broke out and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and
was no factor. SAILOR CHOW dropped back between horses under restraint, drifted from three to six wide on the turn and was pulled up but walked off.

lead, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SINGING ACES broke out and a step slow, was urged along on the
outside, went four to five wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed well to make an outside bid near the eighth-pole, battled with the winner in
the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. BETA JET moved up to race just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, idled behind the
leader passing the quarter-pole, was urged in the two path into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the
show. GET THE BLING was ridden along towards the rear, went five wide on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and improved
position. PUMPVILLE settled under some urging, steadied near the three-eighths, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FEARLESS

and was no factor. WHITE WALLS was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path into the stretch, drifted in near the
furlong marker and failed to respond. GRAND BLING broke out at the start, showed good speed then moved clear midway down the backstretch, vied inside
