Footnotes
SHIFT THE BLAME sprinted to a clear lead on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, came through inside to retake a short lead and
drove clear late. RICKY RUN well placed and three wide, took command through the second turn on that path, then weakened in the stretch drive and was
no match for the winner. EL DUQUE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to the three path into the stretch and closed well for the
show. ODESSA GOLD tracked the pace, angled out three and four wide through the second turn and flattened out in the lane. IMPERIAL GREATNESS ran
evenly for three quarters and had no stretch rally. MORO DRAMA passed a tiring rival. DISTINCTLY BREWED stalked the pace between and faded down
the backstretch.

Footnotes
FLEDERMAUS, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted in disputing the issue inside foes into the far turn, dueled for command
into upper stretch, edged clear under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. AMERICA'S SIMMARD switched off the inside tracking just off the
first flight between foes, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. DONNIE BRASCO,
unhurried while caught four wide racing to the backstretch, steadily advance on the leaders in that path racing into the far turn, shifted inwards on the
second bend pressing the issue outside the eventual winner but weakened in the drive. CPL. DIONICIO, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the
leaders, briefly pressed the issue between foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight, shifted out three wide after a half but offered no rally. BIG YES, urged disputing the pace inside the eventual winner from the outset
into the backstretch, steadily faded into the far turn. PRISON PADRE dropped out early.

HALL RICH LEGACY was urged to gain the lead inside rivals from the outset, went well clear racing into the stretch and widened under a steady drive. DR
PARKER, forwardly placed three deep leading the second flight, continued in pursuit of the winner to the stretch but proved no match while best of the
others. HANDSOME EFFORT tracked the leaders between foes and continued well enough to prevail for a share late. SILVER SUN worked his way to the
inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn but had no rally. TEXAS STORM broke awkwardly while brushing the gate, was urged inside rivals
pursuing the leader into the turn but gave way into the lane. CAKE AND EAT IT TO tracked the leaders outside foes and soon faded. FORMAL TREASURE

Footnotes
STARSHIP REINA, forwardly placed along the inside stalking the pacesetter, switched off the inside entering upper stretch to bid for command between
foes, quickly took charge and went clear under pressure. ITSHERLUCKYDAY, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight, shifted four wide nearing
upper stretch to bid for command in that path entering the lane, couldn't match the winner but edged a rival for the place honors. PRINCESS LIVIA,
forwardly placed three wide, shifted inwards to lodge a bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. SOLD ON SALSA sprinted to the lead, angled in once
gaining the advantage, dictated the pace to upper stretch but weakened once headed by the winner. WINNING QUALITY broke outwards bumping
ITSHERLUCKYDAY, was guided to the rail tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn and lacked a rally. DANGEROUS CURVES
ducked out at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders four wide on the backstretch but gave way nearing the lane. LADY NOY dropped out
early.

Footnotes
COLONELS DAUGHTER, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn, steadily gained contention racing three
deep between foes into the lane, lugged in a bit under pressure, came under some correction midstretch but was righted, then just edged PATIENT DIGNA
in the final stages while exchanging light contact with that rival to prevail under some right handed pressure. The latter tracked the pacesetter outside foes in
second flight to the backstretch, shifted inwards a half while being prompted to commence a steady advance, drew on terms to challenge the pacesetter in
tandem with the winner midstretch but was outkicked while exchanging some light contact nearing the wire. ALLURING APPROVAL sprinted clear while
angling over racing to the first turn, held sway on a commanding advantage to upper stretch but faltered late. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY tracked off the second
flight between foes to the backstretch and continued evenly into the lane. THUMP tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was caught
four wide racing through the far turn and offered no rally. EYERISH INSPIRED tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight and faded after a half.
COTTON TOOYAH, urged to a forward placing between foes leading the second flight on a narrow margin to the backstretch, shifted out three wide after a
half and came up empty racing into the far turn.

DREAMS OF SHIRLEY sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail in the opening quarter, dueled for command inside a rival into the stretch and edged
clear late under right handed pressure. SILVER NINA was urged to force the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, dueled between foes nearing the
turn, continued to press the issue outside the winner past mid stretch but came up second best. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW, urged to contention along the
inside early, tracked off the first flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the turn and gained a share racing into the lane while making
an even effort. MY BLONDE MARY settled along the inside in the opening stages, swung four wide entering the stretch and made an effort to improve
position. TURBOTIGER broke slowly and failed to menace thereafter. DEESSE, bumped by PLAY THE MAX at the start, settled between foes and proved
no threat. PLAY THE MAX stumbled at the start, then bumped DEESE while righting himself, was hustled to contend three deep between foes racing
through the backstretch but emptied out early. HER ZEALOUS ducked out at the start, was urged to terms with the first flight four wide prompting the pace
through the backstretch but was spent early.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN CAL shifted in gaining a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, conceded some position to that foe nearing the
backstretch, continued with a steady bid to wrest command racing into the far turn, then came under stout pressure leaving midstretch to turn back a
challenge from JUAN PABLO and edged clear in the final sixteenth. The latter raced unhurried while angling inside tracking behind the second flight to the
backstretch, continued along the rail briefly awaiting an opening midway through the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid along the rail entering upper
stretch to loom briefly inside the eventual winner but was outkicked. FADE AWAY, bumped at the start, settled into stride, came around foes racing into the
far turn to lodge a three wide bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering the lane. SPEAKERIT tracked the leader outside foes as part of the second
flight racing to the backstretch, then faded between foes on the far turn. BIG RIG tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and offered no
rally. FALSE INFO broke outwards bumping FADE AWAY, was quickly righted, then urged setting the pace on a clear margin along the inside to the

Footnotes
CHANNELED'S ANGEL broke readily, was urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening quarter, dictated terms on a narrow advantage
through the bend, then turned back a challenge from MERMAID KISSES racing into upper stretch and went clear under steady pressure. The latter,
forwardly placed along the rail, stalked the pacesetter along the inside racing into the turn, was urged through close quarters to bid inside the leader entering
upper stretch, was steadied slightly while shifting out of tight quarters entering the lane and couldn't regain even terms with the winner. SUZIE ITS YOU,
urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way in the drive. C. A. C. CHAQUIRA, forwardly placed four wide, then
three wide entering the turn while prompted in pursuit of the leader, gave way into the lane. ROMANTIC GIZMO bobbled while ducking in slightly at the
start, tracked the leaders between foes, then angled to the inside on the turn, shifted out entering the lane and improved position between foes late.
SHARPERTHANME, carried in at the start, settled along the inside early and failed to menace. MONJA made brief pursuit of the leaders three deep
between foes but gave way early. FEBRUARYSEXCLUSIVE tracked the leaders between foes from just out of striking distance to the turn and steadily
faded into the lane. THEY CALL ME LUCKY, unhurried outside foes in the opening stages, was caught four wide racing into the turn while being prompted
to advance but soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MERMAID KISSES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
