Footnotes
BELLAS FELLA saved ground well back for six furlongs, began moving along the rail turning for home, came off the inside 70 yards out and was up at the
wire between horses. MOZANO bumped with CONSILIUM at the start, advanced four wide after six furlongs, rallied outside through mid stretch, reached
the front late and just missed. ELITE MISSION set the pace pressed from both flanks up the backstretch, shook off his pursuers clearing inside around the
turn, maintained a healthy advantage through most of the stretch, but yielded in the final yards. BULKCARRIER stayed in range three wide to the stretch,
and finished evenly on the far outside. CONSILIUM lost his footing and bumped with MOZANO at the start, raced well back to the stretch and passed tired
horses. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ pressed the early pace along the inside, weakened on the turn, and faded through the lane on his left lead. DRACARYS
FIRE pressed the pace outside for six furlongs, and gave way. GUYS WAIT ON ME hit the left side of the gate and veered in at the start, and was far back
throughout. SPLENDID STONE retreated around the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALLGORILLA established an even pace inside, widened the lead into the stretch, and remained well clear on his left lead under light pressure. CHAOS KID
tugged anxiously inside early, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and was along outside rivals for the place. SUN SQUALL raced in the two-path
virtually throughout, and was up between horses for third. ST JOE VIPER prompted the pace three wide to the stretch, and lacked a rally. GRAN HOMBRE
prompted the pace outside ALLGORILLA to the stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. BLESS THE KITTEN was never in the hunt.
CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was a step slow from the gate, moved up inside heading to the turn, rallied determinedly along the rail through the final furlong
and was up late. FORT KING set the pace in the two-path, remained clear past the eighth-pole, but was overhauled from the inside. SLICK STAR chased
outside FORT KING from the start, and was inching closer outside the top two finishers near the wire. JETTIN OUT bumped with FREDDY SOTO at the
start, was four wide under a drive outside the quarter-pole, and could not threaten with an even finish. DUBLIN TINKER raced in the second flight toward the
inside, and failed to menace. BABA TOBI was outrun four wide for a half-mile, lugged in under right-hand pressure through upper stretch, had the rider drop
the whip just outside the eighth-pole and made no headway. FREDDY SOTO bumped with JETTIN OUT at the start, and trailed inside.

Footnotes
DINNER AT FIVE raced close up inside for three furlongs, moved out at the top of the stretch, rallied between horses through the furlong grounds and wore
down SHEZ STUCK UP from outside. SHEZ STUCK UP dueled inside STRAND DE ORO early, shook that rival off on the turn, remained clear past the
furlong marker, and yielded grudgingly. AUNT IRENE advanced between horses on the turn, loomed outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, had the
rider lose the whip near the eighth-pole, and finished evenly. BORROWED ANGEL raced between rivals in the two-path on the turn, and finished evenly.
HECHIZADA came four wide off the turn, and passed tired horses outside. PRINCESS LACIE was a step slow at the start, saved ground on the turn, and
improved position while never a factor. WATER WIZARD bumped with SYLLABUS at the start, moved inside heading into the turn, stayed in midpack to the
stretch, and faded. SYLLABUS bumped with WATER WIZARD at the start, tracked three wide early, retreated around the turn and into the stretch, and
bumped with STRAND DE ORO late. STRAND DE ORO pressed the early pace outside SHEZ STUCK UP, steadied unable to hold her spot just past the
quarter-pole, and bumped with SYLLABUS late. WICKY trailed every step of the way.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER was a step slow at the start, rushed up in tight quarters on the rail early, waited behind the leaders around the turn, slipped through inside
SAY ADIOS to take over nearing the eighth-pole and drove clear. HARPER GO LUCKY raced four then five wide around the turn, had aim outside through
the lane, and finished willingly to go clear of the others. SAY ADIOS broke to the lead, dueled inside MAGNOLIA BLVD while slightly off the rail, faced
challenges from both flanks a furlong out, and yielded. MAGNOLIA BLVD pressed SAY ADIOS from outside to the stretch, and weakened between horses.
EL ZEUS gave chase three then four wide for a half-mile, and weakened in the drive. HERO OF THE FUTURE was no factor two wide. TRAVELIN
GAMBLER was outrun five wide. SHANGHAI LEVI was always well back.

Footnotes
MISS MAC bumped with HONEST GAL at the start, advanced rapidly around the turn, joined the leaders four wide at the top of the stretch, and drew off
under a drive. SOCIALLY ASTRAY raced just behind the three-way pace dispute on the turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, could not kick on
with the winner but dug in through the late stages inside DIXIELAND HUMOR for the place. DIXIELAND HUMOR was a step slow at the start, came five
wide rallying off the turn, and was edged outside SOCIALLY ASTRAY for second. MYSTIC COMIN HOME dueled for the lead inside RITA OF CASCIA and
ANOTHERSONGNDANCE, put them away at the top of the stretch, but could not hold off the late challengers. MARVA was no factor two wide.
ANOTHERSONGNDANCE contested the pace outside rivals, and faded after a half-mile. QUEEN KANTHAROS was outrun five wide. TOONIE LOONIE
was always outrun. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN was slow from the gate, and outrun inside. LOOKING FOR MORE broke out and was slow to begin, and
remained well back. RITA OF CASCIA dueled up front between horses for a half, and had nothing left. HONEST GAL became fractious in the gate
unseating the rider, bumped with MISS MAC at the start, steadied between horses early, and was through after a half four wide.

ALLEGEDLY PERFECT bumped solidly with MUKULWITZ at the start, tracked inside around the turn, came off the rail finding a seam in upper stretch,
overtook HENRY'S WORLD from outside, and held REMASTER at bay late. REMASTER (IRE) raced two wide on the turn, moved out for the drive and
finished well outside the winner. HENRY'S WORLD sped to the front early, showed the way slightly off the rail to the stretch, and weakened in the last
eighth of a mile. MUKULWITZ took the worst of a hard bump with ALLEGEDLY PERFECT and was off behind the field, came three wide nearing the stretch,
and gained mildly. SEA LOVER pressed the pace outside HENRY'S WORLD, and faded through the stretch. LEGENDARY PRINCE chased outside the
leaders for three-eighths of a mile, and tired.

Footnotes
PANAREA sat just outside the early leaders, took over three wide outside I'M A ROCKSTAR with five-sixteenths remaining, and drove clear through the
stretch. BEASAICHI raced three wide around the turn, and was up late outside I'M A ROCKSTAR for the place. I'M A ROCKSTAR got the best of an early
dispute outside HIFALUTIN, got overtaken late on the turn by PANAREA, changed leads awkwardly while giving way past the eighth-pole, and lost second
late. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was under a drive by midway on the turn, came widest into the stretch and improved for a share. SMITTEN FOR SMITTY tired
through a four-wide trip. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN broke slowly, moved up approaching the turn, and stopped after completing a half-mile. HIFALUTIN
dueled early inside I'M A ROCKSTAR, yielded on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

COVE cleared off heading to the turn, faced challengers from both sides through the furlong grounds, and was able to save the place. ZIP IT JESS steadied
early off POSEIDONS PRINCESS, moved off the inside around the turn, had aim in the four-path a furlong out, and finished one-paced. IMA DAREDEVIL
chased outside the pacesetter through the turn, lodged a bid in upper stretch three wide, and was outfinished. PRINCESS AVRIL raced three wide on the
turn, and lacked the needed late response. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB slammed into the right side of the gate and was off slowly, cut the corner into the
stretch, and could not menace. MISS CHLOE G broke slowly, was outrun to the stretch, and passed only tired horses. KATNISS KAN was outrun three
wide. POSEIDONS PRINCESS drifted five wide fading late on the turn, and dropped back continuing to drift out in the stretch. BELLA BIONDA raced wide
and was outrun. LUCKY MILADY was slow from the gate, and always well back. GREY MANNERS broke slowly, raced four wide on the turn, and dropped
far back.
