VALYCOVE tracked duelers to the half, took over and drew clear from the turn and through the stretch run. MANSOOR loped along just behind leaders to
far turn, past the the quarter pole with a four wide bid for the place spot TERMINAL SPEED secured the rail at the half, angled three wide out of the far turn
with a late bid but hung in the late stages. LIZZY'S LURE dueled to the half but used up and gave in thereafter. CAPTAIN KITTEN showed speed to duel for
a half and gave way readily thereafter. CROWN TO THE GOLD was never a factor.

WINDY LU WHO quick to the front, dueled to deep stretch and responded to urging to go clear to the wire. NORTHERN JOURNEY just off pace from inside,
angled out for the drive with a bid in the stretch but outfinished and best of the rest. RONNI'S DAY dueled off rail to turn but weakened in the drive with no
response. ABIGAIL LEE bothered a bit at the start, raced back to stretch and only improved late. BISCAYNE BAY raced evenly from off rail throughout with
no late bid. NURSE LIZ through early inside and gave way readily. LIEBCHEN never a menace. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR was outrun.

turn, moved up off rail and was coming on too late. STARLIN saved ground to far turn, ran on late for the show spot while cutting into the gap. AULD CUP
trailed for a half, rallied steadily and improved position late. BORA BORA no speed off rail to far turn and evened out in the stretch run. OSVALDO good
position outside throughout and lacked a late response when needed. FIGHTING FOR GRACE far back to the stretch while never prominent. GRADE good
speed to the half and gave way after three quarters. CAPE MARCO DRIVE never a menace. OBTAINED through after half and dropped back.

Footnotes
A KING'S RANSOM dueled early, lost position far turn, went inside and re-rallied through the stretch to prevail. SMART AND BROKE slow into stride
outside, turned for home widest and was outfinished to the wire. RUN THIS TOWN broke well, lost ground throughout with no late kick in the lane. IT'S
GAME TIME speed to deep stretch but faltered in the final furlong. WINGS UP never a real threat. SWIFTY SAM trailed for three quarters, only improved
position late. BOURBON SHOTTE no speed with a middle move to quarter pole, used up. COMMAND CODE inside speed to the half, gave way readily.
ICE MUSIC had a steady fade. BRONZE MEDAL through after half,dropped back.
