Footnotes
FRIED RICE KING prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, then went clear under a drive to the finish. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT bobbled at the break,
recovered to chase five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
along for the place honors in the final jumps. FULFILL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from a pair
to the outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the
front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. GHOST ON A MISSION chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out,
angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position. ROAD HOME chased three to four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and tired. DROP OF BOURBON lunged slightly at the break, chased along the inside under urging from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, tired in the drive. SEEDISKID two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. CAUSE I SAID SO prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide for home, faltered
in the stretch.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE became a part of the pace scenario in short order, was in path four, vying as the widest of three for over a half, pilot holding
something in reserve all the while, was approaching the three-sixteenths pole when switched over to stronger handling, shifted over closer to the inside
route, felt only one stretch threat during the last eighth and successfully fended that foe off. RADIANTRITHYM away without apparent mishap, departed the
backstretch from the five path, kept an eye on the ongoing pace dispute, flashed interest as the second fraction was being posted, was yet in path five
swinging into the stretch, gained ground in a steadfast manner en route for place honors. PRINCESS MIKAYAH got gradually worked over to the rail on the
backstretch, tracked the front runners spaced at a slight distance from off of it, was moved out four wide for the drive home, narrowed in to get up for the
show. FRIEND OF LIBERTY quickly sent over to the rail, stalked the front runners without benefit of cover, stepped into the lane, lacked a solid closing
punch. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY two wide onto the turn, was fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, never got involved.
COLD HEARTED PEARL initially hustled from the gate, went into the two path, argued for control as the innermost of three until late on the bend, pulling
noticeably on the left, entered the stretch one on one with the winner, was soon shaken off then backed away steadily. DISTINCTIVE LADY remained in the
three path after the start, disputed the pace from between rivals until a short distance from the quarter pole, stepped into the stretch and faltered. OFFLEE
IRISH underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, angled five wide for the drive home, never made her presence felt.

Footnotes
CAT'S PAJAMAS just off the inside in range of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the top pair near the sixteenth marker, dug in and prevailed gamely on the wire. LASHARA (GB) tracked
the pace along the inside before tipping to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
tipped out a path nearing the eighth pole forcing LOGIC N REASON to steadied over the heels of LINNY KATE at that station, offered up late foot closing in
tandem with LINNY KATE to secure the place honors in the final jumps. LINNY KATE unhurried from the start, pulled on the bit under restraint and got
steadied off the heels of LOGIC N REASON and then LASHARA near the seven-eighths marker entering the backstretch, settled two to three wide in pursuit
from the tail of the field, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly knocking heads with the aforementioned foe and was up for the show honors in the final strides. STOLEN HOLIDAY forwardly placed three wide,
attended the leader in closest aim on hold down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive between foes to take narrow command a furlong from home, dug in and was headed near the
sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the late stages. MISS MARISSA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the very late going. LOVE
BEACH tracked the pace along the inside coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied up the inside and
was forced to steady losing the slim clearance to the inside of MISS MARISSA just inside the eighth pole, tipped out and was outkicked to the finish. LOGIC
N REASON two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, had LASHARA tip out in front
nearing the eighth pole and was forced to be taken in hand altering out over the heels of LINNY KATE, then made no late headway through to the finish.

Footnotes
OCEAN FIRE hung out mostly three wide on the chute, cleared over to the inside after assuming the advantage early on the backstretch, was well rated,
ventured outward, eventually winding up in path two for the run around the fuller turn, was feeling an increase in pressure approaching the three-sixteenths
marker when switched over to a ride, held well to prevail. SIMPLY MISS RED took up position in midpack after the start, got steadied as the first fraction
was being finalized after appearing unsettled, temporarily took up residence along the rail, abandoned it for path two long enough to scoot by a weakening
TOURBILLON ROSE on the turn, was back inside in time to cut the corner, roused and having some momentum, narrowed in, made no real progress in the
final furlong but won the battle for second. MORE MANGO well rated taking up the chase towards path two for nearly three-quarters, swung three wide into
the lane and took off in earnest after the winner, failed to slice into the deficit, fought onward, ultimately having to settle for the show. WICKED HAPPY
strung out four wide on the chute and turn, tipped one path farther off the rail for the drive home, straightened away, made no headway in the final furlong.
FLEET STEPPER out a bit at the start, leaned on her next door neighbor for a few jumps, raced from off the inside, travelled from path three on the turn,
was moved out one wider for entrance into the stretch, failed to gain appreciably once beyond the eighth pole. DUPLICATED brushed at the start, took up
the chase four wide on the turn, came slightly wider into the stretch, made no impact. MATADOR MOON three wide heading for the backstretch, tucked
along the rail and drafted behind others during the run leading up to the half mile pole, got steered out two wide at that station, was about as wide stepping
into the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. ROMA CARPE strung out four wide entering the backstretch, prompted the winner from the outside, going
about the task from path three on the turn, kept some pressure on for three-quarters before giving way. HARD WON two wide on the turn, lacked a stretch
response. WANNA BE REGAL three wide early, was along the inside route prior to the end of the backstretch, tipped into path two for the drive home, had
no offering. TOURBILLON ROSE tracked the pace from along the rail, appeared through by the three-eighths pole. SHINE LIKE BOBBY sent over to the rail
early on the backstretch, failed to contend.

out, inched away under a drive kept to task. ROUSEY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming

for the last major share. MOON OVER VICTORIA established the front crossing to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch, dug in drifting out when weakening nearing the eighth

Footnotes
SPIRIT ANIMAL taken hold shying a bit from IAN GLASS at the start, took up residence in midpack, underwent a two wide pursuit, was being roused
spinning four wide into the lane, rolled by the ones to catch after mustering up a strong kick, extended the winning margin, under a hand drive for the
majority of the final sixteenth. MEGACITY three wide on the chute, went on to prompt the pacesetter from path two after stepping onto the backstretch, kept
up the pressure all the way to the end of the fuller bend, challenged in earnest heading home, proved no match once the top one appeared on the scene,
stayed on well to save second. IAN GLASS grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent on its way, got guided over to the inside, showed
the way, shadowed by the runner up to the outside, was put to a drive being put to the test at the quarter pole, yielded for good in midlane then backed
away. CHANNEL ISLAND took the inside route, angled three wide onto the head of the stretch, rallied mildly, appearing to mainly improve position by weak
and tiring ones. UHTRED chased the pace two wide and gave way. RIENDO pinched at the start, brought up the back of the pack during the initial stages,
travelled in the two path making his way on the turn, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane, made no impact. TRICKY MAGICIAN strung out three
wide until the top of the lane, folded. BLACKLINE faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey. TRAVELING raced three wide for the six furlongs, spun
into the lane, protected and with seemingly little left, wandered to the outside fence, managed to walk across the finish line for the final minor slice of the
purse, then after being pulled a few strides later, was subsequently vanned off.

JACK OF CLUBS tracked the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out a path near the
eighth pole forcing MORE LIKE IT to be taken in hand and paused in behind, dug in under a drive rallying to just get up in the last jumps and prevail.
SCUTTLEBUZZ broke a beat slow and lost his lane to rivals, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to miss at the finish. STRIKING CAUSEWAY
brushed the near side stall at the start and came under coaxing to duel from the three path with WALRUS GUMBOOT to his outside, tucked to the rail half a
mile from home, knocked heads through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rebuffing his main pace rival confronted by a pair
and was nailed in the very last jumps. LIAM'S BOY three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WALRUS GUMBOOT dueled from the four path down the backstretch with
STRIKING CAUSEWAY to his inside, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug
in latched on to the eighth pole before being ultimately repelled. MORE LIKE IT three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing in mildly when forced to be taken
in hand and paused as JACK OF CLUBS tipped out in front near the eighth pole, then made no late headway. BOOM BOOM KABOOM hustled from the
gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. RATCHET four then three
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, offered no response. ON THE COUCH broke in at the start brushing
CONSTANT QUEST, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. PERFECT BANKER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and

Footnotes
HONOR WAY at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, travelled three to four wide on the bend, as the widest of all, angled out towards
path five for clearance spinning into the lane, settled into her best stride, closed in readily, struck the front in the final seventy yards and edged away.
FINDING FAME took up the chase from the two path, was ridden four wide into the stretch, narrowed in, inched her way to the inside, split rivals late and
procured the place. FAIR REGIS sat forwardly placed three wide, was worked into path four from upper to midstretch, wore down the leader to lead by a
slim margin inside the eighth pole, got overhauled by the top twosome with well under a sixteenth remaining, stayed on for the show. REGAL RETORT
quickly spotted along the rail, stayed put for the opening half, fanned out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, mustered up a mild response.
GETOUTTAMYWAY guided over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was rated along saving ground on the turn, made it into the
stretch, got maneuvered into path three, came up empty. SADIE LADY established the top shortly after the start, showed the way from just off the rail, was
put to a drive for the drive home, got collared past the eighth pole, then weakened. NISHA prompted the pace from the two path for a half and faltered.
INDY'S LADY hustled from the gate, settled towards the back of the pack, raced towards the inside having been set to a prolonged drive, fell back on the
turn nonetheless, came into the lane and folded.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC chased along the inside patiently handled, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge through the final furlong, took over command inside the sixteenth pole and inched away to the finish kept to task. LISTENTOYOURHEART
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under increasing pressure from a pair through
the turn, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, got collared inside the final sixteenth and was along safe for
the place honors. DREAM BIGGER veered in at the start forcing GANDY DANCING to be briefly taken in hand, chased inside briefly before tipping out to
the four path, tucked three wide through the turn advancing through the latter portion of the bend under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to just secure the show honors over a pair. CITY MAN chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail
nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. THREE JOKERS prompted
the pace four then three wide down the backstretch before taking to the two path through the turn, advanced to get on near even terms with the leader near
the midway point on the bend, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
MISSION WRAPITUP three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
BOURBON BAY chased four then three wide under a ride from midway on the turn, angled four to five wide for home and offered no rally. GANDY
DANCING briefly steadied at the start as DREAM BIGGER veered in, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into
upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
QUIET OUT EAST secured a spot in midpack after the start, was firmly rated keeping watch on the front runners from the two path, got taken outward for
the drive home, eventually winding in the four path, closed in on the leader, snatched away the advantage inside eighth pole, kicked clear, then had enough
left at the end to preserve the decision. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE shot over to the rail, stayed put for nearly three-quarters, was given its cue shifting towards
the five path from upper to midlane, rallied with willingness to be along in time for the place. ALBIE sparred for the top from path two, swung into the stretch
and stayed on well for third. CHANTRY FLATS strung out three wide for most of the journey leading up to the backstretch, tucked into path two once on it,
chased the pace from midpack, well rated, angled three wide into the lane, hesitated making his way through the furlong grounds before being called upon
for its best, made some headway late to earn the last major check. RECKLESS SPIRIT was at or near the inside in pursuit of the front runners, slipped to
the outside as three-quarters was being completed, settled in at the head of the stretch in the two path and was fed his cue, chipped away at the deficit,
altered sharply off the heels of another and back onto the inside route with approximately a sixteenth to go, gained afterwards but on the mild side. BIG
WONDER cut over to the inside with the lead, showed the way, tailed by ALBIE to the outside, was turned loose for the drive home, relinquished for good
with slightly under an eighth remaining and steadily weakened. BROWN EYED BOY saw the pilot grab hold at the start, moved over to the rail, took it until
the top of the lane, angled sharply six wide, failed to fire appreciably after being straightened away. BOB IN OUR MIDST loosely pocketed, faltered. MY
AMANJENA strung out four wide on the chute, was one path closer to the inside on the fuller turn, went into the stretch under a ride, had no offering. FLEET
ADMIRAL three wide and one-paced during the opening phases, never reached a contending position. THENORTHREMEMBERS sighted three wide on the
turn, gave way.
