Footnotes
SUN SUMMERS away in good order, secured the pocket in short order, was well rated keeping watch on the front runners, was forced to bide her time
beginning from the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, made it onto the head of the stretch and proceeded to maneuver to the outside, gradually,
beat SKY KITTEN to path three in midstretch and was fed its cue, picked it up immediately, snatched away the advantage a sixteenth later, then held well to
stay in the clear. POSITIVE SKEW went over to the hedge after the start, rode it for over the opening three-quarters, slipped out into the two path and went
to split rivals at the quarter pole, continued outward once into the stretch, eventually becoming four wide, had a good finish down the center of the course to
procure the place. PEACEFUL FEELING held in reserve prompting the pace from the two path, moved up menacingly after the third fraction had been
finalized, wasted not time claiming the lead for good for asked for more at the three-sixteenths marker, failed to shake loose for too long, relinquished to the
winner right around the sixteenth pole, then weakened into the show slot. MINIT MAUS broke about a half length the fastest, responded to the hold being
applied by the pilot and dropped back, saved ground until the conclusion of the backstretch, left the half mile now stationed in the two path, came up to the
end of the second bend, fanned out six to seven wide during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered up a mild kick, sufficient
enough for the last major check. SKY KITTEN forwardly placed three wide, swung into the lane, lost its path to the top one while not making any headway,
weakened in the last eighth. HAPPYCREST pursued the pace from the two path in midpack, lacked the necessary stretch response. APPRECIATE hung
out four wide on the clubhouse turn, was one path nearing the inside on the subsequent one, never made her presence felt. PETALITE vied for the lead
from the inside, got headed at the three-sixteenths marker and backed away. IDEATIONAL along the inside route, fought the rider until the half mile pole,
stepped into the stretch and came up empty.

YES AND YES established the top in short order,got guided over towards the inside eventually settling in at a slight distance from off the hedge, rated kindly
cutting the pace on a loosely-contested lead, stepped into the lane, extended the margin under light encouragement during the ensuing furlong, got
switched over to a strong drive at the eighth pole, preserved a healthy advantage, kept to the task at hand. BIG WONDER remained forwardly placed even
after brushing with VINEYARD SOUND in the shadow of the starting gate, sat two wide loosely drafting off the right shoulder of YES AND YES, got cued up
tipping approximately three wide into the stretch, failed to cut into the deficit despite finishing with willingness. STANDUP brought up the back during the
initial stages, angled sharply into the two path late on the backstretch, kept watch there from the top of the bend until its end, swung out into path five for
racing clearance during the early stages of the stretch run, becoming the widest of all, rallied for third. BOURBON CURRENCY two to three wide in pursuit,
was more the latter spinning into the stretch, lost the show after failing to muster up a sold closing punch. ALBIE three wide onto the turn, was four wide
exiting it, made no impact. KUMAR quickly spotted along the inside route, took it for over a half, went four wide into the lane, had no offering. KING'S
HONOR (IRE) underwent a two wide journey and gave way. KING OF RANCH hustled from the gate to secure a spot in midpack, faltered off a
ground-saving journey. VINEYARD SOUND brushed at the start, tracked the front runners from just off the hedge, was worked into the three path from
upper to midlane, backed away.

Footnotes
TIMELY TRADITION dueled in hand from the two path with BERTRANDA to her outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and remained patiently
handled as a trio now confronted her through the latter portion of the turn to the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home shaking off a pair of them and
was roused straightened away, dug in under threat to the eighth pole before rebuffing the remaining lone challenger and edging away to the finish.
BERTRANDA dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths joined to the outside by a pair
now between foes, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in latched on to the eighth pole before being ultimately repelled through to the finish while
preserving the place honors from a late surging rival. PUFFERY chased just off inside from near the rear, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch,
kept on to secure the show honors. PRAIRIE FIRE hustled from the gate, prompted the dueling pair in close aim four then three wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths and advancing to vie briefly before being shaken off swinging five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. MARY'S
GIRL just off the pace five then four wide, came under a ride at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn to stack outside the top trio,
went six wide into upper stretch and was shaken off straightened away, then weakened in the drive. BANGLE GAL chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
trailed.

Footnotes
FLYING FINISH broke the tardiest after bobbling to the left as the field was sent off and running, worked out a tuck along the inside coming up to the
conclusion of the backstretch, inched up, proceeded to angle into path four from the five-sixteenths pole to upper stretch, kicked in with good energy after
being straightened away, struck the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go and edged away. PAPA LUKE settled into the three path after the start,
vied as the widest of three until the top of the turn, went at it one on one with COMPETITIVE CLOUD beginning from the seven-sixteenths marker, slid over
into path two a furlong down the road, saw the pilot riding with confidence spinning into the stretch, with the soon-to-be replaced COMPETITIVE CLOUD
under an all out drive, responded when given his cue a few strides later, began the final furlong in front but the winner bearing down hard to the outside,
yielded in the general area of the sixteenth pole, stayed on for second. FARRAGUT brushed at the start, took up the chase three wide on the bend, got
driven about as wide into the stretch, went on to secure the show. OUR DESTINY travelled three wide on the turn, got sent out six wide stepping into the
lane, made no headway in the final stages. ORB IN THE TOWER strung out on the overland route during the run around the bend, angled five wide into the
stretch, improved mildly. STASH MY MONEY made some contact with FARRGUT at the start, cut over to the rail by the half mile pole, was moved to the
outside heading home, wandered out towards path six down the stretch, gaining some but without impact. BANK GALA two wide onto the turn, was hand
ridden into three path entering the stretch, gave way. COMPETITIVE CLOUD got urged into a forward position, disputed the pace from path two while
between rivals until the top of the turn before dueling with the second place finisher, moved over to the inside a sixteenth shy of the quarter pole, with the
nemesis following suit by shifting nearer to the rail too, came under a drive prior to spinning into the lane, surrendered and backed away. SENOR PHELPS
strung out four wide on the turn, folded. MY PRIMO brushed at the start, took up the chase from path two on the turn, failed to make its presence felt. YOUR
AWESOME BOSS along the rail disputing the pace as the innermost of three until the seven-sixteenths pole, faltered.

MONKEYSEEMONKEYDO three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on the front through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then edged away under a drive kept to task. IMA PHAROAH four then
three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the
place honors. MATTY'S MARAUDER broke in at the start pinching back MAGIC MOJO in concert with PROPENSITY and forcing that middle rival to be
taken in hand, chased five then four wide advancing through the latter portion of the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home
and improved position for the show honors. COUNT DOWN established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded near the eighth pole, shied out under a near sided
stick forcing an already backing away PROPENSITY to be paused, and weakened in the late stages. JOHNNYPUMP three wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. MAGIC MOJO got pinched between foes at the start and was steadied conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. NORTH CAROLINA chased
three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PATRIOT GAME chased two
to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. PROPENSITY broke out a step at the start pinching back MAGIC MOJO in tandem with MATTY'S MARAUDER, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and was paused behind COUNT DOWN as
that foe shied out under a near sided stick but was already backing away and tired. UNION CHARM chased two to three wide from near the rear under a
ride from midway on the turn, went three wide for home, made no impact.

Footnotes
VICTIM OF LOVE assumed a prominent position after appearing to come away without apparent mishap, sparred for command from path two matched up
with JAKARTA, the more confidently-ridden of that pairing, took over the advantage in time to lead the others onto the head of the stretch, wound up drifting
towards path five over the next furlong, came in sharply getting corrected with right side stick work at the sixteenth pole, dug in well to fend off the runner up.
COME DANCING one of four making light contact with each other right after the start, was within range of the front runners while perched two to three wide
on the turn, was given her cue angling approximately four wide into the stretch, saw the wayward ways of the top one in upper stretch and altered course to
the inside, making it over to the rail just beyond the eighth pole, flattened out late and had to settle for the place. PACIFIC GALE off the inside throughout,
was strung out three to four wide on the turn, as the widest of all, got steered out five wide entering the stretch, went on to secure the show. JAKARTA
brushed from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, soon emerged from a tight pack at the back with a clear advantage, got guided over to the inside
route, vied for control against the winner to the outside, yielded shortly after the half had been reeled off, backed away steadily down the stretch. ROYAL
CHARLOTTE made light contact with CHALON at the start, abandoned the inside route for path two at the top of the turn after the previously-named foe
tucked into the pocket herself, was ridden four wide for the drive home, failed to fire appreciably. CHALON bumped lightly from both sides after springing
from the gate, sneaked her way into the pocket as the journey along the backstretch was ending, tracked the pace lightly hand urged, tipped to the outside
turning into the lane, had no response.

MEAN MARY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way rated on the pace just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home,
remained patiently handled, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and drew off under a drive to prevail. MY SISTER NAT
(FR) pinched between foes at the start, grew detached at the tail of the field, saved ground throughout coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to just get up for the place honors in the final jumps. FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) saved ground through the
first turn before racing in pursuit two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn, got set down continuing just off the
inside for home, proved no match for the top one and ran on to procure the show honors. CALL ME LOVE (GB) tracked the pace along the inside patiently
handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. FOOLS GOLD broke in at the start
pinching MY SISTER NAT against FEEL GLORIOUS, raced two to three wide in closest aim of the leader through the opening six furlongs, began to fade
near the quarter pole and was roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the stretch. VALIANCE two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FIRENZE FIRE along the outside throughout, travelled three to four wide on the turn, crept up towards the ones to catch after the second split had been
posted, saw the pilot sitting motionless atop spinning into the lane, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, responded right away,
closing the gap sufficiently so as to poke a head down in front at the eighth pole, by this juncture in the five path, shook free, was kept to urging until the
shadow of the finish line. STAN THE MAN got rated along sparring for command two to three wide, was switched over to stronger handling for the drive
home, spinning about four wide into the lane, forged to the slimmest of leads, had it snatched away by FIREENZE FIRE in the neighborhood of the furlong
marker, stayed on with willingness en route for place honors. YORKTON established the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running, got guided
over towards the rail, eventually settling at a slight distance from off of it, showed the way tailed by the runner up from the outside, rated during the opening
phases, got put to the test heading home, shifted out towards the three path,relinquished in upper stretch then weakened into the show slot. WICKED
TRICK stalked the pace from path two, got maneuvered out into path six from upper to midstretch for racing clearance, made no headway in the last eighth.
DIAMOND KING remained along the rail after coming out slightly and bumping with MIDNIGHTCHARLY at the start, rode it until the end of the bend, tipped
out into path two at the top of the lane, tired. MIDNIGHTCHARLY made contact with DIAMOND KING at the start, dove over to the inside route, raced
sluggishly even though asked to pick it up by the rider, brought up the rear well behind the others, cut the corner under a drive, continued to make no
progress, then was switched over to a protective hold and allowed to fade away in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE) away well and to the front, showed the way under rating three wide down the backstretch settled into a comfortable
rhythm, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through the turn, floated four wide at the head of the stretch in front of UNI
before straightening away three wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, edged clear under a drive and held well to the finish to prevail. BEAU RECALL
(IRE) got carried in at the start by the veering in VALEDICTORIAN, raced two to three wide down the backstretch at the tail of the field on hold, tucked to the
two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in and get up
for the place honors in the final jumps. UNI (GB) broke in at the start bumping REGAL GLORY, tracked the pace two to three wide down the backstretch
before tucking inside at the nine-sixteenths, tipped to the two path placed to light coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced around VALEDICTORIAN in
tandem with REGAL GLORY to her outside, paused very briefly swinging four wide into upper stretch as NEWSPAPEROFRECORD floated in front, dug in
under a drive and kept on to the finish getting collared at the end for the place honors. REGAL GLORY bumped at the start by UNI who broke inwards,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing on the front in concert with UNI and bid five wide into upper stretch,
couldn't sustain the momentum and weakened in the late stages. ZOFELLE (IRE) three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. VALEDICTORIAN veered in at the start carrying in BEAU RECALL three paths, chased two to three wide in
closest aim of the leader, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
WINNING FACTOR away well, took up position along the inside route, tracked the front runners rated along in midpack, was still on it getting cued for the
drive home, got steered out a few strides later after espying a clear two path for the asking, bumped with UNCLE RENNY after that foe came in slightly, won
the coveted position, hitched up to SANDY LANE KITTEN by the beginning of the final furlong, forged to the front approximately a sixteenth down the road
and kicked clear. SANDY LANE KITTEN several paths off the rail early on the clubhouse bend, cleared over to the hedge prior to stepping onto the
backstretch, was rated along showing the way on an open lead, ventured onward for over three-quarters under the same set up, stepped into the lane and
got switched over to stronger handling, had the top one take aim at the eighth pole, put up some resistance before releasing the lead a sixteenth or so later,
stayed on well to garner the place. UNCLE RENNY was patiently pocketed keeping an eye on SANDY LANE KITTEN, angled two to three wide entering the
stretch, came in a bit just as the winner was maneuvering into the two path at the furlong grounds, bumped solidly with that opponent, held on for third.
BRICE swung two wide onto the backstretch, sat reserved pursuing the pace from midpack, went out five wide for the drive, narrowed in to earn the final
significant slice of the pot. SIR CHUBBY underwent a two to three wide trip, lacked a solid closing punch. POWER BOSS unhurried taking up the chase
from path two, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, mustered up a mild kick. MONTAUK SUMMER three wide on the first turn, was strung out one
path wider on the subsequent one, went into the stretch and weakened. TOLAGA BAY forwardly placed along the hedge during the initial stages, got eased
to the outside after entering the backstretch, stalked the pace until stepping onto the far turn and folded. EAGLES PALACE three wide on both turns, gave
way. SEEDISKID raced four wide for most of the way on the opening bend, was much closer to the inside on turn two, got moved out three wide stepping
into the lane, had no offering. JOHN WANT REVENGE three wide racing towards the backstretch, cut over to the inside at the half mile pole, continued
along failing to make its presence felt, went on to stroll three wide into the lane without any stretch energy to offer. VERIFY tucked along the inside route at
the head of the backstretch after being two wide prior, saved ground to no avai afterwards.
