to win going away. GERTIE CAT broke in front, pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match for that one while clearly second best.
CEE CEE'S GOT THIS hopped hitting the gate at the start, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. SASSY SISTER with the second flight in the three path,
went evenly. AIKEN APPLE well placed, faded in the stretch while drifting out DEB'S ALL OUT broke a step slow and was no threat. SPEAKING VOLUMES

KHALFANI away alertly, set all the pace, turned back a bid from the runner up nearing the top of the stretch, responded under right handed urging and won
going away. MAXIMIZER chased the winner into the turn, loomed boldly two wide nearing the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner.
LOVEATTURKEYCLUB well placed inside, altered course out to the five path in the stretch and finished determinedly. DANTU went evenly. LAS ANA had
his head turned then bobbled at the start and failed to menace. QUICK COWBOY trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. DIAMANT stalked the
pace for a half then weakened. AFTER THE MONEY was no factor.

O'MALLEY'S MARCH vied for the lead along the inside for a half, altered course to the four path at the top of the stretch, responded with a burst of speed to
make the lead late and drew clear. JOE BAILEY stalked the pace from the four path, had a mild late rally and finished second best. Z J WINS chased the
pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker then was outfinished. MAGICAL EXPRESS chased the leaders into the stretch then
faded. YO BERBS was bumped at the start, quickly sprinted to a clear lead, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. GATLING bore out at the start
bumping a rival then trailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals late. REBEL ROAD failed to menace. WOLF STRIKE was no threat. HENNESSY FIRE
was no factor.

soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. SOUTH BEACH GIRL failed to menace. NATALIA'S TEMPLE was outrun. WILD WITCH
had brief speed. GAGLIANO had her head over the side of the stall as the gate opened, remained hung up for several seconds, lost contact with the field,
was distanced though completed the course and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
