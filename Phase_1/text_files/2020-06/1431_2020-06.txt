Footnotes
NO PAROLE retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, showed the way, lightly urged and spaced at a slight distance from off the rail,
came under a slightly stronger hand ride after reeling off the second split, was in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole when asked for his best, gave
the desired response, beginning the final furlong in possession of what turned out to be his largest lead, stayed comfortably in the clear, kept to some urging
to the finish line. ECHO TOWN made contact with MISCHEVIOUS ALEX at the start, displayed no lasting ill effects from it and glided over to the rail a
sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, tracked the pace, under some encouragement, was set down coming up to the quarter pole, got tipped out into the two
path at the top of the lane, rallied for the place. SHOPLIFTED off the inside route, worked out a tuck into the two path approaching the end of the
backstretch, stayed put there only fleetingly, moving outward only a sixteenth later, ranged up to the top one, from the four path and while well in hand, was
within striking distance when asked for more springing from the five-sixteenths pole, commenced its stretch run one path closer to the rail, lacked the
needed response and had to settle for third. MISCHEVIOUS ALEX out at the start, bumped with the second place finisher, departed the backstretch from
the three path, was rated along prompting the winner on the turn, got called upon for the drive home, had no rally and backed away. MERU two wide onto
the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, gave way.

INDIAN PRIDE dueled in hand three to four wide down the backstretch with SEA SPARKLE to her inside pulling slightly on the bit, went four to five wide
through the turn, began to advance near the quarter pole and assumed command swinging three wide at that station, came under light coaxing straightened
away briefly and was intermittently coaxed edging clear to the eighth pole, remained clear to the finish to prevail. MRS. DANVERS coaxed from the gate,
raced briefly four paths off the inside before tucking to the two path six furlongs from home, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out at the three-sixteenths and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second
best. SEA SPARKLE coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path with INDIAN PRIDE to her outside, got lightly coaxed along through the turn, was
displaced from command near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors.
MAIDEN BEAUTY chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
FOREVER CHANGED four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home, tired, and was eased

Footnotes
DECORATED INVADER away in good order, remained stationed along the inside route, kept watch on the second place finisher within striking distance,
tipped out to draft behind that foe during the last stages of the run leading up to the half mile pole, was maneuvered back closer to the inside after PROVEN
STRATEGIES went into the two path at the top of the turn, inched up along the freshly-created open rail corridor, was given his cue launching a bold bid at
the five-sixteenths marker, clawed its way forward, not only gaining real estate but likewise preserving his hole, spun into the lane alongside the nemesis,
wasn't intimated as the twosome blazed their way throuigh the furlong grounds, even with the runner up shifting leftward trying to tighten things up a bit,
emerged at the eighth pole clearly in charge then drew off smartly. PROVEN STRATEGIES hand urged springing from the gate, established the top in short
order, cleared the others enough and was guided onto the inside route, showed the way, feeling some pressure from VANZZY to the outside, came out into
the two path approaching the half mile pole, leaving the rail unguarded, continued to lead the way, pulling on the left however, came under siege from the
winner in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, got set down a few strides down the road, tried, however belatedly, to close down the rail, yielded
nevertheless, stayed on well for the place. MR. KRINGLE got gathered after coming out with his initial step, darted over to the rail nearing the conclusion of
the backstretch, rode it to the end of the bend, angled three wide into the stretch, proved no match. VANZZY prompted the pace from path three for
three-quarters and gave way. FAMISHED strung out mostly three wide on the chute, was three to four wide on the fuller turn, got sent out into path five
during the early stages of the stretch run, failed to fire and backed away. VENEZUELAN HUG underwent a two wide pursuit for nearly six furlongs, between
rivals for a good portion of the journey on the backstretch, fanned out into path six for racing clearance from upper to midstretch, lacked a response.

HAPPY SAVER prompted the pace of O'TROUBLE from the outside three then two wide, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper strertch,
took over command at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. THE ANGRY MAN chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and kept on to secure the
place honors in the final strides. O'TROUBLE established the front shortly after start and showed the way in hand two to three wide, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, got displaced at the three-sixteenths and weakened
in the late stages while preserving the show honors. MUTAKAAMIL chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home, offered no response. RARE STRIPE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the drive, then fell heavily after the finish appearing to be suffering from heat exhaustion and was attended to on track and cooled down until able to
regain his own footing before being subsequently vanned off. SHADOW BOAT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. UNCLE NED chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and tired. ISLANDMAN chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home, made no impact.

Footnotes
SWEET MELANIA kept the advantage after out-breaking the other members of this quintet, was moved over to the inside route, showed the way, shadowed
by ANTOINETTE to the outside, while pulling on the bit, doubled the lead she held as the first fraction was being finalized by picking up the tempo several
ticks during the setting of the second one, shifted into the two path at the commencement of the run around the bend, with the earlier-mentioned foe
following suit by moving wider herself, inched away, got turned loose turning into the lane, lengthened away to lead by her biggest margin with a furlong
remaining, squandered much that healthy margin late yet held sway. HIGHLAND GLORY took up the chase from path two, between rivals for a good portion
of the opening three-quarters, tipped to the outside and got driven three wide into the stretch, narrowed in, eventually winning the place. ANTOINETTE
away well, tucked into the two path shortly afterwards, was rated along attending the top one from the outside, went into the three path entering the turn
after SWEET MELANIA went one path wider herself at that stage, kept pace lightly hand urged thereafter, swung into action by swinging about two wide
under a drive onto the top of the lane, got outfinished. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER underwent a ground-saving journey, lacked the necessary stretch
response. SELFLESSLY stumbled at the start, recovered in short order and raced along the outside, proceeded onto the backstretch from path three, was
slightly wider upon arriving at the full turn, got roused at the five-sixteenths marker, was more in the three path spinning into the lane, failed to muster up a
kick and backed away.

take over command at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held on to prevail. LIGHT IN THE SKY
three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to
threaten late but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish. MY SASSY SARAH three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. AVA K'S GIRL four then three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got

under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. ANYDAYISHERDAY saved ground at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the five or six path at the three-sixteenths and then tipped
out to the far outside a furlong out and offered no rally. SINGLE VERSE chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. ANCIENT BROWN three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths remaining, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. STRONGERTHANUKNOW hustled from the start, dueled from the two path
with WINIFRED J to her outside widening away from the rest, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing past the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside for home, yielded at the three-sixteenths and tired. WINIFRED J coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to
her inside opening up as a tandem on the rest of the field into the turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home as the field took closer order on the

Footnotes
GAMINE responded to some hand urging coming out of the gate to cement herself to the top, showed the way down the backstretch, a few paths off the rail
and pulling on the left, was briefly on the inside route during the run around the bend but mainly raced around it towards path two, still pulling on the left,
stepped into the lane, drifted out towards the outer border of the four path from upper to midlane, got cued up for the last eighth, continued to pour it on,
winning as much the best. PLEASANT ORB moved over to the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, arrived at the top of the turn and soon desired to tip
to the outside, was denied during her initial attempt at the seven-sixteenths pole, had success though a sixteenth later, was maneuvered back to the inside
in time to cut the corner into the lane, haplessly watched the winner assert herself, won the battle for place. WATER WHITE came away without apparent
mishap, got guided over to the rail nearing the half mile pole, came under a ride approximately a furlong down the road, swung two wide into the lane, got
outfinished. LUCREZIA stalked the top one from the two path, got driven four wide into the lane, gave way. PERFECT ALIBI off the inside throughout, was
strung out four wide on the turn, got steered outward for the drive home, was subsequently sighted five to six wide afterwards making no headway. CASUAL
took up the chase from path three on the bend, was about as wide entering the stretch, folded. GLASS CEILING four wide departing the backstretch, began
a retreat a few strides later, was well behind spinning into the lane under a protected hold, ventured onward for the last slice of the pot, then was pulled up
quickly.

field down the backstretch before tipping three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a
good finish to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the very last jumps to the wire. KANTHAKA brushed the near side stall at the start
and was corrected recovering outwards to bump OLEKSANDRA, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled

Footnotes
TIZ THE LAW taken in hand after springing from the starting gate, attained a forward position proceeding along the chute, stayed within striking distance,
crept up to the pacesetter from path three after three-quarters had been completed, seemed poised to strike when ready, directly abreast of the leader as
they headed home, tipped slightly at the top of the lane, accelerated when given his cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, opening up a
commanding lead only a sixteenth down road, stayed well in the clear under good handling. DR POST took up residence in midpack after the field had been
sent off and running, was in path four travelling on the turn, was under a ride angling six wide for the drive home, had a good finish down the center of the
strip to garner the place. MAX PLAYER cut over to the inside route, was along it for a good portion during the journey leading up to the half mile pole, shifted
into the two path at the top of the turn, got fanned out seven wide from upper to midlane, went on to secure the show. PNEUMATIC along the outside
throughout, raced three to four wide on the turn, got sent out into path five entering the stretch, gave way. TAP IT TO WIN was under a firm hold
establishing control on the chute, crossed onto the backstretch, continued to be rated along carving out the pace, several paths off the rail, slid over to the
inside coming up to the top of the turn, came under intensified pressure from TIZ THE LAW nearing the quarter pole, moved out into path three when set
down spinning into the lane, got overpowered by the top one, backed away steadily thereafter. SOLE VOLANTE was at or near the two path until the end of
the bend, stepped into the lane, wandered out seven wide while making no headway. MODERNIST brushed with FARMINGTON ROAD in the shadow of
the starting gate, pursued the pace towards the inside route, ventured onward saving ground on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, had no offering.
FARMINGTON ROAD made contact with MODERNIST right after the start, departed the backsretch from path four, shifted out about eight wide in the lane
running on empty. FORE LEFT prompted the pace to the outside of TAP IT TO WIN, followed that foe inward stepping off the backstretch and tucked into
the two path, kept pace for another a furlong, began tiring leaving the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the lane then was allowed to fade away.
JUNGLE RUNNER moved up steadily on the front runners along the backstretch, cut over to the rail at the top of the turn, fell back, went four wide into the
lane with little left and further retreated.

Footnotes
BREAKING THE RULES tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and prevailed gamely on the wire. DIGITAL AGE (IRE) three wide into the first turn, settled tracking
just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong to
challenge in the late stages but was ultimately repelled to the finish. HAVE AT IT four then three wide into the first turn, took over the front and showed the
way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled and cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under threat and was
collared inside the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the show honors. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) just off the inside near the rear through the first turn and down
the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick. ARGONNE chased along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position in the
stretch. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and
passed tired foes. RED RIGHT HAND forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SURPRISE TWIST coaxed from the gate, raced four wide through the first turn before chasing
three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced and was outkicked. SAND
DANCER two then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered
no response. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) two then three wide through the opening bend, raced three wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
POWER UP PAYNTER took up position after an apparent clean getaway, departed the backstretch from the two path, dove over to the rail leaving the
midway point on the turn, improved, angled three wide entering the stretch, was displaying some momentum diving back to the rail in midlane, continued to
close in, altered course the third and final time a sixteenth later, split rivals taking charge in the last seventy yards and edged away. BIG WONDER off the
inside, travelled in the two path on the turn, moved out one path farther off the rail for the drive home, closed in with good energy for the place. SIMPLY was
sent over to the rail, saved ground for a good portion of the opening half, angled three wide into the lane, rallied for the show. CRACK SHOT established the
top in short order, was rating along cutting the splits on an open lead, got turned loose in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, was reeled in about a
furlong later and weakened. QIAN B C steadily advanced into contention three wide on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive home, mustered up a mild
response for the final furlong. KIERKEGAARD two wide onto the turn, was sent out five wide exiting it, gained ground but all done without making any
impact. TURBO DRIVE worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, got maneuvered out into the four path coming into the stretch, lacked a
solid closing punch. STARRY MESSENGER sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, had no rally. COOLBOY applied tepid pressure on the leader from the
two path for a half before giving way. IMPETUOUS pocketed, faltered. WHAT THE LUCK pursued the pace three wide until late on the turn and folded.
DOUBLE SHOT quickly spotted along the rail, didn't pick up speed when asked early on the backstretch, fell back steadily.
