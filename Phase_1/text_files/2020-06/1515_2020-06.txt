Footnotes
BULLGRATS dueled along the rail, drifted out turning for home, quickly straightened out and drove clear. BARNSTORM was devoid of speed, made
progress at the rail around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was up late for the place. PRIMAL DESTINY stalked the duel three
wide, lacked a serious rally and was outfinished for the place. ARYA PEACEFUL dueled outside of the winner, was floated out turning for home and
weakened. GATTOSING saved ground off the pace, made a bid near the eight pole then faded through the lane. BARN YARD BRAT failed to menace while
racing three wide.

COMPOUND INTEREST broke awkwardly, rushed up inside to establish command near the three-eights pole, drew off around the turn and held well clear
under a drive. KULANI came in and bumped a foe at the start, chased the pace two wide between foes, exchanged a bump with FIT BUT FAT nearing the
eight pole, vied outside of that foe for the place in the lane and prevailed in that duel without making an impression on the winner. FIT BUT FAT came out
and bumped at the start, chased the pace inside, bumped again nearing the eighth pole, never threatened the winner and was outfinished for the place.
SYNERGY UNBRIDLED lacked early speed, raced five wide around the turn, was getting in through the stretch and had a mild gain. COCONUT MAN failed
to menace while racing two wide. WINDSOR CALLING had early speed three wide between foes and steadily faded. GIANT VIKING was pinched back at
the start, saved ground and never threatened. LUCKY NED PEPPER had early speed between foes and retreated nearing the lane. INDUS VALLEY MAN
had brief speed four wide. The rider of FIT BUT FAT claimed foul against KULANI for alleged interference around the turn but the Stewards found no reason
to alter the original order of finish. Per Stewards ruling # 34 Windsor Calling has been disqualified from earnings. REVISED RULING #36 Windsor Calling
still DQ'D

CAPE LOOKOUT stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear and angled in nearing the lane, continued on the left lead
and widened under a drive. MACANAO lacked early speed while saving ground, made good progress inside down the backstretch, angled three wide near
the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly to be a clear second. CHERUBIM settled off the pace two wide, bid three wide into the far turn then flattened
out in the lane. ONCE MORE EH had early speed inside and weakened around the far turn. SCHLOSSER set the pace two wide and tired after a half.
THOMAS KNIGHT was fractious behind the gate, saved ground and failed to menace. MY PEOPLE SING was outrun inside. GOODBYESEEULATER
played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
FENDER BABY was rather reluctant to load, stalked the pace in the three path, seized command inside the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive.
FLOWERS VALE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, was collared near the sixteenth pole and lasted for the place. WIGGLE IT
JIGGLEIT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and had a mild rally for the show. I'M SO MUNNY was bumped at the start, gave distant chase
three wide and rallied belatedly. DARK TRICKS chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. KIM'S PET was off slow, dropped far back, saved
ground and never threatened. LOLA'S KISSES played no factor while racing four wide. ZIRCON ZLOTY was reluctant to load, raced two wide and failed to
menace. SHEPLAYSTHEFIELD chased the pace four wide, faded and was not urged in the lane.

Footnotes
DEBRAW was hustled to the front, set a pressured pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. BOCA BIRDIE lagged far back inside, made progress still
at the rail around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. GALLINELLA chased the pace two wide early, angled in to save ground
around the far turn, lacked a rally and held onto third. RIGHT NOTION stalked the pace three wide and came up empty. PIMM AND PROPER pressed the
pace two wide and tired in the drive. SO RED THE ROSE was hard ridden into a forward position inside, dropped back down the backstretch, angled out
around the far turn and had no response. LOVE HAPPY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SUAVE JUAN was hustled to the front two wide around the first turn, drew off down the backstretch and held clear under a drive. DEPUTY JAMES was
hustled inside of the winner early, tipped out when that rival cleared early on the backstretch, chased two wide in the clear around the far turn, lacked a
serious rally and lasted for the place. BRO LATTE lacked early speed while saving ground, made progress inside nearing the far turn, angled four wide near
the three-sixteenths pole, rallied outside and just missed second. W V ROCKET MAN saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked rally.
MINI BOLT failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CASTLE ONE was not a threat while racing two and three wide. ROAD TO DUBAI lagged
well back inside, went four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. CANDY MAN ONE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace three wide and
faded after a half. BROTHER DAN had early speed four wide and was through early.
