Footnotes
BLACK DROP was outrun to the turn, shifted off the rail and swung four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed fast to be up in time. I'LL DO
IT FOR YOU had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then closed fast inside to just miss. SHE'S GOT HEART set the pace to the turn, edged away to the
stretch, was clear to mid stretch then was tiring and could not hold. TSUNAMI SPRING had no speed, got fanned four wide on the turn, swung out widest for
the drive and finished in a strong rally. POULAPHOUCA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but was outfinished late.
LOUS TIZNOW got outsprinted early, was three wide on the turn and closed steadily to the line. BEE EINSTEIN was chasing also early, got fanned four
wide to the stretch and did not threaten. OUI SAY NO hustled to press the leader to the turn, got outkicked to the stretch and weakened. HOLY ZAGS was
reluctant to load into the gate then had no speed and was not a factor. LEGALLY BIG was pinched back at the start and never a factor.

to the stretch, responded in the drive, could not catch the top one but was not threatened for second. NEAH BAY checked between rivals after the start,
chased the pace two wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and just saved third. DURAZNITO was bothered by MARINO HEAT and checked
at the start, got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then did not rally. COMIC STYLE had no speed and was not a threat. SOUTH
RIM chased the winner to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. FIGHTINGALLTHETIME had no speed and was not a
factor. MARINO HEAT broke out and bothered DURAZNITO, pressed three wide to the stretch then was tiring, checked away from DURAZNITO in mid
stretch and gave way. TEXAS BOB was never a threat. CALIFORNIA CANDY was always outrun.

HEATHERS GREY was unhurried to the half, rallied three wide and was on terms with GOLDEN IRIS (GB) to the stretch, battled determinedly in the final
furlong and prevailed. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) pressed the pace three wide to the half, bid inside to duel for the lead to mid stretch, dug in but was bested.
FAIRY TALE BLISS was settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. KALLINIKI was four wide on the first
turn, stalked to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. SIDE EFFECT (GB) was on the pace to the
backstretch then tracked to the second turn, raced off the rail to the stretch and did not rally. ROSE PRINCESS bobbled briefly to begin, had no speed, was
four wide to the stretch and never a factor. ACCLAIM THE QUEEN hustled to duel for the lead to the second turn, tired then stopped in the stretch, was
eased but walked off.

TAKES A VILLAGE was pinched back shortly after the start, trailed but was used to keep in touch to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, shifted out,
rallied once clear and drove clear. RUNNINFROMTHELAW tracked the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide but rallied to the front in mid stretch then
could not hold off the winner but dug in late to save the place. JUSTA POPPIN was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then finished
willingly but missed second. DAIRY KID had no speed, was forced to circle five wide to the stretch but could only pick off rivals in the drive. SEIZE THE
CHANCE chased the pace three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SHAKE IT CALI had no speed, saved
ground on the turn then tried to rally inside of LYDIA O LYDIA in upper stretch, was forced to take up, again tried to go inside that one leaving the furlong
grounds, again had to steady and finished evenly. LYDIA O LYDIA attended the pace between rivals to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and
weakened. EDDIE'S PRINCESS hustled and dueled inside to the stretch then tired. I WANT ONE was on the pace outside two others, raced three wide to
the stretch then gave way in the drive.

NEPTUNE'S STORM pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide to get on terms in mid stretch then dug in gamely to get the nod. KIWI'S
DREAM (AUS) set the pace under pressure from the winner to the stretch, resisted stubbornly to deep stretch but was nipped. CAMINO DEL PARAISO
stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished steadily but could not make an impact. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE was
allowed to settle to the half, circled four wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. ARCH PRINCE was also settled to the half, saved
ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MAJESTIC EAGLE had no speed, settled on the backstretch, was two wide to the stretch then finished
evenly. SIMPLY BREATHLESS (GB) tracked the pace while three wide to the stretch then was outfinished in the final furlong. MURAD KHAN (FR) trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
GRATZIE (GB) was outrun to the half mile pole, circled four then five wide on the far turn, was widest in the drive but finished willingly and was along in
time. TINK'S TWIRL chased the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, may have briefly got a head in front in deep stretch but was caught
by the winner. SPLASHING was allowed to settle to the second turn, bid four wide to the stretch, shifted out while inside the winner in the drive and finished
well. HAL'S BUDDY dueled three wide to the half mile pole, pushed away and was clear while off the rail to the stretch, remained the leader to mid stretch
but was tiring in the late stages. BUTTIE chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. RENNY'S
LADY (IRE) had no speed, got fanned four wide on the second turn and was making up ground belatedly. MUSIC BABE also had no speed, came two wide
to the stretch then closed some ground late. CASINO GAMES settled mid pack to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then weakened.
SENORITA COMETA hustled to contest the pace for five furlongs, was outrun on the second turn and gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
IRISH HEATWAVE was outrun to the half, advanced inside on the second turn, continued on the rail in the drive and was along in time. SHADRACK tracked
the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, responded when set down and bested the others. BRONZE WARRIOR set the pace, met a bid
on the backstretch, responded on the second turn then was collared in mid stretch and weakened late. SARNI pressed the pace to the backstretch, tried to
engage for the lead nearing the half, was turned back, raced two wide to the stretch then was outkicked and finished evenly. IMPERATOR chased the pace
to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) had no speed, was well back to the second
turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch but did not threaten. TUNE TO WIN settled for a half mile, came two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing
response. ON RAGLAN ROAD got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then was two wide to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch.
MAJOR KONG had no speed and was never a factor. DUB TOWN settled to the half, raced three wide on the second turn but gave way after six furlongs.
SITH LORD tracked the pace to the second turn then stopped, was eased in the drive but walked off.

Footnotes
BORNONVALENTINEDAY was outrun to the half, bid two wide on the second turn then shifted out for room, rallied when set down and closed steadily to
inch away from EVERYBODY DOES IT late. EVERYBODY DOES IT was allowed to settle to the half, raced two wide on the second turn, rallied to get on
terms with the winner nearing the sixeenth pole but was outkicked late. LACEY'S RAINBOW had no speed, raced unhurried to the second turn, saved
ground to the stretch then finished willingly for the show. RIDE OUT THE STORM also was unhurried for a half mile while chasing the leaders, advanced
inside on the second turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished for third. SUGARSEEKER was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the
second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then could only pick off rivals in the drive. MOONLIGHT MYSTIQUE got outsprinted for a half mile, raced off the
rail on the second turn but came up empty in the drive. FLORISTA (IRE) had no speed and was not a factor. OURSENSATIONALGIRL hustled to set the
pace from the rail to the second turn, pushed away in upper stretch but tired through the final furlong. HARDSENSE pressed the pace two wide for six
furlongs then was outkicked to mid stretch and also tired. LA GUAPA VELOS chased the pace for a half mile then stopped after six furlongs.
