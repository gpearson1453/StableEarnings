closing yards. ARCH REVENGE pressured the pace dueling through the turn digging in with a narrow lead in the two path down the lane being grabbed at
the wire. FINE went evenly off the pace losing ground to upper stretch firing nine wide to close in late. THORPE D'ORO pressured the pace dueling from the
inside to upper stretch giving all in there ceding grudgingly along the rail. LOYALTY SPIRIT slow early rallied to upper stretch threatening in the closing
yards. HERO OF HAVEN stalked close up looming through the far turn, extending five then six wide down the lane would hang late. GRAN GREYFROST
slow early lagged to the far turn then responded with some late interest down the lane. GREATEST GAME gave a mild middle move vying into upper stretch
before weakening late. STARLING'S LAW tracked the pace to the far turn then weakened while eight wide down the lane. BOMBONERO faded on the far

QUEENS DUDE pressed early three deep wresting a clear lead on the turn widening in the three path upper stretch, drifted out under left urging when
threatened late ending up in the seven path holding on. GATTO ROSSO pressed early then chased on the turn, bid from mid track in upper stretch being
carried out to the eight path as the winner drifted late saving place. LET ME ASK BOB came in bumping at the break, chased the pace losing ground to
upper stretch bidding willingly late eight and nine wide. GRAN TOGOSHI was bumped then in tight shortly after the break, gave a mild move on the turn
then weakened in upper stretch. KEY TO THE NILE slow early played no factor. LEAVING HOME bumped at the break had no impact. ARMONICO was
always outrun. BARAVELLI pressed early between horses then chased on the turn wilting abruptly along the inside to upper stretch.

Footnotes
OYA slow early saved ground surging into upper stretch drawing clear along the rail. ASPENS LITTLE ZIP pressured the pace putting a head in front on the
turn, engaged from the inside in upper stretch proved no match holding well as second best. CAPTAIN ANNE went evenly losing ground to upper stretch
vying six wide there. A LITTLE FLATTERED pressed the pace dueling through the turn weakening in upper stretch. LINDA'S MUSIC pressed early then
dropped off on the turn playing no factor down the lane. BOSTON CRIDER slow early was no factor. DEREK'S COP E CAT was never involved. CAROL
flashed early speed then gave way on the turn.
