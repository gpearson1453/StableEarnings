Footnotes
KASILOF broke sharp from the outside, dueled for the early margin, shook loose entering the turn, widen the effort through the drive and was much the best
while never asked. BATTALSTOWN dueled from the inside early, chased the pace through the turn, remained forward and just lasted for the place. SHO
MO THE MONEY outrun early, advanced outside through the turn, responded when asked and closed with a rush for the show. KISS YOUR BRIDE forced
the early pace inside, remained forward but could not keep pace. HE'S NOTE WORTHY went evenly. WELLFIELD was no factor. CABO HEADACHE was
no threat. KRISYNSARASBOY was never a menace.
