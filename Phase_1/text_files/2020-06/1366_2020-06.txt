Footnotes
ANGEL'S RUN was kept close between rivals, went for the lead three wide on the bend then steadily drew away while ridden out the last eighth. RUNNING
SCARED without early speed, commenced her bid widest on the turn, fanned out further into the lane and got up for second late. PRESENT OF HERO
bumped with ARCH FLYER at the break, advanced three wide on the bend, fought for second between rivals the last eighth but was narrowly outfinished.
I'M SO TINK passed outside tired ones. ARCH FLYER bumped with PRESENT OF HERO at the start, gained the lead midway on the backstretch, could not
stay with ANGEL'S RUN leaving the turn and gradually yielded the last eighth. GO PADDY JO was away slowly and never a factor. TAPALONG displayed
brief speed from inside, came off the rail some on the turn and steadily gave way. PHOENIX ATTACK saved ground taking the bend and was empty for the
drive. HIDDEN FIGURE soon lost contact with the field, distanced herself from the rest and was walked off after the race.

Footnotes
CAN'T SAY NO contested the pace from the beginning, stayed in path three through the turn then gradually opened up under a drive in the lane.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP pressed ONE WAY HOME from just outside, was no match for that one when set down in the drive and could only just last for the
place. SIRCORRI without early speed, rallied belatedly just off the inside the last quarter mile. Z U SOON soon trailed, though hustled along and passed
between tired horses in the stretch. ONE WAY HOME pressed from inside on the backstretch, angled out through the bend, began to fade and drifted out
under left-handed pressure inside the last furlong. ENDGAME advanced between rivals to contest the pace but gave way from inside the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
LEE LA DEW forwardly placed, saved ground on the bend, gradually drifted out in the lane, took the advantage inside the furlong marker, brushed with
GUSANO nearing the sixteenth marker, was corrected and pulled clear under urging. BE AN INSPIRATION pressed from outside, lacked the needed
stretch rally but caught GUSANO for second late. GUSANO broke in stride, set a pressured pace between horses, was challenged from inside in the stretch,
was brushed briefly approaching the sixteenth marker and gradually yielded. SQUIRRELY MIKE jostled between rivals at the start, was checked when his
path narrowed while in tight quarters nearing the half mile marker, stayed in path three on the turn and gradually angled in the last furlong. HARD WHISKEY
broke inward, jostleing with SQUIRRELY MIKE, chased from outside and was never a threat. DROOP'S M D B also jostled at the break, chased from just off
the inside and failed to menace. JITU trailed from inside, angled out to the outside leaving the bend and had little to offer. JAXONS POINT steadily faded
from inside.

Footnotes
COUSIN DARIO vied for the lead outside SYRUP from the start, moved clear on the bend, fanned out some into the lane and held sway under a steady
drive. B SALTY was reluctant to load, advanced from outside COUSIN DARIO to threaten upper stretch, lacked the extra needed the last eighth and could
only just hold second. DIAMOND MAXIMUS settled early, picked up his pace under urging along the rail on the turn, came into contention midstretch then
leveled off the final furlong. STALLONE prominent from inside, angled to the outside with a quarter mile left and rallied belatedly five wide. INTONATION
chased from outside, lost ground, four to six wide through the turn and flattened out for the drive. SYRUP displayed early speed from inside, did not stay
with COUSIN DARIO on the turn, came off the rail some into the lane and steadily gave way. MIDNIGHT JOKER showed little. DANCIN NICKY was a factor
between rivals on the backstretch but gave way two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
SCARLET POSITION stalked the early speed from outside, engaged LESLEY'S SONG in the lane and shook free inside the last sixteenth. AFOOLER
broke inward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, advanced four wide leaving the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, rallied belatedly but caught
LESLEY'S SONG for second. LESLEY'S SONG bumped at the break, vied for the early lead between horses, moved clear on the turn, was challenged
again in the stretch and slowly wore down inside the last eighth. COWGIRL KIMMIE forced into PEACE LOVE BREAD at the break, progressed three wide
on the turn, lost considerable ground fanning outside AFOOLER entering the stretch and could only make up minor ground in the late going. KIPPER
DOODLE broke outward, bumping LESLEY'S SONG, displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up on the bend, angled out upper stretch and
continued to gradually fade. GHAALEB'S MAGIC bumped at the start, was an early factor between rivals but yielded two wide on the turn. AIR ELLIE failed
to menace in a wide trip. BIT MONEY was a contender from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the turn. PEACE LOVE BREAD was squeezed back
at the start and showed little in a ground-saving trip.

MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS took the early lead just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, was challenged from outside in the lane, fought on even terms,
jostled with GONEGHOST the final sixteenth and held on. GONEGHOST stalked the early speed while toward the outside, went for the lead in the lane,
battled on even terms with MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS, jostled with the latter the last sixteenth and finished on even terms with him. AMERICAN HERITAGE
progressed from inside on the bend, angled out for a clear path inside the last furlong and caught GIRLOLAMO'GLORY for third. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY
advanced three wide on the turn but leveled off deep stretch. GITA'S LAD moved inside nearing the turn, swung to the outside on the bend and had no late
bid. MEEKA displayed early speed from inside, gave way on the bend, distanced himself the last quarter mile and walked off after the race.

Footnotes
HELLOFAGUY rated off the early speed, was just off the inside taking the bend, altered out for a clear path upper stretch, rallied four wide under a steady
drive and edged ahead in the waning yards. GREAT SCAT vied for the early lead inside VIRGA, gained the rail on the turn, moved clear upper stretch but
did not have enough left in the late going. PEACOCK MAN prominent from the beginning, closed the gap while three wide on the turn, drifted out slightly as
he fought for the lead inside the last eighth and leveled off deep stretch. COOL AMBITION bumped with FOUR LEFT FEET at the break, trailed from
outside, began to advance from inside on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run, closed well between horses but was too late. FOUR LEFT FEET
bumped with COOL AMBITION at the start, moved to contention three wide on the turn, swung out further for the drive and began to wear down the final
furlong. VIRGA disputed the pace inside GREAT SCAT for three and a half furlongs then began to tire. CITY POSITION was an early factor just off the
inside, did not keep up into the bend, angled to the outside and leaving the turn and continued to fade. NOT CHOPPED LIVER showed little in a
ground-saving trip.
