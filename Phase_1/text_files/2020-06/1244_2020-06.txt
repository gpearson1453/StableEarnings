Footnotes
BECOMING MACHEN took the lead soon after the start and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was prompted leaving the five sixteenths pole, widened
the advantage through the far turn and kept alert down the lane. WORKPANSOMETHINGS was pinched back soon after the start and raced well off the
pace in the three and four paths, settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and was
along for second later yards. CITY PRINCESS bobbled a bit at the break then stalked the winner while racing off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the
five sixteenths pole but flattened stride through later yards. WALKNTHEPLANK came in soon after the start then saved some ground racing off the pace,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but showed little more. CHARITABLE MISS raced off the pace in the three
and four paths and showed only mild response. THUNDEROUS saved ground and showed little response from the three eighths pole. GLOBAL COFFEE
saved ground. CORKY COWGIRL settled off the pace in the four and five paths, showed only mild response from the three eighths pole and faded on the
far turn. MY HAT stalked the early pace in the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded.

Footnotes
MERRY MERRY MOJO raced well back from early contention then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, progressed steadily in the five path of the far turn,
closed to the lead just inside the sixteenth pole and drew off. BUSTED HALO rated close to the early pace inside and was boxed in leaving the first turn,
started a four wide bid at the three eighths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths, raced clear on the far turn but was caught flattening stride inside the
sixteenth pole. WHAT A STORY raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, was in range of the lead most of the far turn but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. JACOB T saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed some rivals in the lane. WHERE'S THE LIME settled well off the pace saving
ground the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and showed
little more. BOUNDTOBEGOOD stalked the early pace and threatened nearing the three eighths pole, took a slim brief lead nearing the five sixteenths but
dropped back at the rail on the far turn and weakened. ALLEN JR. saved ground. APPROVING SONDE raced with the pace two deep then faded past the
five sixteenths pole. FLASHY READY RICK angled in and raced with the pace then faded past the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
IT'SMYINTENSION settled back in the two and three paths, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole then dug in leaving the far turn to take the lead in the final
yards. COMMCAT rated with the early pace two deep, was pressured with the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came in a path at the head of the
lane, dug in to the finish but was caught the final yards. SECRET CASTLE saved ground off the pace the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn at the rail, was shut off and checked into the lane but finished evenly. U S FUNDS became a bit edgy in the gate then settled off
the early pace inside, started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, had aim on the lead in the three path of the far turn but drifted into the lane and
flattened stride. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground well off the pace then bid only mildly. CAMPANIA stumbled at the break and nearly unseated her rider
while causing him to lose his irons then raced well back. NAVY SWORD rated with the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole
then faded at the rail on the far turn. After a stewards inquiry and a subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Commcat, lodged by the rider of Secret
Castle, the stewards took no action.

Footnotes
THREE BOPS stalked the early pace two deep then took the lead at the quarter pole, dueled clear approaching the head of the lane, widened to late stretch
and held on well. MISS WAVE settled just off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, dug in for second inside the sixteenth
pole and was gaining on the winner. IRISH KNOCKOUT angled to the inside and rated the early pace then came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, ceded the edge at the quarter, dropped back at the rail approaching the head of the lane and flattened stride the final furlong. TAPTAP gave chase
outside, rounded the turn in the four path and finished evenly. MEET MS BOBBI RAE gave chase inside but proved empty through the lane. COOK THE
BOOKS gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. SPUNKY ALI CAT came away a step slow and never factored. BASKET
GIRL hesitated at the break then saved ground.

Footnotes
WINDSORS FOR IT gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the five path, then dug in through the final furlong to get up the final yards. ROCK ON
contested the early pace inside and dueled clear nearing the quarter pole but was caught in the final yards. WINDSOR LEGEND engaged in close early
chase, rounded the turn in the three path then flattened stride the final yards. ZAFIR gave chase toward the inside, raced off the rail through the turn and
finished evenly. CORREJON was unprepared for the break and gave only distant chase, raced in the five path of the turn and passed a rival widest. WILLS
DEFENCE was not a factor. JOOPSTER contested the early pace two deep but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
SHEZALEMONDROPKID stalked the runner-up three wide then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, moved alongside that one two deep a furlong
away, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and widened through later yards. UNCUT rated a short lead inside then came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, was met at even terms a furlong away, ceded the advantage mid-stretch then flattened stride later yards. KATY THE CAT settled back off the rail the
opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn two deep and finished evenly to gain
on the top two. BEYOND PRETTY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased three wide on the far turn and showed little more.
ECLIPTICALS VISKI stalked the pace two deep, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then faded. BRAHMA
MOMMA raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, showed little response down the backstretch and could only pass some faders in the lane.
MOHAWK MISS mostly saved ground. DOVES OUT was not a factor. NIGHT BLOOM came away a step slow then stalked the pace four wide, but, faded
after a half mile. PAINT ME PRETTY was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
PAXOS angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. CAT COME HOME became
unruly leaving the paddock then settled off the pace inside, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and dug in
through the lane to share second with THOMAS KNIGHT, who stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole then
dug in through the lane to share second. MACANAO settled off the early pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path
of the far turn and finished evenly. GOODBYESEEULATER's jockey lost an iron into the first turn and bore outward through the turn, then raced mostly
wide. INCENSED raced well off the pace in the five path the first turn and showed little response. KING OLLIE was not a factor. MORE DATA stalked the
pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. RUNAWAY BULL bore outward through the first turn,
was not encouraged and eased.
