Footnotes
DELIA O'HARA broke readily to gain a forward placing outside rivals, advanced on the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch, pressed the
issue through the turn to gain a narrow advantage, kicked clear leaving midstretch and was kept to steady right handed pressure. CYNICAL GIRL, off a step
behind the leaders, shifted out three deep racing through the backstretch while being urged to advance on the first flight between foes racing into the turn,
continued with a steady bid in that path and gained the place honors late while no match for the winner. SIGICRICKET broke sharply, angled quickly to the
inside setting the pace on a narrow margin in the opening stages, dueled for command inside the eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way leaving the
furlong marker. CAUSIN MISCHIEF settled in the last flight along the rail racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the stretch and gained some
position late while making no real impression. POLARCENTS switched out four wide tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, continued in
brief pursuit of the leaders into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. OKIE LOGIC bobbled at the start, recovered quickly while angling to the inside
while being prompted to a forward placing, steadied momentarily avoiding close quarters racing past the nine sixteenths marker and dropped back early.
POKEGAMA, forwardly placed between foes pursuing the first flight into the turn, gave way into the lane. TANGO'S KITTY proved no factor.

Footnotes
TRAPALANDA bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to join the pace three deep racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival into
upper stretch and went clear through the last furlong under steady right handed pressure. MERANGO TANGO tracked off the first flight racing off the rail
while inside foes in second flight into the turn, continued four wide into the stretch and finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. HERBIE,
urged along the rail disputing the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge to midstretch and weakened late. OH
BROTHER JACK settled last while angling inside, shifted out entering the lane and gained position between foes late. BIG SPORT tracked off the first flight
racing in the five path between foes into the turn, exchanged some light contact with TOP OF THE PAGE midway through the bend and lacked the needed
late bid. TOWARDS THE LIGHT, urged between foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. TOP OF THE PAGE
tracked off the first flight racing six wide through the backstretch into the turn, was bumped midway through the bend and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
YEAH YEAH took up a position tracking just off the first flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted three deep entering the
second bend steadily advancing on the leaders, moved to gain the advantage in that path entering upper stretch and just maintained a narrow advantage
between foes to the end under steady pressure. WHERE'S JORDAN tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered
momentum while swinging out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. WAR
VETERAN stalked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, came around a tiring foe to
split rivals just off the inside to bid inside the top pair through the stretch but was outkicked. SIDE STREET DAVE settled along the rail racing to the
backstretch, swung out entering the stretch and continued with interest to gain position between rivals. L' CRISTABAL, urged to gain the lead racing to the
first turn while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid and gave way into the stretch.
CHARLIES A CHARMER, off last, settled outside a rival in the last flight, was fanned wide into the lane but had no rally. TERYN IT UP, in touch prompting
the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, gave way between foes nearing the lane. THE INTERIOR TIMING SPLITS WERE OMITTED PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
NORTHERNBRILLIANCE was prompted to a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch, stalked just off the first flight to the far turn, was urged to
advance in that path nearing upper stretch, was carried out by VIX VISION racing into upper stretch losing momentum, came under stout pressure while
shifting inwards bumping that foe in the closing stages but continued resolutely to just prevail on the wire in an all out drive. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL,
unhurried inside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained position along the rail entering the far turn, shifted outside a tiring foe
to split rivals just off the inside to bid for command inside the pacesetter in upper stretch, struck the front between calls late and just missed. VIX VISION, in
touch from the outset prompting a rival's pace, edged forward leaving the midway point of the far turn, bore out badly racing into upper stretch impeding the
eventual winner, was righted to contest the issue between foes while being bumped in late stages but couldn't contain the top pair. FIRST TO THE WIRE
switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, tracking off the second flight, gained position four wide racing into the lane, altered course in upper stretch
but continued with interest to gain position to the end. ALOO GHOST angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes, was prompted to advance
three deep into the lane but had no final kick. HERO OF FIRE settled outside foes in the last flight racing widest to the backstretch and never gained
contention. SINK THE BISMARCK, restless in the gate momentarily dislodging his rider, was roused to the lead inside a rival pressing the pace into the
backstretch, then gave way nearing the lane. SAVAGE WARRIOR tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch but emptied out after a
half.

ARNOLD'S PATSY, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail after the opening quarter to stalk the first flight along the inside,
came through inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch to wrest command and went clear under firm handling. ROSIE'S FLOWER'S tracked
off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out five wide advancing into the lane and proved best of the others. MRS. D'S CONCERTO,
urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, couldn't contain the winner and gave way midstretch. HANALEI SUN broke in a tangle,
was settled into stride dropping well off the leaders, angled out five wide entering the lane and made some belated progress. MS COMEDY TIME settled
well back of the field racing through the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. LUCKY MAC, urged three deep pressing the pace through the backstretch
into the turn, gave way after a half. CATERINA IANO stumbled at the start, was righted to track off the second flight while angling inside but offered no rally.
CHINA DISH, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. DAVIDSDERBYDAYGIRL, forwardly placed
four wide in early stages, steadily faded nearing the lane. OAKLIE GAL was outpaced early.

Footnotes
FRANCES ANNA was urged to the lead outside foes racing through the straight to the first turn, sprinted clear along the rail into the backstretch holding
sway on a commanding advantage, bore out to the four path entering upper stretch while briefly losing the advantage but produced a solid second effort to
wrest the advantage on the wire under firm handling. LOOKIN ATA RUNAWAY tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight into the
backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling entering the second bend, switched off the inside to bid between foes inside the pacesetter
entering upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. SEYNATAWNEE was rated just off the second
flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path to prevail for a share between foes late.
RAGING GOLD DIGGER tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the
leader while angling to the inside racing into the far turn, bid for command inside foes in upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. REAL DE
JALPA tracked well off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. BANKER NITA, held up in the opening
stages, was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. CRITTER was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under her
own power.

ATTAIN SUCCESS, in touch with the first flight between rivals just off the inside in the opening stages, was urged to press the issue nearing upper stretch,
then edged forward entering the lane to gain a clear advantage under brisk handling. ROCKNROLL ROCKET, brushed at the start, recovered to gain terms
with the first flight attending the pace four wide through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path to upper stretch, couldn't match the winner late but
held a rival for the place honors. TWO THE PUNCH was rated off the first flight while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted five wide
racing into the lane and continued to improve position to the end. MINES MADE UP broke readily, pressed the pace on a narrow advantage three deep
between into the turn and gave way in late stages. GAME DAY DECISION broke outwards brushing a rival, was settled last while angling to the inside and
never menaced. SHIPMAN'S SONG, urged inside foes pressing the pace along the rail into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

SOME SAY SO broke sharply, stalked the leaders three deep to the turn, advanced in that path to wrest command leaving midstretch and went clear under
firm hand urging. TASHIARA, urged to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dueled to midstretch, couldn't match the winner but edged a rival
for second. MACHOS VISION, urged to dispute the pace between foes, then along the inside racing into the turn, dueled to midstretch and weakened.
ROSIE BEAR tracked off the second flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide into the lane and gained some
position in an even effort. SANDY SANGRIA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and gave way into the stretch. CARRIAGE tracked off the
second flight between rivals and offered no rally. JUST SPLENDID flashed brief pace along the inside and gave way into the turn. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC,
fractious in the gate before the start, broke slowly and proved no threat. WINNAGER was steadied avoiding close quarters along the inside while going a bit
erratically in the opening quarter, switched out racing into the stretch but had no rally. CABLOOSIE BAY, shuffled back just after the start, soon dropped out.
