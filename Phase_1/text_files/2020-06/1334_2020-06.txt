Footnotes
CATCH THAT PARTY engaged towards the two path at the time with TEMPESTA, saw OUR TROUBADOUR make it a three-way tussle at the
nine-sixteenths pole, was forced to participate from between rivals as the threesome raced heads apart with each other all way to the end of the bend, was
set down in the general area of the quarter pole, battled valiantly down the lane and gamely won the nod. OUR TROUBADOUR cut over to the inside after
the break, hitched up to the front runners just shy of the half mile pole, was in path three, vying as the outermost of three on the turn, settled in upper stretch
and was switched over to stronger handling, fought onward with good determination but wound up denied. TEMPESTA quick out of the gate, went over to
the rail after assuming a slim advantage, was forced to fend off the two twosome beginning a sixteenth from the half mile pole, saw the trio raced directly
abreast of each all during the run the run around the bend, had the pilot commit to a drive a couple jumps prior to the quarter pole, vied with vigour onward
but had ultimately had to settle for the show. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT sat within striking distance of an ongoing pace dispute while taking the two path, got
let out springing from the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, came up short. MITZRAYIM shifted onto the
inside route down the backstretch, narrowed in on the turn, stepped into the stretch and was asked for more, was closing in willingly when forced to be taken
in hand after getting stuck in traffic, namely behind the first three finishers, with a few jumps to spare before the finish line. CORAGESCONTENDER saved
ground, was moved out into the two path at the head of the stretch, made no late headway. UNLIKELY two wide onto the turn, was sent out four wide exiting
it, lacked the needed response. YOUSAIDHELLO off the inside throughout, dropped back as the tempo picked up during the setting of the second split, was
spotted two to three wide on the turn, came into the stretch and made no impact. FAIRPIT had the rider take hold after coming in with his initial step, with
the gate having been set up with little space between it and the fence, raced near the rear towards the rail, was maneuvered into the six path from upper to
midlane, never made its presence felt. NO SENSE chased the pace from the two path, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, made no bids.
COME ON E. V. took the inside route, came up empty when placed in path two at the top of the lane, then was vanned off after crossing the wire. HIS BOY
ELROY stutter-stepped his way out of the gate, departed the backstretch form the two path, strolled four wide into the lane without an offering.

Footnotes
BOLD DADDY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under attendance to the outside but facing little pressure while settled into
a comfortable rhythm down the backstretch, had a rival advance three deep and was given a notch to work with midway on the turn before coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat a furlong out, repelled the challenge to inch away through
to the finish kept to task. GOLDEN SPEAR three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps. BOOTLEGGER (FR) attended the pace of the eventual winner from the
outside in the two path under a light hold applying pressure through his presence only until the midway point on the turn when given some rein to work with,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the eighth pole, began to get
shaken off inside that station and was ultimately repelled through to the finish. PLUTONIAN (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front,
came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. QUALITY CHOICE
broke a half a beat slow and brushed the off side stall at the start getting away near the rear, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a belated rally. . CATCH A CAB two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace,
came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the
late stages. ARMAMENT away towards the rear, got forced to steady briefly into the backstretch as GAULTIER appeared a bit headstrong under restraint to
the outside when off heels, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and improved position in the drive. ZINGER bumped at the start by BROKERS PRIZE who broke inwards, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack,
came under encouragement three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SPECTACULAR PLUM briefly
steadied early on into the backstretch as a rival outside grew a bit rank, raced three wide from near the rear coming under a ride midway on the far turn,
went three wide for home and was unable to make an impact. BROKERS PRIZE broke in at the start bumping ZINGER, tracked the pace just off the inside
from mid pack, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. GAULTIER (FR) grew rank and headstrong off heels of
rivals into the backstretch and in turn forced ARMAMENT and SPECTACULAR PLUM to briefly steady before tipping out to the five path into the clear,
tucked four wide midway down the backstretch beginning to advance on the front, the rider allowing his charge some rein rather than continue to tussle with
him, tucked three wide into the far turn advancing to latch on the top pair three furlongs from home, got shaken off inside the five-sixteenths, went five wide
into upper stretch backing away and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PRIMACY remained along the inside after coming away from the starting gate the tardiest, departed the backstretch lightly hand urged, picked it up when let
out a notch soon afterwards, moving into the three path at the five-sixteenths marker with interest, challenged as the widest of three turning into the lane,
emerged at the eighth pole with a clear advantage, lengthened away, set to a hand drive for much of the final sixteenth. BACK CHANNEL cut over to the
inside after the field had been sent off and running, showed the way on a slim margin, forced to fend off a pair of foes to the outside, saw the winner add
itself to the pace scene as the half was being completed, spun into the lane under a drive, relinquished to the winner in short time, held well for second.
DARE TO TRY contended for the top as the widest of three from path three until midpoint on the turn, went on vie closer to the rail and from between rivals
a few jumps later, stepped into the stretch getting roused, failed to keep up and backed off. ARIMA chased the front runners from the three path on the
bend, came into the stretch then wandered out into path five giving way. VENUS OYZO hustled from the gate, began to pull on the bit afterwards, argued for
the top two wide and from between rivals for almost a half, made it into the stretch and faltered.

GO RUDY GO forwardly placed three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through
the turn, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command a furlong out, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MONEY IN

wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors in a blanket finish. DISCIPLANARIAN got brushed at
the start by WESWORLD who broke inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and kept on
for the show honors. LONG ISLAND CITY tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. FLUENT IN SARCASM established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside,
tucked to the inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was displaced a furlong out, then weakened in
the late stages. KID CHOCOLATE three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LORD CAMDEN broke in brushing the near side stall at the start,
chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WESWORLD broke in at the start
brushing DISCIPLANARIAN, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went five to six wide
into upper stretch and passed tired foes. GATTO MARRONE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PRINCE HALO bumped at the start by MONEY IN THE BANK who broke outwards, chased four wide

Footnotes
SEA FOAM retained the advantage after breaking on top, got steered over to the inside route, showed the way coaxed along, stepped into the lane and
extended the lead, was set down to an abbreviated drive that lasted from near the sixteenth pole to the final seventy yards, went on to cross the wire well
geared down. TWISTED TOM well off the inside throughout, underwent a four wide pursuit, swung into the lane, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
marker when asked for his best, proved no match, with the others proving no match themselves with regards for place honors. DURKIN'S CALL took up the
chase from path two in midpack, was sent out five wide from upper to midlane, got outfinished. PLAYWRIGHT stumbled badly at the start, departed the
backstretch from the three path, got called upon at the midway point of the turn, fanned out into path six once in the stretch, made no headway, yet earned
the last major check. HIT IT ONCE MORE prompted the winner from the two path, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and
folded. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC pursued the pacesetter from the three path, was about as wide entering the stretch, gave way. FLEET IRISH stayed
towards the back of the pack after the break, travelled two to three wide on the turn, got asked to pick it up leaving the three-eighths pole, was maneuvered
into path seven from upper to midstretch, had no rally. PIPES along the inside route, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, faltered.
HOROSCOPE saved ground to upper stretch, having drafted behind the winner for much of the going on the backstretch, stepped into path two entering the
stretch then later went on to alter course to path five to no avail.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S CAT tracked just off the inside from mid pack, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge outside a quartet
coming to the eighth pole, came in under an off sided stick placing BOURBON MISSION and FIELD OF COURAGE in tight between himself and FORT
FORTITUDE who was intent on preserving his lane to their inside, BOURBON MISSION paused taken in hand inside the eighth pole for two to three strides
and FIELD OF COURAGE was forced to check out losing all momentum and two to three lengths of ground, rallied to take command near the sixteenth
marker then dug in to fend off a late surging rival. HONEY WON'T saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch roused, was in behind rivals to the eighth pole, tipped out a half a path at that station and offered up a good finish to
surge late but missed at the end. CELEBRATION (GB) established the front and showed the way in hand just of the inside, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner roused into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
threat and was collared inside the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the show honors. PAGLIACCI just off the pace just off the inside, tucked inside half
a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. FORT FORTITUDE
coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge a furlong out when bumped lightly in the hindquarters by FIELD OF COURAGE due to pressure outside from KITTEN'S CAT, held steadfast to his
lane but was outfinished in the late stages. BOURBON MISSION four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out drifting in slightly under an off sided stick before being forced to pause between foes in tight as
KITTEN'S CAT came in under an off sided stick from the outside, lost some momentum as a result, then kept on to the finish unable to recoup his former
position. MISSION COMMAND just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. HONORABLE HERO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. FIELD OF COURAGE four then three wide in pursuit in range of the leader, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was forced to check out when put in tight between rivals at
the eighth pole bumping FORT FORTITUDE in the hind end due to pressure from KITTEN'S CAT outside, lost all momentum as a result and finished in
hand to the wire. POOL WINNER coaxed from the gate, raced briefly inside before tipping to the two path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. POCKET CHANGE struck the off side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OUTRAGEOUS BET chased three to four wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled eight wide at the top of the stretch and was unable to make an impact. There was a General Stewards' Inquiry into the
stretch run before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
COST BENEFIT (GB) shied in at the start, recovered in short order and assumed a forward position, glided over to the inside route with the lead early on the
backstretch, carved out the pace, well rated, sailed along under the same scenario for three-quarters pole, headed for path two heading into the lane, was in
the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker when asked for more for the initial time, desperately clutched to a slim lead late to stay in the clear. DOVIMA took
up the chase from the two path during the opening phases, flashed interest tipping into the third one on the turn, was given her cue challenging in earnest
about four wide into the stretch, gained in a steadfast manner, got denied. WINDFALL PROFIT settled for the pocket after the winner established the top,
was patiently ridden tracking that opponent, arrived at the quarter pole, had enough of a seam along the inside corridor with which to launch a rally turning
into the lane and did just that, issued up a stiff bid but was staved off. HALO CITY pinched at the start, raced at or near the inside, gained well to secure the
final significant slice of the purse. MY SWEET WIFE strung out three wide for three-quarters, angled six wide for the drive home, had no closing punch.
TOO SEXY seemingly the widest of all throughout, sat parked out five wide stepping onto the backstretch, went about the turn from path five, got
maneuvered out seven wide during the initial stages of the stretch, made no impact. TIZLEGAL came in at the field was released, went on to sit forwardly
placed three wide on the chute, tucked over closer to rail to press the pace soon after entering the backstretch, remained at the task, but from between
rivals on the turn, went into the lane and weakened. DERBY BRAVE kept watch on the pace from path two in midpack, was worked under encouragement
into path five from upper to midstretch, had no gain. EMPIRE LADY strung out four wide on the chute, was one path closer to the rail on the fuller turn, had
no rally. HIGH OPINION underwent a two wide pursuit for the majority of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider,
lacked the needed response. HILL D'ORO along the rail by the end of the chute, faltered. GRACEFULLY displayed no speed after ducking in at the start,
got eased coming into the lane then walked off the course without need of outside assistance.

tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled through the turn, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, edged clear under
a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the finish. BUSTIN SCONES coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the wire. WAILIN JOSIE chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. GOOD CREDENCE

on for the last major share. HAPPY SOPHIA hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, cut the corner into

Footnotes
SHE'S A JULIE got sent over to the inside after getting away in good order, was some under some hand encouragement tracking the front runners going at
it side by side for control, was cued up turning into the lane three wide under a hard drive, found herself teamed up with POINT OF HONOR closing in on
OLLIE'S CANDY, reeled in the latter nearing the wire then crossed it just in time to earn the decision. POINT OF HONOR remained in the two path after the
field had been sent off and running, got put to a prolonged drive after entering the turn, spun into the lane approximately four wide, gained on the one to
catch in unison with the winner, missed. OLLIE'S CANDY sparred for command lightly hand urged from path two, increased her presence during the run
around the bend, grabbed the advantage late on the bend to lead the others into the stretch by a long head, had the pilot go to work, emerged the eighth
pole holding her largest lead, saw the top twosome whittle away at it, eventually getting reeled in in the shadow of the finish line. BLAMED vied for the top
from along the inside route, coaxed along and with OLLIE'S CANDY in attendance to her outside, came under heavier pressure from the aforementioned
opponent once beyond the half mile pole, got headed as the pair approached the end of the bend, remained a prominent factor for the next furlong before
backing away. PINK SANDS raced towards the inside, slipped to the outside and was asked for more at the three-eighths pole, was moved out five wide
into the stretch, didn't make any headway, then finished off the final furlong having been placed to a protective hold. GOLDEN AWARD sat forwardly placed
three wide until the conclusion of the backstretch, failed to respond when put to an abbreviated drive early on the turn, fell back farther and farther, stopped
to a walk while being eased down the lane.

Footnotes
BEAN COUNTER tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home into
daylight, dug in between foes to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was just up gamely on the wire. PRINCESS FAWZIA established the front
and showed the way in hand along the inside settling into a comfortable rhythm, remained on hold awaiting a challenge through the far turn, came under
pressure near the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, remained safely clear to the eighth pole under growing threat from a quartet, dug in
stubbornly fending off those rivals until nailed in the very last jump. COREY SCORES saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled
until set down angled three wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth and missed on the line. GLORIOUSLY just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish but was
outfinished in the late stages. HURRICANE BREEZE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, kept on under a drive through the stretch getting outfinished in the late going. STRIKE MAGIC three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. STORMY DERBY DAY three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WICKED TITLE broke in at the start, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and offered no response. HAPPYCREST three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. SHYZA two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along midway on the far turn, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.
