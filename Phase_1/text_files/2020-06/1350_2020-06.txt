Footnotes
AVIE'S SAMURAI showed early speed but allowed SKYGAZE to take command on the main track, forced the issue, took the lead early turn and drew away
then held sway under light handling. DIAMOND SPARKLES was squeezed back early and settled off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide on the
turn then chased the winner home. TEACHER'S PET had brief speed then stalked the pace, was hustled four then three-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch but evened out with a 16th to run. ANN OF CLEVES stalked early, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the turn while dropping back then
finished gamely in vain. VANA GRAND stalked early, was hustled from the rear on the turn but failed to menace. SKYGAZE took a short early lead entering
the main track, was headed at the turn, chased to the stretch and tired. LA PAQUITA stalked early, chased three-wide from off the pace on the turn then
lacked a rally.

gained steadily to the end. PREFERRED GUEST settled off the pace , closed three then two-wide late turn and finished gamely. BAMBARRA BAY broke
outward and bumped KATIA'S FURY, settled in striking range, was steadied behind a rival late turn and moved off the rail but failed to menace. DAD'S
MISSY raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. SILENT CHARITY set a pressured pace, shook clear mid

GOLDEN WAVE forced the pace, challenged at the top of the stretch and drew clear quickly then prevailed under a hand ride. FORT HOPE stalked the
pacesetter, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. ARTIE MY BOY raced in mid pack, was hustled
two-wide on the turn then chased gamely to the wire. WARRIOR'S HEART, in range, came three-wide through the turn then finished gamely. KEEN
SAMURAI raced in mid pack, closed angling from three to six-wide through the turn and gained steadily through the stretch. UNWAVERING led early, set a
pressured pace, was engaged at the head of the stretch, yielded, but was determined to hang on to a piece of it. OLLIEMYBOY, in range, came three to
six-wide through the turn then finished with some interest. BOLD VICTORY settled off the pace, closed three to six-wide on the turn then chased gamely
through the stretch. GREEN FLEET, in range, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. HOLYFIELD,
away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. EMBRACE MY UNCLE broke outward but gained striking
range quickly raced four-wide on the turn then flattened out mid stretch. KUDURO settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but
lacked a closing response. CANADIAN SECRET raced off the pace, rode the rail on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
NEWSTOME bumped with LOOKINATAMIRACLE then was crowded by AYE AYE SIR at the start, stalked the dueling trio of leaders while racing on the
inside, swung four-wide past the 1/4 pole then drew clear in the stretch. UNTITLED avoided the congestion at the break, advanced along the outside to join
the duel for the lead, raced three-wide on the turn, was outfinished by the eventual winner but was clearly the best of the rest. LOOKINATAMIRACLE was
off a bit slow and bumped by NEWSTOME before being crowded as AYE AYE SIR ducked out, was hard-ridden early to make the front, dueled for the lead
while racing between foes, was two-wide on the turn, gave way in the stretch and prevailed for show. AYE AYE SIR ducked outwards at the start causing a
chain reaction, was on top early but was soon pressured, dueled while saving ground on the turn, drifted off of the rail turning for home and tired. STRIKING
MOON was bumped by STORMY SOUL and herded at the start, dove down to the as they joined the course proper, trailed the field, saved ground on the
turn and offered no rally. STORMY SOUL bumped into STRIKING MOON at the start then was herded outwards, stalked the pace while racing two-wide
then came up empty.

settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed a gap in the stretch. SURE WOULD FOREST settled off the pace, chased
three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. OCCASIONAL VIEW raced from off the pace, saved ground on the turn but lacked a closing response. CALL

Footnotes
PIPER'S LEGACY raced in mid pack, checked along the rail in tight quarters late turn, responded when asked in the stretch, rallied smartly and was just up.
MISS BEHAVE stalked early then pressed the on the turn, took control in the final furlong but was caught on the wire. AMERICAN TAP, in range, raced
two-deep on the turn, was set down at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. SHORT SUMMER DRESS set a pressured pace along the rail, was
engaged mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. RUNWAY DREAMER settled in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide through the turn then rallied
belatedly. MISS BOBBIT, prominent early, was taken back a bit at the turn but remained in striking range, was well-placed through the stretch but evened
out. WEED BE HAPPY settled off the pace, was steadied late turn, angled out upper stretch and rallied. MONASTERY LANE settled off the pace, rode the
rail on the turn, was steadied at the top of the stretch then finished evenly. REXDALE settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn,
came widest to the top of the stretch then flattened out. LA CHAUFFEUR stalked the pace but backed away approaching the stretch. MARWOODS WAR
raced in mid pack, came five-wide through the turn then lacked a rally. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD stalked the pace from the outside, raced four-wide on the turn,
was roused in the stretch but had no response.

hustled three to five-wide on the turn then rallied widest. WAVE BABY raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn and finished under a
determined stretch drive. FIRMLY GROUNDED, in range, closed two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. LORD OF LEGENDS had
