second turn, remained clear to mid stretch then was tiring and was all out to the line. LUCKY MS JONES had no speed, bid three wide on the second turn
then closed steadily to the line. SNOW PACK lagged to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch then closed a gap without threatening. TOTALLY
NORMAL chased the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. SUPER BUNNY hustled to the front, was
collared nearing the half, got outrun on the second turn then tired after six furlongs, stopped, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

LA CROIX was quickest and took the lead, set the pace two then three wide to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch and held under steady urging.
CARIBOU CHIANTI chased the winner two wide to the stretch then had too much ground to make up but was not threatened for second. PAJAMA QUEEN
had no speed then was forced to circle five wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. IZZY'S INPUT hustled to press the winner three wide, got
outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. TAHOE BLUE was sent for speed, chased four wide to the stretch then tired. GO MUSKEE was through early.

Footnotes
DARNQUICK had the best speed and eased in, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch but was all out to hold. TAKE ME
FOR A SPIN lugged inward and cut off AT ATTENTION right after the start, pressed the winner three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch
but kept to task and closed willingly. AT ATTENTION was cut off and steadied hard shortly after the start, trailed to the turn, was three wide then swung out
widest for the drive and closed steadily. AWESOME SUMMER was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then closed the gap to the line.
RETURRAY was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then was gaining without threatening. SMILEFORME stalked the winner two wide to
the stretch then came up empty. The stewards conducted an inquiry and the rider on AT ATTENTION lodged an objection against both the winner and the
runnerup. After reviewing the start, the stewards disqualified TAKE ME OUT FOR A SPIN for interference against AT ATTENTION and placed him third.
