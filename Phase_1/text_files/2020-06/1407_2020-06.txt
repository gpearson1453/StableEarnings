Footnotes
JAMIN'S JET prompted the pace three, then two, wide down the backstretch, cleared away from an inner weakening rival into the turn, widened her
advantage in upper stretch, and was driven to the wire. OVERDRESSED stalked three wide between horses early on, but was outmoved by foes into the
turn, cut the corner while being driven turning for home, produced a rallyalong the rail in midstretch, and secured place in the closing stages. MINI DRESS
vied along the inside early on, but was shuffled back and steadied behind the weakening ADMIRAL'S GARNET into the turn, lost many lengths worth of
position, shifted off of the rail at the five sixteenths pole and swung to the seven path turning for home, then rerallied willingly for a minor reward. GRAN
CONFUSIONE tracked from midpack while four wide into the turn, shifted three wide and inched forward, then finished evenly between horses in the late
stages. LOVE'S TAVITO chased the pace setter from the two path, forged place from multiple foes into the turn, but weakened between rivals at the furlong
pole. A LOT OF SPUNK took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. MY GUATEMALAN GIRL shifted to the four path between
horses turning for home, but hung on her left lead and lacked a kick, then lugged a bit inwards through the lane. ADMIRAL'S GARNET set the pace inside of
the eventual winner down the backstretch, but weakened into the turn, was green in upper stretch while fading, and subsequently stopped. ABHAILE was off
slowly, took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, swung to the seven path turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CASHANOVA took back between horses passing the wire for the first time, tracked the pace three wide and outside of horses, inched closer turning for
home to make a three wide bid in upper stretch, and edged past inner foes passing the sixteenth pole under driving pressure. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS
prompted the pace setter from the outside, vied outside of that foe into the far turn, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch while meeting a challenge
from CASHANOVA, but was bested by that foe at the sixteenth pole. SHINING THROUGH settled off of the pace in the two path early on, advanced three
wide while in the four path around the far turn, sustained a grinding rally through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leader. SUN LOVER (GB)
set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of multiple rivals in upper stretch, but yielded through the final sixteenth. WAR FILM tracked from midpack two
wide between horses, but chased the leaders through the lane while finishing evenly. FRANKINCENSE was in tight quarters between horses through the
lane for the first time, took back and settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to threaten. PERFECT BEAM
pulled along the inside passing the wire for the first time to stalk the pace into the first turn, saved ground behind the leader, but weakened turning for home.
LIGHT OF THE WORLD was crowded between horses and pinched back at the start, then trailed throughout. JUMPER clipped heels with the eventual
winner into the first turn and lost the rider, then walked off. Following a Stewards' Inquiry, no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
FORMULA prompted the pace three to wide into the turn, dueled for the lead around the turn in through upper stretch, then drew clear passing the furlong
pole under driving pressure. LAVALIER dueled for the lead outside of LYNNE T down the backstretch, inherited a lead into the turn while being hounded by
the eventual winner, held a slight advantage in upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong, and just held place at the wire. MESANGE was forwardly
placed along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home to be outside of the dueling leaders, produced a grinding rally through deep stretch, but
missed place at the wire. UNION SONG raced inside of rivals while in midpack down the backstretch, shifted off of the rail around the turn to pass the
weakening early leader before shifting back to the rail turning for home, then stayed on mildly for a minor reward. EBONY BAY took the turn in the two to
three path while in midpack, and failed to threaten. IT'S ALL CASH advanced five wide and outside of horses passing the half mile pole, shifted four wide
into the turn, came into the lane in range of the leaders, but flattened out in upper stretch and weakened. ANGLICO took the turn in the four path while far
off of the pace and passed tired rivals through the lane. ILLUSIONISTA raced midpack four wide, but weakened in upper stretch. A REAL GEM was
forwardly placed three wide between horses early on, but weakened into the turn. THANK YOU GIRL was off slow and bumped an outer foe at the start,
came under a drive two wide into the turn, but failed to respond. LYNNE T dueled for the lead inside of LAVALIER early on, but weakened into the turn, and
subsequently stopped.

BIG TIME bumped with an inner foe multiple times at the start, dueled for the lead inside of multiple rivals thereafter, dug in in upper stretch as multiple foes
began to weaken but MAD MADDY sustained a bid, then dueled gamely inside of that rival through the final furlong, and prevailed at the wire. MAD MADDY
was off a half step slowly, recovered and rushed to prompt the pace four wide between horses into the turn, made a three wide bid turning for home, dueled
with BIG TIME through midstretch after other rivals weakened, but failed to edge an advantage in the late stages, and hung. PATTY H prompted the pace
five wide into the turn, made a four wide bid outside of rivals turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch, then held show. SOME NIGHTS dueled for the
lead three wide, then two wide into the turn, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. PUYE TIMING tracked the pace from the three path
around the turn, but chased the leaders through the lane without making a bid. TETE A TETE was bounced around between horses at the start, saved
ground through the turn while far off of the pace, then stayed on mildly between horses through the lane. NO MO' SPENDING broke outwards, tracked the
pace from the four to five path, but weakened in upper stretch. FADED MEMORIES bumped an outer foe multiple times at the start, lied close to the pace
along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. WENDY'S FINE WINE brushed the gate and was off multiple lengths behind the field, then trailed early on
and failed to factor. KITTEN WITH A WHIP vied two wide between horses early on, but took back to stalk into the turn, then weakened while hanging on her
left lead in upper stretch before shying from a rival at the furlong pole. LONGDRINKOFWATER was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
ANGELUS WARRIOR came out at the start, stalked the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and edged
clear in the final stages. JUGGERNAUT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, remained clear in the stretch but yielded late in the drive.
LETMENO tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. STRONG TIDE trailed the field early on, was in the
four path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch drive. ACRE raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane with some late gain in the stretch run.
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the drive. MISTER NOT FUNNY
was bumped and bothered at the start, raced off the rail into the lane and improved position. LONTANO was never a threat. SOCIAL AFLEET was through
after a half. MR. QUALITY had early speed then folded up.
