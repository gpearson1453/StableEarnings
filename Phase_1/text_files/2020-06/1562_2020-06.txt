asked on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. KASHEARS broke out and brushed the gate, saved ground on the first turn,
lagged at the rear, went around the far turn in the two path and failed to threaten. TOMMYTOSHORT was caught in the five path on the first turn then rated
off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and bumped with a rival then had nothing left. JOHN
DOUGH bumped with an opponent early then checked, went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, dropped back

stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. SONOMA CRUSH broke a half-step slow then was hustled, raced between horses under urging,
went four then three wide on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. HE'S A RANGER chased
the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened but was clear for the show. TRE LEE DIVINE was coaxed along
towards the front, steadied while in tight between horses at the three-eighths, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. THE RED DUDE
bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, raced off the pace under urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. TOASTING MASTER
bumped with a rival twice after the start, was urged along on the far outside, went seven then six wide on the turn and failed to respond. ZMOR ARISTOCAT

four to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WAKEFIELD bumped with a rival at the start, showed no speed under
urging, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor. ALL SHACKED UP bumped with a foe after the start, exchanged bumps with a rival early,

Footnotes
FOOL'S PARADISE went around the first turn in the two path while between horses, settled between horses on the backstretch, started the far turn in the
two path, steadied at the five-sixteenths then dropped to the rail, moved out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, gained on the leader into the final
furlong, moved out in dogged pursuit outside the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a right-handed whip and surged by late to prevail under strong
handling. QUEBEC was hustled to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace with some company to her outside, shook clear along the rail
on the far turn, extended the advantage passing the quarter-pole then was roused while widening into the stretch, drifted out when put to a left-handed whip
just inside the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed whip, led into the final forty yards but was caught while well clear for the place. CURLIN'S
JOURNEY was hard held between horses in the three path on the first turn then reserved near the back, raced in the three path under a tight hold early on
the far turn then steadied around the five-sixteenths, continued under tight restraint then steadied again at the quarter-pole before shifting five wide and
lacked the needed response while up for the show. COWGIRLS LIKE US went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while five wide
on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond. CLASSY ACT was rated on the inside, dropped back under urging while along
the rail on the far turn, drifted out while well out of contention in the stretch and capitulated. BLUE MOONRISE raced in the three path on the first turn,
prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded. TERRA'S ANGEL broke
out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue while four wide on the far turn, chased between foes past
the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
CAPT. ST. JACQUES chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the leader into the final furlong, gained the advantage just
inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. COWBOY RIDGE settled near the middle of the field, was urged along in the two path on the
turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished with good courage to narrowly get the place. ROBO was bumped at the start
and forced out, raced on the outside under urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly
to just miss the place while able to get the show. RUN TO FAME bumped hard with a rival at the start, moved up to take the lead, went around the turn in
the two path, was set down in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth then was overtaken and lost the trifecta. HARD TWIST broke out and
bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CARRIES
MAN bumped with a rival early, settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, moved out near the
sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. SANGIO VASY showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and tired. FIRST BUMP RIDGE bumped
hard with a rival at the start, bumped with another foe early, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, moved further out
near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. TWO STEPPING DISCO was bumped at the start then forced into another rival, raced towards the rear on
the outside under urging, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
