Footnotes
CADDO FOX came in nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the four path, prompted the pace on the outside, came in and brushed with a foe while
taking the lead midway down the backstretch then moved clear with a half-mile to run, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was coaxed along late on
that bend then roused for more near the three-sixteenths, responded well under a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead in the stretch, switched to
the proper lead while clinging to the advantage late and held under a hand ride from that point to the wire. CHACHING BLING raced in the three path on the
first turn, settled just off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch under
a left-handed whip then began to drift out while making an outside bid, continued to drift out under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, finally switched to
a right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole, kept on to the wire but missed while well clear for the place. WILD AND GOLDEN went three wide on the first
turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while
best of the rest. NIALL was hustled from the start, went around the first turn in the two path, moved up early on the backstretch to race just behind the
leaders, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, angled out leaving the backstretch, went four to five wide on the far turn and came up empty. RUNNIN
THE RED was squeezed back between horses early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn and
failed to threaten. FANDO was taken up briefly when the winner came in nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled outside under some
urging, was ridden along while four wide for most of the far turn then moved to five wide, floated eight wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. PROUD
TO SERVE went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace in hand, lost the lead to the winner while brushing with that foe midway
down the backstretch then dropped back, came up empty on the far turn and retreated. RANCHERO RIDGE went five wide on the first turn, dropped back
early on the backstretch, fell to the rear with a half-mile to run then dropped well behind and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ISLAND SUN broke very fast, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch a head behind under a
right-handed whip then was switched to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, gained the advantage inside that marker then shook clear into the
final sixteenth under a continued left-handed whip and proved best while put to a hand ride in the final forty yards. WINGS FOR ENO broke out at the start,
chased the pace on the outside then five wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead into the final furlong
then swapped to the proper lead, was switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while unable to go with the winner.
STRAWSUPONREQUEST showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a left-handed whip while in
front just after turning into the stretch, battled while still on his inside lead in the drive, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened while well clear for
the show. DUST EM veered out at the start and spotted the front a few lengths, was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MY BLARNEY STONE dropped back while urged along, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path,
turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. BOORNAZIAN was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path and was
no factor. FLYING THE REDEYE chased the pace, went four wide for most of the turn then shifted five wide, came six wide into the stretch and faltered.
TOX BOSS showed no speed under urging then angled in while well behind, saved ground on the turn and showed little.

that foe into the final furlong then was outfinished while clear for the place. MANDREW broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
was urged along off the pace, went five to six wide on the turn, gained into striking range under the whip into the stretch but flattened out and settled for the
show. MEAN CANNON was hustled from the start, chased the paced on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into
upper stretch and weakened. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail
into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GAME DAY PLAY was fractious in the paddock then had a shoe repaired, broke a bit slow then was carried in,
raced off the pace under urging, saved ground on the turn, came out three wide into upper stretch then moved further out around the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. OSCAR CHOICE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two to three path on the
turn and tired. HE'S A BOMB was ridden along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and failed to
respond. RUNAWAYPOINT broke in at the start, dropped back under urging, went four wide early on the turn, dropped to three then two wide later on that

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN broke out then was corrected by the rider, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, ranged up four wide
early on the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the five path at the three-sixteenths, responded well under a strong hand ride in
upper stretch and extended the advantage, drifted in when put to a right-handed whip inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider, went
back to a right-handed whip into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under strong urging. EL SUPREMO went three to four wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip, switched to a
right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner. INSTAFAMOUS went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed kick then missed the place while just able to get the show. MAGIC
MICHAEL came out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled well back in the field, was urged along while five to six wide on the far turn and
lacked the needed response. RUNCHIEFRUN raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, drew even with that
foe leaving the backstretch, vied in the two to three path on the far turn, led from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the
winner, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. GLASS EATER saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside on the far
turn, advanced closer in the process, moved out into upper stretch and failed to respond. LIFE ON THE ROAD went four to five wide on the turns and also
failed to respond. CARLEA'S DREAM went five wide on the first turn, settled outside under some urging, was urged along while five wide on the far turn,
dropped back passing the quarter-pole and faltered. PREFERITO DA BARBI was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead nearing the
five-sixteenths, dropped back passing the quarter-pole and stopped. IRISH SILVER raced in the two to three path on the first turn, settled well off the pace,
dropped well behind while three then two wide on the far turn and showed little.

midway through that bend then dropped close to the rail, set the pace while in hand, controlled the action in the two path while asked on the far turn,
responded well when roused for more at the three-sixteenths then came under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip while extending the
advantage into the final furlong, went back to a right-handed whip around the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under strong urging. CLASSY PAPA
tossed his head while taken up into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled in the front half of the field, shifted in outside the half-mile pole then
moved closer, was urged along against the rail on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. INSURRECTION was bumped hard at the start, raced off heels while rank nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled on the inside
of a foe, was urged along while five then four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. JETT RINK was caught seven
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. EGOMANIAC broke out and bumped hard with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along while two to three
wide early on the far turn, moved to four then five wide later on that bend, was carried six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. SCHOENHARDT
was hustled from the start then taken in hand nearing the first turn before being taken up shortly thereafter, went five wide on that opening bend, settled on
the outside, was urged along while five to six wide on the far turn and faltered. ISTAN WARRIOR came out behind horses nearing the first turn, went six
wide on that bend, settled on the outside, moved in under urging leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide early on the far turn, shifted five wide near
the quarter-pole and was no factor. TROOPER showed no speed while hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear under
urging, moved from four to six wide on the far turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and never reached contention. ICE STRIKE leaned out at the
start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty while four then three wide on the far turn and retreated. TRES
CHIFLADOS raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path under restraint, stalked the pace under a tight hold, chased in the three path
on the far turn and also faltered. PASTOR VAN went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on
the far turn and failed to respond.

wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong but was outfinished then just missed the trifecta.
TEXAS WARRIOR settled on the outside, chased five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, made a bid into the final furlong but was
out-kicked. CROSSTIME was well placed towards the front, went three wide under urging on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick. SILVER LUKE SILVER was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the inside of two foes, steadied while crowded a bit along the rail
nearing the seven-sixteenths and dropped back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive around the
furlong marker and lacked the needed response. DOC'S CLASS ACT was last to commence then urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GRADYZ KAT was urged along at the rear, went five to six wide on the turn, came seven wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten.
