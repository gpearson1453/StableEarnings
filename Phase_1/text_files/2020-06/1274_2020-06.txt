COLLUSIONIST stalked the pace three wide going into the turn and drew clear through the lane under little urging for the handy win.
WHISKEYDRUNKAGAIN showed good speed along the inside in a three horse duel but could not go with the winner through the stretch.
ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST was in the two path in the speed duel dropped back entering the stretch but came again late to just miss for second.
COLORFUL COLORADO raced along the rail but never mounted a rally through the stretch. CRUZ'N JACK raced in the two path for much of the race but
never launched a rally. DUGABOY BROWN was well behind the leaders while along the inside going into the turn came out for the drive but lacked a
winning rally. A J SAMURAI was fanned four wide on the turn and then even wider entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ANNIE'S BOY was away well to set the pace along the inside and proved much the best late. MAIUS pressed the pace on the outside but could not go with
the winner late and held second. WEST DAWN made a sweeping three wide move on the turn and was gaining late while never a threat to the winner. UZI
raced five wide on the turn and was making a mild bid late. HERZEN was forced five wide on the turn and could not make up ground. EMPEROR'S
CHOICE was up close just off the pace but faded through the stretch. CURRY FLURRY was well back and tried to make a wide move through the stretch.
BAILEYS IRISH raced along the inside and offered little in the stretch. GO LITTLE TE raced midpack along the inside but faded in the stretch. MR. B. G.'S
CREED was in tight quarters up the backstretch and was shuffled back and was not a factor after that.
