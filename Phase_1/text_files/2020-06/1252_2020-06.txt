Footnotes
PURPLE HEART ROAD five wide when withing striking distance into the first turn, raced four wide onto the backstretch, continued four wide in the run up
the backstretch and into the far turn while settled, set down into the stretch, closed with good interest to be up in time in the final strides. CHROMED HEART
four wide while also forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked in the three path the middle half, advanced and challenged on the outside entering the
stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, led late, caught late. BIG HEADED BABY in the second flight while racing just off the inside, continued behind the
leaders in run up the backstretch, challenged between rivals and inside the runner up turning for home, dueled with that one until late and weakened.
RUNCIMAN void of early foot, raced back, distanced some mild interest in improving after a half then flattened out when the real running began entering the
stretch. DON'T LOOK broke on top, raced with the early pace inside, chased the leader up the backstretch, took over along the inside into the far turn, vied
into the lane while remaining closest to the inside and gave way when headed. BOSTON BOOM last away, raced always back. JOHNNY CASINO moved
up to set the pace before a quarter, clear backstretch, stopped far turn when headed.

Footnotes
SILVER KING outrun in the early going while saving ground, angled out when beginning to advance turning for home, four wide into the straight, steadily
drifted in while moving to challenge, exchanged bumps with the runner up inside the furlong grounds when that rival came out slightly, continued to drift in
maintaining contact with that same foe in the run to the wire, displayed good determination to be up in the late going. MANGELSEN broke alertly, set a legit
pace along the inside, shook well clear midway on the final turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage midstretch, came out just as the winner was
challenging under a left handed stick to exchange bumps with less than a furlong remaining, floated in by that same rival in the run to the wire, held on
gamely to miss. WHATAFIND lacked early foot, came five wide into the lane when beginning a mild rally, proved no match for the top two late while finishing
clear of the others. FREE INDEED closest to the runner up off the inside, had little left for the drive. STANDING MAN went one paced while racing off the
inside. SHAQ JACK settled off the pace, came four wide and in some traffic behind the winner turning for home, lacked a closing kick. SHOT ON WINDY
HILL settled toward the front and the inside for six furlongs, weakened late. OUR BERMUDA broke back, lagged well back and was never a threat.
PRIVATE REALITY off slow, was also always outrun. KISS OF THE WOLF forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, stopped after a half.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MANGELSEN AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE
RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
TWO WITH A TEN broke alertly, vied up front while between horses, edged clear when straightened for home, responded when challenged late, dug in and
prevailed in game fashion. FLASH MEDIA last to leave, remained well back in the run up the backstretch, made a good gain while saving ground through
the turn, encountered some traffic late in the bend, split foes past nearing the furlong marker, challenged inside the winner late but was outkicked in the
waning strides. CAJUN SHOTS bothered slightly at the start, settled in mid pack while racing off the inside three wide into the lane, bit closer nearing the
furlong marker, could not match strides with the top two late, best of the rest. SHEZA MEAN BROAD raced within striking distance toward the inside, two
path into the lane, roused, lacked a winning response. PIPER'S BUTTERCUP also raced toward the front, four wide through the turn, had little left for the
drive as well. LITTLE BROWN EYES dropped to the inside after the start, saved ground through the turn, briefly waited for room turning into the lane along
the rail, found lacking when clear for the drive. TOSHITA FOREVER broke back, moved out, five wide through the turn, improved slightly while not a serious
threat. MY GIRL EM off a step slow, fell far back in hand, displayed some moderate late interest after the issue had been decided. THE LADY RULES vied
up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. I AM THE FIRE five wide when mid pack through the turn, also backed up in the drive. ORANGE TWISTER
pressed the issue in the three path for four furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
TEMPLE SHADOW prompted the pace while off the inside, continued to stalk three wide in the run up the backstretch, challenged on the outside turning for
home, long drive, proved best in a determined effort. FOR REAL ALICE broke up with the leaders, raced in the second flight inside, fell back while saving
ground through the second turn, asked along into the straight, rebid between rivals, past the furlong marker, outkicked by the winner late, held sway for the
place. SUNDEREYA lacked early foot while moving toward the inside early, remained in hand, rallied three wide into the lane, gained the show while getting
to the top pair late. THAI CHILI SUE settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer four wide into the far turn, continued in the four path around that bend,
made a mild close while not a serious threat late. FOUR PRINCESSES broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside,continued to vie into the lane, gav
eway late. ANCONA dueled up front while off the inside, weakened in the drive. VERONICA'S DREAM off a step slow, moved out, raced five wide out of the
final turn when back, failed to muster a rally. SAGE'S EPIPHANY trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TIZ ONE FEE outrun in the early going, moved a bit closer toward the inside exiting the turn, waited briefly then split foes inside the furlong ground,
accelerated to be edging clear at the end. COOL SPRING broke well from the middle of the gate, showed the way up the backstretch, given a breather
through the turn while clear, roused for the drive, led late, proved no match for the winner, held the place. ISLAND BLUE forwardly placed toward the inside,
in some traffic late in the turn while continuing to save ground, lodged a mild bid late, not enough. LIL ALLIE DANCER settled off the pace, moved to within
striking distance by late in the turn in some traffic, came up empty as well the final furlong. MISS GURETTA fell quickly back after the start, continued to trail
turn, came six wide into the lane, found best stride too late while running down the middle of the strip. JEWELS OF SORCE settled early three wide, came
four wide into the lane in the second flight, flat late. GLORIETA pressed the runner up off the inside, weakened in the drive. CHAMPAGNE MOMENT raced
in mid pack off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called on in the drive. ARGUMENT WON failed to menace with a four wide trip. BECCA'S WHISPER
five wide through the turn in lacking speed, remained back through the stretch. HARLANS WARRIOR staged a steady retreat.

SIR TRUEBADOUR settled in the second flight off the rail, came up empty for the drive. SPEEDY FELLAR void of speed after being last away, shifted out
when straightened for home, made a late run well out in the course to be getting to the runner up late. WIN LION WIN outrun in the early going inside,
moved closer and lodged a bid along the rail late in the turn, drew clear through the lane under steady urging. GRAND LUWEGEE well back off the early
pace, dropped inside for the run through the turn, followed the winner into the lane while continuing to save ground, proved no match for that rival late,
narrowly lasted for the place. WONDER RUN broke alertly, pressed the early pace, steadily faded. OIL MONEY took command start, set the early pace off
the inside, allowed the winner the inside late in the turn, faltered when headed by that one.

Footnotes
RIDE TO THE WIRE broke sharp, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn while in hand, cruised
home to steadily increased advantage while being kept to task. MAJESTIC HERO also away well, chased the winner in vain throughout, could do little with
that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. SUCH forwardly placed while four wide into and through the turn, saved the show while no match for the
top two. CHRONIQUEUR steadied when in tight at the start, raced well back for a half, roused when straightened for home, finished willingly with a rally
through traffic. BLUSHING DREAMER settled in mid pack toward the inside, in the two path entering the stretch, between rivals while withing striking
position for the show spot a furlong out, came up empty. BRAZOSWILDCAT one paced along the inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, also
found lacking in the final furlong. HONOR MY SPEED even effort while in mid pack throughout. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE last to leave, never menaced. LION
RAMPANT made little impact. FLASH DANCERLUCK forwardly placed for three furlongs off the inside, backed up in the drive. CHIMNEYVILLE remained
always back. HEART WARRIOR broke out, bothered foe, moved outside, five to six wide late in the turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
QUIKFAST N AHURRY broke with the pack, fell back, moved out, began to move four wide early in the turn, reached the front turning for home, quickly
clear, won geared down, ridden out. SPECIAL CONNECTION lacked speed toward the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, split foes upper stretch, proved
no match for the winner, finished willingly to be clearly second best. HEY GRACE closest to the leader, briefly challenged between that rival and the winner
turning for home, proved no match for the latter, nor could contain the runner up. STORIED TRIP off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home,
lacked a serious closing response. SEE SASSY RUN forwardly placed along the inside, tired in the drive. SIENNA BREEZE fractious in the gate prior to the
start, away well, cleared before a quarter, showed the way through the turn, gave way when confronted into the lane, drifted while continuing to give way to
the wire.

Footnotes
SPENDAHOLIC close from the start, dueled through the turn off the inside, disposed of the other speed in upper stretch, remained clear to the wire while
under steady handling. PRE HEAT lacked early foot, angled out four wide when advancing late in the turn, finished well to be clear for the place, no match
for the winner. RISKEY TRICKEY broke sharp, narrowly set the early pace along the rail, dueled inside the winner through the turn, could not keep up with
that one in the drive, proved no match for the runner up, lasted for the show. SUPERCONDUCTOR pressed the issue early while off the inside, began to
gradually weaken early in the turn. WHITE RUSSIAN bumped, last to leave, raced back, five wide through the turn,improved position while not a major
factor. JAIL HOUSE void of speed while out in the strip, came five wide out of the turn, passed tiring rivals, not dangerous. ROUND QUARTER within
striking distance for three furlongs along the inside, had little left for the drive. SON OF PATRIOT trailed much of the way, passed tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. AMPHIBIAN in mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. OFFICER SID settled off the pace, faded in the
drive. RHETT N' SCARLETT staged a steady retreat.
