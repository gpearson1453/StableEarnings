Footnotes
GAME SET AND MATCH shifted in early settled in the back half racing just off the rail through the first turn, moved out a bid heading up the backstretch,
went in the four to five path on the far turn commencing a bid, ground away steadily through the lane to just get up. KEATON stalked two to three wide just
off the leader around the first turn, kept wider still up the backstretch, inherited the lead past the three-eighths while shifting in back to the two to three path,
was clear on the far turn, lugged out at the top of the stretch and kept on late. THIRSTY MONKEY raced off the leading pair three to four wide, began to
edge closer leaving the far turn but steadied slightly as KEATON came out in upper stretch then ran on well. LIL LATIGO was just a bit reluctant to load,
caught six wide in the early going just off the leaders, shifted in midway up the backstretch, made a bid inside rivals in mid-stretch but was outfinished.
MOMMA JOKE was four to five wide through the first turn then moved in a bit leaving that bend, dropped back heading up the backstretch, went in the three
to four path on the far turn and failed to rally. LOOKINFORAVICTORY raced wide in the five path early, shifted in heading up the backstretch and was never
a threat. C T BEACON'S HILL was never involved racing off the fence in the three to four path, was distanced, not persevered with in the final sixteenth and
walked off. BEAN AND THE BUG set the pace on or just off the rail, bore out near the three-eighths, was pulled up and vanned off. Following an objection
by the rider of THIRSTY MONKEY against KEATON alleging interference at the top of the stretch, the stewards upon review disqualified the latter and
placed him third behind the former.

Footnotes
MYHOTRODLINCOLN attended the pace from between runners to the three-sixteenths, the outside rival at that point dropping back, dueled briefly outside
SHANGROYAL into upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker and forged clear late. SHANGROYAL vied inside the winner but off the rail, was no
match for that one but held the place from DONTPREACHTO DARCY, who raced outside the second flight going four to five wide on the turn, ran on late
but missed second. MR MOO trailed early and shifted in, went in the two path through the turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch and improved
position. DEVIL'S TEETH lacked early speed soon after the break, moved up to be three to four wide between rivals in the second flight late up the
backstretch, failed to rally. KRIS WHO vied outside the top pair going four wide on the turn, faltered and faded. LODE THE GOLD broke a bit awkwardly,
was inside the second flight and came up empty.

Footnotes
SILVER SECRET R F set the pace racing off the rail, went into the turn in the three path on a clear lead and moving in just a bit on that turn, came back out
to the four path leaving that bend, held safe from ZIPTIME, who was urged at the break but lacking speed, moved up in the two path into the turn, kept on to
bid inside late but had too much to do. LAYCOCK BAY settled just off the leaders going outside through the turn and six deep, drifted out in late stretch.
SOME ASSEMBLY REQD pursued the leaders five wide then easing back and shifting late on the turn, went evenly in the lane. MEGA SOURCE raced in
the back half of the field outside, went in the five then four path on the turn, came out seven to eight deep into upper stretch and improved some. QUICK N
QUIET moved up saving ground on then just off the rail through the turn but had no rally. MEMORY TAKER exchanged a light brush at the break, chased
the pacesetter and eventual winner from just outside going four wide on the turn, faltered in the stretch and faded. KARAOKE CAT was between rivals up
the backstretch for a bit after exchanging light contact at the start, dropped back in the three path into and on the turn and failed to rally thereafter. REINING
PESOS trailed early, entered the turn on the rail gradually moving out to the three path by late on that bend, angled nine wide into upper stretch and was not
a threat. SHANGHAIED ROO broke well but soon dropped back, raced off the inside in the four to five path on the turn coming out eight deep into upper
stretch and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHEZA DANDY R F came in after the break bumping a rival, contended outside three wide, moved clear on the turn and held sway. YES I'M GOOD was
bumped into a rival and bobbled after the break, switched outside a foe passing the half-mile marker, went four wide on the turn and kept on in the lane.
SHESAPACKINPUNCHES was bumped into a rival after the break, chased in behind off the fence, went in the two then three path on the turn and kept on
in the lane. BUOYANCE was bumped after the break, pressed from between rivals, dropped back on the turn going in the two to three path on that bend
and failed to rally in the lane. TOUCH ME ILL DANCE raced outside just off the leaders in the three to four path on the turn and failed to rally. STEALING
HOME appeared to stumble badly while perhaps losing footing in the hind end a few strides out of the gate, was thereupon taken hold for much of the run
up the backstretch, allowed to run thereafter while swinging seven wide into the stretch. MISS DOMESIUS was forwardly-placed inside to prompt the early
pace, faltered and faded. Following an objection by the riders of both SHESAPACKINPUNCHES AND YES I'M GOOD against SHEZA DANDY R F alleging
interference after the start, the latter was disqualified from first and placed fourth behind BUOYANCE for causing chain-reactive interference to that foe.

Footnotes
STORMIN FAST stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, led by the sixteenth and edged clear. HOLD ME ONLY broke slowly but soon moved up
outside rivals, went four to five wide on the turn, altered inside foes in upper- to mid-stretch and gained the place. SEVEN SILVER COINS came out a bit
after the break to vie inside rivals but several paths removed from the rail, went in the two to three path mostly through the turn dueling inside a foe, drifted
out a bit into upper stretch and was outfinished. LATIGO RIO broke outwardly just a bit, contested the pace from outside going four wide on the turn, drifted
out a bit in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. INDEFINITELY broke a step slowly and steadied slightly at the start when in tight, shifted in and
saved ground on the rail, came out in upper stretch and improved. MR GOLD MAN was carried out early and exchanged some contact with outside rivals,
shifted in midway up the backstretch, saved ground on the rail through the turn but had no rally in the lane. CHARLIE COMANCH bumped hard with the
outside rival when forced out then with inside foe soon after the break, dropped back and raced outside going in the four path into the turn and moving out to
the six path by late on that bend, needed more late. HENRY ON THE RUN broke a bit awkwardly, switched outside a rival up the backstretch, went two to
three deep on the turn and into upper stretch four to five wide but was not a threat. WISKEY CROWN drifted out shortly after the break, showed brief foot
chasing from between the leaders, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. MR LEVI CANYON steadied and bumped hard with a
rival early, shifted in going three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace. Following a stewards' inquiry, MR GOLD MAN was disqualified from sixth
and placed tenth behind MR LEVI CANYON for interference.
