Footnotes
GRAND SIERRA pressed inside early, held rail through the turn and inched away late inside of rival. LOVE AND HOLD set pace through the turn, drifted out
top of the lane and drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was caught late. BIG FAST CAT stalked two wide going into the turn, came out into the three path
at the top of the lane, was asked and safely held third. MALIBU MAGIC stalked between, steadied approaching the turn, went three wide into the turn, then
summoned a mild rally in the lane. BOB AGAIN chased inside throughout and had no response when asked and was outfinished. IMPEACHMENT ACE
lacked speed and settled three wide in the back of the pack, entered the stretch four wide and was not a factor.
