Footnotes
CASTANUELA (MEX) came away in good order, tracked the pace on the outside, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn,
moved clear nearing the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker,
shortened stride into the final sixteenth and was fully extended to last. LADY EXPRESS was urged along off the pace, dropped back passing the
seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursed the winner under the whip into the final furlong, gained fast into
the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. DUSTWHIRL WONDER bumped with a rival at the start, established a good position just off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path, waited from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch, pursued the winner under the
whip into the final furlong, gained fast into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the show. WILLTHERESAWAY was ridden along towards the rear on
the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and improved position. PERFORMANCE WRITER was urged along off the pace, went four to five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GIVEN KISSES chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into
the stretch and tired. SKIRT WARNING was ridden along towards the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. RANGER
CONNECTION broke in and bumped with a rival, settled well back in the field, was urged two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.
GORGEOUSWITHA G broke out and was slow into stride, moved up on the outside under urging, chased five then six wide on the turn and came up empty.
ROSEMARY BEACH broke out at the start, checked sharply early then dropped back, angled to the outside of the field then advanced under urging, went
six then seven wide on the turn and had nothing left. SALTY HEART was away alertly, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead at the
seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail early on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and faded. HI SKOOL SWEETHART was completely
unprepared at the start, had her head stuck down to the inside and left the gate extremely far behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the three
path and trailed.

Footnotes
TEMPLE TOWER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well into the final sixteenth and surged by foes in the final stride to prevail under strong handling. FASHION
ISLAND moved out into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled just off the pace, was taken up briefly outside the half-mile pole, wen three to four
wide under urging on the far turn, chased outside into the final furlong, gained a short lead four strides from the wire but was denied while just able to get the
place. SHAKE IT UP TRACY went around the first turn in the four path, set the pace on the outside of two foes, moved clear outside the half-mile pole then
dropped in, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths, led determinedly under a drive into the final
sixteenth but was caught while narrowly able to get the show. NOTORIOUS GAL went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer near
the seven-sixteenths, chased two to three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the leader into the final sixteenth and
finished with good courage but just missed the trifecta in a four-way photo. NIMBLE KITTEN saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was
urged along while inside on the far turn, moved out under a drive in the vicinity of the furlong marker and gained late but failed to menace. ORATORY

dropping from the two path to the rail on the far turn and tired. LOTS OF MOXIE saved ground on the first turn, prompted the pace on the inside, dropped
back outside the half-mile pole, came up empty into the far turn and faded. LOVE YAMARI was very rank under tight restraint into the first turn, rounded that
bend in the two path, settled at the back, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 20 Feet)

Footnotes
R B TOO set the pace on the outside under pressure, shook off multiple foes in the two path inside the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage while set
down into upper stretch and drew away under the whip until the final forty yards then was hand ridden to the wire a much the best winner. EL CHOCOLATE
lacked speed while ridden along, angled in inside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and safely secured the place
while no match for the winner. CORD'S KOKO NIGHT was urged along on the outside, advanced quickly leaving the backstretch, made a three to four wide
bid from the three-eighths to about the five-sixteenths then chased the winner, dropped back into the stretch and tired while best of the rest. FIRST BUMP
RIDGE was off a bit slow, moved up under urging, chased along the rail early on the turn, made a brief bid near the five-sixteenths then chased the winner,
dropped back in the two path into upper stretch and capitulated. IVAN'S HEART settled off the pace, was ridden along passing the half-mile pole, dropped
back fast in the two then three path on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. DUHOPPER pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, was
urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, dropped back fast in the two path on the turn and also faltered then was eased but walked off. FOR D'S KNIGHT
was urged along off the pace, dropped back under strong urging late on the backstretch, went wrong outside the quarter-pole and fell then was vanned off.
TEXAS HEAT broke a bit slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, dropped well behind, swerved trying to avoid the fallen foe outside the quarter-pole
and unseated the rider then was walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident on the turn, no change was made to the order of finish.

drive, rallied in the final furlong and finished fast for the show but was too late for victory. HALLMARK GIRL broke out at the start, chased the pace on the
outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. MILLI STARR was urged along off the pace,

Footnotes
DON'T FORGET drifted out just after the start then was corrected by the rider, moved in gradually while settling on the outside, tucked into the three path
entering the turn, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole then rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker, drew clear
under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. MAJOR BROWN was rated just off the pace on
the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked while given a clear opening at the quarter-pole and earned the place while no match for the winner.
TROY OUNCE broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, took the lead briefly at the three-sixteenths
then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match then lost the place but was clear for the show. COLOMBARD was urged along off the pace,
rounded the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. MAJOR
SHIPMAN settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. CHRONIQUEUR settled towards the rear, was urged four
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. R H SMOAKEM showed good speed and set the pace under pressure, vied in the two
path under urging on the turn, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths then dropped back into upper stretch and tired. EYE CLOUD was hard ridden at the rear
of the field, went four wide on the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch, moved further out around the furlong marker and was no factor. COOL QUARTET
broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside to the two path on the turn and failed to respond. WITT LOVES TACOS broke out at
the start, was urged along on the far outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and faltered.
