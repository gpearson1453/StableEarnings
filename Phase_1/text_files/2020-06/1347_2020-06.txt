Footnotes
SASSY GAL vied between rivals to the turn, continued outside JASMINE BABY three wide on that bend taking a narrow lead by the top of the stretch, held
that rival under a drive. JASMINE BABY vied inside rivals but a path removed from the fence with a narrow lead, was overtaken but fought on gamely while
clearly second best. RAGTIME RYTHM pressed from outside the aforementioned duo, went four wide on the turn encouraged along by the quarter pole to
keep up but proved no match for those. SHAME ON BEA broke just a half-step slowly, raced toward the back early having moved well off the inside, went in
the four to five path on the turn and ran on. MISS SPOONER chased from outside, shifted in two wide leaving the backstretch and to the rail nearing the
three-sixteenths, came up empty in the stretch. FUEGO Y FURIA trailed early, avoided a stricken foe past the quarter pole by angling out. IM MACYS
PRINCESS chased inside, fell past the quarter pole and was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

DADDY WHAT IF got away slowly, advanced into and on the turn going in the three then four path, swung out seven wide into upper stretch and drove past
late. RISKY REVENGE vied between runners early then outside going three wide on the turn, led in upper- to mid-stretch but was outkicked. BLUE BOY
WHO moved up to prompt the pace inside, contended through the turn and weakened some. EL CHUMELITO broke awkwardly, pressed and then chased
from outside going four wide on the turn then weakened some. RIO CUTIE vied inside rivals but off the rail then briefly between rivals before dropping back
early on the turn, moved out a path on that bend and could not rally thereafter. TU SOLO TU switched out quite wide early, moved in from the four to the two
path early on the turn and was never a threat. STRIKE RATE lacked early speed despite encouragement, raced a path or two removed from the rail through
the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
YES ITSA STAR set the pace from off the inside, went four wide into the turn moving in a path on that bend while edging clear, held sway under hand urging
till being eased up nearing the wire. MUSCLE HEAD exchanged a light brush at the start, switched outside rivals heading up the backstretch, went five then
four wide on the turn just off the leader, could make no headway on that rival in the lane while preserving the place. FIFTEEN TO VEGAS moved well off the
inside in the early going and advanced between rivals heading to the turn, moved in from the four path to the two path early on that bend then back out a
further path turning for home, could make no headway late and was unable to get past inside MUSCLE HEAD for the place. ICED was mid-pack and well off
the inside early, went six then five wide on the turn and was no match for the top ones. RADICAL ERUPTION raced along the inside late up the backstretch,
switched outside rivals three wide near the five-sixteenths early on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. INCLUDE HOO exchanged a light brush at the start
and was away last, switched out heading up the backstretch to be widest of all into the turn, moved in from seven deep to about five wide on that bend and
had no rally in the lane. COMMANCHERO SPRING was forwardly-positioned briefly from between rivals, dropped back and shifted in going three then two
wide on the turn and was empty for the drive. MARTHAS BOY was forwardly-positioned briefly inside rivals just off the fence, moved to the rail early on the
turn, was empty in the stretch. CONGRATS GIVEN raced off the inside well back, went in the three to four path on the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
NEW ADVENTURE moved to the fore from between rivals after the opening three-sixteenths, set the tempo thereafter with outside pressure racing in about
the three path, edged away from foes on the turn into upper stretch while getting out just a hair nearing the end of the turn, was clear into mid-stretch and
held under steady handling. MINNIE ME HA settled off the leaders, was caught five wide entering the turn then shifted in to the three path by the mid-point
of that bend, was kept busy to gain the place while unable to reach the winner. TIZ DONNA BELLA set the early pace from outside, was overtaken past the
half-mile marker and continued to press from between runners going four wide into the turn, was placed in tight quarters near the three-sixteenths, ran on
evenly in the stretch. INVODKAWETRUST switched well off the inside early racing in the back half, moved nearer the inside leaving the backstretch to be
about three wide into the turn, shifted out six wide by the latter part of that bend, altered inside rivals in mid-stretch and ran on. CRAVING YOU moved up
outside foes to reach contention five wide on the turn, weakened in the lane. SHADOW ME GRAY trailed early, went widest into the turn going six then five
wide on that bend, was never a threat. MAGA PARTY bobbled slightly at the start, showed brief speed inside then steadily retreated. DIAMOND Z
ROSEBUD was ridden along early to chase the leaders, dropped back leaving the backstretch from the four path going in that lane through the turn and was
empty thereafter.

WILLY TELL HIM set the pace from outside rivals, went three wide on the turn coming out a bit leaving that bend, drew clear and held sway. TANZANITE
moved forward inside, made a mild brief bid early on the turn, was placed in tight quarters near the sixteenth pole but won the battle for place over SUPER
SWISS, who was forced out a bit at the start, was forwardly-placed under some coaxing, went between rivals in contention on the turn, lugged in a bit at the
sixteenth pole under a right handed whip and was outfinished for second. I B EZ raced outside just off the leaders, went in the four path on the turn and ran
on evenly. GETTY was just a bit fractious, hopped at the start, switched outside early, went in the six path into the turn moving in to the four path by the end
of that bend and was not a threat. FRAT BOY was off the leaders racing in the four path into the turn, moved in a path on that bend and had no rally. TIZ
TITUS bobbled slightly at the break, was outpaced early and never near enough to threaten. BACK SEAT HERO broke out a bit, raced off the inside going
in the two to four path through much of the turn before swinging out nine deep into upper stretch and was not a threat.
