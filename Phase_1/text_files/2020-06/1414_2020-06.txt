pressure from EFFINITY to the outside, got headed near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole,
then weakened through to the finish. DATA DEAL coaxed from the start, chased four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, continued four wide for

stretch, was unable to make an impact. TOM'S CHOICE fractious prior to the start breaking open the stall door, was backed out and reloaded prior to the
start, got coaxed away from the gate and chased just off the inside through the turn, went two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COILEAN BAWN off about a length the quickest, saw IN FRONT establish the top soon afterwards, was well reserved keeping watch on that opponent from
along the inside during the initial stages, got eased to the outside and into the two path early on the backstretch, departed it from the same one, tipped into
the three path coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, ventured onward to the end of the second bend yet on hold, got turned loose stepping up to the
three-sixteenths marker, inched up on the front runners, snatched away the advantage with under a sixteenth to go and edged away. FORTUNA went on to
attain a forward position after bumping lightly with IN FRONT, stalked the same rival afterwards while stationed in the two path, increased its presence
during the run around the far turn, got cued up and challenged in earnest in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, forged to the front, relinquished
reluctantly with under a sixteenth remaining, stayed on well for the place. IN FRONT out with her first step, made contact with her next door neighbor,
rapidly shook it off and grabbed the advantage, slid over to the inside, was then rated along showing the way, accompanied by the second place finisher to
the outside, was called upon when put to the test by that foe right around the three-sixteenths pole, yielded, weakened into the show slot. ASTOUNDMENT
stayed along the inside once the field had been released, was sighted pulling on the bit for much of the journey leading up to the crown of the backstretch,
closed the gap after inheriting the pocket soon after leaving the clubhouse bend, kept pace with the front runners, got called upon nearing the quarter pole,
altered course into the three path from upper to midstretch, flattened out. ALL OTHERS FOLLOW (GB) pursued the pace from the two path, swung into the
lane and failed to fire appreciably. TONAL VERSE settled towards the back of the pack after the start, was under a firm hold wedged in between rivals while
towards the three path on the first turn, continued to race from along the outside on the backstretch, shifted over to the rail at the half mile pole, was
maneuvered back to the outside for the drive home, winding up in the four path, came up empty. CURLY WURLY underwent a three to four wide trip to the
quarter pole, had no response.

Footnotes
CREATIVE STYLE off the inside throughout, sat within striking distance two to three wide, began the run around the bend being lightly urged along to keep
pace, got set down springing from the five-sixteenths marker, angled towards the four path for entrance into the stretch, clawed his way towards the one to
catch, grabbed away the advantage just beyond the eighth pole and kicked clear. LEITONE (CHI) responded to mild encouragement during the opening
phases to rush up to contest the pace, went about his business primarily from the two path until the half mile pole, shifted closer to the rail once on the turn,
with AUTOSTRADE likewise moving closer to the inside, got turned loose for the drive home, shook off the aforementioned foe only to get pounced upon by
the eventual winner, yielded for good with under a furlong remaining, stayed on for the place. HOFFENHEIM took up position in midpack after the start,
travelled three wide on the turn, was moved out into path five for the stretch run, proved no match. AMERICAN LINCOLN sat forwardly placed along the
inside, was put to a drive after reaching the half mile pole, stepped into the stretch and made no headway. AUTOSTRADE pressed the issue from path
three for much of the first half, was in the two path undergoing the task on the bend, came under a ride spinning into the lane, got shaken off then steadily
backed away. SHADOW RIDER in the two path leaving the backstretch, was under a drive to no avail on the turn, angled five wide into the lane, continued
to offer no response. HOLIDAY BONUS took up chase from the two path after stumbling at the start, folded.

MISS YOU BLUES three then four wide in pursuit from mid pack, advanced to be just off the pace when set down spinning four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to duel with TRANSLATE through the final furlong taking a narrow advantage a sixteenth out and shook away gamely at the end to prevail.
TRANSLATE four then three wide in aim of the front, advanced to take over command nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, came under lone
threat and dug in knocking heads from the eighth pole through to just inside the sixteenth marker battling on gamely, ultimately got shaken off in the final
jumps while clear of the rest for the place honors. YELLEN pressed the pace of LUCKY LINDSEY from the outside three then two wide placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. MARIPOSA D'ORO
broke in at the start bumping SASSY SECRET, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in
the late going. SHANNY GO NANNY chased along the inside from mid pack, angled out five wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, offered no
response. ALWAYS ALRIGHT veered out at the start, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, went five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. QUEEN DAVEIGH three then two wide at the tail of the field, got
coaxed along midway on the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. SASSY SECRET bumped at the start by MARIPOSA D'ORO
who broke inwards, showed brief speed pressing the pace along the inside down the backstretch, got shaken off into the turn and was coaxed along, faded
through the latter portion of the bend and went just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the stretch. CHIC BELLA four then three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and tired. MUSICAL THUNDER chased three wide until tucked to the inside half a mile
out, got pushed along with three-eighths to go, swung three wide for home and made no impact. LUCKY LINDSEY established the front and showed the
way in hand from the two path under pressure from a flanking pair, shook off the inside foe tucking to the inside into the turn, continued under pressure from
a pair to the outside through the bend coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got headed inside that station, cut the corner into upper stretch,
folded, and was eased in the final furlong.

ARCHUMYBABY emerged from a tightly-packed group with a forward position shortly after the start, cut over into the two path, pressed the issue from
between rivals during the run around the bend, stepped into the lane still tussling with the other two, was switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of
the three-sixteenths pole, left the eighth pole with the runner up directly abreast, not much separating them with regards as to who was in front, began to
come out a little from left side stick work as the nemesis began to come in herself from stick work being applied on the opposite side, saw the twosome
brush with other twice after meeting up with approximately a sixteenth remaining, fought onward gamely to prove best by the narrowest of margins. JUMP
FOR JOY moved up in tow with the winner to confront CAMORRA as the first fraction was being finalized. sat perched three wide, vying as the widest of
three on the turn, swung into the lane with the pace dispute still going on, was the last to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring slightly beyond the
three-sixteenths marker, vied with vigour matched up with the top one, started to drift inward from right side pressure in deep stretch, eventually brushing
two times with ARCHUMYBABY, continued at it eye to eye with that rival only to be the one denied. QUEEN KAHEN kept watch on the three front runners
fighting for the top from path two, between rivals for much of the opening half, came into the lane then mustered up a mild response, sufficient enough to lay
claim to the show award. MISS JAK underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, had some gain but all
accomplished without impact. CAMORRA got corrected after breaking slightly to the outside, was clear for much of the trip on the backstretch, but had
company by the top of the turn, was forced to fend off two others to her outside, came under a drive just shy from the quarter pole, relinquished soon
afterwards, tired in the final furlong. EXCESS CAPACITY four wide onto the turn, got sent out into path five exiting it, gave way. TROPICAL JOY along the
overland route at all times, never got involved. MO FLASH left the post parade early and sprinted off towards the top of the clubhouse turn, proceeded to get
pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, got guided over to the inside, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

Footnotes
THE CARETAKER went over into the three path proceeding along the backstretch, was asked to pick it up at the midway point on the turn, kept pace of the
front runners, swung three wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, struck the front in midstretch, felt the presence of the second
place finisher in the final stages, had just enough left to preserve the decision. KAZMANIA settled in as the trailer, stepped onto the turn two to three wide,
was put to a drive right around the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane and began to narrow in, split rivals with a furlong to go, was under left side stick
work getting worked into path four leaving the sixteenth marker, displayed a turn of late foot, fell short. LEAKY CUP went on to prompt STEAM ENGINE two
to three wide after breaking through the gate, applied some pressure on that pacesetter all the way to the end of the bend, wasn't able to claim the top,
weakened in the last eighth. STEAM ENGINE hand urged to establish the front end, was kept to it after having done so, cut the pace, spaced at a slight
distance from off the inside route, got turned loose for the drive, yielded in midlane and backed away. CASTLE CASANOVA brushed at the start, was two
wide entering the turn and sent out four wide leaving it, had no offering. SUMMER BOURBON off the inside, brushed with CASTLE CASANOVA right after
the start, took up position in midpack, raced four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, gave out. NUEVA YORK broke through the gate,
appeared to come away after being re-loaded without apparent mishap, was down on the rail well before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, got
heavily roused after the half had been reeled off, cut the corner into the and faltered.

Footnotes
JACK AND NOAH (FR) established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm through
swift splits, tucked along the inside through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in and held well to the finish to prevail in
Bill Daly fashion. TURNED ASIDE two to three wide in closest pursuit of the aforementioned foe, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from home, angled four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to chase the winner home. OLD CHESTNUT brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three
then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. MAXWELL ESQUIRE
chased along the inside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GUILDSMAN (FR)
chased along the inside in aim of the front, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the late stages. CHIMNEY
ROCK brushed the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. SO STREET coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ROZIERE took up the chase from path four for over three-quarters, was given her cue challenging for command slightly nearer the rail in upper stretch,
fought her way by COURTED inside the sixteenth marker and edged clear. LUCKY LATKES made it over to the rail by the end of the opening phases,
changed her course of action and tipped back to the outside soon afterwards, underwent a three wide pursuit on the far turn, angled four wide entering the
stretch, came home with good energy to garner the place. COURTED appeared keen launching a three wide to the front end, got guided over to the rail
once on the backstretch, led the others yet appearing eager for some time afterwards, with ROSEY'S INVASION in accompaniment to the outside, was let
out being challenged by that opponent as the twosome stepped into the lane, staved that foe off only to have the winner to deal right afterwards,
relinquished with under a sixteenth remaining and weakened into the show slot. PAINITE moved over to the inside, saved ground until the quarter pole, was
cued up angling six wide for clearance during the early portion of the stretch run, had a good finish along the outside to be along for the final significant slice
of the purse. BROVIA remained stationed along the inside after the field had been sent off and running, was forced to be kept on hold approaching the
quarter pole, lacked racing room all the way down the lane, with the rider even needing to steady the mount off the heels of another in the final stages.
DERBY DOLL sat reserved in the two path in midpack, was asked for more for the drive home, was holding its ground when pinched in the vicinity of the
sixteenth pole, failed to regain its prior interest. ROSEY'S INVASION mostly strung out three wide on the first turn, attended the pacesetter from two path
once on the backstretch, stayed hitched up, swung into the lane and mustered up its best bid, got turned back during the next furlong, tired. GEN Z had the
rider take hold after bobbling at the start, raced three wide on turn two, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked the needed response. BANQUE DE
MARGAUX off a length the tardiest, was sighted two wide when put to the whip at the three-eighths pole, shifted four wide into the lane, made no impact.
TOPAZ BRIDE hung out in the three path on both turns, gave way. LA RUBIA saved ground to no avail. WALL EYE checked while seeming keen early on
the backstretch, lost momentum for the next four strides, resumed its pursuit from the two path, went one path farther off the rail into the stretch, folded.
