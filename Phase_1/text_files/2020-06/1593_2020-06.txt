Footnotes
STAGE FIVE CREEPER chased the two rival duel into the far turn while in the three path, asked for more after the three-eighths pole, was under increased
urging approaching the quarter pole, moved to the leader when straightening then edged clear and held. LUCKY BE A LADY vied for the lead along the
inside, moved clear in late far turn, was soon joined by the winner, could not keep up with that one while giving ground grudgingly. LADY BLUE was in the
three or four path through the turns, came into the lane from the five or six path and ran evenly through the final eighth. MARIA ROSE was along the inside
through the far turn, in contention entering the lane but lacked a closing kick while running evenly through the lane. GREEDY AMERICAN was never a
threat while in the three path through the far turn. KUPURI was off with a slight bobble, raced along the inside throughout and and made little impact.
CHARMING JILLY B vied for the lead two wide into mid-turn then faded.

Footnotes
C JS BILLY BYU stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid nearing the three-eighths pole, cleared into the lane then slowly widened to the
wire. GAMERA set the pace from the two path into the turn, was passed by the winner in mid-turn, lost the place spot after entering the lane then kept on
well to regain the place spot while not a threat to the winner. INTERFERENCE tracked the pacesetters while near the inside, came off the rail to bid from the
three path into the lane, looked to be a serious threat after straightening in the lane then faltered near the sixteenth pole and lost the place spot.
DARKNSTORMYTIME was never a threat while racing in the two path throughout. TUF INTENSITY was never a serious factor while in the three to the two
path through the turns. RHINESTONE ROMEO was steadied soon after the start while in between rivals, settled back while saving ground and was never in
it. SUNDAY SWAYIN trailed throughout while off the rail through the turns.

Footnotes
TAPIGAL chased the pacesetters through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, bid three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared and
widened through the final eighth while being kept to the task. HER GOLD MINE was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the five or six path and rallied for the place spot. DEAR THEODOSIA trailed into the lane while near the rail, continued to trail with an eighth to go then
was full of run while weaving through traffic the final sixteenth. FLAME OF ALBERTA was in the three path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a
closing response. BOO'S GAL hustled to the lead at once, remained in the top spot through the turn then gave way when headed. FLAT OUT MINKIE
pressed the vied for the lead into the lane while two wide and was empty nearing the eighth pole. BLUNT BRUNETTE was in the two path through the turn,
angled into the lane from the seven path and never was a factor. SHE LIKES CASH trailed throughout while in the two path.
