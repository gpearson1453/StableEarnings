Footnotes
ROYAL LEIGE moved up on the turn giving steady surge to wrest the lead in upper stretch putting away rival widening under a drive. KING SHAWN chased
the pace rallying to draw even on the turn, overtaken from the inside in upper stretch held well though second best. ANYWHERE ROAD slow early lost
ground to upper stretch moving past the rest there racing seven wide. GOBARRYBARRY put in a mild bid on the turn then leveled off in upper stretch.
UNBRIDLEDSELECTION played no factor. ZERO FOR CONDUCT had some early speed then faded along the inside. ASTRO ORBITER broke sharply to
a clear lead, hooked on the turn would wilt in upper stretch. VOLCANO BAY bumped at the break would trail throughout.

MAXXIMUM ENERGY advanced on the turn collaring rival from the outside in upper stretch drawing out in the three path. TOMS CHUCHU in tight leaving
the gate was rushed clear setting the pace through the turn, hooked on the inside in upper stretch proved no match holding well to salvage place. DIG IN

drifted down to the rail in upper stretch fading there. GO HARLEY GO veered out a bit at the break, hustled inside would retreat on the turn. LION LION
raced mid pack tiring to upper stretch. JERRY THE BULL was never involved. LEAVING HOME raced evenly through the turn then wilted in upper stretch.
GATOR DON'T PLAY was always outrun.

Footnotes
LEADING INDICATOR bumped at the break would angle inside to the turn rallying to duel into upper stretch digging in gamely to clear late at the rail. TO
HONOR AND RUN away alertly pressed on pace through the turn dueling abreast rival down the lane ceding grudgingly at the end. GEMAGILITY a step
slow lost ground to upper stretch mustering a late rally in the six path. DEL'S BEAUTY raced mid pack moving evenly throughout. COME ON CALLIE
pressed then chased on the turn, wore down in upper stretch. SHIPMANS MAGIC bumping at the break played no factor. HOLIDAY BID was never
involved. UNUSUAL GATOR was always outrun. AZARCH gave way on the turn. MS. NINEONESEVEN chased through the turn wilting in the seven path
upper stretch.
