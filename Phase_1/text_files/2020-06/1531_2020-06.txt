Footnotes
CARDCOUNTER gained command soon after the break, stayed out from the rail while clear into the final furlong, responded when challenged and held
gamely. MISTER HUMOR broke slowly, advanced early between horses, steadied in tight two wide entering the turn, steadied again nearing the quarter
pole, was sent to vie inside the winner leaving the furlong grounds but wasn't enough. NOT FAKE NEWS stalked outside the winner in the three path, was
set down for the drive but lacked the needed closing. BOYS OF QUEENS broke in the air, trailed along the rail into the stretch then came out between
horses with a belated run. SAN ELIJO wasn't far back to the stretch while three wide then tired. WARLEGGAN had position along the rail to the stretch then
tired.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SPA was bumped into ADMIRATION after the break, settled two wide, began a run into the far turn, closed along the inside through the lane and
prevailed. PRATT dueled along the rail from the outset, drew off nearing the stretch but couldn't last. DULVERTON wasn't far back outside, was sent closer
three wide between rivals into the far turn then weakened in the lane. ADMIRATION was bumped leaving the gate, settled early, made a four wide run into
the far turn then flattened out in the lane. SPORTING ART came in on the winner leaving the gate, moved to duel two wide, faded through the lane then
collapsed in distress after the finish. JOE FLASH was outrun after a slow break. JOHNY LIGHTNIN wasn't far back along the rail to the far turn then tired.
BIFF raced three wide and was finished after five furlongs. MOSSBAWN showed little.

R LUCKY CHARM dueled along the rail from the outset, moved clear after five furlongs, remained clear into deep stretch and held. SHECOR settled
outside, rallied three wide around the turn then closed a gap through the final yards. SHACKLE ME GOOD wasn't far back early, made a run in the three
path on the turn but lacked a strong closing response. HIJINKS raced three wide with the pace into the final furlong then weakened. MISS FORESTER was
slow early, circled into the stretch and gained too late. ZANDORA dueled two wide between rivals into the turn, fell back nearing the quarter pole and faded
in the lane. GROTON ST SCOUT broke slowly, raced wide around the turn and failed to menace. STROLL ACTION steadied along the rail entering the turn,
stopped and was vanned off after the race. ICE PALACE was finished early.

INTERESTING LEGACY wasn't far back, steadied in tight quarters between horses nearing the turn, steadied again two wide between horses near the
quarter pole, swung to the outside entering the stretch, took over before a half then drove clear late. HEIKO broke in the air, moved to a short lead from the
outside nearing the end of the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and couldn't keep up with the winner late. ESKENFORTIME was slow early,
began a run along the rail on the turn, angled out through traffic through the final sixteenth and finished with good energy. SKY GAZER R V F raced inside
the winner early, steadied in tight nearing the quarter pole, steadied in early stretch then continued evenly. MR. TOP FLEET broke sharply to make the early
pace, remained prominent along the rail for over a half then weakened. CARDIO COWBOY raced the two path around the turn, angled wide into the stretch
and gained mildly. SCURLIN was no factor. C EM SMILE bobbled leaving the gate, raced the three path and tired. ZEUS ODIN raced three wide with the

SO GUCCI moved to a clear lead under rating early on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn, was put to whip in early stretch, bore out
late under left hand whip and held. FISH TO FRY chased, angled out nearing the five furlong pole, impeded TANYA'S GEM, angled out midway on the
backstretch, stayed well out from the inside around the turn and closed a gap too late. Following an objection by Hernandez, FISH TO FRY was disqualified
and placed fourth. SQUAN'S KINGDOM was slow to settle, raced two wide around the turn, angled to the rail entering the stretch and finished willingly.
TANYA'S GEM was advancing between rivals early on the backstretch when forced to check near the five-eighths pole, raced two wide around the turn and
lacked a strong closing. BRANDYWINES SECRET tired outside. FORMAL CLASS was outrun after a slow break. BARLEY JACK was outrun. MA DE TAW
briefly showed speed inside.
