Footnotes
DROP DEAD GORGEOUS dueled for the lead inside of CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR into and around the turn, shook loose from that foe turning for home,
widened her advantage in upper stretch under hand urging, and was ridden out to the wire. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR dueled for the lead outside of DROP
DEAD GORGEOUS into the turn, but was no match for that foe leaving it, then held place through the lane to prove second best. EXCELERITA prompted
the dueling leaders from the four then three path around the turn, but was no match for the eventual winner turning for home, and held show through the
lane. BETTER ANGELS bobbled a bit at the start and trailed the field early on, raced far off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, then
improved between horses with a mild kick through the lane, but was no threat to the leaders. LUSCIOUS was off slowly, then shied inwards from an outer
rival, pulled between horses down the backstretch to be within striking range of the leaders while in the two path into the turn, but failed to keep pace with
those foes turning for home, then kept on through the lane, but was caught for fourth approaching the wire. HER GIANT was forwardly placed four wide, got
kept in the five path around the turn by an inner rival, and failed to factor. FLASHBACK BEAR was off slowly, saved ground while far off of the pace around
the turn, but to no avail. ROZAFA was jostled slightly between horses while in midpack in the four path passing the nine sixteenths pole, took the turn in the
two path while far off of the pace, and failed to make an impact. SUPREME IRENE was unruly in the post parade and unsettled through the warm up,
brushed the gate when it opened, raced far off of the pace along the inside, but weakened into the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
HULEN prompted the pace from the three path while outside of a pair of rivals, made a three wide bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage
passing the furlong pole, and drew clear in the late stages. LITTLE ALEX set the pace while staying a path off of the rail, held a margin turning for home
while meeting bids from rivals on both side, dug in at the furlong pole as his outer foe forged an advantage, then kept on, but was only second best.
LOOTING was forwardly placed along the inside early on, made a rail bid in upper stretch as the leader left it opened, but failed to reach even terms and
was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong pole. BAYTOWN BEAR took the turn in the four path while outside of rivals in midpack, produced a four wide
bid outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, but flattened out at the three sixteenths pole due to failing to swap leads. OUR COMMISH was off a step
slowly and crowded between rivals at the start, raced far off of the pace in the three to five path and failed to make an impact. CANDY MOVER chased the
pace under coaxing two wide between horses, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole, then wandered about through the lane while green and
on her left lead. SEATTLE SEE YA was outrun early on, showed little.

Footnotes
FAST BOAT was a bumped, crowded and off a bit slowly at the start, advanced inside of rivals down the backstretch to stalk from the pocket into the turn,
split the leaders two wide at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage turning for home, responded willingly when asked passing the three sixteenths
pole, and kicked away with good courage. BULLETIN set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner turning for home, proved no
match for that foe in upper stretch, then saved place. TELL YOUR DADDY was outrun and trailed the field around the turn, shifted to the six path in
midstretch and offered a belated rally for a minor reward. JUST MIGHT bumped an inner foe at the start, raced midpack and shifted from the four path to the
fwo path into the turn, moved inside of rivals turning for home and produced a place bid between horses at the furlong pole, but did not have enough.
ELUSIVE MISCHIEF was outrun early, swung to the five path turning for home, and produced a mild kick on her left lead, but was outfinished for minor
rewards. MANIACAL shifted to the rail while far off of the pace into the turn, saved ground, but to no avail. FIELDER prompted the pace two wide between
horses, was shifted three wide when the eventual winner left the rail at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch,
and weakened late between horses. COPPER TOWN prompted the pace three wide, was floated four wide at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened
turning for home and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ADMIRE set a tepid pace along the inside, dug in inside of a pair of rivals in upper stretch, and drew clear from those foes again approaching the furlong
pole. ORO DE TEJANO stalked three wide early on, made a three wide bid for the lead outside of the dueling leaders turnig for home, but failed to match
strides with the eventual winner at the furlong pole, and proved second best. TRASHTALKINYANKEE prompted the pace setter from the outside, inched
forward around the far turn and dueled for the lead between rivals in upper stretch, but was turned back at the furlong pole and gave way in the late stages.
GALINDO advanced past tired rivals into the far turn while two wide, and failed to threaten. MARTIAL EAGLE bobbled a bit at the start, advanced along the
rail past tired foes into the far turn, but came under a drive at the seven sixteenths pole, then failed to make an impact thereafter. DADDY'S ON STRIKE
was caught three wide around the first turn, came under a drive at the nine sixteenths pole, but failed to factor. JUST LIKE RICHIE was caught four wide
while close to the pace around the first turn, failed to respond to coaxing at the five furlong pole, weakened to trail the field at the half mile pole, and
stopped.

HEROS REWARD stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, drew clear in the stretch and held sway in the final stages. HIDDEN RULER
dueled early on, was in the four path into the lane, darted out near the eighth pole under left handed whip with some gain on the winner in the final stages.
MAJESTIC WEST chased the pace early, raced along the six path into the lane, made a bid down the stretch, was bothered near the eighth pole with no
late gain thereafter. THE GREAT DANSKY bobbled at the start, stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, slightly steadied near the eighth pole
and lacked any late gain. HE'S A BABE was never a threat. LIVING VICARIOUSLY was slow at the start, showed brief speed then folded up. SACRED
OATH was outrun, eased in the stretch and vanned off after the race. The trainer of THE GREAT DANSKY claimed an objection against the rider of
MAJESTIC WEST for interference in the stretch run but after review by the stewards the claim was disallowed.
