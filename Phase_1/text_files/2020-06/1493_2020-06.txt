Footnotes
PHARAOH'S CITY settled off the pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch, lacked room, angled back in while still behind horses, found a seam
leaving the eighth pole, responded well and was up in deep stretch. THESE BLUES dueled two wide between foes, put away the pace rivals to briefly go
clear near the sixteenth pole, continued on the left lead and was caught in the final strides. KEEPING THE PEACE dueled inside of rivals to midstretch and
was outfinished. POPPY'S TWO STEP lacked early speed, raced three wide around most of the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. MY
BERNIE went evenly while racing two wide. C C'S WARRIOR disputed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. ADULATION stalked the early pace
outside, made a four wide bid to reach even terms nearing the lane then tired.

Footnotes
HARMONIC THUNDER settled off the pace four wide, cruised up four wide around the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly
cleared and held clear under left-handed urging. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS lacked early speed while saving ground, advanced four wide around the far turn
and was clearly second best. JUST WHAT I NEEDED led in the two path early, settled back when a rival cleared early on the backstretch, re-bid two wide
between foes early on the far turn, could not match strides with the winner from the five-sixteenths pole and held on for third. WEE ARCH stalked the pace
three wide and came up empty in the lane. TAPPING MY HEART played no factor while racing three wide. JUST MARITZA rushed up five wide around the
first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn. JENNYANYSPOT was always outrun.
