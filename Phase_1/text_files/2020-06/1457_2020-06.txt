Footnotes
VEIW FROM THE BAY pursued the leaders from outside, went four wide on the turn while ridden along, struck the lead prior to the top of the stretch, was
clear by mid-stretch and held under a drive. TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR broke outwardly just a bit, stalked the pace, went three wide on the turn, took a narrow
brief lead past the five-sixteenths but was overtaken quickly, proved no match for the winner but was second best. YOU BUG ME set the pace from off the
rail, went in the two path into the turn while in the clear shifting nearer the rail on that bend before coming back out entering the stretch after overtaken. was
no match for the top two. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL broke a half-step slowly, moved past a rival in the three to four path on the turn but failed to rally. TEE
BONE settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and passed tired rivals inside. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING bumped the inner rival at the start, chased
briefly from inside on or just off the rail and came up empty. MAGIC CARPET RUN was bumped at the break, raced last but one off the inside, went two to
three wide on the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BLUE BOY WHO broke on top and lead through the early stages then pressed from inside DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER while off the fence, dropped back in
the two path early on the turn and moved out a path on that bend before shifting to the rail past the three-sixteenths, bid inside in upper stretch, struck the
lead in mid-stretch and edged clear past the sixteenth pole then held. BARONS BOY broke a step slowly then was encouraged forward first between rivals
then up outside the leaders into the turn, went four wide on that bend taking a narrow lead past the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in mid-stretch and second
best. DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER moved forward from outside to prompt the pace, went three then two wide on the turn and was overtaken late on that
bend, yielded in the stretch. REALREALGOOD broke a step slowly, raced well back and outside early, went four wide on the turn and gained mildly. THE
KID IN SYD was off the inside early then moved in to the two path entering the turn, swung out five wide out of that bend and failed to rally. EL CHUMELITO
tracked the leaders from inside early then steadily weakened. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU was within range early tracking in behind going into the turn in the
three path then weakened. RIO CUTIE broke a step slowly at the start, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, came out in the stretch but failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
DANDY DON WHO was lightly brushed at the break then settled into stride, advanced rapidly on the turn five wide, made the lead late on that bend and
shifted in a bit, was clear into upper stretch and extended the advantage. PACK 'N GOLD vied outside going four wide on the turn, was no match for the
winner but held the place. SILENT ZENON raced outside off the leaders, went four then five wide on the turn passing rivals into upper stretch but offered no
extra late. E BAR GOLD steadied after the start when in just a hair tight, raced mid-pack of the leaders going two wide into the turn, shifted out beginning at
the three-sixteenths to be six wide into upper stretch and ran on. BILLY JOE WHO trailed well back early, went in the three path through the turn before
swinging seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. MAGNIFICENT CHANCE came out a bit after the break, tracked inside on or just off the rail on
the turn, came out four wide into upper stretch and was in tight between rivals at the furlong marker. ONE KEY contended inside, drifted out leaving the turn,
tired. BELLELARO vied three to four wide between runners and came up empty.

Footnotes
DRIVE THRU GARY pressed the pace from inside rivals but well off the fence, went in the four then three path on the turn edging away, was clear into
upper stretch when shaken up then held safe under mild hand riding late. QUANTICO JOE stalked from outside, entered the turn four deep then shifted in
three then two wide on that bend, slowly closed the gap but couldn't reach the winner while second best. BULLY RIDE attended from outside, went six then
five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MARTHAS BOY vied between runners early, went five wide into the turn then moved in a path, dropped
back late on that bend and continued to weaken. IMPUTED was bumped at the start, raced wide and in the back half up the backstretch, went three wide
into the turn moving in a path early on that bend, shifted out five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. SKEETER WHO switched outside a rival past the
half-mile marker, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to make a bid. TARGARYCAT shifted in heading up the backstretch chasing the leaders,
went two wide into the turn moving to the rail, came up empty. RUNAWAY REGENT bumped a rival at the start, moved to the rail at the half-mile pole and
was never a threat.

Footnotes
BABO STORM tracked from between rivals in the second flight, shifted in from three to two wide early on the turn before then moving back out three deep,
moved out further four wide to commence a bid late on that bend, came into upper stretch five wide and struck a narrow lead at the eighth pole then dug in
under steady handling to hold a rival at bay. GOGO OXBOW settled outside the second flight, went four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six
deep and just off and outside BABO STORM but couldn't get past that rival. C D POLDARC broke a half-step slowly, settled outside, went in the three path
on the turn before shifting seven wide into upper stretch and gained late. I'VECOMETOWORSHIP broke a step slowly, shifted in tracking up the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, got through in tight quarters on the rail in upper stretch but needed more late. HE'S A HIT broke outwardly just a bit,
pressed from outside then contended three wide, lacked the needed late kick. GUY IN THE SKY was coaxed forward to set the early tempo inside, raced on
the rail through the turn while challenged before coming out just a bit leaving that bend, weakened in the stretch. YUUUGE PARTY contended between
rivals, began to weaken late on the turn, switched outside in upper stretch and failed to menace thereafter. PALICE REVENGE broke a bit awkwardly and
was outrun.
