Footnotes
SERENA'S HOPE set the pace from the two path, widened into the lane then continued to extend the advantage while being under a vigorous hand ride to
the wire. POLARIZING chased the winner from the outset while racing in the two path, continued in the three or four path into the lane and chased the top
one home while finishing clear for the place spot. HOPPESTRY was in the three or four path through the turn then continued on in the four path in the lane
and finished best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. PAIGE'S STAR saved ground into the lane and was never a threat while finishing in mid-pack.
NEW APPEAL was in the two path through the turn and never was a menace. ELLE'S CROWN angled off the inside approaching the turn, continued in the
three path chasing the top two, remained a contender into the lane then was empty the final eighth. LOVE BROKE THRU was in the four or five path
through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never factored. MI LUNA was outrun while in the two path. BOLD CONCEPT was done in upper
stretch while racing well off the inside.

Footnotes
JUSTICE IN VEGAS was last away and settled along the inside, picked up momentum through the turn while just off the inside, waited nearing the 5/16
pole, shifted four wide into the lane with continued energy, shifted from the five to the three path near the sixteenth pole then won the duel to the wire with a
head bob. OSCAR P Q was in the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five of six path, was moving well when joined by the winner,
dueled with that one late and just missed while second best. OUR BALDY B set the pace while in the two path into the lane was still on a clear lead with an
eighth to go then gave way to the top two and settled for best of the rest. ARCH DREAMER chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into
the lane as a contender then weakened approaching the sixteenth pole. DOC'S BLUE TIPPER was in the two path through the turn and moved up through
the lane while evenly. COLONEL MOON raced in the three path through the turn while in the back of the group, continued in the five path entering the lane
then moved up while not a threat. KITKAT KITTEN pressed then chased the pace while in the three path then faded after entering the lane. FHACO trailed
into the lane then passed tired ones. THEN CAME CAIMAN well off the inside through the turn, continued in mid-track and tired. MARCHOS bid through late
turn and into the lane while saving ground then was suddenly done near the eighth pole. HEZA GLITTER was finished early while in the two path. DR.
APPROVAL was outrun while near the inside.

Footnotes
SHES THE CAUSE was checked at the start when she broke a step out and outside horse broke in, raced well back from the three path, continued to
progress through the field into the lane ,remained in the three path while not needing to stymie momentum, was shook up nearing the eighth pole and
finished with a rush to be up in time. ONLY REWARD'S was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, gained momentum
inside the eighth pole to gain the lead and look like a winner in deep stretch, was all out to the wire and was just caught. CATLIKE pressed the pace from
the two path, bid into the lane, gained the lead and cleared by several lengths with an eighth to go, began drifted out under right-handed urging, continued
to drift from the five to the nine path and could not hold the top two sway while finishing best of the rest. DONTYOUREMEMBER stumbled to knees at the
start, settled into last, raced in the two path through the turn, continued near the inside into the lane and rallied late. NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS was along
the inside into the lane when in good position then weakened. REAL BELLA was never a threat while in the two path. RELEASE THE HEAT set the pace
while near the rail into the lane then was suddenly done after straightening. LADY ALLY dropped to the inside before entering the far turn, remained along
the rail into the lane then was never a factor. MINING GOLD never a factor while in the three path through the turn. KANFU chased the pace from the three
path and was done nearing the quarter pole. LUCKY FEVER was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired. OLIVE
U was outrun while in the two path.

the lead while under pressure, could not shake challenger then dueled to the wire and just stayed up. MISS STELLA pressed the pace from the three path,
continued to press the winner into the lane, dueled with that one through the final eighth and just missed. TWISTED STORIES was in the three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the five path and could not gain on the top ones. SLEWPY'S HALO was in the three or four path through the turn, came
into the lane from the five or six path and just missed the show spot. SCAT'S CHOICE was bothered by a loose rival on the turn and moved to avoid that

Footnotes
ENGLISH ESCORT was unhurried while off the inside, moved up to contention into the far turn, was asked for more in late turn, swept past the leaders into
the lane quickly cleared and was kept to the task to remain clear at the wire. SOOTHING was unhurried while near the inside into the far turn, came off the
rail and into the four path entering the lane, gained momentum outside the eighth pole and was gaining to the wire. ANGEL FACE was in contention through
the far turn, was asked for more in late turn, moved to a serious threatening position entering the lane then could not keep up with the winner while keeping
on well for the show spot. MARCHENWALD was close up into the far turn, got shuffled when behind a wall and others proceeded wide, got free in the lane
and lacked a serious bid. SEEKING VIOLET was squeezed at the start, raced in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path
and offered a mild gain while not a threat. SEQUAYA was along the inside through the turn, angled into the three path looking for a path, angled back
towards the rail nearing the sixteenth pole and was never a menace. LIL HITCHHIKER raced in the two path throughout and never factored. COCO
CABALLO was in the three path through the far turn and never was a threat. MAGIC FINNISH pressed the pace into the backstretch, led through the turn
and was empty turning into the lane. MY MISS AQUARIUS vied for the lead into the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. DERBY PRINCESS was
outrun from the three or four path.
