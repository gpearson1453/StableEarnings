Footnotes
MIJET took control early and moved inside, rated along clear through an even pace, responded in the stretch and had enough to hold on. CAT LADY
prompted the pace outside MIJET from the start, had aim through the drive and was inching closer at the finish. LOVE RANGER was three wide in the
second flight early, and had a mild late response between horses to get up for third. TWILIGHT was three wide on the first turn, moved inside and gained
mildly to upper stretch before flattening out. KAHIKO saved ground early, shifted out widest in the stretch and posed no threat. LEA RO tracked outside the
leaders three wide, and tired after six furlongs. MOONLIT FANTASY was unhurried inside for nearly six furlongs, and was empty when roused.in the
two-path turning for home. LADY TEUFLESBERG was off in a tangle several lengths behind the others, and never became involved. PHILLY SPECIAL was

Footnotes
BOLT bumped with CAT GONE QUICK at the start, dueled for command inside that rival early, was also joined from outside by STARSHIP TAXI late on the
turn, edged away under a drive once straightened away into the stretch, and held on gamely. STARSHIP TAXI lost his footing and bumped with RARE HUE
at the start, advanced four wide to challenge outside the leaders after a half-mile, had aim outside BOLT through the lane and finished with good courage to
save the place. TEXTPECTATION lagged far back for a half, swung to the far outside off the turn, and rallied too late. TAYLORSINITIATION cut the corner
rallying into the stretch, but flattened out in the final stages. ROBIN'SBLINDDEAL was no factor two wide. BROADWAY PETE had aim off the early duel,
was under a drive three wide by late on the turn, steadied being out-moved just inside STARSHIP TAXI a quarter-mile out, and gave way. CAT GONE
QUICK bumped with BOLT at the start, pressed the latter from outside for a half, and faltered. RARE HUE bumped with STARSHIP TAXI at the start, and
was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
NILESTAR broke a step slow and was well back early, came three wide off the turn beginning to hit her best stride, rallied determinedly and collared
CHARLIEANNA from outside in time. CHARLIEANNA sped clear after the start, went along at a brisk pace to deep stretch, and caved in. ALPILLES chased
the pacesetter two wide to the stretch, and saved the show. BEATING THE ODDS had a ground-saving trip, and gained mildly in the stretch. PLAY THAT
TONE raced three to four wide, and was no threat. MONEY FACTOR was a step slow at the start, and did not factor. MY MASTERPIECE came widest for
the drive, and made no impact. PRINCESS CARRIGAN raced three wide to the stretch, and faded. SMARTIES GREATNESS was finished early. TIPSY
AGAIN chased inside for three furlongs, and faltered.

CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE raced three wide advancing after a half-mile, responded well through the stretch and wore down REITERATE from outside.
REITERATE sped clear and moved inside after the start, rated along in command to the stretch, could not withstand the winner but was much best of the
others. WORDS OF DEVINE was outsprinted early, swung four wide to the lane and finished evenly. HARTLING saved ground outrun to the stretch, veered
out sharply past the eighth-pole, and went by tired horses. BLESSED BEAST raced three then four wide on the turn, and faded late on the wrong lead.
BEAST OF WILDWOOD chased outside REITERATE early, was put to a drive three-eighths of a mile from home, and gave way steadily.

Footnotes
SAILING SOLO broke to the lead, rated along slightly off the rail through an easy pace, shrugged off a bid from RENAISANCE FROLIC turning for home,
and moved away hand urged. FOREVER MO saved ground unhurried to the far turn, moved out approaching the stretch, and was up for second on the far
outside. RENAISANCE FROLIC fought rating outside SAILING SOLO through the opening half-mile, lodged a mild bid after six furlongs, but was no match
through the furlong grounds and surrendered second. TIZZARUNNER hugged the rail throughout, and lacked a rally. STIRLING DRIVE was reserved two
wide to the far turn, and was empty when roused. ANOTHER MYSTERY broke slowly, moved up mildly outside rivals after a half-mile, but was finished
approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT STELLA pressed the pace outside TWICE AS MAGICAL for three furlongs, kicked clear through mid stretch and widened under a drive.
TWICE AS MAGICAL set the pace hounded by the winner, proved no match in the lane but held the place. FAST CATALINA was forwardly placed early,
and turned in an even effort saving ground throughout. TREVESS moved inside on the turn, and lacked the needed late response. LADY NOY chased three
wide to the stretch, and had no rally. FLAMING INDY checked sharply entering the turn, and made no impact. LITTLE BELLA brushed with ODRAMARK
and steadied back just after the start, moved out in the stretch and passed tired horses. MAHKATO became edgy in the gate prior to the start, and was
outrun. LONESOME PALM was outrun throughout. ODRAMARK brushed with LITTLE BELLA just after the start, raced four wide and tired. BOSTON
BEAUTIES (IRE) was finished after three-eighths of a mile. RANDIABBY was far back throughout.

distance. CRUMB BUN saved ground in range early, moved out three wide late on the turn, had aim outside LIZA STAR through the lane but could not get
by. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT raced two to three wide outsprinted for a half, and was along for the show while not a factor. CORY GAL set the pace inside,
could not hold off the winner late on the turn, and faded through the drive on her left lead. BROADWAY CAT saved ground to no avail. SPANISH POINT
chased three wide early, was eased up by the end of the turn, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

RAGS FOR BRITCHES was bumped between horses at the start, raced four wide through the turns, rallied steadily in the stretch and was up outside rivals
in time. POWER (BRZ) was on hold early, swung four wide off the far turn, found his best stride late and just missed between horses. DRAMATIC KITTEN
broke out, moved up early between horses to force the pace, took over outside WOODHAVEN KID on the far turn, was clear through most of the stretch but
gave way inside the top two late. CAB BEEF raced three then four wide around the far turn, and improved position outside. STARSHIP MUFASA bumped
with RAGS FOR BRITCHES at the start, raced four or five wide throughout, and weakened in the stretch. MAMMOTH stumbled at the start and bumped
LIMETINI, lagged well back early inside, moved out four wide to the far turn, and made no impact. LIMETINI bumped with MAMMOTH at the start and was
slow to get going, moved up between horses after a half-mile, but was finished turning for home. FUTURE PRINCE raced three wide to the first turn, and
never reached contention. BELIEVEITORNOT delayed the start fractious and difficult to load, and retired early. TERRY JADE bumped with RAGS FOR
BRITCHES at the start, raced forwardly three wide early, and tired before reaching the stretch. WOODHAVEN KID set the pace inside, got overtaken
midway on the far turn, and retreated. U. S. COAST GUARD steadied on the rail losing position entering the backstretch, got shuffled back inside on the far
turn, and dropped out of it.
