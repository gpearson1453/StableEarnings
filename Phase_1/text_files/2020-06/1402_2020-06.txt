Footnotes
SPRING CITY GAL was unhurried and dropped inside, advanced rapidly on the turn, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch, surged past the winner
at will before the sixteenth pole, burst clear while drifting out to the eight path nearing the wire and won as much the best. ALMIGHTY STORM broke in full
stride to set the pace while getting quick fractions until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. STEPHANIE'S FAITH allowed to settle, swung wide
and passed tiring rivals mid track. HOT VALENTINA chased the pace for a half then gradually weakened. STURN DONNA was void of early speed and
never involved. THEOREM was through early and swung out to the middle of the racetrack.

KNOCKOUT RANGER prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead while drifting to the six path and proved best in a stiff drive.
SHAKEDOWN was bumped at the start, always within striking distance, loomed boldly three wide on the far turn, drifted to the seven path and finished
second best. ALEX THE DUDE stalked the pace from the inside for six furlongs, shifted out to the six path then finished evenly. PIAZZA DEL CAMPO broke
in front, set a pressured pace into the stretch then faded. FLIGHT MISSION saved ground to no avail. DOROTHYS BOY hopped and bumped a rival leaving
the gate, advanced outside the field on the backstretch, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. MALIBU WEST raced close up while trailing into
the far turn then faded.

Footnotes
CHARLEE'S MAGIC broke in front and chased the pace into the stretch, responded readily when set down, made the lead near the three sixteenths pole
then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under left handed urging. LITTLE BLAKER broke outward, was never far back, had a mild late
rally three wide and got up for second. URBAN RENEWAL broke in a tangle and finished well between rivals two wide. BRINGYOUROWNSAND sprinted to
a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch, chased the winner until deep stretch then weakened. DUBACIOUS had speed along
the inside into the stretch then weakened. PYRITE MILL offered little.

along in time. BEARPATH never far back, closed late in the five path and got up for second. CHIEF BIG HEAD trailed through the turn then closed with a
rush in the six path through the stretch. OSTEENS MESSAGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was
outfinished. DANEFIELD allowed to settle, closed a gap late in the four path. SPLIT MY BRITCHES was fractious behind the gate while loading the no

Footnotes
SUCCOTASH allowed to settle inside, swung outside on the turn, rallied in the seven path to make the lead before mid stretch and finished full of run to win
going away. MA KETTLE stalked the pace four then three wide into the stretch, dug in late and finished clear for second. ISLAND CHIC unhurried early,
found her best stride late two wide. MISS KETTLE ZIP chased the pace two wide into the turn, led between calls, had speed until deep stretch then came up
empty. APRIL MARIE vied for the lead three wide into the turn then faded. GRAZIA WHO close up, lacked room along the inside approaching the stretch
and dropped back. BACCARAT broke in front, set the pace into the turn then gave way. WELLOILEDCAT was outrun. TOM'S TUNE broke slowly and
trailed throughout.
