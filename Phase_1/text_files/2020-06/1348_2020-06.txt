hold off BIG ANDY nearing the wire. MAMBA QUEEN dueled inside, inched away on the turn, came a bit off the rail into the stretch, could not match the top
pair late but held third. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH broke in and a bit slowly then bobbled, chased outside and three wide on the turn, came four wide into the

WORTHY TURK between horses early, angled in and stalked inside, came out a bit in the stretch and rallied under urging to wear down the runner-up
nearing the wire. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR had speed four wide then inched away and angled in, set the pace along the inside and held on well but was
edged late. SEEKING REFUGE bobbled at the start, stalked the pace off the rail, came out a bit into the stretch and continued willingly for the show. EAST
RAND saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch and again in midstretch and could not quite summon the necessary late response.
SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE settled outside a rival chasing the pace to the stretch and did not rally. CHALLAH stalked outside rival to the stretch, drifted in
some in the drive and lacked a further response.

BLAZING CHARM stalked between horses then off the rail, angled in on the turn, came out a bit for room in upper stretch then angled in and rallied along
the fence under urging in the final sixteenth to gamely prevail late. LITTLE MISS ELLIE stalked three deep then outside the winner, came four wide into the
stretch, lugged in nearing midstretch, came under a left handed crack of the whip then had the rider lose the stick a furlong out, bid three wide in deep
stretch and continued willingly. QUEENSBECCAANDJANE pressed the pace inside, took a short lead into the turn, inched away just off the rail nearing
midstretch, fought back between foes through the final sixteenth and went on gamely to the end. MAMAS GOT CASH dueled a bit off the rail then between
horses, fell back a bit past mistretch and was outfinished. GOTTA BE LUCKY hopped slightly in a bit of a slow start, chased off the rail, came three wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed rally. INSTASTORY dueled outside a rival then three deep, dropped back between horses into the stretch and weakened.
CAMEO SHORES broke a bit slowly, saved ground chasing the pace, came out some into the stretch, then drifted inward in the lane and had little for the
drive.

Footnotes
MORE HONOR bobbled some at the start, tugged his way up to press the pace four wide then three deep on the turn, took the lead alongside the runner-up
into the stretch, inched away in midstretch and won clear under left handed urging. DARK HEDGES had good early speed and dueled between horses,
fought back along the rail into the stretch and held second. JEN GO UNCHAINED stalked off the rail then between horses on the backstretch and turn,
came three wide into the stretch and edged a rival for the show. LITTLE NO WAY broke a bit slowly and was a bit crowded early, settled inside, came out on
the turn and four wide into the stretch and was edged for third. LIL SYDNEY stalked a bit off the rail then inside, came out leaving the turn and between
horses into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SUANCES SECRET came out in the early strides, angled in and dueled inside, fell back into the stretch
and weakened. WILL DANCER a bit slow to begin, pulled between horses then stalked three deep, came four wide into the stretch and also weakened.
KING CHARLIE dueled three deep between horses, dropped back on the turn and had little left for the drive.
