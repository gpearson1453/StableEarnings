Footnotes
DANCE AWAY stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded when sat down for the drive and wore down MISS
NOTORIOUS the final furlong. MISS NOTORIOUS dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth
pole but was caught the final jump. DREAMIT outrun early, advanced outside through the turn, came inside for the drive, responded when asked and rallied
late for the show. CHOCTAW CHARLIE dueled from between foes early, remained forward but came up empty in the drive. MISS CASEY BETH dueled
from the inside then tired in the drive. SHE WANTS HALF dueled from the outside and faded. HURRICANE TIZWAY was never a factor. Split times
unavailable due to timer malfunction.

GRAND ATLANTIC dueled from the inside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, gained a clear margin through the turn, was engaged by MY
SUGAR TOWN entering the drive, dueled with that one through the drive and was just up the final strides. MY SUGAR TOWN up close early from the
inside, inched closer entering the second turn, altered outside, responded to duel with the winner but was outnoodded. MONEYINMYPOCKET unhurried
early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but could only gain the show. POCHO'S DREAM forced the early
pace outside, remained forward but could not keep pace. CHARMING BULLET went evenly. BLANCO BRONCO chased the early pace inside but came up
empty in the drive. SIR ESKE went evenly. HOLY SPIRIT chased the early pace outside and tired. ZENMAN was no factor. DOOLIN dueled from the
outside and faded. RACIN ROCKS was no threat. BOND'S MARTINI was always outrun. Times omitted pending review.

Footnotes
LOVE BOUND up close early from the inside, dueled up the backstretch, shook loose entering the drive, opened a commanding margin at the eighth pole
and was much the best while never roused. LIL ASHLEY B. outrun early, circled rivals on the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive, drifted in
slightly mid stretch and closed with a surge for the place. SHE'S OUR STAR unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
responded entering the drive and gained the show. GOTTABEGOLDEN pressed the early pace outside, remained forward but had no late response.
MITCH'S PINS chased the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. NICKYS GUITAR went evenly. ALL IN BRONSON was no real factor.
STAR'S DREAM forced the early pace inside and faded. CLYTEE was never a threat. INTERATIFWITHLEU broke sharp from the outside, dueled up the
backstretch then gave way in the drive. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY was finished after going a half. Times unavailable due to a timer malfunction.

THEBOYZGALAXY stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded when asked entering the drive and steadily
drew clear. STAR GAZE well placed from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded but was no match late while clearly second best.
STAR PERFORMER dueled from the inside early, remained forward for the dive but had no late response. PRETTY PRODUCTION could only improve
position. KOOL AID GIRL could only pass tired ones. LIL KYLIE dueled from the outside and tired. CROWNED STYLE was never a factor. CHARZEE
BABY dueled from the outside and gave way.

Footnotes
FRIENDLYPRODUCTION stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, angled outside, responded and closed with a rush.
TOOCAN DANCE pressed the early pace from the outside, remained in a forward position for the drive but was no match while clearly second best.
MARTIN G forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward but could only gain the show. BRUTALIZE dueled from the inside early, remained
forward but had nothing left. MOONLIGHT WILLY went evenly. FLASH OF PEPPER dueled from between foes and tired. COOL COOL JAZZ was no factor.
VINTON was no threat. POWER OF THE PEN showed little.
