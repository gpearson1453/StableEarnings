Footnotes
SWEET CHAYANE had no speed and was content to trail to the second turn, responded when roused and circled four then five wide to the stretch then
continued to rally through the final furlong to be along in time. TOOLEY TUNES set the pace from the rail to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch under
urging but was tiring and could not hold. TOTALLY NORMAL pressed the pace from the rail to the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task
and was closing the gap. VONHRA settled to the half, was two wide on the second turn and was also gaining belatedly. AMERICAN ROYALTY also was
allowed to settle to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. WAVERLY WAY prompted the runnerup for six
furlongs, was two wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. ROUGE BOUQUET was outsprinted to the backstretch, tracked the pace to
the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ALBANY FRONT had good speed, led to the half mile pole, dueled TOM'S SURPRISE from the rail to the stretch, was headed in mid stretch but dug in
determinedly and edged clear driving. MUSKET POWDER stalked the winner early, was two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but
kept to task and was along for second. TOM'S SURPRISE was rank after a furlong, pulled the rider up to contest the pace, dueled two wide to the stretch
then was racing a bit erratically in the final furlong and could not save second. WAR MAKER chased the pace to the turn, bid three then four wide to the
stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. BALIUS got outsprinted early, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive.
NEHUSHTAN broke a bit slow, trailed to the stretch and was not a threat. POGO had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
ICE OR FIRE was a pace factor from the outset, saved ground to the stretch, responded to kick clear to mid stretch and held driving. CYCLOPS had no
speed, circled four wide to the stretch and finished willingly for the place. RED STAR also had no speed, was two wide on the turn then finished in a mild bid
that did not threaten the top two. SIZZLING EVENING was tracking to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then lacked a closing response. JAMMERS
JUSTICE checked in the early stages, chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then also did not rally. IDIOT IN LOVE hustled to duel the winner two
wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. IVORIAN was chasing early, raced three wide on the turn and also tired in the drive.

Footnotes
KANDEREL was in good position to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, collared BETTOR TRIP NICK nearing the sixteenth marker then just
held off AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM late. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM The latter had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then
closed resolutely but was too late. BETTOR TRIP NICK set the pace from the rail to the stretch, resisted the winner to deep stretch then weakened.
GOVERNANCE pressed the pace to the half, was two wide and still a factor to the stretch then also was giving way late. MYLITTLERUNAWAY tracked the
pace to the second turn, was outkicked while two wide to the stretch and did not rally. DARNQUICK broke alertly then pressed the issue for five furlongs,
saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. ZIMBA WARRIOR was always outrun.

Footnotes
NEVER BE ENOUGH (GB) was well placed to the second turn, advanced two wide to the stretch then split rivals in mid stretch, pushed to the front and won
going away. QAFILAH (IRE) stalked the pace to the second turn, dueled two wide to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch but never
threatened for second. MYBLUEBELL (FR) pressed the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and
weakened. BLAZINBEAUTY settled mid pack to the half, tried to rally two wide on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. NORTHWEST FACTOR also
settled early, raced off the rail on the far turn and lacked a closing response. REGINELLA hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to t he second turn,
was overtaken into the stretch and tired. CREATIVE ROMANCE had no speed and was never a factor. LASTING LIGHT also had no speed and was always
outrun.

Footnotes
DESCARTES broke in a bit and crowded BONA FORTUNA early, chased the leaders to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid
stretch and held off BEAUDACIOUS stubbornly. BEAUDACIOUS got outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and
closed steadily to just miss. DUBRONSKY attended the pace outside of SARGENT LENZINI, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. SARGENT
LENZINI hustled to contest the pace, dueled from the rail to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. AUBURN STREAK checked away
from WIRE TO WIRE TIGAH in the early stages, stalked three wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. RUNKERRY got outsprinted to the turn then was
saving ground but had to take up hard when crowded by BONA FORTUNA leaving the quarter pole and did not recover. BONA FORTUNA chased the pace
two wide, was crowded by AUBURN STREAK and forced into RUNKERRY'S path, steadied then also did not recover. INSANIAMANIA was crowded at the
start, had no speed and was outrun. GALOPIN GOURMET was squeezed and steadied shortly after the start and lost any chance. WIRE TO WIRE TIGAH
went wrong in the early stages, was pulled up and vanned off.

two then three wide to the stretch, responded when set down and closed fast but too late. DICTION pressed the pace two then three wide to the stretch,
dueled to mid stretch then was outkicked and missed second. DRINKIN AND DIALIN chased the pace two wide to the stretch, closed the gap to mid stretch
then finished evenly. PUNALUU had no speed, was four wide to the stretch, shifted widest for the drive but lacked the needed late response. REVEREND

Footnotes
ARCH ANTHEM had good speed and set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch then held off IZ INVINCIBLE stubbornly. IZ
INVINCIBLE settled mid pack to the backstretch, raced between rivals to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch, responded when set
down for the drive and closed steadily and just missed. LIFELINE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then angled out for
room in mid stretch and closed willingly. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE was chasing the winner from the rail to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch but kept to
task and was gaining late. MO BOB (IRE) pressed the pace while two wide to the stretch, also was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and finished
evenly. JIMMY D had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then was gaining but not a serious threat. KID ARCADE also
had no speed, circled five wide on the second turn but flattened in the final furlong. BIG SKY LOGAN tracked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide
to the stretch but tired in the drive. SOONER BETTER settled mid pack for a half mile, was four wide on the second turn and gave way in the lane. WHEN
JESUS WALKED gave a dull effort.
