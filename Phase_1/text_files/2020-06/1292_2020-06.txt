Footnotes
DUPLICATOR went evenly in mid pack through the turn firing in the six path upper stretch surging to the lead while angling in drawing out late. OUR
GOLDEN BOY came in at the break joining the early pace pressing through the turn into upper stretch angling from the four to the twp path late holding well
to salvage place. RUM ON THE ROCKS was in tight at the break lagging through the turn, picked it up vying from the four path in upper stretch traveling
willingly the final sixteenth. MUTASHABEH chased the pace rallying to draw even three deep on the turn, had been overtaken in upper stretch checking
briefly when losing path near the sixteenth pole hanging in the closing yards. GET SOME MO hustled along pursued to upper stretch angling in a bit when
encountering traffic in upper stretch steadying between horses inside the sixteenth pole. LIL PISTOLA slow early lagged through the turn, swung out five
and six wide late would gain modest position. MY BROTHER STEVE broke sharply pressing the pace dueling inside of rivals to upper stretch wearing down
late. REGAL CROSS was never involved. MACHEN OF THE HILL flashed early speed then faded from the quarter pole. JAIL TIME was pinched back at
the break. OBJECTIONS FROM THE RIDER OF MUTASHABEH AGAINST THE RIDER OF DUPLICATOR AND GET SOME MO AGAINST THE RIDERS
OF RUM ON THE ROCKS AND MUTASHABEH ALL FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WERE DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

ARMED ESCORT away alertly pressed a narrow lead through the turn moving to daylight in upper stretch drawing out under urging in the three path.
MUNTIJ pressed the pace from between horses through the turn, ceded to rival in upper stretch holding well in the four path a clear second best. TOTAL
FUTBOL slow early came four wide in upper stretch angling in to the three path mustering a mild rally to best the others. BIG GAME BOB hustled outside
pressed hard three deep through the turn then weakened in upper stretch fading near mid track. WHISKEY SOUR slow early played no factor. GUNTHER
REPORT was never involved. BINDER hopped slightly leaving the gate rushing hard to contention pressing on the inside through the turn wearing out in
upper stretch. SILENT STING gave way on the turn. BACKLASH folded up on the turn.

Footnotes
ARTAVIA stalked early rallying to lead inside of rivals on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch holding firm in the three path. KEY CHEYNE went evenly
rallying on the inside to upper stretch being forced down to the rail responding to save place. HEAT ROAD broke sharply to clear setting the early pace in
the four and five paths, hooked on the turn would cede in upper stretch weakening the final eighth. CHARITABLE went evenly racing six wide down the lane
as no menace. FOREST BLUE slow early proved no factor. GRAN CHIEF chased early then pressed between horses on the turn before giving way in upper
stretch. CHOSEN HEIR brushed at the break played no factor. OVERCRITICIZED was always outrun.

Footnotes
POSSE DREAMIN sent clear set the pace to upper stretch drawing off as much the best. OUT AT EIGHT chased the pace being dispatched by the winner
in upper stretch holding as a clear second best. BIRD CALL raced evenly coming three wide down the lane holding off the others. AMERICAN COTTON a
step slow through the turn came five wide in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. FORCED MOTION played no factor. BASIC HERO was never
involved. BEDTIME FOR BONZO chased early then faded to upper stretch. ABIE was always outrun. MISTER EUROPA raced mid pack giving way to
upper stretch. HOUSE OF PRAYER veered bumping suffering broken equipment at the break, taken wide was eased into upper stretch.
