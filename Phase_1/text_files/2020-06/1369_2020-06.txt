took a peak behind him, took the lead outside the furlong marker then was asked after having the rider take another look behind him, led into the final
sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place. GREY HALO brushed with an opponent at the start, jostled with foes on both sides early, raced inside
early on the first turn then shifted three wide late on that bend, moved out at the rear of the field, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn,

settled on the outside, was ridden along while three to four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was bumped and forced out near the
furlong marker then came up empty. MIZZANNA brushed with a foe at the start then jostled with that same foe early, was hard held while three wide on the
first turn then rated under stout restraint, moved up to make a bid with a half-mile to run, took a short lead in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive
in upper stretch and tired. BATTLESHIP MARY raced in the four path on the first turn, disputed the pace on the outside, dropped in late on the backstretch,
vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and gave way. GEORGIANO went around the first turn in the
two path, settled towards the rear, raced inside to the two path early on the far turn, checked off the heels of a retreating foe at the five-sixteenths and failed
to respond. IAMINTERESTING came out in the early going, raced in the two to three path on the first turn, contested the pace, dropped back outside the

Footnotes
TOP HAT CHARMER broke out at the start, was urged along towards the front on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch,
made an outside bid outside the furlong marker, gained the lead just inside that marker, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong and proved best
under steady urging. SKYLAR'S WAY disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, battled into
the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. HEFFINGTON hit the outside of the gate at the start then dropped back, moved in outside the
half-mile pole, shifted from the three path to the two path midway on the turn then dropped to the rail, cut the corner into the stretch, passed foes inside the
furlong marker, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DREAMIN TIGER was urged along on the
outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then missed
the show. FRUHL'N AROUND was away alertly then hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of the runner-up, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under
a drive into the final furlong and tired. LIL RED VETTE was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path and failed to
threaten. CONTENDRESS bumped with a rival at the start, jostled with foes on both sides early then was pinched back, angled in at the back of the field
then reached the rail, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and was no factor. FIERA PRADO settled towards the
rear, steadied between horses in the two path from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths then was shuffled back to the rear, came four wide into the
stretch and also was no factor. HERO OF GOLD bumped twice with foes at the start then jostled with a rival, was urged along off the pace, went five wide
early on the turn then dropped to three wide, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. MY FOL raced well back on the outside, went
six wide on the turn and also failed to respond. WE OUTTA HERE bumped with a foe just after the start, chased the pace on the outside, pursued the
leaders in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two path and capitulated. OUR LIL RASCAL chased the pace, dropped back significantly
while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, angled seven wide into the stretch and faltered. FAST DOWN THE LANE bobbled at the start,
jostled with a foe early, was urged along off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, went four then five wide on the turn and also faltered.

path, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker, drifted out under a left-handed whip into the final sixteenth then was straightened by the rider
and held under a hand ride coming to the wire. SENOR JOBIM settled off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, drafted inside early on the turn then
moved to the two path late on that bend, waited while boxed in from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, altered course out a couple paths for room at
that point, gained momentum into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but was too late while up for the place. SIXTO chased the pace on the
outside then four wide on the turn, made a bid while dropping to the three path approaching the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and was outfinished while able to get the show. MONTE MAN bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. HERACLITUS moved up to dispute the pace on the inside,
vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and tired. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK broke out then hit the gate and was off
a bit slow, settled near the back, moved out midway down the backstretch, went four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. IRISH SILVER broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along while well off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. GOLDEN TIGER showed speed then chased
the pace, went three wide on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and capitulated.
