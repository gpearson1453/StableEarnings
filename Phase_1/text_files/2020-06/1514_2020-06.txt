Footnotes
RATTLESNAKE RIVER broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace, cleared to the inside entering the turn, vied into the lane closest to the inside, long drive,
proved best in determined fashion. MASTER KEV hesitated at the start, was used to move up and contend four wide early in the turn, vied in the three path
into the stretch, brushed with entrymate, no match for the winner late, narrowly gained the nod for the second spot while continuing widest of the first flight.
DONTMESWITHDISCAT bothered to be off slow, recovered to move up and lodged a bid between rivals midway on the turn, continued to vie into and
through upper stretch while drifting out slightly to brush with entrymate, narrowly outfinished by that one for the place. OXBOW PIONEER fractious in the
paddock resulting in his connections removing his blinkers, continued unruly in the post parade, lacked speed, four wide into the stretch, bothered with a
furlong remaining, no threat to the top three. SARAH'S VISION forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back into the turn, second flight into the lane,
came out to bother OXBOW PIONEER past the furlong marker, lacked closing kick. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SARAH'S VISION AGAINST
THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN WAS QUICKLY DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
GOTTA GO away in good order, stalked the leader off the inside, took over from that from the outside turning for home, shook clear, kept to task. PINCH
ASSAULT broke back, lacked early foot, ranged up closer in the three path exiting the final turn, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly
second best. INVASORS WIND last to leave, void of early foot, came five wide into the stretch, along for the show late while not a threat to the top pair.
MAGIC VOW lacked speed, improved toward the inside entering the stretch, failed to sustain that advance late and was caught for the show. KRAFTY BOY
settled behind the two leaders, raced four wide out of the final turn and tired. CROCODILE JACQUES broke on top, set the pace inside, stopped in the drive
when headed by the winner turning for home. FREEDOM FACTOR was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WONDER RUN asked a bit to keep forward position inside, moved out and stalked the winner through the turn, crept closer to that one late in the bend then
came up empty for the stretch run to be caught late for the place. BIG GUY IAN broke alertly, soon got clear, rated in the run through the turn while in the
two path, drew out through the stretch under steady handling. NATEALYZE settled off the pace and the inside, came on the outside for the drive, finished up
willingly to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. BUFFON fell back after the start to trail, was never close in a dull effort.

Footnotes
WHEN I DO broke with the leaders, pressed up the backstretch three wide, vied on the outside through the turn, disposed of the other speed into the stretch
and kicked clear under steady handling. HERE COMES HOMER in the second flight on the outside, dour wide into the lane, no match winner, long drive for
the place, gained the nod for that position at the end. CLASSIC GREELEY lacked speed for a half, moved a bit closer in some traffic late in the turn in the
two path, split rivals past the furlong marker, challenged for the second spot and narrowly missed, well clear of the others. HONOR MY SPEED in the
second group off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, finished up evenly in lacking a serious closing response. DICTATOR sprinted clear soon after
the start, narrowly showed the way through the turn, faltered along the inside entering the stretch. I'LL RAISE YOU broke on top, allowed the leader to go
early, vied between horses through the turn, also weakened when the real running began at the head of the stretch. SINGINGINTHEWIND was finished
early, trailed home.

Footnotes
KRIS T. with the pace from the start, dueled up front in the two path onto the backstretch, continued to alternate for the advantage into the far turn, put a
way the other speed entering the stretch, headed a furlong out, found more in the late going to narrowly prevail while fully extended. ARGUMENT WON
lacked early foot, advanced into the second flight late backstretch, ranged up to challenge three wide and outside the winner turning for home, put a head in
front a furlong out but was outkicked in the final strides. HARPER BEE last away, moved out to be five wide onto and up the backstretch, four wide through
the second turn, staged a late rally while remaining out in the strip to annex the show, no threat to the top two. COSTA SUGAR settled off the pace, lacked a
meaningful response in the drive to finish up evenly. HARLANS WARRIOR broke on top, showed the way through the first turn, dueled the middle half,
weakened inside the winner turning into the stretch. MISS GURETTA settled in mid pack early, five wide into the. STAR FORMULA four wide in the first turn
when within striking distance, fell back, lost contact with the field in the stretch to be jogged in.

Footnotes
POWER SONG broke well, was clear out of the chute, rated in the run through the turn, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the stretch
under a steady right handed stick. DERBY DOG broke alertly, chased the winner out of the chute, continued to pursue through the turn and into the stretch,
no match, remained clear of the others. SUCH settled off the pace, came well wide for the drive, displayed some mild interest well out in the strip to be up
for the show. DISTINCT QUALITY settled in mid pack early, moved closer from between rivals exiting the turn, failed to sustain that advance the final
furlong, caught late for the show. FIRE MAKERS STAR lacked early foot, improved inside of a couple of rivals turning for home, lacked a further advance to
lose a position late. FLAT OUT LOVE last away, moved out and up to mid pack, four wide out of the turn, came up empty for the drive. MIKEY'S MOUSE
lacked speed, five wide out of the turn, remained back.

Footnotes
ELLA'S LIL STAR broke with the leaders, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, pulled away steadily
under a right handed whip. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE chased the dueling leaders off the inside, three wide into the lane, could do little with the winner in the run
to the wire, clearly second best. RUBY RED SLIPPERS lacked early foot, moved well out in the strip, came five wide out of the turn, rallied midtrack to earn
the show. MISS INVADER in the second flight outside, was four wide into the turn, had little left for the drive. RHETT'S RACER in the second group toward
the inside, continued to save some ground turn, went one paced in lacking a closing response through the lane. ANGELIC KRISS last to leave, lacked
speed, six wide into the stretch, lacked a serious bid. FICKLE FLASH raced in mid pack for a half, had nothing for the drive. BLAZING SENSATION
remained always back. WISH FOR INTEREST broke alertly from the outside, dueled up front outside the winner then gave way in the drive.

SPECIAL CONNECTION raced off the early pace and in the inside, in some traffic second turn, dropped inside when straightened for home, rallied up the
rail to be in time. WILDABOUT AUDREY broke in good order, cleared early in the first turn, set all the pace just off the inside, continued to show narrowly
show the way stretch, dug in gamely, allowed the winner the inside in the final strides, nipped at the wire. SWEET AMELIA pressed the runner up off the
inside, vied with that one through the final turn, long drive, not enough while three wide at the wire and outside the top two. BLESSED ANNA broke alertly,
forwardly placed off the inside, ranged up outside to challenge turning for home, raced on equal terms with the top three past the furlong marker, hung in the
late going while widest of the first flight. GUILTY LADY off a step slow, raced back, saved ground through the second turn when moving slightly closer,
lacked a further response in the drive. PLAYIN N TRAFFIC settled off the and the inside, four wide through the final turn, lacked a closing kick. HEY GRACE
raced outside through the first turn, fell well back before a half, trailed.

Footnotes
EYE ON THE LADIES broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, clear through the turn, increased advantage through the stretch without feeling the
whip to win ridden out. CAJUN SHOTS lacked speed while racing three wide, continued to be outrun into the lane, finished willingly to be in time for the
place, no match for the winner. MY GIRL EM hesitated at the start, trailed for three furlongs, steered out widest for the drive, also finished up willingly while
too late for the place. AMANDASCHIME settled in mid pack while toward the inside, split foes into the lane, finished up evenly in lacking a response for the
second spot. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL broke well, chased the winner off the inside, faltered in the final furlong. ENOUGH HEART forwardly placed for a half,
also had little left in the late going. QUEEZER lacked speed, saved ground into the lane, finished up one paced while remaining inside. SMART N HOLY
showed little while racing four wide. MAK'S ALARM settled, stopped in the drive, finished well back.
