Footnotes
GOLD BUTTON stalked along the inside, rated under a tight hold in the pocket around the turn, waited patiently turning for home, shifted three wide and
split foes under confident handling at the three sixteenths pole, forged a lead approaching the furlong pole, and drew off under mild urging. OUR SECRET
AGENT set the pace inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, was no match for GOLD BUTTON at the furlong pole, but
fought back to reclaim place through the late stage. WELLINGTON WONDER prompted the pace setter early on, vied two wide between horses through the
turn, forged a narrow advantage turning for home, but weakened between horses in the late stages. HANDS UP vied three to four wide around the turn, but
weakened in midstretch. BETTER WITH AGE was off slowly and trailed the field early on, shifted from the two path to the six path around the turn, and
offered a mild rally without threatening. SALLY O'BRIEN was forwardly placed four wide outside of horses, but weakened five wide in upper stretch.
FUNNYBET saved ground off of the pace, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MAGINE was forwardly placed two wide, inched forward into the turn to bid for the lead, vied outside of rivals around the bend before forging an advantage
in upper stretch, then drove clear approaching the furlong pole. GONE GLIMMERING set the pace along the inside of the eventual winner around the turn,
but was headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to be second best. PERSIAN QUEEN prompted the vied for the lead two wide and
between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with those foes at the five sixteenths pole, the fended off WEST BANK BABY through the lane for
show. WEST BANK BABY chased the leading trio from the three path around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, hung for show and missed that
position at the wire. PANTERITA raced far off of the pace two wide and between horses turning for home, and failed to make an impact. ORB'S SOUL
trailed early, passed foes three wide around the turn, but weakened and never got involved. KERTARA saved ground from midpack, but came under a drive
into the turn and weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
DUTCH TREAT saved ground from midpack around the turns, swung to the four, then five, path turning for home and produced a rally in midstretch, then
drove past the leaders at the sixteenths pole and held ZABAVA off safely to the wire. ZABAVA lunged outwards at the start, raced off of the pace two wide
around the first turn, then swung from the three to five path turning for home, produced a late rally, but failed to catch the clear leader in the final sixteenth.
MAD GRACE stalked along the inside while a bit keen into and around the first turn, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper stretch, edged between
them through midstretch, but was outfinished by outer rivals. FOXTAIL stalked two wide around the turns before shifting to the four path turning for home,
but lacked a kick to make a bid in upper stretch, the got outfinished between horses in the final furlong. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY saved ground from far off of
the pace and failed to factor. DIAMONDCOAT set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch and gave way. STROLLIN THE BAYOU
prompted the pace two wide, forged a lead in upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. MISS ALTAMIRA was brushed by an inner
foe at the start, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GALINDO was forwardly placed in the three path around the first turn, vied outside of MAJORS VINDICATION down the backstretch, forged a lead from that
foe in upper stretch, then held his margin from that foe through the lane under a long drive. MAJORS VINDICATION was sent to set the pace along the
inside, held an advantage from GALINDO around th far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, then battled on gamely through the lane, but failed
to regain even terms. TIZ MCNAMARA was forwardly placed in the two path around the first turn, but restrained into the backstretch and dropped back
between horses at the five furlong pole, tracked from midpack in the three path around the far turn, then rallied in the four path through the lane, but only
managed a mild gain. GUM TREE LANE tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, inched forward to stalk three wide around the far turn,
but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home. HOLY MUCHACHO saved ground while midpack, but to no avail, then failed to return to the
winners circle to be unsaddled, and was vanned off. MARTIAL EAGLE trailed around both turns before swinging to the five path turning for home, but failed
to threaten. QUANA DUDE saved ground far off of the pace into the far turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
DIGITAL STAR took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start causing him to bump an inner foe, tracked from midpack two wide early on, got outmoved by
ZAPPER VAN WINKLE into the turn, shifted to the four path around the bend, then to the six path turning for home, then produced a late rally to wear that
leader down on the wire. ZAPPER VAN WINKLE tracked the trio of dueling leaders from the three path around the turn, made a three wide bid for the lead
while in the four path in upper stretch, built a clear advantage approaching the furlong pole, but was worn down in the late stages. JACK LUVS NOVA was
off slow, advanced in the three to five path around the turn, then stayed on willingly for a minor reward. MINE OWN STAR hesitated a the start and trailed
the field early on, shifted inwards when producing a rally in midstretch, then showed mild interest in the late stages. SHAW broke in and solidly bumped
DIGITAL STAR at the start, dueled for the lead three wide around the turn, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. PYSER'S ORB dueled inside
a pair of rivals around the turn, but gave way at the furlong pole and weakened late. BUCKY was bumped by an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead
two wide and between horses into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and faded through the lane. STICK FIGURE stalked along the inside,
but weakened after a quarter mile and stopped through the lane.
