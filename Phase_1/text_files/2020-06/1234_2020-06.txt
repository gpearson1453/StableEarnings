Footnotes
INCUBATOR set a fast pace along the rail, was collared nearing the lane, battled on inside at a disadvantage through most the lane, drifted out under
right-handed urging and regained command in deep stretch. EL EMANUEL settled off the early pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid
two wide into the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole, led through most of the stretch and hung late. POSHSKY lacked speed while saving
ground, angled two wide nearing the clubhouse turn and was along for the show. THE PREDICTOR was in range two wide early but steadily faded after a
half. THOMAS EDWARD saved ground early, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. I NEED YOU was outrun while racing two wide.
SCHLOSSER had some early speed two and three wide but was through after a half.

BARN YARD BRAT stalked the pace three wide, swept to command near the eighth pole, continued on his left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive.
INDIAN WILDFIRE dueled along the rail to upper stretch, continued on his left lead through the stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on well
enough to be clearly second best. I'MOVERTHEMOON dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. SUAVE JUAN lacked early speed, raced two wide
and never threatened. GRECIAN ADMIRAL chased the pace four wide, angled in nearing the lane and faded. LIL MR MATT hit the starting gate, raced well
back inside and was trying to lug in at the rail through the stretch. FORKS OF IVY was outrun inside. GOTTA NIP played no factor while racing two wide.

SISTER ANNA set a clear pace along the rail and just lasted under a steady drive. SMARTY PLEASE was bumped at the start, made progress outside
down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, closed gamely through the land and just missed. HEDGE BURNER stumbled at the start, chased
the pace two wide and lacked a serious rally. STERLING FURIOSA was bumped at the start, lagged well back early, went three wide around the turn, came
five wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. MOJO MATTERS never threatened while racing two wide. JORDAN SPRINGS led early, chased the pace
inside and weakened through the lane. VIRGINIA PEACH saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
GOTHAM NEWS was devoid of speed while racing well last in the three path, edged closer nearing the far turn, waited a bit behind horses from about the
quarter pole to the three-sixteenths marker, swung to the far outside in upper stretch, continued on his left lead, surged outside, inhaled foes in deep stretch
and won going away. CARGO SHIP stalked the early pace two wide, took the lead leaving the seven-sixteenths pole, angled in approaching the far turn,
drew clear, continued on his left lead in the lane, fought off a bid from KING MAURO but was no match for the winner in the final yards. KING MAURO was
bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace, bid in midstretch but hung late. CALADAN was always in range two and three wide but came up empty in
the lane. HOBE SOUND was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. WARCRAFT stalked
the pace from the rail and faded around the far turn. ZITARROSA was pinched at the start, advanced three wide around the first turn, bid outside near the
three-eighths pole but tired in the lane. RELENTLESS STRIKE led early inside but was done early.

Footnotes
I AM I WILL settled off the early pace three wide, made good progress outside down the backstretch, bid three wide around the far turn, seized command
near the three-sixteenths marker, drew off in upper stretch and widened while drifting in under steady right-handed urging. SECRET O'LIFE raced off the
pace three wide, advanced three and four wide around the far turn then rallied widest for the place. SCOTTISH DENIS tracked the pace three wide, bid
between foes around the far turn, was in a bit tight turning for home, was no match for the winner in the lane but held for the show. SAINTE THERESE
stalked the pace inside, bid at the rail in upper stretch but flattened out. COURTLY KITTY failed to menace while racing two wide. KENTUCKY DANCER
stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, took the lead near the half-mile pole, set the pace two wide to the three-sixteenths pole and tired. NOT A
SECRET checked off heels nearing the first turn, saved ground around that bend, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. NATALIE LA
ROSE set the pace along the rail around the first turn and retreated. SCOREEARLYANDOFTEN saved ground and was through early.
