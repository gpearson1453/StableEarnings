Footnotes
AWESOME DRIVE bumped outside rival leaving the gate, pressed the leader from the outside to the stretch, challenged and gained command mid-stretch,
kicked clear and drew away under right-handed urging. REDS TRIBAL HEART got loose in the post-parade, went five wide into the first turn, tracked off the
rail, exited the turn five wide, rallied and edged OUR ROMANCE for the place. OUR ROMANCE away quickly from the inside, set the pace under pressure,
fought back to mid-stretch, weakened late and was edged for second. GOLDEN MELODIE stumbled and brushed leaving the gate, steadied off heels into
the first turn and went five wide around that bend, settled off the pace, angled in on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
RATIONAL angled in soon after the start, tracked two wide to the lane and never rallied. SOME ROYALTY bumped at the start, stalked off the rail, came
four wide into the lane and weakened in the late stages. TURKISH ANGEL off a bit slow, angled to the inside, saved ground into the lane and never
threatened.

VERTICAL THREAT stalked the pacesetter three deep then off the rail, bid three deep approaching the five-sixteenths marker, took a short lead into the
stretch, cleared and widened the margin under some right-handed urging then steady handling late. DISCO BALL threw head and off a bit slow to begin,
came out and stalked from the outside, went four wide through the turn, could not threaten the winner but bested the rest. ADARE bumped both sides
leaving the gate, angled to the inside, came out entering the drive, lugged in near the eighth pole and was along for third. HAPPY HEPO set the pace from
the inside, failed to put up a fight when challenged from the outside, drifted out near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. HOLDEN THE LUTE bumped
with rival at the start, chased outside the pacesetter, bid between on the turn but weakened in the lane. NOTRE DAME broke in and bumped rival at the
start, chased off the rail, went two wide into the lane and never responded when asked. IT BETTER BE GOLD between foes early, dropped back into the
turn, outside a rival around the bend, floated out into the lane and had little left. HALF SPLIT HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MAYAN WARRIOR unhurried in the early stages, advanced four wide through the turn, rallied outside, collared the runner-up a sixteenth out and edged rival
under left-handed encouragement. BILLY THE HOTT dueled for command outside of SHAKE N FRIES, cleared briefly mid-stretch then received another
challenge from the outside, kept on gamely to the wire but could not fend off the winner. GOLDEN IMAGE stalked a bit off the rail, angled out into the three
path on the turn, produced a mild bid in upper stretch, could not match the top pair but held the show. SHAKE N FRIES dueled for command from the
inside, could not match strides near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened late. SEVEN OXEN off the rail in the early going, raced outside a rival in the
two path then moved out a path entering the lane and lacked a rally. GEORGIAN ROAD settled near the inside, saved ground then came out a bit at the top
of the lane, raced between foes in the lane and never found the needed response. SUANCES SECRET raced off the rail, angled in entering the turn, kept
inside to the lane and faded.

on at the wire. ROYAL SEEKER hard to load prior to the start, stumbled a bit at the beginning, raced off the pace, went four wide into the turn, angled out
further in the drive, surged late and just missed. TIM'S BUDDY quickly sped to the front, set the pace outside a rival then cleared, led two to three wide

deep on the turn then drifted five wide into the stretch, then kept on willingly to the wire. KENNY BENNY chased a bit off the rail, went between rivals on the

hold second. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER stumbled at the start, raced two wide into the first turn, chased the pace up the backstretch, went two wide around
the far turn, angled out mid-stretch, rallied and missed the place. LOUD MOUTH tracked off the rail then outside a rival, went between foes on the
backstretch, three wide into the lane and needed more in the late stages. KING ABNER settled off the rail, came out into the backstretch, traveled five wide
