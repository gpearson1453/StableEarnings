Footnotes
AWARD WANTED settled off the pace inside, advanced two wide around the turn, closed three wide between foes, surged late and was up on the wire.
MUSIC IN THE AIR was bumped at the start, vied two wide down the backstretch, dueled inside a foe from the three-eighths pole to deep stretch, dug in
gamely to fend off that rival and was nailed on the wire. CREATIVE ALIBI tracked the pace four wide, rallied outside of the winner and just missed. TALK
YOU OUT OF IT stalked the early pace outside, bid three wide nearing the three-eighths marker, dueled from there to deep stretch and was outfinished.
WORSTBESTIDEAEVER lacked speed, raced three wide around the turn, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. RICA CHICA saved ground
in midpack, swung four wide turning for home and lacked a rally. LOOKIN FOR CANDY dueled inside early and faded around the turn.
SHE'SINTHEBUSINESS had brief speed three wide and was vanned off. WILLOW DRIVE played no factor while racing three wide. MNEMOSYNE was
bumped at the start, saved ground and made little further impact.

Footnotes
GRAND SKYLARK tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane, continued on her left lead, closed outside and was up late. BIG AFFAIR
bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to set a clear pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch, shortened stride in the final sixteenth and yielded late.
PASSION'S IMAGE stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in the lane and narrowed the gap late
while outfinished by the winner. RAPIDASHQUEEN broke outwardly and slowly, chased the pace five wide, angled into the three path near midstretch and
had a mild belated gain. THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT failed to menace while racing four wide. END RESULT never threatened while racing three wide. BLUES
MARY had early speed inside and faded around the turn. LA VENEZOLANA (VEN) broke slowly and trailed in the three path.

HIGH ROLLER stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane and drove clear late. PHISH FAN dueled inside to upper stretch, drifted out
under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under right-handed pressure soon after, could not withstand the winner in the final sixteenth but
held well to preserve the place. JACK STRAIGHT settled off the pace while racing two wide, made a rail bid in upper stretch and flattened out late.
GROSCO (MEX) chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. CHEESE ON dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. DON'T MAKE IT
EASY trailed inside.

BABY BAM BAM settled off the pace outside, advanced two wide around the turn, split rivals near the three-sixteenths pole, rallied inside of the pacesetter
and edged ahead under a drive. COUGAR VISION dueled two wide, drifted out a bit turning for home, angled back in soon after, led past the eighth pole but
could not hold off the winner's inside bid late. VICTORY TIME stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced in the lane. FAIR WINDS broke and bumped
a foe at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. PRINCESS MARISOL saved ground off the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole and
never threatened. BLUE RIDGE ROSE was pinched back at the start, saved ground and made little impact. LA SMARTY dueled along the rail to upper
stretch and tired. HAY LOU C was outrun inside. SMOKING BABY played no factor while racing four wide.

speed between foes, settled back inside down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the place. IRISH CORK pressed the pace
three wide around the first turn, vied outside down the backstretch, briefly led between rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, was no match for the winner
and settled for the show. ASHRAQ set the pace along the rail and tired around the far turn. BENNY HAVENS chased the pace four wide around both turns
