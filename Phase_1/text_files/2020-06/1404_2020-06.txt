Footnotes
ONE CRAZY RIDE tracked outside to the stretch, roused to take over in the drive and went clear to the wire and held sway. DAVIS HAT chased pace
throughout, angled in through the stretch run with no late gain. THE DONNER speed to the front, stayed to the stretch but faltered in the late going. SPURS
ADDICTION raced evenly with no response when needed in the drive. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR off a bit tardy, never a factor. DODGE CITY KID off a bit
tardy and never in the hunt. The second place finished claimed fould against the winner for interference in the stretch run, after review the stewards deemed
no change.

Footnotes
HONEY SAVER tracked leader to stretch, took over, drifted over impeding rival in the final furlong. HIGLEY O'PRADO settled in nicely to far turn, rallied four
wide with late surge to just miss TRUENO good position three wide throughout, rallied along between horses. LUCKYINKENTUCKY off tardy, no speed to
the stretch, steady gain too late in the stages. COMMISSARIO good speed inside to deep stretch, bumped hard late going faded. WIND TWIST with pace to
the half, gave way readily thereafter. JULIANO never a factor. MAGIC JACK off in t tangle, failed to menace. The stewards posted the inquiry sign after the
finish, while the riders of HIGLEY O'PRADO AND TRUENO FILED AN OBJECTION INTO THE STRETCH RUN, after review OF the film the stewards
deemed that the winner HONEY SAVER bumped and bothered COMMISSARIO NEAR THE FINSH AND WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE FIFTH.

Footnotes
SHELTOWEE'S BIGCAT hustled along inside with speed, dueled to the stretch, responded well and drew off. SUMMER WAR three wide speed to turn,
checked to the quarter pole, re-rallied in the stretch for place. EL PIQUIN speed between horses to turn and was all out to hold show spot. HISTORICALLY
off tardy, lagged back to the stretch, inside rush and just missed show spot. SLEW BIZ flashed brief speed outside but gave way and backed up. HAPPY
DASH never a menace. MUCHO SPICY never far back between horses to the stretch run and never gained. BAYTOWN JAXX had an inside trip to no avail.

ABSOLUTE LOVE pressed the leader from the outside to the far turn, engaged in a duel to mid turn, and opened up before drawing away in the stretch.
MOMENTA KAT lunged at the start, stalked from the back while wide on the backstretch, moved up at the top of the far turn, and ran on to chase the winner
as second best. YIELD tracked the leaders to the far turn, lost position while off the rail, then passed a tired foe in the stretch to grab show.
SOUTHERNPERFECTION was pressed on the lead while at the rail to the far turn, dueled briefly and leveled out at the eighth pole. MISS ALTAMIRA
stumbled at the start, moved up on the rail nearing the far turn, dropped back a bit, shifted out on the tlurn to rally, came widest into the stretch and lacked a
needed finishing kick.
