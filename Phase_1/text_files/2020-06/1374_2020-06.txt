CRAFTY'S LAST was just behind the leader going into the turn and was able to get through along the inside to engage for the lead and then edged clear in
the final sixteenth. BEHOLD DE FLAME sprinted to a quick lead but was off the rail going into the turn allowing the eventual winner to come through along
the inside held gamely but could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth. DANDY VAN was well of the pace early came five wide entering the
stretch and could not make up the needed ground. ULTIMATE OLIVER was away best but then was allowed to settle and dropped back and never mounted
a rally. LOOSE CHANGE made a good move three wide on the turn to get into contention then appeared to not change leads in the stretch and tired badly
through the lane.

Footnotes
HESABULLY raced in the two path the entire mile while stalking the pace pulled even with the leader entering the stretch and edged clear in the final eighth.
DURTDOBBR showed the best early speed and had the rail held gamely when challenged while second best. WILLIAM CROTTY was a bit reluctant to load
in the gates was off slow spotting the field two lengths raced three wide on the second turn to get into contention but could not match strides with the top two
in the stretch. KALEIDOSCOPE KID raced along the inside for the mile and never mounted a serious rally. SNEAKY MEEK was last in the early stages
made a wide move up the backstretch but had little left after that. MAMBOCELLO chased the pace along the inside but tired after a half.

WHO'S THE DIVA NOW sprint to a very quick opening quarter took a breather in the second quarter while still maintaining the margin and drew clear
through the lane to win very easily while not asked for run. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH chased the winner in the two path but was no match for that rival but
was still able to hold second. RIDE LADY RIDE chased the leader along the inside but was outfinished for second while easily third best. MOONSHINE
MILDRED raced along the inside and passed tired foes. SNICKEL TE raced along the inside and was never a serious threat. MACK'S MUSIC made a four
wide move on the turn but tired through the stretch. QUITE A STARLETT showed speed for a quarter while wide and tired. SUNSHINE SALLY dropped
back quickly after the start and was not a factor.

ATONARUN was off a step slow then raced up along the inside behind the early leaders came through along the rail when the pacesetter drifted out
entering the stretch to open a good lead and held on. PREACHER'S BLUFF raced along the inside came out for the drive and was closing well between
rivals for second. PUT YOUR PANTS ON came five wide entering the stretch to get into contention but was tiring in the final strides. MIDNIGHT BOLT was
four wide on the turn and was closing well through the lane. RUNN'N REBEL raced along the inside and could not make up ground through the stretch.
TATAR showed the best early speed but came out entering the stretch allowing the winner to slip through along the rail while tiring. DRIBBLES showed
some early speed while three wide but had nothing in the stretch. COUGAR COUNTRY was up close in the two path but faded in the stretch.
