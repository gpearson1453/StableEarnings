Footnotes
GIVEITSOMEWELLIE was keyed up under a firm hold early, settled down tracking the battling leaders up the backstretch, took over three wide approaching
the stretch, kicked clear through the furlong grounds, then held on late. TOKYO moved out widest for the run up the backstretch, advanced three wide into
the stretch, and was gaining quickly outside the winner in the closing yards. WONDER BLONDY was three wide early, loomed up four wide a quarter-mile
out, could not get by GIVEITSOMEWELLIE through the lane and weakened late. LADY LARKO vied inside MISS CHEENY through a modest half-mile,
yielded readily on the rail after six furlongs, then stayed on for a share. SUNDAY SCHEMING was shuffled back along the rail after a half, went out widest
attempting to loop the field around the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. PADDY KAYE'S WILD raced toward the inside in the second flight, and was
no menace. BEE WINGS stayed in range for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and had no bids. MARIANNA QUEEN faded after six furlongs. MISS
CHEENY broke slowly, went up outside rivals four then three wide around the first turn, argued the middle fractions outside LADY LARKO, and was finished
nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SAY CHEESE was between horses among four scrimmaging up front early, could not stay with KIRTAN approaching the stretch, shifted out four wide and
came back on through the late stages to collar that rival from outside. KIRTAN vied widest of the leading foursome early, took over past the five-sixteenths
and shifted inward, remained clear to deep stretch but yielded in the last 70 yards. HIDDEN DREAMS broke in knocking FIFTH ILLUSION into KIRBY at the
start, contested the early pace two wide between horses, was out-moved approaching the stretch, and stayed on for the show. LIESEL lagged far back
inside for three furlongs, moved out in upper stretch and found her best stride belatedly. MISSING LINK broke alertly, argued the early pace inside a trio of
rivals, and tired after three furlongs. BEAUTY GENIUS was far back in the three-path to the lane, and went by tired horses. TEMPT ME stayed close behind
the leaders early, and tired on the rail. KIRBY became fractious in the gate dislodging the rider, bumped with FIFTH ILLUSION at the start, and was outrun.
FIFTH ILLUSION stumbled at the break, then was slammed into by HIDDEN DREAMS and bumped with KIRBY as well, and retired early three wide.
PRINCESS NINA raced four wide, and dropped far back through the stretch.

Footnotes
FIBER OPTIC raced in the middle of the pack three then four wide to the head of the stretch, rallied steadily and wore down GLORY ROLL from outside
late. GLORY ROLL sped to the front after an alert beginning, kicked clear through the lane, but was reeled in nearing the wire. TRUE HEIRESS bumped
with CAPE TRIOS at the start, lagged at the back inside early, was taken out six wide for some room late on the turn, and rallied willingly outside the top
two. CAPE TRIOS bumped with TRUE HEIRESS at the start, got steered out five wide nearing the stretch, and managed only a mild response. SPEED
STAR pressed GLORY ROLL from outside, got shaken off after three furlongs, and weakened. MAJESTIC MAIARA settled in the middle of the pack two
wide to the turn, and never threatened. MOONLIT SEA raced forwardly three wide to the end of the turn, and faded. SUNSET EMPIRE lacked room behind
horses inside virtually throughout, and could never be set down. POCKET OF CANDY was outsprinted early, came six wide off the turn and made no
impact. TIZANILLUSION saved ground in range to the stretch, and came up empty. MI CUAIMA was always outrun. NOT NICE raced four wide on the turn,
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPERHIGHWAY advanced four wide late on the turn, challenged for command outside VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ at the top of the stretch, gained the
upper hand a furlong out and edged clear under a drive, and was geared down the last 70 yards. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ brushed with SUPERHIGHWAY
at the start, then came in bumping WOODHAVEN KID, took over outside DIALED IN GOLD and NIT PICK after a half-mile, pulled clear around the turn
three wide, fought back when confronted by the winner into the lane, but proved no match while much best of the rest. BELLAS FELLA saved ground unable
to keep pace with the top two past the three-eighths, went around DIALED IN GOLD near the quarter-pole, moved into third while lugging in through the
furlong grounds, and widened on the remainder. DIALED IN GOLD vied inside NIT PICK early, weakened around the turn, and faded steadily on the rail
after six furlongs. FIRST SALVO bobbled at the break, and was outrun. WOODHAVEN KID got bumped by VOICESINTHEDARNEZ and lacked room after
the start, moved up inside early, and retreated on the turn. THE BLESS ONE was in the five-path and driven with no response on the turn. NIT PICK argued
the pace outside DIALED IN GOLD early, and stopped after five furlongs.

Footnotes
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY settled in striking range for six furlongs, swung four wide rallying into the stretch, and ran past the leaders from outside in the
closing yards. HERO UP rated along on the lead inside, repelled a challenge from UNCLE CURLY through the stretch, but could not contain the top one.
UNCLE CURLY prompted the pace outside HERO UP, bid through the lane, and was outkicked between horses. SPINNING KITTEN brushed the right side
of the gate at the start, was bumped in the three-path between PREACHER MARSEE and INDIRECTLY into the first turn, circled five wide off the far turn
and rallied mildly. PREACHER MARSEE was bumped around between TIZ LUNA and SPINNING KITTEN heading into the first turn, remained in tight and
steadied along until reaching the backstretch, cut the corner rallying into the stretch, and was one-paced late. TIZ LUNA steadied on the rail first time
through the stretch, bumped with PREACHER MARSEE and steadied in tight entering the first turn, continued lacking room to the backstretch, got taken
wide midway on the far turn, and could not threaten on the far outside. INDIRECTLY bumped with MIKE IS READY at the start, bumped with SPINNING
KITTEN four wide into the first turn, stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired. MIKE IS READY bumped with INDIRECTLY at the start, was four wide into
the first turn, and never reached contention. HAY HAY MY MY saved ground and was finished early. MASPERO was outrun inside. AT THE BEACH was
forwardly placed early, and gave way inside on the far turn.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPIRE bobbled and bumped with INGREIDO at the start, shifted out five wide finding his best stride after six furlongs, battled outside NO
GETTING OVER ME through the last eighth of a mile and gamely prevailed. NO GETTING OVER ME was on hold behind GRAINGER COUNTY and
INGREIDO heading into the turn, maneuvered out four wide getting his cue approaching the stretch, rallied just inside ROMAN EMPIRE as they collared the
leaders through the furlong grounds, and was edged to the wire. INGREIDO bumped with ROMAN EMPIRE at the start, pressed GRAINGER COUNTY
from outside for six furlongs, got the best of that dispute in mid stretch, then shifted in a bit while weakening inside the top two. ESPRESSO CALIENTE
came under a ride inside midway on the turn, and lacked the necessary response. GRAY BEAU stayed close early, and faded around the turn four then
three wide. GRAINGER COUNTY dueled for command inside INGREIDO to the stretch, and steadied inside that one while tiring near the eighth-pole.
THREE DEEP raced five wide around the turn, and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
MR. EDGAR sprinted to the front soon after the start, went along clear while removed from the rail to the stretch, and was kept to pressure while never in
jeopardy. REAGAN'S HEART saved ground throughout, and finished willingly to best the others. LITTLE TEQUILA bumped with EL GRAN CACAO at the
start, raced two wide to the lane, and rallied mildly. SHANGHAI LEVI saved ground throughout, and rallied belatedly for a share. FELON raced three wide
around the turn, and lacked a bid. THE BIG JOKER broke out brushing VENERATE, got outsprinted to the top by MR. EDGAR, steadied and moved off the
inside entering the turn, stayed on the chase to the stretch and gave way. RHYTHM WITH SOUL became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider briefly, got
bumped by REGGAE PIRATE at the break and was off slow, and never got close. EL GRAN CACAO bumped with LITTLE TEQUILA at the start, and tired
four wide near the quarter-pole. VENERATE got brushed by THE BIG JOKER at the break, lacked room a stride later between that one and LITTLE
TEQUILA and steadied back, and was outrun five wide. RUBATO was outrun four wide. REGGAE PIRATE stumbled badly and bumped into RHYTHM
WITH SOUL at the start, and was always far back. PUT IT ON DETTI went wrong at the back around the turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FRANK FIRST settled off the early leaders inside, was roused midway on the turn and began shifting out, challenged outside BEYOND GONE into the
stretch, gained the upper hand a sixteenth out and pulled clear. BEYOND GONE tracked three wide into the turn, took over outside MORE THAN USUAL
and JETTIN OUT approaching the quarter-pole and went clear, could not stave off FRANK FIRST through the furlong grounds and was clearly second best.
MAKABIM raced four to five wide around the turn, and was along outside I'M MORE READY to get the show on the wrong lead. I'M MORE READY stayed
fairly close three then four wide around the turn, faded and was outfinished for third. MORE THAN USUAL went up after JETTIN OUT after a quarter-mile,
took over into the turn between horses, yielded to BEYOND GONE late on the turn, and retreated. JETTIN OUT sprinted clear early, was hooked from
outside by MORE THAN USUAL after a quarter-mile, remained prominent past the midway point on the turn, then steadied inside while giving way nearing
the stretch. NORTHBROOK raced four wide, and dropped far back through the lane.

Footnotes
FLORA FANTASY advanced between horses midway on the turn, cut the corner gaining quickly on the rail into the stretch, rallied past OVER GATORS with
a furlong remaining and drew away under pressure. OVER GATORS sprinted clear inside early under a hold, shook off bids from ASSAIL and CALINAS
SONG around the turn, entered the lane in the two-path, could not handle FLORA FANTASY and ran on second best. CHAMPAGNE BLISS got bumped by
MIDNIGHT MIRACLE and lacked room behind SWEETLY MAID at the start, split horses getting in gear approaching the stretch, and rallied for the show.
ASSAIL went up to press the pace between horses after a quarter-mile, and drifted out four wide weakening at the top of the stretch. SWEETLY MAID
saved ground to no avail. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER raced three wide into the turn, steadied behind CALINAS SONG at the top of the stretch, and tired.
CALINAS SONG chased three wide for a half-mile, and tired. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE broke out bumping CHAMPAGNE BLISS, and trailed inside.

Footnotes
WHYRUAWESOME began drawing a bead on GAME BOY BENNY midway on the turn three wide, challenged outside under confident handling into the
stretch, and drew away hand urged past the eighth-pole. GAME BOY BENNY went clear into the turn two wide, was no match for the winner after entering
the stretch, and held for the place. NORTHERN stumbled sharply at the start, pressed GAME BOY BENNY from the rail early, took back and went out three
wide after a half-mile, and finished evenly. DR HARLAN broke out at the start, raced four wide around the turn, and could not gain on the far outside.
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was outrun to the stretch three wide, and passed tired horses. OX TROT was finished early toward the inside. DOC KANE bobbled
slightly at the start, raced between horses three wide midway on the turn, and faded after a half-mile. NACHO PAPA bobbled at the start, raced widest early,
and never reached contention.
