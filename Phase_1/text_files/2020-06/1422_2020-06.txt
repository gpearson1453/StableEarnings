Footnotes
EXCLUSIVE SYMPHONY lacked speed, raced five wide around the turn, closed down the center of the track and was up in the final strides. OUR
GRAYCIOUS GIRL stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained on the dueling leaders in the lane but was outkicked by the winner. STORMIN MARGARET
dueled along the rail, bumped with a rival in upper stretch, battled on to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. BARBSGRAY LION dueled two wide, was
bumped in upper stretch, battled on between rivals to deep stretch and was out finished. INTRACTABLE chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally.
IDENTITY THEFT failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
THE IRON BANK settled off the pace while caught four wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed determinedly and was up
in deep stretch. KING MAURO stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the eighth pole, led most of the stretch but was unable to stave off the winner
late. CATCH MY CABOOSE saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch and was up for the show. BUNGALOW set the pace along the rail, was
collared near the eighth pole and weakened. CENT COMM never threatened while racing two and three wide. KATMAN QUICK raced three wide in midpack
early, saved ground rounding the far turn and lacked a rally. MORNING MUSE broke through the starting gate, stumbled, fell and lost the rider before
running loose briefly, chased the pace two wide and faded after a half. CHARITABLE HERO was outrun inside. NOPALITO failed to menace while racing
two wide. SOCIAL MEDIA played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
SUNBRIDLED saved ground in range, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. SILVER
CASTLE set a clear pace along rail and led until deep stretch. ORACLE OF OMAHA stalked the pace two wide, lacked a rally and held for the show. V FOR
VIOLENCE had his head turned at the start, raced well back inside, went two wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. TRUE HEIR tracked the pace
three wide and faded nearing the lane. CAPITAL ASSET failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BRILLIANT BOLT played no factor while racing
two wide. FIREBIRD steadied nearing the first turn, raced three wide and was done after a half. WISPER FREEDOM was outrun inside. BRADY'S PALACE
broke slowly, raced four wide around the first turn and was through early.
