Footnotes
JAMMING EDDY dueled between horses then outside a rival on the turn, inched away leaving the turn and drew clear under a steady hand ride. RINSE
AND REPEAT a bit crowded leaving the chute, stalked between rivals then outside a foe on the turn, split horses into the stretch and was clearly second
best. APPRECIATED saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside in the stretch and edged rivals for the show. MR PAYTIENCE broke through the
gate before the start, had speed outside then dueled three deep, stalked off the rail into the turn and three wide into the stretch and was edged for the show
between foes late. CONTE CAVOUR chased three deep then off the rail on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was edged for a minor award four
wide on the line. BAM BAM AGAIN angled in leaving the chute and dueled inside, stalked leaving the turn, came a bit off the rail in the stretch, was between
foes in the final sixteenth and weakened.

was edged for second between foes. LEMON DROP TINI angled in on the first turn and chased inside, came out into the stretch, split horses in midstretch
and was edged for third toward the inside. I GIVE UP three deep early, angled in outside a rival then between foes leaving the backstretch, came three wide

inside, came slightly off the rail in deep stretch and finished willingly. RED DIAMOND broke out a bit, chased inside, came out into the stretch and again in

stretch and went on willingly late. MISS ALEGRIA stalked four wide then outside a rival on the backstretch and off the rail on the turn and into the stretch
and was outfinished. ARYA'S DAGGER bumped at the start, chased between horses then inside, steadied in a bit tight into the turn, came a bit off the rail in

Footnotes
ANNA FANTASTIC pressed then stalked the pace four wide, bid four wide into the stretch, drifted in under right handed pressure to bump with the runner-up
in midstretch and again in deep stretch and gamely prevailed late. LIBERALISM dueled between horses, put a head in front into the stretch, fought back off
the rail bumping with the winner in midstretch and deep stretch and was edged nearing the wire. LOVELY FINISH bumped at the start, chased outside,
came four wide into the stretch and got up for the show three deep on the line. A MELIS prompted the pace three deep between horses then three wide on
the turn and into the stretch, was not a match for the top pair in the final furlong and was edged between foes late for the show. SCREAM AND SHOUT had
good early speed and dueled inside, fought back on the turn and into the stretch and was edged for a minor share late. SHEZ OUR ARCH a step slow to
begin, was between horses early then chased a bit off the rail, swung three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. APPROVED FOR FLYBY
broke a bit slowly, saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened late. MOUNTAIN PASS stalked between horses then
outside a rival, continued a bit off the rail on the turn and did not rally. RUN LIKE KONA broke in and bumped a rival, chased three deep then off the rail
angled to the inside on the turn and lacked a rally in the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the top pair but made no change
when they ruled the contact between them was mutual.
