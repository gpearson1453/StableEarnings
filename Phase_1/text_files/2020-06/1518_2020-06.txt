the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. DR. DEVERA'S WAY hustled from the gate, raced four wide
in pursuit in aim of the leader, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. BIG
BOY MO coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning two to three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. DANGEROUS EDGE chased three to four
wide down the backstretch before tipping five wide through the turn, came under a ride midway on the turn, went four wide for home and weakened.
KADENS COURAGE hustled from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COBBLE HILL away without apparent mishap, got moved towards the inside, settled along the outer rim of the inside route and went on to draft behind the
pacesetter, was cued up for the drive home, angled three to four wide into the stretch, flashed a quick turn of foot to take over upon completion of the run
leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, kept going well to stay in the clear. LOST IN ROME sent over to the rail after the break, rode it until
more than halfway around the bend, slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out five wide for the stretch run, inched up to the winner down
the middle of the strip en route to earning place honors. KILMARKNOCK willingly advanced into the pocket after stumbling at the start, kept an eye on the
front runners while being firmly rated, got sent out two wide for entrance into the stretch, checked when shut off by the ones to catch a little beyond the
three-sixteenths pole, with J'S WARRIOR bearing more responsibility than CARTERS GOT SASS for having closed down the path, regained enough
interest to nail down third. J'S WARRIOR bobbled right after the start, suffered no ill effects from that miscue and assumed a forward position, pressed the
issue two to three wide, pilot holding something back in reserve, was about as wide stepping onto the top of the lane, came in as its fellow pace contestant,
that being CARTERS GOT SASS was coming out, only less so, resulting in both meeting up on the same path occupied at the time by KILMARKNOCK,
leading his rider to check hard, proved powerless soon afterwards when others arrived on the scene and steadily backed away. TIPAZO took up the chase
three wide, shifted out five wide once in the stretch, didn't make an impact. CARTERS GOT SASS disputed the pace from just off the rail, was asked for
more for the drive home, came out a bit at the furlong grounds, surrendered soon afterwards and retreated. AFLEET MICKEY strung out three wide on the
turn, folded after going a half. WISECRACK pursued the pace from path two, got ridden into the lane, lost action abruptly approaching the eighth pole, got
expertly pulled up, was subsequently vanned off, having bled.

GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) forwardly placed along the inside, conceded the front to settle under a good hold saving ground just off the pace, tipped to the
two path through the far turn remaining on hold, angled out to swing four wide into upper stretch, got given a notch and was tapped with an off sided stick
and burst to the front when roused near the eighth pole, drew quickly clear coming inwards inside that station, the rider peering back to ensure it was safely
done, then was lightly ridden out to the wire. GAUGUIN (GER) saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped to the two path following the aforementioned foe
through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, was in behind rivals awaiting as GOOD
GOVERNANCE cleared to the outside, tipped out a path roused near the eighth pole and ran on to secure the place honors. PERSONAL TIME forwardly
placed just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command
when overhauled by the top one, then weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. SHERKALI (IRE) established the front shortly after the
start and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until let out swinging just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in confronted
dueling with the aforementioned rival to near the eighth pole when overtaken in tandem by the eventual winner, then weakened in the late going. KID
BOURBON coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace two to three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
SANITY vying for command just about from the get-go, got eased back conceding the front end to ATHWAAQ, was patiently ridden tracking that opponent,
cut the corner into the lane along the open hedge route, was poised to strike the top when given her cue at the three-sixteenths pole, wasted no time going
to the lead, edged away in the final furlong under a strong drive. FIRST APPEAL guided over to the inside shortly after the start, continued to save ground,
was given her cue for the drive home, tipped into path two to be outside the winner in midlane, ventured onward with willingness but failed to dent the
margin. ATHWAAQ away alertly, remained a pace contestant, gained the advantage after the winner backed off a bit on the backstretch, showed the way
rated along towards the two path, sputtered one farther off the inside entering the stretch, got headed in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,
stayed on well for the last-in-the-money slot. TELETYPE took up the chase two to three wide, went four wide into the lane, settled in and was outfinished.
COBRA SOPHIE took up residence in midpack, stalked the pace from path two in between rivals for most of the initial half, turned into the lane with her path
unobstructed by any other, failed to fire appreciably. PUPAREE underwent a three to four wide on the turn, got sent out approximately five wide for the
drive, launched no bids. ANNIE ROCKS brought up the back of the pack after bobbling slightly at the start, raced from near the inside for the first half, got
steered out three wide stepping into the lane, had no response.

BLUE BELT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and drew off under a drive to prevail. JAVELIN coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest for the place honors. GAULTIER (FR) forwardly placed just
off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. TALE OF MIST chased four wide under
coaxing from midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide for home and made no impact. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK three then two wide in

BARLEEWON away well, tracked the pacesetter towards the inside, going about the task from path two for a period of the journey on the backstretch, slid
over into a tight fit along the inside route as the half was being completed, narrowed in on the loose leader during the run around the fuller bend, tipped to
the outside for entrance into the stretch, was in path two challenging in earnest a sixteenth down the road, wasted no time snatching away the advantage,
kicked clear, completing the final sixteenth under a vigorous hand ride. VOLIERO strung out three wide on the chute, was more in the two path departing the
backstretch, swung out four wide for the drive home, rallied for the place. MUNDACIOUS underwent a two wide pursuit, came under a ride spinning into the
stretch, got outfinished. AINTITFUNKYNOW hung out four wide after springing from the starting gate, got worked over to the hedge by the conclusion of the
backstretch, cut the corner into the lane, shifted into the two path splitting foes in midlane, finished fairly evenly afterwards for the last major check.
OPERATIVE chased the three to four wide for three-quarters, was maneuvered into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, backed away.
JUSTINTIMEFORWINE broke on top and retained the advantage, appeared rank spurting off from the others after crossing onto the backstretch, went
about its business alternating between paths two and three, was more the former leading the others on the turn, went into the lane, yielded readily in the
general area of the three-sixteenths marker and faltered. FREEDOM AND WHISKY parked out five wide stepping onto the backstretch, travelled in the three
path after stepping off the backstretch, came into the lane and retreated. LORD CADBURY cut over to the rail shortly after leaving the chute, began to get
eased nearing the half mile pole, got pulled up, was subsequently vanned off, then was reported to have bled. NO SALT ducked in sharply springing from
the starting gate, lost his rider after striking the temporary railing, losing the rider as a result, was vanned off after being apprehended by an outrider.
Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the start, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

WORTH A SHOT established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside settling into a comfortable rhythm down the
backstretch, remained patiently handled as rivals advanced through the far turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in confronted and
dueled from upper stretch to the sixteenth marker before repelling the challenge to inch away through to the finish. RINALDI veered out at the break towards
the widener course and was corrected and put back on track, raced two to three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, advanced through the far turn to
issue a challenge when let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the stretch until ultimately rebuffed a sixteenth
out, then ran on to preserve the place honors. OPT two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. THE J Y bobbled at the break, recovered to chase along
the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages.
GHOST GIANT tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and was
outkicked. DOUPS POINT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no late headway.
NUTZFORBOLTZ saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered
no response.

Footnotes
MENTALITY got engaged with KID IS FROSTY shortly after the field had been sent off and running, was in the two path contending with the aforementioned
rival for command, inherited a clear advantage when the nemesis backed off after becoming rank heading for the half mile pole, cut over closer to the rail in
short order, showed the way, with the runner up having become the primary pursuer, got put to a drive for the drive home, shifted back into the two path,
dug in stubbornly to defend the front end, continued onward with good energy to edge away. HANNAH'S SMILE secured a prominent position on the
backstretch, was towards the two path prompting the winner on the turn, between rivals from the top of it until around the five-sixteenths pole, followed the
top one by moving wider into the lane herself, put in a determined bid over the course of the next furlong, got staved off, managed to save second.
SARATOGA TREASURE pursued the front runners from the two path, got fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, closed in, came up short for
second. KID IS FROSTY vied with the winner for the lead from along the inside, pulling on the bit while engaged at that task, was rank heading for the top of
the turn, went backwards, losing all told in the neighborhood of two lengths, sat patiently pocketed, stepped into the lane, idled for a little while until the top
one opened up her lane by shifting two wide herself, failed to fire appreciably when given her cue. PURRAGEOUS DYNA three wide onto the turn, was one
path wider entering the stretch, weakened. JC'S SHOOTING STAR worked to the inside after being pinched at the start, eyed the front runners while
spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, angled three wide into the lane, had no offering.

KEFALIANI just off the pace in pursuit along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, dug in knocking heads with the runner up and gamely inched away at the end to prevail. HEY IT'S TATI crossed soon after
the start to be four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, advanced steadily on that rival applying pressure through
the latter portion of the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in under threat and
was headed a furlong out, fought on to the finish getting shaken off late on while clear for the place honors. HAPPY HILL LIL five paths off the inside down
the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
kept on to garner the show honors. CRICK five paths off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked two to three wide through the turn losing some
position before coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, went four wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths near the eighth pole and kept
on to just get up for the last major share. SANDER'S EMPIRE broke out at the start supplying half the pressure to pinch back HENNING'S PENNY in
tandem with LOVELY ESCORT, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under a ride at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper
stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. QUEENTIGUA broke in at the start and was corrected, came under coaxing and chased three wide from just off
the pace, got placed to urging at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. FUNDERELLA three to four wide in pursuit
from mid pack, got coaxed along with three furlongs to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MOPOLKA brushed the near side
stall at the start, came under coaxing and established the front crossing to show the way from the two path settling in hand, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under steadily increasing pressure from HEY IT'S TATI, to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, succumbed on the front
straightened away and weakened. VITANZA stumbled badly at the start pecking and pawing the ground two to three times from her knees before able to
upright herself conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased along the inside down the backstretch from mid pack, tipped to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and weakened. LOVELY ESCORT shied in at the start in reaction to
QUEENTIGUA breaking inwards and pinched back HENNING'S PENNY in tandem with pressure from SANDER'S EMPIRE, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn, got ridden along midway on the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. HAYEZHEE chased along the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. OUR LADY OF WINLOC brushed the off side stall at the start,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch and tired. CITY BIRD FLYING six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. HENNING'S PENNY got bumped between foes and was
pinched back at the start conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole,
went three wide for home and trailed throughout.
