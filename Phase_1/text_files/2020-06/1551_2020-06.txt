Footnotes
POPULAR APPEAL was chasing to the turn, bid four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in deep stretch and got the nod on the line. ANA
LISA hustled to a clear advantage, set the pace three wide to the stretch, dug in when hooked by the winner but just missed. HOPSCOTCHY dwelt in the
gate and was five lengths last to begin, was outrun to the turn, bid four wide then swung widest for the drive and closed steadily in a good effort. WICKED
SUNSET hopped at the start, recovered to chase to the turn, also raced three then four wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally.
IT'S BIG AINE had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEAR CHUM (AUS) broke a step slow then pushed up to stalk the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to collar FACTS MATTER along with PASSIONATE
REWARD nearing the sixteenth marker then dug in to get the nod. PASSIONATE REWARD also was stalking the leader three wide to the stretch, rallied to
get on terms nearing the sixteenth pole then battled the winner but missed. FACTS MATTER set the pace in the two path to the stretch, edged away to mid
stretch but was tiring in the late stages. PURE COMEDY had no speed, was behind rivals and climbing from the seven sixteenths to the five sixteenths while
in the three path, finally leveled out in upper stretch and closed a gap. SUNSET DRAGUNN pressed the pace to the turn, swung out four wide into the
stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

INQUISITION was outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted inside of the runnerup, rallied when set down and prevailed. LUCK IS MY
NAME was chasing the leader to the turn, bid inside that one and dueled for the lead to mid stretch, stayed on late but was outfinished by the winner and got
the nod for second. MUSKET POWDER was also chasing the pace, raced three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to be on terms to deep stretch then was
also outkicked and just missed second. PEQUENO MONTE tracked the pace to the turn, bid four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to be a factor to deep
stretch then was outfinished. BERNIE'S BIG BOY was outsprinted early, advanced four wide to the stretch, was a threat to mid stretch but could not muster
the needed late response. UNFLAPPABLE sped clear to the turn but tired mid turn and stopped in the stretch.

ARIES pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up three wide to engage for the lead, drew away to mid stretch and held under steady urging. SHARI
was jostled between horses nearing the first turn, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner while easily
second best. SIDE EFFECT (GB) tracked the pace four wide to the second turn, remained four wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. DESERT
SMOKE hustled to the lead, set the pace off the rail to the second turn, was overtaken into the stretch and tired. PURE PERFECTION had no speed, raced
four wide throughout and was never a threat. LEONILLA got outsprinted while caught out five deep to the second turn, settled to the far turn but gave way in

INDIAN DANCER set the pace under pressure two wide to the stretch, was headed leaving the furlong grounds by the runnerup but fought back and got the
nod. SHE BEGAN AGAIN stalked the winner to the far turn, rallied three wide and was on terms in mid stretch, briefly had a whisker in front leaving the
furlong grounds but could not hold off the favorite. CRIMSON CLOUD pressed the winner three wide to the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and
finished evenly. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME trailed for six furlongs while three wide then could not make an impact in the drive. MISSIONELLE was settled for a
half, raced four wide on the far turn but came up empty in the drive.

KNOWN hustled to contest the pace inside of LIVE A GOOD LIFE, responded to put that one away to mid stretch then held determinedly. LOOK AT MY
HOOVES was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then eased out for room and finished willingly. HULA KING had no speed, raced three
wide to the stretch then shifted in and closed steadily but could not get the place. LORD VADER tracked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch
then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SWIFT CHANNEL also was tracking outside of LORD VADER, raced three wide to the stretch but
lacked the needed late response. MULZOFF got outsprinted early, was off the rail on the turn and not a threat in the drive. LIVE A GOOD LIFE attended the
pace outside the winner to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. LONO broke a bit slow, was under strong urging early but had no speed
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT was never far back, rallied four wide on the second turn, responded to take over nearing the sixteenth marker and prevailed driving. MAD
LUTHER pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over in mid stretch but could not stall the winner. AIGLE was settled for
a half mile, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. MONSAJEM PERVADE had no speed, settled to the second turn,
was three wide to the stretch then also finished evenly. DYNAMITE RIDE hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail for six furlongs, resisted to mid stretch
then was collared by the runnerup and weakened. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE threw his head at the break and was five lengths last coming out of the gate,
lagged to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then closed the gap without threatening. KID ARCADE was allowed to settle, got fanned out five wide
on the second turn and did not rally in the drive. PAPA PAGOSA was outsprinted to the backstretch, raced four wide on the second turn and gave out after
six furlongs.
