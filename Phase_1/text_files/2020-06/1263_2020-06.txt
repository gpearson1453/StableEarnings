Footnotes
FAIRYWREN stalked the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, bid in the final furlong and drove clear. CANDY'S DREAM
stalked along the rail, was boxed in upper stretch, angled out and rallied. FEELING FUNNY broke outward, showed speed, set the pace, was collared mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. SO ELUSIVE settled off the pace, closed angling in from the fifth path to three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely
outside. BALLROOMS OF MARS settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide late turn then finished gamely. WORDS OF GOLD, in range, raced along the
rail then two-wide on the turn, launched her drive, angled out mid stretch but evened out. JLOHR JAN raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the
turn then finished gamely in vain. CHERUBIC stalked the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn then finished evenly. MARIPOSA BELLE settled in
mid pack, came four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. SHES THE NORTH, in range, raced three and four-wide on the turn but evened
out in the late stages. TARA DAWN, in mid pack early, raced three-wide, bumped and steadied on the turn then lacked a rally. KARAKONTIE FLYER
settled in mid pack, came four and five-wide through the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. NAKED ILLUSION dropped back early, rode the rail on
the turn then tendered a mild run upper stretch then evened out. CASH CODE, in touch, dropped back two-wide on the turn and lacked a closing response.

NOT SO QUIET showed speed on the inside, set the pace while saving ground, was forced to duel into the stretch as SOUPER SUCCESS launched a bid,
briefly lost the lead but dug in and prevailed. SOUPER SUCCESS showed speed, pressed the leader while racing two-wide, briefly took the lead as he
launched a bid, dueled to the wire but was narrowly outkicked. SOUPER SMART stalked the pacesetters while saving ground, angled out at the top of the
stretch, brushed with RECONFIGURE nearing the furlong pole as that foe laid in a bit and finished gamely. RECONFIGURE broke alertly, stalked the pace,
raced two and three-wide on the turn, looked contentious at the top of the stretch, laid in a bit in early stretch then evened out. SILENT JIMMIE dropped
back at the start, began to rally while racing two-wide early on the turn and finished gamely. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS raced in midpack, was three-wide on the
turn, was asked at the top of the stretch and offered no response. O'KRATOS followed the pack while racing widest, was four to three-wide on the turn
before angling back to the four-path and offered no rally. WYATT'S TOWN raced near the back early, trailed on the turn and came up empty.

ANOTHER TIME pressed the pace while two-wide throughout, chased into the stretch, launched a determined drive and got up late, driving. SOUPER
ESCAPE set a reserved pace, was pressured on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed to hold in the late stages. NANTUCKET RED,
rated in range, stalked the pace from the rail and finished gamely. LUNAR GARDEN stalked the pace three-wide, chased hard into the stretch then finished
evenly. GET EXPLICIT settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then while game in the stretch, did not menace. AMALFI COAST
was steadied just out of the gate, raced in mid pack, was steadied again on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and finished gamely. RED
CABERNET, in mid pack early, raced two-wide throughout and finished evenly. STOP WHO'S THAT raced in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns but
lacked a rally. OCEANS OF LOVE settled in mid pack, raced four-wide on both turns then lacked a closing response. ALICE'S WAR was well off the pace,
saved ground on the turns, picked it up in the stretch but failed to menace.

Footnotes
MISS VERRAZANO moved up to force the pace into the turn, took command at the top of the stretch and powered away then finished under a business-like
hand ride. TYPICALLY raced in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide through the turn then rallied gamely. SHISHKA settled in mid pack, 2was hustled
from the second path and the rail on the turn then finished with determination. ENHANCED FINANCE showed early foot and moved clear, was hustled
under pressure on the turn, was no match for the eventual winner at the top of the stretch but chased gamely to the end. OBLIVIOUSLY closed quickly to
contention, chased two-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. MISS MATILDA raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but flattened
out in the final 16th. I'M A GINGER, in range, closed into the turn, chased three-wide to the stretch then flattened out with a 16th to run. SPEEDY DEVIL
settled off the pace, came four and five-wide through the turn but never reached contention. CHICK BEAR raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide late turn
the evened out in the stretch. EZME'SGIRL settled off the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. HARPSWELL was taken back
at the start, raced four-wide on the turn and was not a menace. FRIDAY NIGHT MAGIC settled in mid pack, saved ground,but lacked a closing response.
JULIE'S TAP DANCER stalked the pace, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally.
