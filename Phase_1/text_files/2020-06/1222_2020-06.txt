Footnotes
ALEXANDROS settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, shifted three wide while gaining inside the quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the
stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then powered away under strong urging. BIG BELLA BROWN bobbled at the start but
recovered quickly to get the lead then moved clear early, raced two path to the inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive
into upper stretch, lost the lead inside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. PLATINUM NIGHTS stalked the
pace on the outside, chased three to two wide on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. WHISKEY ECHO was
urged along in fourth position, chased while moving out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. COAL TRUTH settled
on the inside of a rival, came under strong urging late on the backstretch, went four wide for most of the turn, was carried five wide late on that bend then
fanned six wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. ENDER was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung seven
wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. GALACTICA was urged along on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn, was carried six wide late on
that bend then fanned seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. YOUVESAIDITALL was ridden along towards the back, saved ground on the turn and
failed to respond. BOURNE IN NIXA was last to commence, settled at the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and
was no factor. MARK OF THE Z tracked the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, came up empty in the three path on the turn and

upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, was carried out a bit late and got up under strong urging. VISUAL MAGIC went to
the front, set an uncontested the pace in the two path, was asked on the far turn then came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong,
swapped back to her inside lead late and was denied while clear for the place. GRACELY went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on
the outside, made a bid in the three path under urging on the far turn, passed the quarter-pole under the whip, chased the leader into the final furlong,
steadied while being out-kicked by the top two inside the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the show. GOINGTOAGOGO raced inside to the two path on the
first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, settled on the outside, advanced four then five wide on the far turn but lacked the needed response.
MIZZANNA was well placed just off the pace near the inside, came under urging on the far turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked the needed kick.
GOLD INCLUDED was caught in the six path on the first turn, settled on the far outside, went five then four wide under urging on the far turn, moved out in
upper stretch and failed to rally. TASMIN angled in early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path
on the far turn and failed to threaten. JOY TO THE WORLD was taken back under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the middle of
the field, was ridden along while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a strong drive and came up empty. AIR WALKER bobbled at the start,
was caught in the five path while between horses on the first turn, continued between horses early on the backstretch, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, went four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. AMERICAN DREAM was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, lagged at the

TAKE THAT FOR DATA went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried towards the rear, raced under tight restraint at the back near the
seven-sixteenths, remained near the back while inside to the two path on the far turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to near the sixteenth-pole,
found room at that point and accelerated strongly then powered to victory. POST CLOSE raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was well placed just
off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, waited with the rider looking behind him into upper stretch, was roused outside the furlong marker, rallied
to make a bid between horses late but missed while just able to get the place. BELL RINGER saved ground on the first turn, settled near the middle of the
field, raced inside on the far turn, waited while blocked passing the quarter-pole, was roused into upper stretch, rallied along the rail to get the lead inside
the sixteenth-pole but was caught and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. MO GEE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace
on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in
upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken and lost the trifecta. PRAETORIAN went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, advanced leaving the backstretch, was asked while three wide on the far turn, chased into the final sixteenth, made a brief bid late but was
outfinished. TIMES SQUARE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, steadied near the five-sixteenths while three to four wide, came five
wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. GILES rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, came under some urging around the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the far turn, moved to the four path while blocked at
the top of the stretch, continued blocked to inside the furlong marker then altered to the outside and lost his best chance. GOT NO KASH brushed with a foe
early, went three to four wide on the first turn, was reserved under restraint, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused while five to six wide on the far
turn, dropped to the four path late on that bend, chased in the stretch and was out-kicked. DECLARE WAR brushed with a foe before leaving the chute,
went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. DAUNTLESS
PRINCE went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace, was challenged with three furlongs to run, vied inside on the far turn, lost
the lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way. DANCE KINGDOM went four to five wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was in tight while four to five
wide near the five-sixteenths and faltered. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, there was no change made to the order of finish.
