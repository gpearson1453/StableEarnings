the eighth pole but was caught the final stride. BYE BYE SHANGHAI unhurried early from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded
when sat down for the drive and rallied late for the show. CONFEDERATE YELL stalked the early pace outside, advanced through the second turn,
responded but could not sustain the effort. BULLET BANDIT could only improve position. SINGING EAGLE chased the early pace and tired. CADET
