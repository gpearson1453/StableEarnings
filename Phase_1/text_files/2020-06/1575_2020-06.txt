Footnotes
FOO FOO GIRL soon emerged with the lead, showed the way from inside while in hand, was put to urging upper stretch and maintained control under a
steady drive. HIDDEN FIGURE gradually progressed from inside, waited for room on the turn, got through two wide at the top of the lane, moved clear for
second then could only just hold her position. PRESENT OF HERO prominent from outside, was three wide on the turn, forced out some into the stretch and
found best stride too late. HOLD THE SPENDING progressed from outside to reach contention four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run
and also rallied belatedly. MINING FOR PEARLS pressed FOO FOO GIRL from just outside, floated out some into the lane and leveled off. I'M SO TINK
well back early, piked up her pace from outside on the turn and showed a willingness to run late. AMSALOR saved ground and showed little. WARY
CARRIE chased from between horses, floated out widest on the turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
MORA VALLEY was soon clear of the field, put to a drive in the lane and steadily widened command. TOMASITA chased from between rivals, advanced
three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the stretch and gained second late. LITTLE MOLITTA in contention from outside, lost ground four to six wide
through the bend and rallied belatedly in the stretch. COOLER SCHEDULE without early speed, saved ground taking the turn, came off the rail some for the
drive and showed late interest. MISS LEARJET well placed from inside, lacked the extra needed deep stretch. BE AUTHENTIC pressed from just off the
inside, came out some for the stretch run and gradually yielded. TEMPLESIS prominent between rivals, swung out five wide into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. LION'S WAGER swung out widest on the turn and had no late bid. ON THE MONEY was an early factor but faded between horses on the
bend. MUCH TO DO showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
MY CURBY difficult to load, was rated on the inside once the race began, swung out three wide to commence his bid on the turn, took over midstretch then
steadily opened up under a drive. MONTEZUMA EXPRESS vied for the lead outside KIM MAN, moved ahead two wide on the turn and took the rail, was
challenged upper stretch, no match for MY CURBY the last eighth, began to slowly wear down and just lasted for second. ALSHUJAA progressed three
wide on the bend, lodged his bid belatedly deep stretch but gained third. JACK N JOHN saved ground taking the turn, angled outside rivals upper stretch
and showed a willingness to run late. WILDWOOD'S AFLEET chased from between horses, was just off the inside on the turn and also showed late interest.
CAST IRON lost ground five wide taking the bend and closed the gap on the second flight belatedly deep stretch. TREASURE NAP improved position three
wide leaving the turn then failed to have a significant stretch bid between rivals. KIM MAN displayed early speed from inside but began to tire before
finishing four furlongs. HE'S THUNDER faded while toward the outside on the bend. FLOWER PUNCH prominent early, began to tire four wide with three
furlongs left.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE kept close between horses, went for the lead four wide on the turn, angled in some leaving the bend, took a narrow advantage
upper stretch and shook free the last seventy yards. BEEMIE AWARD also prominent between horses, bid three wide on the bend, battled through the lane
and slowly wore down deep stretch. STALLONE in contention early, angled in with a half mile to go, came four wide into the stretch, could not close the gap
but caught B SALTY for third. B SALTY soon disputed the pace from inside but slowly wore down deep stretch. RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS shuffled back
shortly after the break, was just off the inside on the bend, gained the rail into the lane and gave way. INTONATION was four wide on the turn and had no
late bid. MIDNIGHT JOKER void of speed, angled in leaving the bend and failed to rally in the lane. WILDWOOD SECRET displayed early speed just
outside B SALTY but gave way two wide on the turn. DANCIN NICKY steadily faded from inside, was eased in the stretch and walked off after the race.

Footnotes
BIT MONEY hesitated at the break, advanced inside, waited for room on the turn, got through along the rail into the lane then steadily drew away under a
urging. WOOD NOT MIND also hesitated at the start, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out further into the stretch and got up for second late.
TRYST CAT contested the pace from outside from the beginning, was two wide on the bend, forced out some entering the lane, was no match for BIT
MONEY and slowly wore down in the waning yards. CUDDLE ME forwardly placed from outside, was three wide on the bend, angled in upper stretch and
weakened the last furlong. KINGSBURY DREAM saved ground taking the turn, was checked behind CUDDLE ME inside the last eighth and eventually
gained a clear path along the rail deep stretch. WILDWOOD SCAT void of speed, was in path three, swung to the outside for the stretch run and passed
tired ones. ALLEY 'O MALLEY did not keep up between rivals on the turn, was three wide entering the lane and lacked a significant stretch bid. STAR
MAGNA displayed early speed between horses, gained the rail on the turn, came off the inside some entering the stretch and flattened out. DANCING HIGH
failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. SING KITTY SING broke in the air and showed little.

Footnotes
SHMILY shared the early lead inside WILLOW RIDGE, moved clear when put to a drive in the stretch and held sway under steady handling. DIAMOND
MAXIMUS without early speed, commenced his bid along the rail on the turn, was forced to weave around traffic as he made a strong move in the lane and
caught WILLOW RIDGE for second. WILLOW RIDGE disputed the pace from outside, did not stay with SHMILY in the stretch and slowly wore down the last
eighth. SIRCORRI in contention from the start, advanced three wide on the bend then slowly yielded between horses in the lane. BEHIND ENEMY LINES
trailed and only passed outside tired ones in the stretch. TUFF ATTACK well pl;aced early, saved ground on the bend and flattened out the last furlong.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP progressed three wide on the turn but leveled off between foes through the lane. TAK rushed up from inside only to be cut off by
ONE WAY HOME and checked hard after travelling the first sixteenth, altered out some, was bumped by the latter at the half mile marker and faded from
path three on the turn. ONE WAY HOME broke in stride and angled to the inside early on, did not keep up midway on the backstretch, angled out at the half
mile pole, bumped TAK then also yielded on the bend. There was a stewards' inquiry into TAK'S loss of action early in the race and his being bumped at the
half mile marker. After their review, the stewards made no changes.

Footnotes
GREAT SCAT squeezed back in the early going, altered out with five furlongs to go, advanced between horses to vie for the lead from outside, moved
ahead into the stretch and drew away under urging the last eighth. NOT CHOPPED LIVER contested the pace between rivals, was two wide on the bend,
could not stay with GREAT SCAT in the lane but held onto second under steady urging the final furlong. FOUR LEFT FEET forwardly placed early,
advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive, moved clear for third then could only hold his position. SHOBIZ STAR prominent from
inside, angled out leaving the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid from between horses. BARNYARD FIDDLER was an early factor, three to four
wide taking the turn then advanced between rivals in the stretch without threatening. JUSTENUFFTUFF pressed from outside but faded four wide on the
bend. VIRGA improved position two wide on the bend, was forced out by SHOBIZ STAR into the lane and flattened out five wide the final eighth. K STREET
was checked solidly leaving the five furlong marker, angled in on the turn, swung out widest for the stretch run and had little to offer. MUTAKDDIM ROAD
very fractious in the gate, was taken out and walked for the veterinarian, reloaded, displayed early speed just off the inside, gained the rail on the turn and
gave way the last quarter mile. The rider of K STREET lodged an objection claiming interference from GREAT SCAT at the five furlong pole. After their
review, the stewards disqualified GREAT SCAT for that interference and placed him eighth.
