Footnotes
TEQUILA SUNDAY well off the inside throughout, settled into midpack as the field made its way on the backstretch, stalked the pace towards path four
during the run around the bend, flashed interest as the second split was about to be posted, was given its cue at the head of the stretch, narrowed in on the
ones to catch, resumed its steadfast rally leaving the eighth pole, drew up dangerously close to OVERTIME OLIVIA in deep stretch and venturing on with
good determination got up at the finish line. OVERTIME OLIVIA remained forwardly placed after a quick start, cut over to the inside, went at it with
APPLETINI, that foe being stationed out in the two path, was called upon for more approaching the top of the stretch, responded, edging away from the
nemesis, came under pressure from fresher opponents soon afterwards, from both sides, showed no quit, but got nailed. MOVIE SCORE away without
apparent mishap, cut over to the rail prior to leaving the backstretch,was eased to the outside right around the five-sixteenths pole, checked when caught in
traffic a furlong later, took a while to get going once more, eventually doing so a little past the eighth pole, was moved back to the inside in deep stretch,
then came home with belatedly foot to earn the show award. TIZ A KITTEN guided over to the rail, was taken to the outside a short distance from the
quarter pole, closed the gap under his own power the rest of the way to the end of the bend, was worked into the five path from upper to deep stretch,
gained well for the final significant slice of the pot. APPLETINI sparred for command from path two, weakened in the final furlong. LOOKBOTHWAYS
abandoned the rail for the three path on the turn, went about it under a brisk ride, was moved to outside until six wide late, made no impact. EVAN'S NICE
NOW loosely pocketed, faltered. ITS A CHANCE in path two both on the turn and into the stretch, tired. PARTY IN THE SAND pinched at the break,
displayed no speed saving ground for the opening half, fanned out into the six path during the stretch run, made no bids. SISTER EMILY spotted two wide
on the turn, failed to menace. J J LOVES BILLY hustled from the starting gate, stepped onto the turn from the three path, was through before going a half,
was put to a protective hold being eased, walked to the wire in the final stages, then walked off the track without need of outside assistance.

DOMESTIC SPENDING (GB) settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into
upper stretch, offered up a strong kick through the final furlong to engage the leader inside the final sixteenth and was up in the last jumps to prevail. DON
JUAN KITTEN attended the leader in closest aim just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home and
seized command straightened away, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was nailed in the final strides. MAXWELL
ESQUIRE tracked the pace along the inside, got set down cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the show
honors. EVER DANGEROUS just off the pace just off the inside, tipped three wide three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, continued three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GET SMOKIN established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, remained patiently
handled coming under challenge near the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and was headed for command straightened away, then
weakened through to the finish. LIAM'S FIRE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home,
was unable to make an impact. TALAKO settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, suffered a catastrophic injury to his left front nearing the
three-eighths pole, got immediately put to a protective hold being guided outside and expertly pulled up, then was euthanized on track. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the incident on the far turn focusing on TALAKO before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
MALIBU MISCHIEF remained forwardly placed after an alert start, cut over to the inside, was rated along fending off COTTON CANDY CUTIE out in the two
path, continued along under the same scenario for the opening half, stepped onto the head of the stretch and was fed her cue, responded, holding the
earlier-mentioned rival at bay, began to drift to the outside once past the eighth pole until about four wide, had enough at the end to preserve the decision.
MISS LOYALTY rode the rail, was under encouragement getting tipped into the two path entering the stretch, was altered back to the inside once the winner
became wayward at the eighth pole, gained steadily but fell short. COTTON CANDY CUTIE hustled from the starting gate, sparred with winner from the two
path, was driven into the stretch, got outfinished. AMERS within striking distance of the front runners coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, dove
over to the rail, took it to the end of the bend, angled four wide into the stretch, went onward for a few strides then began to shift wider yet, winding up
approximately seven wide when done, rallied mildly but without impact. CAMORRA forwardly placed three wide for a half, gave way. PRINCESS MIKAYAH
two wide onto the turn and into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. MAGARI four wide entering the turn, was one path farther off the inside exiting it, had
no rally. STARLITE MISSION strung out five wide on the turn after being pinched at the start, was never involved. TAYLER'S THE BOSS took up the chase
from path two in midpack, spun towards the third one for the drive home, had no offering. VOLODINA along the inside route, went on to cut the corner into
the lane to no avail. ATHWAAQ three wide at the top of turn, displayed brief foot.

Footnotes
DANCERS FOR TOKEN took up residence in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, appeared a bit keen heading for the half mile pole three
wide, pilot applying a tight grip on the reins, narrowed in without need of encouragement, saw the rider alter course towards the rail after crossing midpoint
on the turn, changed course and proceeded to get ridden four wide into the stretch, reeled in the ones to catch to emerge as the as the new leader at the
eighth pole, extended the margin to a healthy size prior to being geared down for the final forty yards. JADE'S DREAM sparred for the top from the two path,
challenged for command turning into the stretch, proved no match for the winner while finishing well clear of the others for place honors. MICROSECOND
vied for the lead from along the inside route, lightly hand ridden, got turned loose for the drive home, got overhauled then tired in the final furlong.
MUNDACIOUS underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, fanned out into path four for entrance into the stretch, lacked the needed response. PACIFIC
JAZZ took up the chase from path three on the bend, was driven into the lane, made no headway. RIVER NILE a forward factor along the backstretch,
departed it from the three path, got sent out five wide entering the stretch, backed away. SENRIMA guided onto the inside route after the start, got shuffled
behind a tiring EMCEE PRIME beginning from the midway point on the turn, managed to escape that predicament by tipping to the outside late on the bend,
was moved out four to five wide spinning into the stretch, failed to make any impact. THEITALIANAMERICAN took up the chase from the two path on the
turn, swung into the lane and had no rally. Z'FINALE four wide stepping onto the turn, was never in it. EMCEE PRIME rushed up along the after tossing his
head at the start, appeared through by the three-eighths pole, was under a protective hold coming about three wide into the lane, then was allowed to fade
away.

JEN'S BATTLE got bumped at the start by LITTLE RED FROG who broke out a step, tracked the pace from just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final
furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. LITTLE RED FROG broke out a step at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe, settled just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tipped out four wide midway on the turn put to coaxing, angled seven wide into
upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors in the final jumps. BELLA ROSE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
wide into the turn advancing to be in range of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch taking command
straightened away, dug in under threat, got collared near the sixteenth pole, then got nailed on the wire for the place honors while clear for the show. DIXIE
MO chased three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung six wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild bid. CHAYSENBRYN settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. MOSIENKO three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. LAKE
CHICOT established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths out, swung three wide into upper stretch
under threat, yielded the front straightened away into the stretch and tired. LA NEGRITA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, got set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MISS LIANA showed brief speed four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, went four wide for home before faltering in the drive.

GRADED ON A CURVE took up position in midpack after an apparent clean getaway, managed to work his way onto the outside border of the inside route
by the conclusion of the clubhouse bend, continued to be patiently down the backstretch, slipped out towards path three as three-quarters was being
completed, glided four wide into the lane, was already in front travelling through the furlong grounds when given his cue, responded, kicking well clear of the
others, then maintained that healthy advantage kept to some urging to the wire. POINT HIM OUT strung out three wide on both turns, swung out into path
four heading onto the stretch, rallied for the place, although never posing a danger to the top one. JACK THE CAT quickly spotted along the inside,
remained along it, stepped into the stretch then finished well enough to be along for the show. DANTE'S FIRE mostly two wide in pursuit of the front runners
until the end of the bend, was worked into the five path from upper to midlane, mustered up a mild response to earn the last major check. IMPAZIBLE
ODDS retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition. was coaxed along showing the way on a loosely-contested lead, came under heavier
pressure as the third fraction was being finalized, got let soon afterwards, relinquished for good in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker and backed
away. GIANT SHOES raced within striking distance, kept watch from the two path on the second bend, came into the stretch and tired. JIMMY JAZZ chased
the pace from the two path, angled six wide into the lane, lacked the needed response. SOUTHERN BRIGADE three wide on the first turn, worked out a
tuck closer to the rail once the backstretch, stalked the leader while pulling on the right, gave way after going six furlongs. MONAGHAN loosely pocketed,
faltered. CURLIN'S LEGACY away last, made it onto the inside route at the top of the backstretch, chugged along at the back of the pack, got sent out
towards path seven from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, had no offering.

WON AND DONE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, spun just off the inside for home, edged clear under a
drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and just held on to prevail. AMERICAN POWER just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive tipping out a
furlong out, rallied to threaten late and just missed on the wire. ZOOMER got bumped between foes at the start by PREAMBLE due to pressure inside that
foe from SUMMER BOURBON and then pressure outside from THOUSAND PERCENT and MR. DOUGIE FRESH and conceded three to four lengths to
the front, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and closed well to
secure the show honors clear of the rest. MR. DOUGIE FRESH tucked in just after the start and brushed SUMMER BOURBON before forcing that rival to
steady off his heels, raced forwardly placed four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SUMMER BOURBON broke out at the start bumping PREAMBLE into ZOOMER and in turn into TORCH OF TRUTH, chased
three then two wide under a ride from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TORCH OF TRUTH got bumped
between foes from pressure on both sides and was taken in hand and pinched back at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three to
four wide, came under encouragement at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway. CALIFORNIA NIGHT broke a beat
slow without incident, chased five then four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went six wide for home and tired. THOUSAND PERCENT broke in at
the start bumping and pinching TORCH OF TRUTH against pressure inside from SUMMER BOURBON, then got crowded himself by MR. DOUGIE FRESH
to his outside and was forced to steady off that rival's heels after leaning on TORCH OF TRUTH briefly, conceded three lengths to the front, chased four to
five wide until tucked down along the rail with nine-sixteenths to go, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.
PREAMBLE got bumped at the start by SUMMER BOURBON and in turn bumped ZOOMER into TORCH OF TRUTH, raced three then two wide in closest
aim of the leader, got ridden along at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
THERAPIST away in good order, settled into midpack, sat reserved in path three during the run around the bend, angled out approximately six wide into the
stretch, chiseled away at the deficit, began to come in, leading the second place finisher to likewise shift closer to the rail from the sixteenth onward. at times
with the pilot applying right side stick work, went at it eye with the runner up late and gamely got the job done. MAJESTIC DUNHILL departed the
backstretch from path three, swung five wide into the lane, began to rally just to the inside of the eventual winner, maintained the momentum leaving the
eighth pole, was induced inward by the top one beginning from right around the sixteenth pole, kept onward with good energy and good courage, got
denied. FLAVIUS towards the inside during the initial stages, was spotted in path two by the top of the turn, came into the stretch and kicked into stride, split
rivals at the three-sixteenths pole while closing in, altered over to the rail in midstretch, was finishing willingly albeit with nothing better than the show slot as
the final reward when forced to check while in tight at the shadow of the finish line. SEISMIC WAVE loped along in the two path, went into the stretch,
fanned out seven wide, then rallied well to earn the final significant slice of the pot. HAWKISH spotted along the inside on the turn, closed in. VICI got
engaged twice for the command while mostly two wide, yielded past the eighth pole and weakened. SOMBEYAY lightly hand urged saving ground, had no
rally. DELAWARE (GB) sneaked its way over to the rail at the half mile pole, stayed put on the turn, tipped into the path three early during the stretch run,
came up empty. HONOR UP two wide onto the turn, was sent out six wide exiting it, tired. WIN WIN WIN quickly spotted along the rail, was never heard
from. LONHTWIST forwardly placed from off the inside, bid three wide as the half was being rattled off, kept it up for the next furlong, nearer path two for a
sixteenth, drifted four wide into the stretch and soon began to back away. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET within striking distance two to the end of the bend, gave
way. NICODEMUS pressed the pace from along the inside for a half and faltered. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on an incident in deep stretch, in
addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of MAJESTIC DUNHILL against the rider of THERAPIST alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand
and the race was declared official.

HENNI PENNY three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied with a
host of rivals in front, angled in to the two path slipping by the backing away NIC AND ZOE a furlong out to issue a challenge and take command near the
sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail. LIZA JAMBALAYA three then two wide in pursuit, got set down angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied drifting in slightly just outside the eighth pole putting AMAZING RIDE in tight between herself and COIN THE PHRASE before taking over
command and inching away at that station, dug in and was caught a sixteenth from home, ran on to just secure the place honors on the wire.
SEVNTEENEIGHTYSEVN chased along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, had to briefly pause in
behind AMAZING RIDE as that rival got squished between foes directly in front, tipped out a path and rallied tipping out once more slightly near the
sixteenth marker as LIZA JAMBALAYA drifted out slightly and offered up a mild kick to miss for the place honors. JASMINESQUE four then three wide in
pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. AMAZING RIDE chased
along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was forced to steady in tight
between foes as LIZA JAMBALAYA came in slightly and COIN THE PHRASE drifted out when weakening, lost momentum as a result of the pause and
weakened in the late stages unable to recover. RESTRAINT OF TRADE settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got let out angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. LEMON CRINKLE chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into
upper stretch and offered no rally. ZERENIA three to four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals in the drive. WISHES AND DREAMS broke in at the start and was corrected, saved ground in pursuit from near the rear, came under
a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and made no impact. OSAGE TREATY chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home,
got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. COIN THE PHRASE hustled from the gate, dueled
with NIC AND ZOE to her inside widening away from the rest of the field as a team down the backstretch and into the turn, had the field take closer order
nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch shaking off her main pace rival confronted by a host of challengers, drifted out slightly placing
AMAZING RIDE in tight between herself and LIZA JAMBALAYA who came inwards slightly forcing that rival to pause and steady between, yielded the front
at that juncture and weakened through to the finish. NIC AND ZOE shied slightly at the break from WISHES AND DREAMS breaking inwards and came
under hustling to knock heads with the aforementioned foe while along the inside, shook away in tandem from the rest of the field down the backstretch and
into the turn, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got shaken off straightened away and tired.
