INDIAN BELLA grabbed the early lead, edged clear leaving the far turn and held well in the stretch. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS stalked, was outpaced leaving
the far turn and stayed on. ICY DAWN off slowly, advanced on the far turn, moved four wide into the stretch and rallied. MOSTLY AWESOME reluctant to
load, raced forwardly while three wide and lacked a rally. MULBERRY came in at the start, saved ground, lacked room throughout and offered no response
when asked. SCHUYLER WARRIOR was always outrun.

Footnotes
MAGIC IN MOTION GP broke outwardly, gained the lead, edged clear on the turn and held sway thereafter. IRISH CONTESSA settled while three wide,
moved closer on the turn, went four wide into the stretch and rallied. LOUISE THE LASER chased along the inside and lacked a rally. ACEITUNA passed
tired ones. MISS PHOTO was forwardly placed and offered no response when urged. A J HART never menaced. RYRYSWEETIE was always outrun.
