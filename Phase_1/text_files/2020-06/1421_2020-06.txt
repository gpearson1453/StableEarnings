Footnotes
HARA broke to the lead, shook clear after three furlongs inside, and was driving to 70 yards out before being wrapped up. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI was
outsprinted three wide early, rallied outside and picked up the place late. FOUZIA got pushed in a bit at the start, rushed up on the rail and checked sharply
behind HARA outside the half-mile pole, moved to the two-path late on the turn, weakened late and surrendered second. WHOLEBODEMEISTER pressed
the early pace between horses, steadied while dropping back outside the three-eighths and again five-sixteenths out, moved out in the stretch and came
back on to snag a share. AUDREY shied out from DANNYHILL and was a step slow to begin, raced four wide and did not menace. ACTING LUCKY broke
in brushing WHOLEBODEMEISTER, swung four wide advancing mildly late on the turn, but could not sustain the bid. DANNYHILL broke out, chased three
wide into the turn, and tired after three furlongs. TANTALIZING GAL broke a step slow, raced four wide and faded near the stretch.

Footnotes
DARK AGES was unhurried early, raced four wide around the turn, responded when roused mildly through the furlong grounds, and swept past the leaders
outside under hand urging in deep stretch. CONGRATS THAT cleared to the lead in the two-path going to the turn, was no match for the winner 70 yards
out and held the place. SLICK STAR chased outside CONGRATS THAT to the stretch, and was outfinished. ENZOEXPRESS was forwardly placed after
the start, checked off stride along the rail past the half-mile pole, lacked room late on the turn, bid mildly on the rail in the stretch and flattened out. FREDDY
SOTO saved ground to no avail. R BOY EVENS stayed in range three then four wide to the top of the lane, and tired. LAWYER DRILL was four to five wide
and always outrun. AN OBJECTION AGAINST CONGRATS THAT BY THE RIDER OF ENZOEXPRESS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE
TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP was back to last a few strides after the start, moved inside beginning to find stride early on the turn, came off the rail past the eighth-pole
rallying between rivals, and bumped with FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL while getting past that one from outside in the final yards. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL was
briefly clear out of the gate before being joined from outside by MIDNIGHT TRAVELER and TURPIAL, gave those two the slip going comfortably turning for
home, was roused a furlong out still clear, then drifted out under left-hand pressure and bumped CARAMEL CHIP yielding late. MIDNIGHT TRAVELER
pressed the pace between horses into the turn, got shaken off to the stretch, and ran on well clear for the show. DREAMING THOUSAND raced four wide
around the turn, and faded in the stretch. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE angled widest trailing off the turn, and passed only tired horses. TURPIAL gave chase
three wide, and tired past the quarter-pole. BROTHER SKYE made no headway under urging two to three wide on the turn, and dropped far back eased up
in the lane.

U S S COLTON broke outward, sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along well in command and removed from the rail, and faced no dangers while kept
to a drive. R NINJA J K pursued outside the winner throughout, and remained clear of the rest. SULTANNES CROWN was outrun inside for a half-mile,
moved out in upper stretch and was along for the show. TRINNI ENERGY followed U S S COLTON out at the break, chased inside to the stretch, and
weakened on the wrong lead. MIGHTY FAST bobbled a stride from the gate, moved off the rail past the midway point of the turn, and never menaced. KING
ANDRES broke outward, and faded around the turn two then three wide.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked from close range three wide, ranged up outside INCONVEYANCE and STRONG ENDING late on the turn, gained control
outside the latter entering the final furlong and moved away under a light drive. STRONG ENDING tugged his way through along the rail to vie with
INCONVEYANCE midway up the backstretch, battled with a short lead turning for home, could not stave off the winner past the eighth-pole and held the
place. LUCKY MIKE advanced mildly two wide after six furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch, came off the rail with a furlong to run and finished evenly.
CITY PARK made up some ground on the turn four wide, but lacked the needed final bid outside. BURLY BOY lost ground to the leaders three wide as the
rider dropped the whip at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved in a bit to the lane and dropped farther back. INCONVEYANCE led early before being joined
from inside by STRONG ENDING, dueled with that one around the turn, and gave way between horses after six furlongs.

Footnotes
TIL THE END advanced four wide after six furlongs, overhauled the leaders and kicked clear through the furlong grounds, and held off
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL to the wire. The latter was slow into stride, swung out to the five-path at the top of the lane, and finished well. RHYTHMIA
bumped lightly with DIDNT DO IT at the start, settled in the middle of the field two wide early, stalled in traffic from just inside the quarter-pole through upper
stretch, moved out finding clearance into the last eighth of a mile, and finished with good energy for the show. AMBASSADOR JIM saved ground in the
second flight to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. MY POINT EXACTLY steadied along the rail behind the leaders entering the backstretch, stayed inside
awaiting room approaching the stretch, remained hopelessly stymied to late and could never be set down. SUBLIME APPEAL prompted the pace outside
DIDNT DO IT, challenged for command turning for home, and gave way through the closing stages. DIDNT DO IT bumped lightly with RHYTHMIA at the
start, set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way in upper stretch. VALIANT VIRTUE raced forwardly three wide to the stretch, and tired.

HARPER settled off the dueling leaders into the turn, bid three wide after a half-mile, collared GIROLAMO'S ATTACK from outside in mid stretch and drove
clear. LOUIS LE GRANDE took closer order around the turn four wide, rallied with good courage and was up for second between horses.
JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT broke a step slow and trailed early, moved up while saving ground on the turn, shifted out for the drive and finished evenly.
SANDYS BLAZE raced in the second flight two wide for a half, shifted to the four-path and gained mildly. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK vied for command inside R
UNCLE ERIC early, got the best of that dispute after a half, could not hold off the winner a furlong out, and gave way. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE broke slowly,
raced four wide around the turn, and failed to threaten on the far outside. VASZAR ACADEMY was finished early three wide. R UNCLE ERIC contested the
pace outside GIROLAMO'S ATTACK early, and was finished at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
FUJAIRAH bumped lightly with MRS. MAISEL at the start, raced between horses in the second wave heading to the turn, moved out rallying through mid
stretch, and wore down SWIRLING CANDY from outside. SWIRLING CANDY vied for command between SONG RIVER and FLY ON ANGEL early, won
that battle and moved clear through mid stretch, then drifted out under left-hand pressure and yielded late. CLASSY BEAST broke slowly, trailed three then
four wide to the end of the turn, and finished well on the far outside. MANE ATTRACTION saved ground improving a bit approaching the stretch, moved to
the two-path with a mild response, but was outkicked. SONG RIVER set a pressured pace inside, and gave way in upper stretch. MRS. MAISEL bumped
lightly with FUJAIRAH at the start, was outsprinted inside to the lane, and gained mildly without threatening. TONY'S ROSE was no factor four wide.
POSEIDON'S PASSION raced three wide to the stretch, and faded. FLY ON ANGEL contested the pace outside rivals for three furlongs, and faltered.

Footnotes
CRYOGENIC advanced to contention nearing the stretch three wide, rallied determinedly through the final furlong and was up outside KYLE in the last
strides. KYLE vied for command between horses early, shook off APACHE BRAVE getting clear on the rail turning for home, led to the final strides and was
nailed with the rider never brandishing the whip. GOOD BYE GREG pressed the early pace inside rivals, lost position around the turn, came four wide into
the lane and rallied mildly on his left lead. PEMAQUID PETE briefly vied between rivals before getting shuffled back near the turn, shifted out four wide past
the quarter-pole and could not gain. MR NAPPY was outrun early, and improved mildly on the rail without threatening. APACHE BRAVE vied outside
APACHE BRAVE for three furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. THE VIRGINIAN failed to become a factor four wide. SHINY COPPER PENNY lagged
well back to the stretch, and made no headway on the far outside. POOL BOY CHARLIE was outrun throughout.
