Footnotes
PRETTY GITA sprinted clear in hand before finishing the first furlong, was let out leaving the bend, under urging in the lane and prove much the best.
BARBIELLO took over second just off the inside on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and could only just hold her position late from between
rivals. MAJESTIC RAJ well back early, picked up her pace from outside on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the lane but steadily advanced to gain
third late. SOUTHERN ATTACK also without early speed, lodged her bid into the stretch and was closing in for second through the waning yards.
VERRAZANO WOMAN chased from outside, was four wide through the bend and lacked the needed late kick. RANGOON ATTACK advanced to contention
along the rail on the turn but flattened out the final eighth. GO PADDY JO faded three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
FORT RAMSEY rated early, advanced between rivals on the bend, moved clear upper stretch then continued to widen command under urging. MUSIAL
advanced between horses on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and gained second late. GREAT GRET vied for the early lead between horses,
moved ahead and took the rail on the bend then gradually wore down for the drive. UNCLE PAPPY prominent early, did not keep up from inside on the turn,
angled out midstretch and could only improve position without threatening. RED DIRT ROAD well placed on the backstretch, angled out three wide on the
turn then flattened out through the stretch. TOCCETIVE JAC passed inside tired ones from inside. RUDY'S BOY in contention early, faded three wide on the
bend. MIKAYLA ATTACK progressed four wide on the turn but gave way for the drive. PATCH'S LUGH was a factor on the backstretch while between rivals
but quickly faded through the bend. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE FINISH BEATEN LENGTHS WERE ESTIMATED BY THE
EQUIBASE CHARTCALLER.

Footnotes
W W CANDY rated off the early speed, went for the lead three wide on the turn, moved clear upper stretch then steadily opened up under urging. AGAVE
KID soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the bend, no match for W W CANDY but proved easily second best. FAST ONE in the second
flight early, did not keep up two wide on the turn but gained third inside the last eighth. THE DOGMEN passed outside tired ones the last furlong. BEE
HAPPY ATTACK was prominent just outside AGAVE KID, began to yield two wide before finishing four furlongs and was under a hand ride the final furlong.
DIRTY BAD BOY faded three wide on the bend. ERNIE SUM MONEY was an early factor but yielded from inside on the turn. YO HO HO chased from well
off the rail, angled in on the bend but came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
SHOWIT in midpack early toward the outside, came into contention three wide on the turn, fanned outside MY FOUROONE KPLAN for the stretch run,
engaged that one inside the last furlong and edged ahead late. MY FOUROONE KPLAN shared the lead from outside, moved clear three wide leaving the
turn, was challenged from outside inside the last eighth, slowly wore down but was easily second best. I'VE GOT ISSUES well back early, lost ground taking
the bend, rallied belatedly six wide in the lane and gained third late. REJOICE AN BE GLAD progressed inside on the turn, swung three wide for the stretch
run, advanced to midstretch then leveled off. LAST SURPRIZE without early speed, was just off the inside taking the turn, angled toward the outside upper
stretch and improved position between rivals without threatening. BELLAH DOWN well placed inside, came off the rail leaving the bend and flattened out
between rivals. WILDWOOD SCAT chased from just off the rail, swung out widest for the drive then failed to have a significant bid. ROCKET QUEEN
contested the pace inside from the beginning but tired for the drive. LADY WARRIOR was hustled along from outside on the backstretch then did not have a
stretch bid. MAY BE SUSPECT displayed early speed between foes but gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
KING OF THE SOUTH stalked the early speed from outside, was four wide taking the bend, engaged MARCO'S DREAM and DAEIGHTYFIVEBEARS from
outside inside the last furlong, battled to the wire and edged ahead in time. MARCO'S DREAM vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, moved
ahead two wide on the bend, was challenged again from outside in the lane, fought gamely but had to settle for second. DAEIGHTYFIVEBEARS bumped a
couple times after the break, advanced between horses, took over second three wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch, did not have enough left but
was easily best of the rest. MONFORD progressed just off the inside on the turn, took the rail into the stretch then raced evenly to the wire. EUGENE a step
slow at the break, advanced two wide through the bend and upper stretch then also leveled off. W W CRUSADER broke inward, bumped a couple times
with DAEIGHTYFIVEBEARS, settled to the outside, progressed five wide on the turn but could not sustain his bid through the lane. HARD WHISKEY
chased from between rivals and had no late bid. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD well placed from inside, faded from inside on the turn, angled out midstretch for a
clear path but had no rally. REAL TALK TY broke alertly, was soon challenged from outside and began to tire with three furlongs left. GEM CITY JEWEL
was a factor from outside on the backstretch but faded four wide on the b end.

Footnotes
COWGIRL KIMMIE rated from inside, angled out four wide to advance through the bend, engaged KIPPER DOODLE from outside in the lane and shook
free the final seventy yards. KIPPER DOODLE vied for the early lead between rivals, moved clear through the turn, was challenged from outside in the
stretch and wore down through the waning yards. CHROME ATTACK just off the rail on the bend, swung five wide for drive, lugged in under right-handed
pressure the last furlong but was clearly best of the others. GHAALEB'S MAGIC prominent from outside on the backstretch, was three then four wide taking
the turn, failed to have a significant stretch bid but improved her position late. GHOST TRAIN pressed from between horses, was two wide through the bend
then flattened out the last eighth. KALISPELL contested the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not stay with KIPPER DOODLE on the turn and also
flattened out deep stretch. MY WIFE IS BOSS was an early contender but began to wear down three wide leaving the turn. AIR ELLIE failed to menace
staying well off the inside throughout. SEATTLE TRAIN was never a factor.

Footnotes
SEA OF MAKEBELIEVE forced the pace outside ROSKI, went for the lead leaving the turn, moved clear two wide inside the last furlong, floated out some in
the late going but held sway. DR. LIECHTY forwardly placed just off or along the rail, was checked when his path was taken leaving the quarter pole, altered
out three wide upper stretch then altered inside with less than seventy yards left. JAGUAR RIDGE chased in midpack from outside, was four wide on the
bend and found best stride too late in the stretch. ROSKI set a pressured pace from paths two or three on the backstretch, was challenged from outside on
the turn, moved to the rail leaving the quarter pole, his rider lost his whip upper stretch, slowly yielded and was checked slightly in the waning yards when
his path was taken. CAST IRON prominent from outside, was four then five wide through the bend and weakened for the drive. SMART ALEX'S POSSE
progressed between rivals to gain a striking position three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning widest entering the lane and also lacked the needed late bid.
BAD MOON three to five wide throughout, failed to menace. NOTANINJA chased from just off the inside, fanned out some for the stretch run and had little
to offer. CLASS WON gradually retreated from outside, was five wide through the turn and also had no late bid. STUMP faded from along the rail, his rider
lost his whip with a furlong to go and STUMP continued to yield. There was a stewards' inquiry into ROSKI'S loss of action deep stretch and an objection
lodged by the rider of DR. LIECHTY alledging interference from ROSKI leaving the quarter pole. After their review of the race leaving the turn and deep
stretch, the stewards did not make any changes.
