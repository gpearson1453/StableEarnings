Footnotes
DEHYDRATION vied between horses early on, took back under restraint as his outer foe, SKYVALUE, shifted inward and put him into tight quarters,
proceeded to stalk in the three path outside of the dueling leaders, made a two wide bid outside of SKYVALUE into the turn, took over from that foe in upper
stretch, then held sway under driving pressure. HEART RIVER advanced from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, forged place from inner tiring
rivals in upper stretch, then kept on without making headway on the leader through the lane to prove second best. FRENCH ROSE was off a step slowly,
trailed the field around the turn while shifting to the five path, then stayed on mildly outside of weakening inner foes for a minor reward. FOREIGN
EXCHANGE saved ground while off of the pace into the turn, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole, failed to respond, then shifted to the four path
in upper stretch, and failed to produce a bid. TRAFFICISKILLINGME dueled inside of multiple foes early on, then only inside of SKYVALUE after a furlong,
but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, and subsequently stopped. SKYVALUE broke outwards, vied outside of a pair of foes early on, shifted down at
the five furlong pole and dueled two wide into the turn, but was rechallenged by DEHYDRATION to her outside at the three furlong pole, then was headed
by that foe turning for home and caved.

Footnotes
LORD DRAGON vied two wide between horses due to the lack of pace-setting interest from other rivals, vied outside of URBAN LIGHT (IRE) down the
backstretch, then took over from that rival in upper stretch, drew clear, and held sway under driving pressure. HOLY MUCHACHO made a rail advance
down the backstretch to striking position into the far turn, gradually shifted to the three path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual
winner in upper stretch, forged place inside the furlong pole, then just held that position from the late charging URBANITE at the wire. URBANITE shifted
from three three path to the five to six path turning for home, and produced a mild kick outside of rivals in deep stretch, but missed place at the wire. TIZ
MCNAMARA was ridden non-aggressively early on and got caught six wide into the first turn, took back off of the pace and shifted to the three path around
that bend, then angled to the inside and saved ground through the far turn, then gradually shifted to the four path through upper stretch to attempt to
produce a kick, but lacked on and finished evenly. URBAN LIGHT (IRE) set the pace inside multiple rivals into the first turn, then inside only of LORD
DRAGON into the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened at the three sixteenths pole. MAJORS VINDICATION
prompted the pace five wide into the first turn due to lack of aggression from other rivals, was outpaced to midpack into the backstretch, took the far turn in
the four path, and weakened. HEZA HANDFUL prompted the pace four wide between horses into the first turn due to the lack of early pace, stalked the
pace into the backstretch, but came under a drive at the half mile pole, failed to respond, and steadily faded thereafter. DELP vied three wide between
horses early on, but failed to keep pace with his inner foes at the five furlong pole, and steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
FLASHY BIZ was forwardly placed three wide, made a three wide bid for the lead into the turn, took over from inner rivals turning for home, drew off when
called upon, and was ridden out to the wire. FRESHMAN CLASS advanced through the turn in the four path, forged place approaching the furlong pole
while proving no match for the leader, and was second best. CANDY BIZZNESS trailed the field down the the backstretch, took the turn in the five path,
then passed tired rivals for a minor reward. SHESONSPEEDDIAL set the pace inside a duo of rivals into the turn, but failed to keep pace with them
approaching the five sixteenths pole, shied from either the railing or the shadow created by the railing passing the five sixteenths pole, which caused her to
concede multiple lengths to her outer counterparts turning for home, was blocked in upper stretch when EASY TIGER shifted inwards, then tipped out from
behind that rival late, and passed her for a minor reward. EASY TIGER vied two wide while a bit keen from restraint, but was headed by FLASHY BIZ
approaching the quarter pole, drifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. COUNTLESS FUN stalked two wide between horses
early on, but failed to keep pace at the half mile pole and subsequently faded. WICKED VALENTINE was forwardly placed along the inside, but came under
a drive to keep pace into the turn, failed to respond, and weakened. BIONIC ROSIE was a bit keen early on between horses, saved ground off of the pace,
but weakened into the turn, then galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
TOBYS HEART hesitated when the gates opened and spotted the leader a few lengths at the start, found stride and advanced into the turn, produced a
strong inside rally inside the five sixteenths pole to run up right behind the leaders, smoothly tipped out without losing momentum and split the leaders two
wide turning for home, drew off when called upon in upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire after flopping back to his left lead inside the furlong pole.
EVER CLEVER LADY broke outwards and was outsprinted early despite rider encouragement, advanced in the three to four path around the turn, then
produced a mild rally through the lane while hanging on her left lead to reach place in the final stages. LITTLE JEWEL was forwardly placed along the
inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the turn, shifted off of the rail to the three path in upper stretch, and passed tiring rivals with a mild kick
while hanging on her left lead, but was outfinished for place. ROAD TO ROMANCE dueled inside of ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) early on, held a lead turning for
home, but was no match for the eventual winner passing the quarter pole, held place to the furlong pole, but weakened inside of rivals at the sixteenth pole.
SCAT'S CHOICE trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted to the five path in midstretch, and passed tired rivals. COUGER rated along the inside while
far off of the pace, but was shuffled back in the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and failed to menace. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) dueled outside
of ROAD TO ROMANCE into the turn, but weakened between horses turning for home, and faded at the furlong pole. SOME NIGHTS shied out from a rival
at the start, chased three to four wide around the turn, but drifted to the five path approaching the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. MIDYEAR
was midpack along the inside early on, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, and was through after a quarter mile

the stretch run. SUNNY DALE set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. ABOUNDING JOY raced back early
on, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch. LADY SUEBEE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late
