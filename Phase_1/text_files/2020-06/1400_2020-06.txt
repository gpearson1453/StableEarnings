CHICORY BLUE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, angled off the rail at the
eighth pole and was along for the place. KISSTHATBABYGOODBY dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained in a forward position
for the drive and just lasted for the show. RUN ROCKET unhurried early from the inside, advanced through the second turn, responded when asked and
rallied late but just missed the show. VINYL pressed the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) could only improve
