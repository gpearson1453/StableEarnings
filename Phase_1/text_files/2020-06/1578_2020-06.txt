Footnotes
FRED'STWIRLINCANDY showed early speed, contested the pace while inside to the two path, was asked inside the quarter-pole then headed at the
three-sixteenths, fought gamely with the runner up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BRING ME A CHECK went around the first turn
in the four path, contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the far turn, poked a head in front at the three-sixteenths, battled
outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while well clear for the place. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the
front half of the field, was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved out more under strong
urging outside the furlong marker, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. ROBINSON went three wide on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.
CAIRO KING broke a step slow, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went two then
three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. EASILYUNBRIDLED broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a rival, went three then four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along while five then four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. COSMIC HALO saved ground on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn and also failed to respond. EXCALIBUR RIDGE broke a step slow, saved ground on the
first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then angled out significantly and failed to
threaten. LOOKIN GOOD bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on
the far turn, came three wide into the stretch then angled out significantly and was no factor. TWO TOO MANY brushed the outside of the gate at the start,
went three wide on both turns and showed little. WILD INDY was hustled from the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came up
empty while four wide on the far turn and faltered then was pulled up in the final furlong and vanned off.

Footnotes
MEME JO chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, shook
clear under a right-handed whip into the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. FROSTED BLING bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was
urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then quickly drifted out under a left-handed whip while still on her
inside, switched to the proper lead inside the furlong marker, gained on the winner into the final sixteenth and missed but narrowly earned the place.
GALACTICA was ridden along towards the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then moved further out, gained in
the final furlong and finished with good energy to just miss the place while well clear for the show. FEARLESS ALEX bumped with a rival at the start, was
ridden along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
EURODEVILWOMAN was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked under threat from the winner near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage
to that foe under a drive into upper stretch and gave way. CRAZY IVAN showed no speed while ridden along, saved ground on the turn, steadied off heels
at the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. GET THE BLING bumped lightly with foes on both sides at the start, was hard ridden with the whip early then
urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. P MILLERS CLOCK bumped lightly with foes at the start, chased the pace, dropped
back in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FULL TRIGGER bumped solidly with a rival at the start, was hustled to the lead then sped clear, dictated terms while inside to the two path on the turn,
widened into upper stretch, was given one crack of a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, drew off under a moderate hand ride into the final sixteenth
then was eased up while much the best. HOLD ME GABBY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, moved up under urging, went three to four wide on
the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and got up for the place late while no match for the winner. TEXAS CROSSBOW tracked the pace down the
backstretch, chased the winner in the two to three path on the turn, pursued that foe under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match then was caught
for the place while far clear for the show. THEORIST was well positioned just off the pace after being hustled from the gate, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. OPLIN broke in then was corrected with a tug of the right rein, was urged along off the pace,
bumped with a foe near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. CHODY N DANIEL broke out and bumped with a rival then
was taken up, raced well off the pace under urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor. TEXAS GOLD
RUSH brushed the outside of the gate at the start, was urged along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and
also failed to respond. GRASSBURR had his head turned as the gate opened and was unprepared, remained in the assistant starters hands after the start,
was taken up severely while off extremely slow, still had the lead shanked attached, raced near the back with the shank flapping to the side, went four then
three wide on the turn and was no factor while continuing with the shank flopping.

TIGERBEACH broke out while hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dueled gamely with
MISTER KELLY in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BOB'S BAD BOY showed speed between horses then dropped back outside the
three-eighths, chased two to three wide on the turn, moved out behind the leading duo into the final furlong, gained determinedly in the final sixteenth and
just missed while narrowly able to get the place. MISTER KELLY leaned out at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in
the two path while still inside that foe on the turn, dueled gamely in the stretch and just missed while clear for the show. PAPA RIZZO settled towards the
rear, dropped to the rail late on the backstretch, steadied into the turn then was roused, moved to the two path before the quarter-pole, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and finished with good energy to get the last spot in the superfecta. GOLD SPEED GO pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and was out-kicked. NOVEMBER MIKE showed speed then dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths,

Footnotes
FINAL FORM angled in while going to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, had the rider take a confident peak behind him at the quarter-pole,
responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed whip and proved best under steady urging. TRUE CASTLE was hustled
from the start, moved off the rail while chasing the winner, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip then was
switched to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. OKIE QUEEN settled on the outside, moved in leaving the
backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, came between horses inside the five-sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response while up for the show. TRIXIE RACER moved in while dropping back under urging, shifted out leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide
on the turn and failed to threaten. NOMIZAR settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch
under the whip and was no factor. ELUSIVE ROSE was urged along at the back on the outside, moved in near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn
and failed to respond. CEDAR HALL tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
capitulated.

QUICK QUICK QUICK chased the pace on the inside of a rival, went around the turn in the two path, was tipped out while set down just after turning into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. IMAGINARY MUSIC veered
out badly at the start, recovered to dispute the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dueled with ELLE'S TOWN under a drive into the final
sixteenth, got the best of that foe for the place but was overtaken by the winner. ELLE'S TOWN was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside
of the runner-up, dueled with that foe under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the place while able to get the show.
HOLIDAY TIME was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out nearing the furlong marker and finished
willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. BLACK AGNES veered out sharply at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn,
came out in upper stretch and weakened. STORMIEIS BLUE broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally.
