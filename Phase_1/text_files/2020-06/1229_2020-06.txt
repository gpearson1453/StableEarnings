Footnotes
TENCH broke readily to gain the advantage, dictated the pace in hand just off the inside opening a comfortable margin racing through the backstretch, was
roused right handed midway through the stretch and held sway on a clear advantage to the end. ELUSIVE EDGE, forwardly placed three deep in the
opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn while being prompted in a steady bid to close the gap on the winner but proved only second best.
ACCESSIBLE was settled outside foes in early stages, shifted to the inside entering the lane and continued with an even effort. O DANNY BOY tracked the
leaders inside foes in the opening quarter, shifted out racing into the lane but never gained striking distance. EXCELLENT MARK made brief pursuit of the
pacesetter between foes but soon faded nearing the turn.

Footnotes
ETELKA tracked off the second flight racing in the three path to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path on the far turn and produced a
solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm right handed encouragement. NOSTALGIA settled inside foes in the opening stages,
came around a tiring rivals to split foes just off the inside racing into the lane, came through tight quarters midstretch while shifting three deep but continued
with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. ELLA'S ISLAND stumbled at the start, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing, stalked the pacesetter
outside a rival under firm restraint while getting out momentarily on the first turn, moved to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, went clear entering
the lane but failed to sustain that momentum. MOMS LOVE tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four
wide racing into the far turn, then continued in that path through the stretch while making a mild gain. MILLIE settled last racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance while being fanned five wide entering the stretch and made some belated progress. DREAMINOFDASIES angled to track just off the
second flight racing to the first turn, was bumped by SHE'S A LADY GRIZ while being carried out slightly on the first bend, was prompted to gain position
between foes racing into the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ tracked just off the leaders racing into the first
turn, was steadied in tight quarters, then altered course bumping a rival racing through the first turn, continued a bit erratically between foes racing to the
backstretch and offered no rally. DREAMING OF PARIS stalked the pacesetter inside a rival in second flight to the backstretch but came up empty racing
into the far turn. RUNNING GIRL sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave way into the
lane. VOTING HIGH reserved between foes early, was held up avoiding close quarters inside foes on the first turn and soon dropped out.

ARCHIVERO broke readily, angled to the inside to gain a position stalking just off the leaders racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out three
wide entering upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage at the wire under firm encouragement. DREAM OF GOD forwardly
placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival, was prompted to terms with the leader racing into the turn, pressed the issue in a prolonged skirmish past
midstretch while striking the front between calls but just failed to contain the winner, then was vanned off the course following the race. ETERNAL CROSS
was urged to gain the lead from the outset while angling over, shifted to the rail disputing the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, continued in a
protracted skirmish to late stages but yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. CATCH YA LATER BRO, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the
turn, made a mild gain in late stages. LEBASI was settled outside foes racing to the turn and never gained contention. RED NATION, caught in close
quarters while altering course just after the start, made brief progress three wide to gain a position in second flight racing into the turn but came up empty
entering the lane. GOOD SOLUTION, held up between foes avoiding close quarters early, soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF
GOOD SOLUTION LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE START WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
COUNTESS JESSICA, held up avoiding close quarters leaving the chute, was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out
entering the far turn to advance on the leaders four, then five wide racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and kicked
clear under firm encouragement. WORLDS APART, reserved while angling to the inside early, shifted out to split foes three deep on the far turn, was caught
in close quarters nearing upper stretch, angled six wide entering the lane and produced a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. SWEEPENO
was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out entering the far turn to advance on the leaders four wide, moved to
gain a brief advantage in that path in upper stretch but failed to sustain her momentum. BRYCENS GOLD, forwardly placed between foes leaving the chute,
was eased off the pacesetter to track that rival between foes in second flight, shifted out while racing in close quarters entering upper stretch but continued
with an effort to improve position. REWROTE switched outside foes in early stages tracking just off the leaders, made an early move to wrest a brief
advantage three deep entering the far turn but came up empty entering the lane. PEACE TAKER, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn,
dueled for command inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way after six furlongs. ONE SLICK FACT, forwardly placed between foes racing to the
backstretch, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way. ROSALDA was rated just off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch and emptied out
entering the far turn. PURE MAGIC, caught four wide racing to the first turn racing just off the first flight, gave way after a half.

SPEAKERIT prompted to a position just off the leaders racing to the first turn, raced unhurried while angling inside nearing the backstretch, shifted out on
the far turn steadily gathering momentum, swung out to the four path entering upper stretch, was headed in late stages but produced a steady late response
to prevail under firm encouragement. STUNNING BABY, unhurried dropping off the second flight racing to the first turn, switched out on the backstretch,
steadily gained position three deep between foes advancing in tandem with several rivals racing into the far turn, angled five wide entering the lane and and
continued willingly while just failing to edge the winner. DOPO LAVORO was settled out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, angled inwards
nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, was held up momentarily when awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted course to bid three
deep between foes striking the front between calls late but just failed to sustain that momentum. OVERPRAISE settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch, conceded some position avoiding traffic racing into the far turn, switched out to split foes just off the inside in late stages but was outkicked for a
share. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention racing four, then five wide into upper stretch but
flattened out late. I AINT TELLIN broke slowly and never gained contention. BABY BROTHER urged to terms pressing a rival's pace, dueled for command
to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. SOUL KITTEN proved no factor. TEDDY'S HONOR tracked off the first flight while angling inside racing to
the backstretch but came up empty nearing the lane. AGRIPINO, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset racing to the far turn, gave way into
upper stretch.

Footnotes
ANDREA'S WORRY, prominent four deep between rivals in the opening stages, shifted inwards while being prompted to dictate the pace on a narrow
margin racing in the three path through the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path through the bend to upper stretch and widened the
advantage late under firm encouragement. TRUE ATKA tracked the leaders along the rail while dropping off the second flight after the opening furlong,
saved ground on the turn, shifted out racing through the stretch to split foes just off the inside and edged a rival for the place honors late. MY SISTER'S
KEEPER tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn to briefly gain striking
distance but weakened late. LA BELLE DE COURSE, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening sixteenth, was steadied in close quarters
nearing the five furlong marker, angled to the inside lodging a brief bid nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner and was gathered up in
late stages. FLAMING INDY tracked off the second flight three deep in early stages, angled in on the turn to make brief progress between foes but proved
empty in the drive. HIFALUTIN, in touch with the leaders five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pursuing the pacesetter three deep racing into the
turn and gave way after a half. PEMAQUID DOT was a brief factor between foes just off the second flight but faded early. FORGOTTEN PEACE proved no
factor.

Footnotes
STORMY D, reserved along the rail racing as part of the last flight in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn gradually drawing into contention,
tipped out leaving midstretch to challenge just outside the pacesetter and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. NATIVE LION sped to the lead
while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, was prompted to resist several challenges racing through the far turn past
midstretch and just failed to contain the winner. MARMALADE was rated between foes tracking off the first flight, angled in entering the far turn to split rivals
just off the inside nearing upper stretch lodging a brief bid but had no final kick. GLAM, caught three deep, then four wide racing into the first turn while
racing in touch with the first flight, was eased back to track off the first flight to the far turn and continued with an even effort to regain some position late.
MONKEY MIND, in touch with the pacesetter between rivals prompting the issue under light reserve racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far
turn and gave way in late stages. SUNDRENCHED, pulling between foes while moving to terms with the pacesetter three deep racing into the first turn, was
prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn and gave way while being floated wide racing into the lane. ASHLEY'S ROSE, reserved
outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned five wide nearing the lane but lacked a rally.
