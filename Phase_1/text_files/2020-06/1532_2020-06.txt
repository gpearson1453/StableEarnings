Footnotes
TEMPLE KNIGHTS had good speed and dueled inside of STORMY CHARMANT and PRINCE DE PRINCE, was three wide and edged away on the turn
then responded through the drive and held. PRINCE DE PRINCE pressed the winner early but was forced out to the five path to the stretch then finished
willingly for second. EMERALD MAGIC was chasing early, saved ground to mid turn, came two wide into the stretch and closed the gap without threatening.
SAYIN GRACE had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was also making up ground belatedly without menacing. STORMY CHARMANT attended
the winner's pace to the turn, was outkicked four wide to the stretch and tired in the final furlong. CAJUN BETTOR was outrun to the turn then circled six
wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. SUNNY RIDE chased the leaders to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but gave out through the
lane.
