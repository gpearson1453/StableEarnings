Footnotes
MISS RULES broke just a half-step slowly and settled into stride last but one racing just off the fence, edged closer in behind runners in the three path into
the far turn, moved out five deep leaving that bend while commencing a bid, struck the lead by the sixteenth pole while driving past. VERY CHERRY got
away alertly but was outsprinted soon after the break, raced two to three wide outside a rival on the first turn, moved up three deep heading into the far turn,
shifted in about midway on that bend to the rail, bid inside foes taking a clear lead by upper stretch but was outfinished while clearly second best. ARTISTIC
MINISTRY exchanged a bump at the break, was toward the back in the four path into the first turn, advanced rapidly midway up the backstretch from
between horses to prompt the issue, contended four then three wide on the far turn and flattened out in the lane. PREMED exchanged a bump at the start,
was caught outside foes seven then six wide on the first turn, applied minor pressure to the leaders early up the backstretch, dropped back in the five path
on the far turn and failed to rally. SPEED BUMP was lightly bumped at the break, chased early going five then four wide between runners on the first turn,
dropped back up the backstretch and while shifting in a bit into the far turn, faded. PRINCESS JADA caught six then five wide around the first turn, moved
up to contest the pace up the backstretch facing outside pressure heading to the far turn, went in the three path into that bend moving in to be two wide
midway, faltered in upper stretch and faded. ROWDY STORM stumbled at the start, trailed while off the inside in the three to four path, swung seven deep
into the stretch and failed to threaten. PERFECTUS broke awkwardly and bumped a rival, was thereupon rushed to the lead in the four then three path to
set the pace on the first turn, was quickly overtaken leaving that bend and steadily dropped back. SPECIALYKINDACRAZY broke outwardly then sharply
corrected inward, tracked inside, came up empty.

SURPRSINGLYPERFECT broke just a half step slowly, switched out and advanced outside foes five wide into the first turn, pressed from outside up the
backstretch, bid five wide taking the lead at the five-sixteenths and edging just clear, moved in a path on that bend, was re-engaged inside by HOWDY
turning into upper stretch, dueled the whole way and just held. HOWDY moved up outside LONS OXBOW to press the pace three wide and between
runners on the first turn and heading up the backstretch, was still between and in contention three then two wide on the far turn, lost a little ground on the
new leader on that bend but came back and dueled inside to narrowly miss. LONS OXBOW set the pace from the outset racing off the rail into the first turn,
thereupon faced outside pressure continuing well removed from the rail up the backstretch, moved in from the two path early on the far turn to the rail and
back out again having been overtaken and yielded in the stretch. CLASSIC GENT caught wide into the first turn then shifted in past the three-quarter to
save ground on the rail through the rest of that bend, was several lengths back off the leaders up the backstretch, continued to save ground on the far turn
moving out leaving that bend and coming into upper stretch four wide, ran on in the lane. BASHFUL BOB pressed the early pace four wide and between
rivals around the first turn and five wide between up the backstretch, entered the far turn still in contention four wide and between runners but dropped back
and switched out then continued to weaken in the stretch. BRICKHOUSE was unprepared and broke awkwardly, moved in from very wide to about the three
path early on the first turn, continued mostly three deep thereafter and was not a threat while not being persevered with in the lane. Following a stewards'
inquiry no action was taken.

MISTER KOWEN was outpaced early, began to advance outside rivals six wide on the turn, continued to grind away at the leader to get up late. QUIEN ES
was bumped just after clear the gap by and inside rival, vied inside foes but off the fence, took the lead on the turn going in the two to three path on that
bend, was clear into upper stretch but worn down late. AUSSIE YOU LATER pressed from between rivals early, continued the pursuit from outside QUIEN
ES going four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to be best of the rest. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT dropped back early despite breaking well, raced off the
inside toward the back going four to five wide on the turn, swung out entering the stretch still with much to do, was eventually nine deep by mid stretch and
gained some. GOLLY GEE was forced out and into a rival clearing the gap early, raced mid-pack in behind off the inside in about the three path through the
turn, came out five wide in upper stretch and ran on with some late interest. LEADING PROSPECT tucked in behind the early leaders but still four to five
deep leaving the backstretch while in close, lost ground on the turn, came out seven wide for the drive and ran on. WRAPPED was up close early racing two
deep, went two wide into the turn while dropping back and shifting out, emerged four deep coming out of that bend then shifted out six wide, was in tight
quarters late. CONFIDENTIALLY WHO saved ground mid-pack inside on the turn, came out in the stretch and had no rally. AMOR N PASION pressed the
pace from outside, went five wide on the turn starting to weaken, continued to weaken in the stretch and drifted a bit near the wire. CHACHAS SPECIAL
was well back early, went two to three wide on the turn and was never a threat. HUNTER ROCKS came in at the start then drifted out a bit at the gap, was
forwardly-positioned in the two path late up the backstretch moving nearer the rail into the turn and came up empty. FINAL THUNDER was in tight at the
start, far back running in the three path on the turn, swung out six wide into the stretch and made no bid.

Footnotes
CLAVICHORD broke out just a bit, settled in the three path off the leaders, switched out further heading up the backstretch, commenced a bid four then five
wide on the far turn, struck the lead past the furlong marker, was soon clear and held sway. M G MS VICTORY RUN raced last but one early going two to
three wide through the first turn, asked for run still well back at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide on the far turn, moved out turning into upper
stretch and was six deep at the furlong pole, gained steadily and slowly. HESA PROSPECTOR set the pace racing off the rail mostly in the two to three path
and in the clear, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened thereafter. OFFENSIVE raced on or just off the rail just off the leaders throughout but offered
no late bid. SEXY DEXY was caught four to five wide on the first turn, was well-placed just off the leaders up the backstretch and in the clear, continued four
deep on the far turn and weakened. INDIAN H WHO raced four to five wide throughout and failed to rally. SEA EMPEROR shadowed the pacesetter three
to four wide on the first turn, pressed the issue up the backstretch, dropped back three wide between foes leaving the far turn and faded. RATE THE GAIT
broke a bit awkwardly, raced on or just off the rail and was not a factor.

FILL THE BILL settled nicely tracking the pacesetter early before moving up inside that one to press from the two path into the turn, took a narrow lead in
upper stretch, lugged out a bit under the first use of a left-handed whip and brushed ONE MARK, switched to hand riding and right-handed stick and dug in
gamely to hold sway. MY STORM WARRIOR shifted in prior to the turn, saved ground off the leading trio along the rail through that bend, continued to gain
inside under stout urging through the lane but missed. ONE MARK stalked from outside, moved closer to challenge four wide on the turn, was brushed in
mid-stretch losing just a touch of momentum and rain on. AISLE RUNNER broke inwardly, trailed up the backstretch, switched off the inside entering the
turn going two then three then four wide on that bend, advanced outside rivals at the top of the stretch and continued to gain late. JORNALERO raced close
up early inside ONE MARK and just in behind the leaders, continued to chase from the three path through the turn while losing ground, shifted in having
reached upper stretch and gained mildly late. SEVENTH HENNESSY threw her head at the break, raced mid-pack outside going in the four to five path on
the turn and failed to rally in the stretch. BULLY BABY set the early tempo then was joined by inside and outside foes, vied between three wide from the
three-eighths to the three-sixteenths and came up empty thereafter. BENJAMIN WHO hopped outwardly at the break, settled toward the rear going two to
three wide on the turn and made no bids. ZESTY JAZZMAN saved ground while being ridden along at times but was not a threat. Following a stewards'
inquiry FILL THE BILL was disqualified and placed third behind ONE MARK for causing that rival interference in the stretch.
