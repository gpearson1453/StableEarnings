ORBITING THE SKY was hustled early, lacked room into the turn and with the lead in mid stretch was much the best. MISS TEA BLONDE was unhurried
early and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DIAMONDSINHEREYES showed speed from
the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. KINZUA was away alertly and hustled along on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. DIAMOND BREW was in touch early but trailed the field on the turn and had no impact.
TRIPLE SEVENS had no speed and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire.

turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MR CHANGUE stalked the early leader and was hustled along on the turn but from the four
path through the stretch was all out. STREET CAT SAM was off the pace and showed little while never in contention.

showed no speed, had a mild gain on the turn and was up for place. BE THE CHANGE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch was no real threat. NUPOGODI stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had
nothing left. OMAR tracked from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. OUR VICTOR broke
poorly and showed little while outrun. WATCH THIS was off the pace, chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
SEATTLE TREASURE was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up in time. BOLD ANIMAUX
was in touch, moved up on the far turn and had the lead in deep stretch but failed to hold. AUNTIE KATHERINE set the pace and had the lead on the far
turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. TINKER RING stalked the leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch needed more. DIVINE AMI was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. MILWAUKEE MAGIC was in mid pack and raced evenly on
the far turn but had no late kick. GOODOLDHOCKEYGAME tracked from the outside but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the
stretch had nothing left. THE OTHER BREEZE was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
