off in the late stages while safely preserving the place honors. O SHEA CAN U SEE two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under

Footnotes
BOURBON CURRENCY off the inside throughout, took up residence in midpack after the field had been sent on its way, kept watch on the pace
contestants a short distance up ahead from path two during the run around the bend, sprang to life tipping three wide into the stretch, responded well to
close the gap, sustained the momentum once beyond the eighth pole, got hooked in a duel with the runner up in the final sixteenth and gamely won the bob.
YES AND YES stayed forwardly place after an alert getaway, moved closer to the rail to eventually go at it with WILD WILLIAM, sparred with that opponent
for the opening half towards path three, got cued up issuing a challenge as they headed home, proved up to the task and soon claimed the top, began the
last eighth holding its largest advantage, saw the second place finisher chip away it it, vied with vigour during a stirring tissle with the winner from the
sixteenth onward and although determined to the end, wound up denied. STANDUP underwent a four wide pursuit on the bend, angled into path five for the
drive home, finished well enough to secure the show. CAUSE OF ACTION tracked the action from just off the inside route, was fanned out into the six path
from upper to midstretch, closed in. CHARGE AHEAD eyed the front runners while saving ground, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, went out
into path four during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. MENTAL MODEL made no impact off a ground-saving journey. MAGICAL
TALE pocketed within striking distance of the pair fighting for the top, came up empty after angling onto the two path at the top of the lane. JUST FOR ONE
DAY had the pilot take hold after lunging inward in an awkward manner at the start, departed the backstretch from the two path, was moved out four wide for
the drive home, never made its presence felt. WILD WILLIAM vied for control from along the inside until upper stretch before backing away. MINE THE
COIN spotted along the rail on the turn, got sent out six wide during the stretch run to no avail. KADENS COURAGE had a two wide trip and tired. MY
ECLAIR strung out three to four wide on the turn, folded.

Footnotes
LIFE CHANGER coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with PARDSY to his outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home, shook off his main pace rival confronted by the runner up, dug in gamely to repel that challenger to the finish kept to task. DREAMS OF
TOMORROW two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish while well clear of the rest to be along second best. FIRST LINE three to four wide in

Footnotes
SCOTTY BROWN established control shortly after the start, cut over to the inside, rated kindly showing the way, was approaching the three-sixteenths
marker when asked for more, dug in well in the final stages to stay in the clear. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY tracked the pacesetter from along the rail, came
under a drive cutting the corner into the lane, narrowed in, tipped out belatedly, fell short. HIGH TONE kept an eye on the winner from the pocket, slipped to
the outside and into the two path in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, was roused for the drive home, got outfinished. PETRUS took up the
chase primarily from the two path, finished off three-quarters, was worked into the four path from upper to midlane, rallied mildly. GOLDEN IDOL strung out
four wide on the bend, lacked a solid closing punch. DARING DISGUISE rode the rail for nearly six furlongs, angled five wide entering the stretch, made no
impact. BROADWAY JOE accompanied the winner from the two path until the five-sixteenths pole and folded. FIVESTAR BANDIT three wide on the chute,
was closer to it in pursuit of the front runners afterwards, gave way. POLITICAL saved ground to the end of the bend, went three wide into the stretch,
weakened. DROP OF BOURBON away slowly after stutter-stepping its way out of the starting gate, continued to toe the inside route, failed to contend.
LEGEND OF BAM taken hold after breaking slightly to the outside, raced as a forward factor from path three for six furlongs, stepped into the lane having
little left and retreated.

Footnotes
INSTILLED REGARD away without apparent mishap, took up position in the two path, picked up interest after departing the backstretch, shifted into the
three path during the early stages of the run around the second bend, chopped away at the deficit under confident handling while between rivals, was
poised to strike the front spinning into the lane on near even terms with the pacesetter, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and turned loose, went about
the lane in an erratic manner anywhere from path four to path two, reacting to whichever side stick work was being applied, yet made the front, felt the
presence of the runner up late but held sway. DEVAMANI (FR) darted over to the rail, stayed stationed along it until the conclusion of the backstretch, got
guided into the two path at the half mile pole, in time to elude a rival that was in the first stages of a steady retreat, angled four wide into the stretch, kicked
into her best and rallied for the place, coming up just short for the win slot. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN grabbed the top in short order, proved able to rate
showing the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the inside route, felt some pressure for the initial time after entering the second bend, came under a
drive in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole after the eventual winner drew directly abreast, stepped into the stretch, yielded reluctantly during the ensuing
furlong, stayed for the show. SYNCHRONY strung out three to four on each bend, gave way. FLOP SHOT (IRE) saved ground during the opening phases,
raced from two path on the far turn, briefly waited behind a wall of equines approaching the quarter pole, went into the stretch, failed to fire appreciably when
given his cue. SOCIAL PARANOIA underwent a two wide pursuit during the trip leading up to the head of the stretch then gave way. TEMPLE tracked the
pocket loosely pocketed during the initial stages, slipped into the two path after crossing the midway point of the second turn, chased the winner from
between rivals the rest of the way to the quarter pole with good energy while being vigorously ridden, checked when in tight coming up to the quarter pole,
had the rider try to get going again, failed to regain interest then was allowed to fade away with a protective hold being applied. TRIBHUVAN (FR) bobbled
with the rein snapping soon after the start, was steered extremely wide and out of harm's way to any of the others despite being basically rudderless,
remained so both on the backstretch and the far turn, got expertly guided over to the rail once in the stretch, was subsequently apprehended by an outrider
inside the sixteenth pole and walked off the course. GUCCI FACTOR took the inside route, was through after going three-quarters pole, wandered four wide
into the stretch on empty then was allowed to fade away protected, Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident in the homestretch, the result was
allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
During a sudden cloudburst, CODE OF HONOR got away well, settled seven paths off the inside down the backstretch in mid pack, tucked five wide
through the turn beginning to advance from the three-eighths given some rein to work with and circled rivals placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge to the leader through the final furlong, dug in knocking heads from the eighth pole to the sixteenth
marker taking command at that station, then inched away to the wire in game fashion to prevail. ENDORSED chased just off the inside down the
backstretch from mid pack in the early stages, got given some rein to work with and advanced strongly to the front taking command at the half mile pole,
began to shake away through the latter portion of the turn patiently handled, spun just off the inside for home, got roused nearing the eighth pole as the
aforementioned foe made his presence known, dug in under a drive head to head to the sixteenth marker when headed for the front, fought on to the finish
latched on to the wire well clear of the rest. FOREWARNED raced five to six wide in pursuit unhurried at the tail of the field until placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors isolated between the top
twosome and the rest of the field. JOEVIA broke in at the start bumping PRENDIMI, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the
leader, tucked three to four wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in response to the move by ENDORSED who slipped up
the inside, swung three wide into upper stretch now in closest pursuit of that leader, dug in under a drive and weakened in the final furlong. PAYNE four
wide just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nine-sixteenths from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and tired. MIHOS five wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
MONONGAHELA three wide at the tail of the field, tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and made no impact. SENIOR INVESTMENT bobbled at the break, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. PRENDIMI bumped at the break by JOEVIA,
who broke inwards, got hustled to the front and showed the way in hand three wide under some pressure from that same rival, tucked to the two path at the
nine-sixteenths and had ENDORSED range up inside quickly half a mile from home and seize command, now gave chase in concert with JOEVIA through
the turn under urging with three furlongs to run, swung three wide for home, folded in the stretch and was eased through to the finish.

NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE) involved early with JAKARTA during the initial stages, was soon on the front end all by herself after the aforementioned
rival took up a stalking role, showed the way from a slight distance off the inside, pulling on the left, lengthened away from the others during the run around
the bend, was towards path two when turned loose in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth but remained
comfortably in the clear. REGAL GLORY kept watch on the winner from near the inside route, was moved out three wide entering the stretch, failed to cut
into the deficit en route to place honors. SIGNIFICANT FORM settled into midpack after the start, chased the pace spotted on the outer edge of the inside
route, got cued up for the drive home, went three wide into the stretch, altered back towards the inside late, didn't make sufficient headway. VIADERA (GB)
off one length the tardiest after shying in at the start, saved ground, got maneuvered into the five path from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly. SARATOGA
TREASURE took up the chase from the two path on the turn, got sent out six wide into the lane, lacked the needed response. ROSE FLOWER (GER) went
over to the rail at the half mile pole, cut the corner into the stretch, had no rally. JAKARTA vied with the top one early, was allowed to drop back, stalked the
winner two to three wide thereafter until the quarter pole and gave way. EYEINTHESKY grabbed hold after coming in at the start, raced in the two path, was
set down at the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the stretch, had no offering and backed away. GETMOTHERAROSE travelled in the two path on
the turn, was moved out four wide during the initial portion of the stretch, failed to menace. JC'S SHOOTING STAR quickly sent over to the rail, was not
involved.

the gate, got coaxed along through the opening furlong three wide before taking over the front settling in hand, tucked to the two path through the turn, got
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths coming under challenge, faced pressure through the latter portion of the turn and relented spinning just off the inside
for home, dug in under a drive weakening in the final eighth while along clear for the show honors. FIRENZE FIRE broke out at the start under hustling and

Footnotes
THORNY TALE the widest of three contending for the top on the backstretch, found himself towards path two vying with MORGANTOWN on the turn,
assumed command as the half had been rattled off, got set down spinning into the stretch, drew off smartly. QUICKFLASH disputed the pace from between
rivals on the backstretch, went on to take up the chase from the two path once on the turn, proceeded to angle to the outside springing from the
five-sixteenths marker, wound up approximately five wide a furlong later, displayed willingness securing second, although no match for the top one today.
TALE OF THE UNION came away a length the tardiest after lunging at the start, was moved sharply over to the inside route, rushed up under its own power
into contention, changed course and was maneuvered to the outside entering the turn until three wide, kept pace with the front runners, swung into the
stretch, weakened in the last eighth. FINANCIALSTABILITY three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, got outfinished.
MICROSCOPE four wide midpoint on the turn, was five wide by midstretch, improved down the lane. MORGANTOWN remained along the rail after the
start, fended off a twosome during the opening phases, saw that tussle morph into a one on one contest with the winner by the half mile pole, relinquished
modway on the bend. stayed in contention for a while longer and faltered. MORE GRAYTFUL steadied early reacting to BULWARK having trouble handling
the footing, travelled three wide on the turn, went into the stretch and had no rally. QUINTARELLI three wide stepping onto the turn, made no bids. TRUE
GOLD strung out four wide on the turn, never made his presence felt. BULWARK appeared to lose his footing heading for the end of the backstretch,
stepped off it about two wide, gave way. CENTRIST two wide at the half mile pole, was never involved. THE LAST ACE worked out a tuck into the two path
coming up to the half mile pole, folded.

the five-sixteenths tipping out to swing six wide into upper stretch, rallied with a good kick to issue the lone challenge to the leader through the final furlong
and was up in the last strides to the finish. VOODOO ZIP broke in at the start bumping LONESOME FUGITIVE, established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside, began to slip away near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat near the
sixteenth marker and was caught in the last jumps to the wire. MR JAGGERS steadied at the start when TURN OF EVENTS veered directly in front, raced
inside down the backstretch before tipping out five wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced powerfully from near the rear
through the latter portion of the turn and continued five wide into upper stretch into prominence, offered up a mild kick through the stretch to secure the show
honors. RED STORM RISEN bumped at the start by MISCHIEF AFOOT, raced four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and kept on for the last major share. BAY STREET MONEY four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came
under a ride at the five-sixteenths and angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to improve position in the drive. MISCHIEF AFOOT
broke in at the start bumping RED STORM RISEN, chased five then four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid four wide into
contention in upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the stretch. RED FLAG ALERT forwardly placed three then two wide in aim of the
leader, came under a ride three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HEIGHT two to three wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, went six wide at the three-eighths put to coaxing, swung seven wide into upper stretch and tired. TURN OF EVENTS veered in at the start
forcing MR JAGGERS and ZUZUDINI to steady in behind and FIXATION to shy mildly, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BUBBA CHUCK three wide down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn ridden along from
midway, swung four wide for home and made no impact. FIXATION chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three wide for home
and faltered. ZUZUDINI steadied at the start as TURN OF EVENTS veered inwards in front, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out,
