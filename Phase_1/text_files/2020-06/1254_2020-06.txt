SMOKIN ENCOUNTER was in good striking position to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch but was all out to hold. MR.
DIPLOMAT had no speed, raced two wide into the turn, swung out four then five wide into the stretch and finished willingly but too late. POWER TIMES
TWO chased the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and was closing steadily. MR BINGLEY set the pace while two
wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch by the winner and did not rally. CASH MONEY was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was
closing the gap late. ROB'S GOT GAME stalked the pace inside, had room but was reluctant to advance inside nearing the half, got shuffled back then
again was shuffled back at the three eighths, saved ground to the turn, eased out in upper stretch and stayed close to the line. ROMAN ROCKET was
outsprinted early, came two wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.

FAIR CHALLENGE attended the pace early then pressed TRUE REGARDS two wide to the stretch, rallied to take the lead to mid stretch and held under
steady urging. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE chased the pace while racing off the rail to the stretch, could not impact the winner but finished steadily for second.
CARTERS BLUE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. NORTH CROSS also chased the pace
from the rail to the stretch then came up empty. TRUE REGARDS hustled along to set a pressure pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken and
weakened.

Footnotes
KING EDDIE attended the pace between to the backstretch, pushed up to get away from the middle, dueled from the rail to the stretch, responded when set
down and held stubbornly. TORO DE TORO was a pace factor inside to the backstretch, got outkicked leaving the half, was two wide to the stretch, shifted
inside the winner in upper stretch, rallied to loom boldly in deep stretch but was bested late. TASTE'S LEGEND was allowed to settle to the half, got pushed
out three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. RUSTIC CANYON attended the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the
stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. MO BOB (IRE) got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, shifted off the rail and
was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. JIMMY G had no speed, got fanned four wide when roused on the second turn but could not off
the needed rally. UPO also had no speed and settled to the half, circled five wide on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
KONA COAST was sent for speed and set the pace from the rail to the second turn, responded and edged clear to mid stretch then was tiring but had
enough left to hold. MAXINAMILLION was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then closed steadily but was
too late. KITTEN'S ROYAL was caught off heels into the first turn, steadied hard and bore out to the six path at the thirteen sixteenths, trailed to the second
turn, was four wide to the stretch and closed determinedly in a good effort. GIANT MARK pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs, got outkicked to mid
stretch by the winner then weakened. MERCY RULE chased the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch and was making up ground
belatedly. NATIVE CHIEFTAIN had no speed and settled to the half, bid three wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. AIGLE had no speed and
saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BREAKFAST BALL never far away to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out for room, rallied when set down and closed fast to
prevail. LA GATA ELEGANTE pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to engage for the lead to the stretch, lugged out badly in the final furlong
and could not hold. GOLDEN GODDESS tracked the pace to the half mile pole, slipped inside of ANGELS HOLIDAY on the second turn to also duel to the
stretch, responded to mid stretch but weakened late. MAGICAL PATH had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then was
closing the gap late. UNUSUAL SECRET broke out but was quickly corrected, had no speed, got fanned four wide on the second turn then picked off rivals
in the drive. CREER settled mid pack to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. EGYPTIAN
GODDESS also had no speed, had to circle four wide while gaining on the second turn then could not sustain the needed response. GO VAIDAGIRL settled
mid pack to the second turn, was asked for speed off the rail but did not respond. VICTORY COMMAND trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. ANGELS
HOLIDAY hustled to the lead, set the pace for a half mile then stopped on the second turn, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
SIX POINT RACK stalked the leaders to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch and held driving. SOUTHERN
THUNDER was settled for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then finished willingly inside. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT was also settled early, bid two
wide on the second turn and finished in a mild rally. RIDE INTO THE SKY set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was overtaken in mid stretch and
weakened. MAD AT MONEY broke in a tangle and was outrun to the backstretch, closed the gap to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch and made
up ground belatedly. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE had no speed, chased the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then came up empty
in the drive. CAROLINA ISLAND had no speed and was never a threat. SUNNY SPOT attended the pace outside of RIDE INTO THE SKY for six furlongs
then tired.

stretch then finished willingly for the place. ANYPORTINASTORM was used to prompt the pace, came two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch
and finished evenly. PASSIONATE REWARD got outsprinted early, saved ground to the stretch and was closing some ground late. BEAR CHUM (AUS)
had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and was making a belated bid. SPARTICLE lagged early, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed a
gap without threatening. WHAT'SONTHEAGENDA was under urging to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch then closed
the gap also without threatening. SUNSET DRAGUNN hustled early but was outsprinted then saved ground to no avail. DADDYSPRIZE had no speed,
stopped in upper stretch then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
WHEAL GRACE never far back to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then pushed to the front past the furlong marker and held. CAROLINA MIA
dueled from the rail to the stretch, resisted the winner to inside the furlong grounds then settled for second. REDUCTA (GB) chased the pace from the rail to
the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. HAPPY ROAD had no speed, saved ground to the stretch and came on late. GALILETA was outsprinted to
the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. PRUDENT lagged to the turn, was three wide to the stretch and did not
threaten. ZAKAR chased the pace to the turn but was forced out to the five path to the stretch and weakened in the drive. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT had no
speed and was not a factor. SWEET AND SOFTLY hustled to attend the pace to the turn, pressed two wide to the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
NARDINI was outsprinted and tracked the pace to the turn, bid three wide then swung out five wide into the stretch, responded when set down and closed
steadily to be along in time. MYANGELCINDY attended the pace from the rail, responded to edge away to mid stretch then could not stall the winner while
holding second. HABOBANERO stalked the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. MOMMY ROSE had no speed,
saved ground to the stretch and closed some ground late. RESPECT MY CANDOR lagged to the turn, came three wide to the stretch and was gaining late.
SQUARE PEGGY hustled to contest the pace, was off the rail to the stretch then was passed by MYANGELCINDY in upper stretch and weakened.
PROMOTE (IRE) was chasing the leaders, steadied off heels midway on the turn and did not recover. DEARBORN also chased the pace to the turn, got
fanned four wide to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then weakened.
