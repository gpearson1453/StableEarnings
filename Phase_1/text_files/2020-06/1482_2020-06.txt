Footnotes
SIR BRAHMS was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole and
edged up late. OLD TIMER'S DAY chased the pacesetter from the three path through the turn, moved to the leader straightening in the lane, inched in front
of that one just outside the eighth pole, still maintained a short lead inside the sixteenth pole and could not hold the winner safe. IMPROVISER set the pace
while near the rail into the lane, dueled with the runner-up to inside the eighth pole then yielded. DREAMMEISTER was never a threat while racing in the
two or three path through the turn. MONGOL BULL was along the inside turn, angled into the three path in upper stretch then was empty after being asked
after straightening. ON JOHN was along the inside through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
NUTCRACKER BALLET was unhurried into the turn, gained momentum through the latter part of the turn, continued with good energy moving into the lane
from the four path, swept past the leader just after straightening in the lane then drew off while under a strong hand ride through the final sixteenth.
PERFECT JUSTICE was away alertly to gain the lead at once, raced on a clear lead through the turn and into upper stretch, was no match for the winner
then kept on to be clear for the place spot. JUDY'S MARKET chased the pace while in the two path through the turn, weakened through the final eighth but
lasted for the minor share. JULIPS HOLD was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, continued near the inside through the lane and moved up
while not a threat. DEVILS DAUGHTER chased the pace from the three path through the turn then had little to offer after turning into the lane.
LUCYDOESTHEHULA was along the inside through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and tired. GLOWED was jostled soon after the start,
raced in the two path and was never a menace. MISS LEGS outrun while saving ground.

Footnotes
ODIE chased the two rival duel while racing in the three path, bid into the lane, quickly made the lead and drew away while under a left-handed drive.
VINEYARD vied for the lead along the inside, was better that dueling rival but was no match for the winner while staying on to be clear for the place spot.
GIANT'S FORREST was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and moved up while not a threat. TOOTHPIC vied
for the lead two wide through the turn, could not keep up with the top two then weakened further near the sixteenth pole and lost the show spot late.
PLEASANT SUNRISE was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. ROCKING CHIEFTAIN made little impact while in the four path through the
turn. SEYMOUR KID was never a factor while saving ground.

Footnotes
COPPER NICKEL set the pace while near the inside, came into the lane with a clear lead then drew off when asked. BRIBE was unhurried early while near
the inside, angled to the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the five to the four path with momentum but was never a threat to the top one and
throttled down a bit late when outcome was clear. TWO CARROT RANSOM was in the three path through the turn, continued in the four path into the lane
then regained the show spot while not a serious threat. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was never a serious threat while saving ground through the turn.
RUNNINAWAYWITHIT was never a factor while along the inside. SHACKLELACKALACKA pressed the winner from the two path into late turn then faded.
WANNA HAVE FUN was in the four to the three path through the turn and made no impact.

PREPARE FOR GLORY was unhurried while in the three path entering the lane, asked for more while straightening, continued with good momentum to
catch the leader late and edge up. CIELO AZUL vied for the lead two wide through the turn, edged clear outside the eighth pole while dropping closer to the
inside then could not hold the winner safe. FIVE STAR COLONEL vied for the lead along the inside, was steadied slightly when runner-up came in after
straightening in the lane, could not keep up and finished best of the rest. JINGLE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three
path and offered a belated rally. STORMY CACTUSA came over early and bothered a couple near the half-mile pole, raced in the two path through the turn
and weakened inside the eighth pole. DAAHER STREET was never a threat while racing near the inside through the turn. WARRIOR'S REMARK was never
a menace while along the inside. AKAMAI was taken up and checked hard nearing the half-mile pole when another put her in tight and was never was a
factor. GALILEO'S ROCK raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and tired. JACKSONS GOLD chased the pacesetters through the turn
and into the lane then was empty. BLIGHT was fractious in the post parade and at the gate, bothered early when bumped, raced in the three or four path
through the turn then bolted to the outside fence entering the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE FIRST PART OF THE RACE
DID NOT FIND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR DISQUALIFICATION, AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #4 FIVE STAR COLONEL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF #7 CIELO AZUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN WAS DISALLOWED. *THE FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A
MALFUNCTION WITH THE RACE TIMER. Race times added after video review

stalked in the three path before fading. NATIVE CHARM was brushed at the start, stalked to the stretch and gave way. TOURIST LIKE ME was through
