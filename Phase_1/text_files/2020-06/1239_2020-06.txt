Footnotes
KNIGHT'S CROSS dueled for the lead inside of ADHHAR early on, dug in turning for home as multiple rivals made bids, but repelled those foes in the late
stages and prevailed under driving presssure. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, rated under a tight hold right
behind the pace setter while in the pocket into the far turn, waited for racing room turning for home as outer rivals got first run to make bids, shifted off of the
rail at the quarter pole to make a two wide bid for the lead between horses, but did not have enough to catch the leader. VERVE'S HUMOR gained ground
outside of rivals in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane in the five path and made an outside bid for the lead approaching the furlong pole,
but did not have enough and was denied in the late stages. KATZARELLI trailed the field to the far turn, ran up behind rivals and waited for racing room
while under a hold and behind traffic from the five sixteenths to the three sixteenths, swung to the five path to be outside of rivals approaching the furlong
pole, then produced a mild rally for a minor reward. FRA MAURO was squeezed back between horses at the start, rated off of the pace in the two to three
path, shifted to the five path around the far turn, but leaned inwards in upper stretch, shifted inwards through the lane, and failed to make a bid before
getting outfinished for fourth. ADHHAR dueled two wide while staying in the three path around the first turn, shifted down to the two path into the far turn, but
weakened between horses turning for home. JOHNY'S BOBBY was forwardly placed in the three path, made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CAFE MISCHIEF dueled inside of WHISTARITA around the turn, shook loose from that for in upper stretch, built a clear lead, tired in the late stages, but
just held off STELLAR STILETTO at the wire. STELLAR STILETTO was off slowly, saved ground in midpack around the turn, shifted out and split foes three
wide in upper stretch, rallied late, but missed at the wire. LILLET raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then finished evenly to get up for
show. MI CHACHIS INTENTA took the turn in the three path while well off of the pace, angled inwards in upper stretch to attempt a rail bid, lacked a true
kick inside of rivals, and improved for a minor reward. LYONAISSE stalked the leading duelers from the three path, was roused into the far turn to make a
three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader in upper stretch, and flattened out. WHISKARITA dueled for the lead
outside of CAFE MISCHIEF into the the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. MAGNA G FORCE was a bit keen behind horses while well off
of the pace early on, and never got involved. RED JERSEY broke a bit slower than his surrounding rivals, took up slightly when a bit rank leaving the chute,
tracked from midpack two wide between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. PER RULING# 200046 FROM THE STATE OF KENTUCKY RACING

NOMO RON stalked two wide, bid for the lead two wide in the three path along with PARK RIDGE BENNY to his outside turning for home, forged a lead
between horses before being bumped by his inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, dueled gamely between horses through the lane while shifting outwards,
and held his narrow advantage to the wire. PARK RIDGE BENNY tracked from midpack three wide, made a three wide bid for the lead while in the four path
turning for home, dueled gamely outside a pair of rivals through the lane while being herded outwards by those foes, but was denied at the wire. SEVIER set
the pace while staying a bit off of the rail, came into the lane in the two path while meeting multiple challenges, drifted outwards when the rider used left
handed pressure at the three sixteenths pole, bumped NOMO RON while getting headed by that rival, dug in gamely through the lane, but failed to regain
even terms. REASON TO SOAR broke in, shifted from the inside to the five path around the turn to be outside of the leaders in upper stretch, but chased
those rivals home. CEE R BEE was forwardly placed along the inside, but came under a drive at the five sixteenths pole, failed to respond, and weakened
late. FASCILITATOR took the turn in the two path while far off of the pace and was no factor. GRAB THE MUNNY saved ground while far off of the pace,
but never got involved. TWINKLING KNIGHT trailed in the four path around the turn, and showed little.

COUNTY FINAL set the pace along the inside, shook loose from a chasing rival in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. BREAKTHROUGH
bumped with LUCKY AS A SEVEN at the start, was forwardly placed in the four path, then three path into the turn, inched forward turning for home to make
a bid at the three sixteenths pole, but was no match for the leader, and proved second best. RUSTLER saved ground from midpack into the turn, steadied
hard behind WORKIN IT when that rival weakened at shifted inwards at the five sixteenths pole, switched out and came into the lane in the five path, then
rallied mildly to split horses while drifting inwards for show in the late stages. LUCKY AS A SEVEN bumped with his stablemate at the start, rated off of the
pace, advanced slightly in the four path around the turn to make a show bid in upper stretch, but was outfinished in the late stages by RUSTLER for that
position. BREW PUB saved ground while far off of the pace, then improved through the lane with a mild rally, but failed to threaten. INDY TOURIST shook
his head when the gates opened, then came out many lengths behind the field, saved ground while trailing through the turn, and failed to factor. BAYTOWN
BEAR shifted outwards in the early stages and bumped with WORKIN IT multiple times at the nine sixteenths pole, chased the pace setter from the two path
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. FAST BOB took the turn in the three path and never got involved.
WORKIN IT was forwardly placed three wide, exchanged bumps with BAYTOWN BEAR at the nine sixteenths pole, weakened into the turn, shifted inwards
when surpassed at the five sixteenths pole, causing RUSTLER to steady, then continued to fade thereafter. NEW YORK ONE was forwardly placed along
the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the turn, and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
NEW EAGLE prompted the pace setter from the two path, inched forward to make a bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear from his inner game foe
approaching the furlong pole, and widened his margin under driving pressure. CARPE VICTORIAM set the pace along the inside, dug in in upper stretch
after being headed by NEW EAGLE, but gave way to that foe approaching the furlong pole, then held place through the late stages. GHOST GAME was
bumped early and raced off of the pace, was driven into the turn, shifted from the three path to the five path turning for home, and stayed on mildly, but ran
out of ground to gain place. SOMETHING NATURAL stalked three to two wide, forged show from outer rivals in upper stretch, but was outfinished for that
position in the late stages. PEPPER PIKE saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide to pass a tiring rival at the five sixteenths pole then failed to menace
thereafter. ARTEMUS EAGLE was slow into stride, advanced from far off of the [pace in the four path around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch.
GANGLY broke inwards and was rank between horses at the start, shifted four to three wide in midpack and between horses into the turn, but weakened
turning for home. OLYMPIC ROMP trailed in the two to three path around the turn, and failed to get involved. JIMMIE T was forwardly placed along the
inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently stopped.
