down the stretch and gained the place between runners in the closing moments. U. S. DANGER dueled from the outside, kicked clear mid-stretch but got
run down in the final yards. STAY LEGENDARY quickly jumped to the front while breaking inward, dueled from the inside around the turn, fought back in the
lane and weakened late. SMILING CREWE settled early, raced outside a rival, five wide leaving the bend and summoned a mild rally. DOHENY BEACH

Footnotes
AWESOME ALESSANDRA dueled with SCREAM AND SHOUT for the lead into and around the turn and three wide into the stretch, inched clear
approaching the eighth pole and stayed clear under urging. MAGNOLIA'S HOPE stalked off the inside, three wide then tipped out a path, chased the winner
willingly through the drive but lacked the needed late punch. SCREAM AND SHOUT dueled from the inside and was outfinished in the final furlong. BIG
PASSION raced outside a rival then three wide leaving the bend and finished evenly in the late stages. DADDYS REAL DIVA well placed behind the top
pair, stalked from the inside then angled out at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. THICK SMOKE unhurried from the outside, angled in approaching the
turn, left the turn two wide and failed to rally. FOG LIFTER tracked a bit off the rail, two wide into the lane and was eased late.

kept on for a minor award. TICK TOCK vied for command three deep then two wide through the turn, challenged to mid stretch and weakened. DON'T
STOP LOOKIN broke out and bumped rival, vied four deep then between foes around the turn, fought back to the three-sixteenths pole and also weekend.
GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) showed speed between runners, outpaced around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
SHORT OF EZ chased outside the leaded, moved up to press between briefly then along the leader, headed foe three wide into the stretch, drifted out near
the eighth pole and held under strong urging. RINSE AND REPEAT chased off the rail, spit foes on the turn, shifted inward at the top of the lane, summoned
a bid outside the leader but was floated out near the eighth pole and kept on for the place. TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked from the inside, bid in upper stretch but
got outkicked in the final furlong. LET'S REJOYCE stalked outside, went four wide then five wide leaving the turn, drifted inward in the final furlong and
summoned a late bid. GOLDIE'S HILLS traveled a bit off the rail then saved ground into the lane and finished well. WITHOUT MALICE set the pace under
pressure from the outside, led in the two path through the bend, resisted to the sixteenth pole then weakened late. READY FOR A FIGHT chased outside a
rival, steadied between at the three-eighths marker, came four wide into the lane and had little lefto for the drive. SQUARE DEAL off a bit slow to begin, five
wide into the stretch and made no impact. PROJECT LEADER showed early speed three deep, chased four wide to the lane, drifted in past the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. The Stewards conduced an inquiry involving the incident between SHORT OF EZ and RINSE AND REPEAT. After a
review, the Stewards ruled that although SHORT OF EZ drifted and floated RINSE AND REPEAT out near the eighth pole, it did not cost RINSE AND
REPEAT a placing and there would be no change.
