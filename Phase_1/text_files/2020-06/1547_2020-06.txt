a foe, settled off the pace, raced inside for the majority of the turn then shifted to the two path, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and failed

Footnotes
DIXIE CARROUSEL was hustled from the start, chased the pace from third, saved ground on the turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, turned
into the stretch in the two path, moved out behind the leading duo coming to the furlong marker then jostled with GRANNY JEWELL outside the
sixteenth-pole, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under a strong hand ride. IN DISGUISE bumped hard with a rival at the start, recovered to track the
pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, led under a left-handed whip into
the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip while still in front at the sixteenth-pole and was caught while clear for the place. RUN ON GIRL broke
alertly then was hustled clear, dropped to the inside into the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, dropped
back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. CASH ON FIRE broke a step slow then checked, raced at the back of the field, went
three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position. MAGICAL ICE broke out and bumped hard with an opponent, bumped
again with that foe shortly thereafter then checked, raced towards the rear, went five to six wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. GRANNY
JEWELL was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, jostled with the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole and tired. TEXAS MISSILE broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along in the three path on the turn and failed to respond.
WIMBLEDON'S GOLD bumped hard with foes on both sides at the start then bumped again with a rival shortly thereafter, raced on the outside under
urging, went five then four wide on the turn, dropped to three wide outside the three-sixteenths and came up empty.

Footnotes
FROZEN HANNAH raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, moved out behind
the leaders in upper stretch, made a bid between horses into the final furlong then brushed with a foe, battled with two rivals into the final sixteenth, fought
gamely with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BEE BIT broke out and bumped with a rival, went three wide on the first
turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside, came under urging on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final
furlong, moved out some at that point, battled gamely to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. DECORATED ACE went two to three wide on
the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the far turn, took a short lead at the three-sixteenths then came under a drive,
drifted out some into the final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. LOVE ON TIDES pulled under a
tight hold nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was reserved off the rail on the backstretch, went three then four wide while roused on the far
turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the show. QUINN MURPHY went around the
first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground while coming into the race on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out while
chasing in a good striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. POSTER GIRL (GB) set the pace on the inside with company to her
outside, was asked under heavy threat outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage near the three-sixteenths then dropped back in upper stretch and gave
way. CHEROKEE SUMMER bumped with foes at the start, saved ground on the first turn, lagged well behind, was urged along while inside on the far turn,
moved out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed whip in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and was no factor.
PERFORMANCE REVIEW bumped with a rival at the start, steadied between horses early, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged
along while five wide on the far turn, dropped to the three path into the stretch and failed to respond. DAUGHTEROFDEFENCE went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and came up empty. VIV went four wide on the first turn, settled towards
the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and also failed to respond.

LACEY BOSS broke in but was away fast, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two
path while moving clear around the quarter-pole, responded well when lightly shaken up into upper stretch and drew off under a mild hand ride to win ridden

Footnotes
DARPA broke out at the start, showed good speed and set the pace, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted down to the rail in the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging.
SKIRT WARNING bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in
the stretch and was second best. GOODNIGHTLOVING bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was taken back midway down the backstretch
then moved out, went four wide under urging on the turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DUSTWHIRL WONDER was urged along
off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. BADGERI CANDY was
hustled from the start then settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths and also lacked the needed
response. HI SKOOL SWEETHART had her head turned at the start, broke out then hit the gate and was off a bit slow, moved in while tossing her head
under vigorous restraint, continued under vigorous restraint past the five-eighths, finally leveled out midway down the backstretch, went three wide for nearly
the entire turn then shifted five wide while roused inside the quarter-pole and failed to rally. TRUE ALLEGIANCE was hustled from the start, chased the
pace, raced inside on the turn and tired. WENEEDTOTALK dropped back at the start then moved in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
PERFORMANCE WRITER settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
BROADWAY BURN bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, made a bid on the far turn, took the lead at the
three-sixteenths, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. SCATTERED MIST bumped with a rival at the start, angled in
while going to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner
at the three-sixteenths, battled with that foe under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. FARMAVET went five wide
on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while just up for the show. LINDA DIANE
darted in while breaking fast, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging with three furlongs to run, chased inside
on the far turn and also lacked the needed kick. GWINNETT'S MAP was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced in the two path on the first turn,
settled at the rear, started the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SUPER LEGS went
around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to rally.
TASMIN bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled well back on the outside, went four wide early on the far turn then was
carried five wide, dropped to the two path very late on that bend and was no factor. GRADED ATTITUDE bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the
inside, was urged along on the far turn, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. SKIPTEASE broke a bit slow then was forced
out, went four wide on the first turn, was vigorously held while extremely rank early on the backstretch then reserved towards the back, went five wide under
urging on the far turn and also failed to respond. JULIA'S TEMPLE was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went
three then four wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and never reached contention. LOUISIANA
SPECIAL went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and came up empty.
