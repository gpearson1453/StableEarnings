Footnotes
GOLDEN READY showed to the front off the rail and cleared away at the top of the stretch. BIG LEMON was squeezed just after the start, raced wide on
the backstretch, was hustled in the five path on the turn, and advanced steadily to move up to second in deep stretch. RUN THIS TOWN tracked the pace
from the outside and rallied in deep stretch to earn show. DR. BASKIN was off slow, chased the leaders from outside, was pushed along on the turn and
brushed a foe in the stretch, then lost position late. DANZO raced just behind the leader, was between horses down the stretch, brushed a foe and faltered.
DOCTOR VICTOR swerved in at the start and saved ground to no avail. EDZO was unhurried and no factor.

Footnotes
NEW HOPE ROAD went five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace while widest on the backstretch, was hustled to go after the leader at the top of the far
turn and took over at the eighth pole. BURSTING IN AIR layed off the pace, moved up in the five path on the far turn, continued a steady advance down the
stretch and gained place. MINE'S PERFECT was the speed to the stretch and leveled out at the eight pole. FIONA POWER saved ground and held position
late. WEST BURKE was in tight between foes at the start, raced off the rail just behind the leader, and faded in the stretch. BIRD KEY was no factor.
BIONIC ROSIE was in contention, asked on the turn, and had no response.
