Footnotes
MORE MO FOR ME, well placed inside, challenged outside stretch, dueled, drew out from the sixteenth pole. CROSS LAKE PROUD pressed outside early,
forced issue turn, opened up late turn, dueled stretch, gave way. PURRSISTENT broke a step slow, dropped back, was making a good advance inside
when he lost his path in late turn, steadied, moved off the rail, rallied for the show. SHADY BIZ saved ground, finished evenly. MI CHICA, well placed
outside, lacked rally. DESPOSITO raced evenly outside. ULTIMATELY opened up early, took the inside, pressured turn, gave way late turn. RUSTY SHOE
PENNY showed little.
