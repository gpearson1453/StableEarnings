HARD BEING ME stalked the pace two and three wide, bid under a drive nearing the lane, slowly gained through the stretch and was up in the final strides.
KITE SURFER set a pressured pace along the rail, dug in inside of multiple challengers, led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. SONDE ST BLUES
pressed the pace two wide, vied between rivals around the far turn and through the lane and was outfinished. CUBIC SOUND settled off the pace along the
inside, made progress at the rail through midstretch, lacked room inside, swung out leaving the sixteenth pole but could not seriously gain once clear late.
HENRY STANDINGBEAR chased the pace four wide and faded around the far turn. FEAR THE LATI failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SAGEBRUSH stalked the pace two wide, continued on his left lead in the lane, seized command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear.
SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA came in and bumped a foe at the start, quickly sped clear, set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, continued
on the left lead in the lane, led to midstretch, offered little resistance to the winner but held on for the place. EUTAW STREET settled off the pace while
saving ground, made good progress inside of foes around the turn but flattened out in the lane. SCYTHE chased the pace three wide between foes and
lacked the needed rally. WINDSOR LEGEND was bumped at the start, raced five wide and never threatened. ROCK ON had speed between rivals,
steadied nearing the quarter pole and faded. SAVAGERY was bumped hard at the start and had only brief speed four wide.

PORT MORE lacked early speed, advanced three wide around the turn, closed strongly and was up on the wire. GEORGE TOWN CAT set the pace along
the rail, drew off around the turn and led until the final stride. ON THIS DAY stalked the pace two wide, could not match strides between the top two in the
stretch but held well enough to stave off a threat for third. ICE KAUFY chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. MR SHEEN saved ground to no
avail. JEWEL HEIST was outrun while racing two wide. POPLAR AVENUE failed to menace while racing three wide. TOO MANY CORONAS was outrun
inside. NO MISTAKE N ME had early speed three wide, bore out around the turn, was eased and walked off.

LADY STORM set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and widened under a drive. BOUNDTOBEBAD prompted the winner two wide, was no
match for that foe but stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. MANAROLA tracked the pace from the inside, lacked a rally and held clear for the show.
AZZURRA raced three wide and never threatened. SHE GIVES ME FITS rated up close two and three wide and came up empty. MABEL was bumped at
the start and made little impact while racing two and three wide. DUDES PICK played no factor while racing two wide. NURSE TOMPKINS was outrun three
and four wide. TECHNIQUE ONLY bobbled and bumped a foe at the start, rushed up to show speed three wide but was through after a half. LIL WATTY
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
WALKNTHEPLANK settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress outside down the backstretch, bid two wide around the far turn, seized
command approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. STERLING FURIOSA broke out and slammed CHARITABLE MISS at the start, saved ground off
the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and gained a share of second. CHARITABLE MISS was bumped repeated and squeezed back at
the start, raced well back inside, made progress inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and closed strongly between foes to get up for a share
of second on the wire. THUNDEROUS saved ground in midpack, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished evenly. CITY PRINCESS vied two wide
around the first turn, cleared off early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail from there past the three-sixteenths pole then tired. MY HAT set the
early pace along the rail, angled out to chase two wide early on the backstretch then faded around the far turn. GLOBAL COFFEE played no factor while
racing three wide. WORKPANSOMETHINGS came in and bumped a foe at the start, steadied entering the first turn, raced three and four wide and made
little further impact. CORKY COWGIRL was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace three wide and retreated around the far turn. TWILIGHTATWINDSOR
raced four wide around the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn and retreated.
