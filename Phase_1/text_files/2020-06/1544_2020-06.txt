Footnotes
MARKISTAN advanced to contention four wide after a half-mile, took over outside MORE DIAMONDS approaching the eighth-pole and drove clear, and
was wrapped up 70 yards out. MORE DIAMONDS argued the pace in the two-path inside rivals, was no match for the winner through upper stretch, but ran
on clear of the rest. PLATINUMCENTS stayed close early inside, bid along the rail turning for home, but weakened past the furlong marker. CABRINA broke
slowly and was far back for a half, and improved past tired horses without threatening. SUPER HERO WANDA swung four wide late on the turn, and failed
to menace. FURY SONG veered out into WELL HELLO YOU and checked sharply at the break, and was never close. LUCY'S INTEREST pressed the pace
four wide, and faded steadily after a half. BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND was outrun throughout. MUCHA SUERTE was finished early two wide. WELL HELLO
YOU got bumped and pushed out by FURY SONG at the start, was outrun and dropped far back in the stretch. VALID EMPRESS vied between horses
three wide early, weakened on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
CASALSA dashed clear out of the gate, showed the way in the two-path, and was driving to stay in command. FULL SEND chased outside CASALSA every
step of the way, and was best of the others. FIRE'S FINALE raced four wide around the turn, lugged in through mid stretch, and was well clear for the show.
DANG IT was edgy in the gate prior to the start, chased inside and faded after three-eighths of a mile. PAPA HONOR hit the left side of the gate and was off
slowly, raced four wide and was never close. MISTER LEONARDO faded steadily in the three-path. ABUELO NUNO dropped far back early inside.

Footnotes
NORTHERN contested the early pace outside FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS, disposed of that one midway on the turn, faced challengers from both flanks
approaching the quarter-pole, dueled outside KALU through the lane and would not be denied. KALU settled just off the early leaders, moved inside after
getting past FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS leaving the three-eighths, loomed along the rail turning for home, battled inside NORTHERN through a long drive
and stayed on stubbornly. DR HARLAN raced four wide in striking range for a half-mile, had a clear shot outside the battling leaders through the lane, and
was inching closer through the final yards. STARSHIP APOLLO lodged a three-wide bid between horses coming to the quarter-pole, but flattened out into
the stretch. VENEZUELAN WARRIOR moved off the inside late on the turn, and could not make his presence felt. E J'S REVENGE was outrun in the
two-path. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS vied inside NORTHERN early, gave way midway on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMART SET broke to the lead, shook off RANK AND FILE around the turn, and drew off through the stretch mostly hand urged. RANK AND FILE was
widest among a foursome chasing SMART SET early, moved in to the two-path going clear of the others early on the turn, could not stay with the pacesetter
after three furlongs and ran on second best. CAMELLIA GAL chased three wide between horses early, could not keep pace with the leaders after three
furlongs, and stayed clear for the show. KAYLA'S TUNE chased innermost of four across the course heading to the turn, and faded steadily. BRONX LADY
broke slowly, and was never in the hunt. BETTER BOAT was sent from the gate and steadied slightly behind SMART SET early, then took up sharply in
tight between horses just past the three-eighths pole and could not recover.

Footnotes
BLACK JET sprinted to the front early outside STURGEON, moved in after clearing off from that one, fended off advances from BABY BROTHER and
SOVEREIGN IMPACT around the turn, edged clear in upper stretch, kept TENACITY ZIP at bay into the final furlong, and dug in to stave off THE QUEENS
JULES through the closing yards. THE QUEENS JULES was in the second flight to the stretch three wide, rallied with good courage and was gaining
outside the winner late. TENACITY ZIP moved up in the two-path approaching the stretch, had a clear shot outside BLACK JET turning for home, weakened
into the final furlong, brushed late with STURGEON and just saved the show with the rider looking over his right shoulder coming to the finish. GRAN
MALBEC was outrun in the two-path for three furlongs, moved out and finished well too late outside. STURGEON broke alertly but was outsprinted to the
top by BLACK JET, saved ground losing position through the turn, got going in upper stretch and came off the rail with a rebid, then brushed with
TENACITY ZIP and steadied between that one and THE QUEENS JULES late. GRAN SAMAN broke slowly and trailed inside, moved out four wide leaving
the turn, and made no impact. SOVEREIGN IMPACT pressed the pace three wide, and gave way into the stretch. BABY BROTHER pressed the pace
between horses, blew the turn drifting out at least 10 wide past the quarter-pole, and continued to drift out in the lane.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED RUBY stayed close early, was boxed in behind the leaders and steadied approaching the five-sixteenths, got out for clearance three wide
turning for home, collared GITANA from outside entering the final furlong and edged away. GITANA was hooked from outside by CHILLIN LADY after a
quarter-mile, gave that one the slip coming off the turn, got overhauled in deep stretch by UNCAPTURED RUBY and yielded while much best of the others.
CHILLIN LADY went up after GITANA from outside heading to the turn, got shaken off past the quarter-pole, and ran on to salvage the show. MATRACA
broke out, chased outside the leaders three then four wide, and faded after a half-mile. TRINNI SUNSHINE broke slowly, and was never a factor. GLITTER
GIRL lunged out and bumped hard with MARIES MELODY at the start, and tired after a half three wide. WICKET HOPE dropped far back on the turn.
MARIES MELODY bumped hard with GLITTER GIRL at the start, and was through early inside.

Footnotes
KATIELEIGH broke out, cleared to the lead and moved inside, rated along through an easy half-mile, picked up the pace to fend off a challenge from BIG
TINA on the far turn, and was driving to stay clear late. AUGUSTA MOON steadied inside first time under the wire, went along under a firm hold to the
backstretch, moved out three wide coming under a ride after six furlongs, kept on resolutely and was up outside BIG TINA to get second. BIG TINA
prompted the pace outside KATIELEIGH, challenged in earnest after six furlongs, was shaken off in upper stretch and yielded the place late. TEAM WIN
shied out from KATIELEIGH at the start, was mostly three wide on the turns, and could only gain mildly on the far outside. TOWA prompted the pace
outside for a half-mile, dropped back into the far turn, and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
R BOY BODE chased outside the dueling leaders, bid three wide into the lane, rallied steadily and forged past DIAMOND MINT to edge away late. PURE
LUCK was outsprinted early three wide, shifted out wider at the top of the stretch, and was just up outside for the place. DIAMOND MINT dueled for the lead
outside EARTH for three furlongs, gained the upper hand entering the stretch, battled inside R BOY BODE through the furlong grounds and yielded
grudgingly. THE ZIP ZIP MAN bumped with CHIEF WHITE SOX at the start, saved ground outrun early, moved out for the drive and finished willingly
between horses. CHIEF WHITE SOX bumped with THE ZIP ZIP MAN at the start, waited for room behind the leaders in the two-path on the turn, moved
inside DIAMOND MINT with a mild bid in mid stretch, and was outkicked. DARK AGES broke slowly and trailed for three furlongs, moved to the far outside
and gained belatedly. G Q COVERUP was no factor two wide. EARTH hustled up to duel inside DIAMOND MINT early, yielded coming off the turn, and
faded through the final furlong. WELOVECANDY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
COMBINATION prompted the early pace outside HE'S INCREDIBLE, challenged for command out in the four-path turning for home, reached the front near
the furlong marker and edged away under pressure. HE'S INCREDIBLE cleared to lead inside after the start, dug in when challenged by COMBINATION
while shifting off the rail, and battled on stubbornly. GUMP stayed close three then four wide for a half-mile, had aim outside the leaders through the stretch
but could not reach them. LIFE IN SHAMBLES raced three wide between horses advancing a bit on the turn, and lacked the needed late bid. MY FRIEND
FLAVIN was two wide on the turn, moved inside for the drive and had no rally. CAJUN FIRECRACKER was slow away from the gate, raced four wide
around the turn, and faded through the lane on his left lead. WHO'S OUT moved up inside up the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and continued to
fade away.

Footnotes
LILLIE'S HEAT sped to the front early, opened a lengthy lead through fast fractions, drifted well off the rail around the far turn with the lead diminishing
somewhat, stayed clear through the stretch while continuing to drift out under pressure, and wound up close to the outer rail. AFFICIONADO (FR) gave
distant chase in the two-path for six furlongs, moved inside for the drive and stayed on for second. RUN BLONDIE RUN was far back and three wide early,
moved inside still far back after six furlongs, came off the rail rallying past the eighth-pole and was up for the show. FANTASTIC KINGDOM broke slowly,
lagged far back to the stretch, moved outside and got going belatedly. CASSIDY'S SMILE was outrun early, advanced four wide through the furlong
grounds, then was overhauled late for the last major share. AGUAS COLORADAS was under a firm hold early behind horses, and never factored. BLAME
THE GODS was four wide around the first turn, and never reached contention. LET'S GO BABY tossed her head slightly at the break and was off behind the
field, trailed to the stretch and went by stragglers. STARSHIP GUSSIE chased the pacesetter from a distance for six furlongs, and tired. NOBLE
INTENTIONS raced three wide on the turns, and lacked a rally. PURO BLANCO faded inside after six furlongs. BREAKFAST POND was always far back.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA grabbed the early lead, rated along removed from the rail, widened the advantage after six furlongs and was driving to stay clear. NONNA
MADELINE moved off the inside chasing LETRUSKA in the three-path around the turn, could not mount a serious challenge and was much best of the
others. BELLA CIAO was outrun for six furlongs, came four wide into the stretch and was along for the show. HEIRESSALL raced in the two-path and posed
no threat. HELPING LISA D had her head turned at the start and was off slowly, saved ground into the stretch and did not factor. QUEEN NEKIA was
finished early inside. STARSHIP BONITA showed brief speed, and was finished after a half-mile. REMARKABLE SOUL chased three wide up the
backstretch, tired around the turn and dropped far back.

BUDGET BUSTER was allowed to settle inside for six furlongs, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch, took over from outside under a drive through
the furlong grounds, and coasted in the last sixteenth of a mile. PERFECT ENOUGH followed behind BUDGET BUSTER advancing on the far turn inside,
stayed on the rail rallying into the stretch, and went clear of the rest. ESTILO PELIGROSO raced three wide on the turns, and offered a mild response on his
left lead to get up for third outside rivals. BEE MAJOR set the pace inside, and weakened through the drive. SULTANNES CROWN prompted the early
pace, bid between horses around the far turn and into upper stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. GUN OF GLORY tracked three wide,
challenged outside the leaders three wide approaching the stretch, and weakened past the eighth-pole. I'M DOWN raced two to three wide on the turns, and
failed to menace. WATER WALL trailed early inside, was taken out four then five wide around the far turn, and could not gain. LOVEDISC stayed in range
four wide for six furlongs, and tired. LASTFORTINOFAMILY tired two wide after six furlongs.
