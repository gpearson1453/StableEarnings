SUPER TERRIFIC raced out of the gate to press the lead, drew away from a challenge into the turn and widened the margin down the stretch as much the
best. DARBY DART raced behind the leading pair, moved up in the two path on the turn, drifted out then angled in at the top of the stretch and evened out
late while just holding place. MR ZYDECO was off a bit slow,, raced inside behind the leaders, dropped back on the turn, shifted out in the stretch then
came agian late and finished well to just miss place. EDZO was hustled to the front till the turn and faltered in the stretch.

THIRSTY ACTOR was well placed on the inside tracking the leader, saved ground on the turn, dueled the leader down the stretch, lightly bumped with that
one and was clear late. MEETME AT D'STREET went to the front, dueled down the stretch, bumped a bit with the winner and gave way late. RICH E Z
dropped back after the start, drifted out in the stretch, and finished with good energy late. ELWOOD'S ADVICE tracked the pace, chased the leaders hard
on the turn and lacked the needed rally. TEE TEE contended early, dropped back after being in tight, and was floated out wide in the stretcch while lacking a
needed rally. WHOLE LOTTA RUN was closed off at the start, and saved ground to no avial.

the first turn, dueled outside the winner, lost the lead but gave a game chase of that foe down the stretch. JUNKET brushed a horse into the first turn,
tracked the leaders, was urged on the far turn, and finished well late. UNITED STAND was off last, raced in the four path on the first turn, and saved ground

EVALUVNMACHINE vied outside a foe on the backstretch, took the lead on the turn, drew clear, and had enough to hold off a late closer. NESSUM
DORMA was urged out of the gate, raced between horses on the backstretch, and finished fast to close a gap on the leader. CATCH MY KITTY tracked the
leaders while out wide on the backstretch, rallied in the three path on the far turn, reached second but lost the place position in the stretch. HIGH VISION
was the ealry speed through the first turn, got off the lead on the backstretch, was under urging on the far turn and lost ground in the stretch. FLORIDA
RUST chased not far off the lead in a compact field but lost ground in the stretch. STRONG WORK stalked at the rail early, was asked on the far turn but
could not keep pace.

OLA QUE TAL quicker start from gate today, led every call while well handled from the turn and stayed clear to the wire. FLUG slow into stride,rushed to the
turn with a steady run for the place spot. DIAMOND DREAMER sharp break, just off leaders to turn, lost position in the turn and re-rallied in the stretch for
show. RAISING DREAMS no speed to the turn, improved position only in the stretch. MODERN DAY DRIFTER inside trip to turn, no real threat.
STONETOWN BOY no speed to the turn, came widest to improved late. IRON AGE chased while saving ground to no avail. MAGNITSKY never a factor.
HANNAH'S BOISTER mild impact to the turn but gave way readily. QUIET TURN never menaced. SAVO never a contender. JR'S DAY never close.
