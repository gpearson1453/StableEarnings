Footnotes
TEMPLEMENT rated just off leaders to turn four wide.took over and ran clear in the final sixteenth under good handling. COMPETITIVE QUEEN rushed
inside, dueled briefly, lost position in the turn near the quarter pole and re-rallied in the stretch to secure the place spot. LA COYOTA dueled three wide to
the quarter pole, between horses in the stretch run and proved best of the rest with a good effort. ON THE COME tracked leaders to the turn, moved up
slightly late. LARRY'S BABY off a bit slow, hard used to turn, nothing left for the drive. THREE BIRDS broke slow and only improved position in the stretch.
TEMPERANCE ROAD never a real factor. RUN LIKE REV raced back with no response when called upon. ELLIE'S STROLL broke well , shuffled back and
never theatened thereafter. GLISTENING STAR dueled between horses to quarter pole, stopped t to a walk late.

stride late and was flying at the wire while probably best today ED'S ROCKET pressed the pace to quarter pole, stayed well, settled for show. CEE R BEE
no speed outside to the stretch, rallied in the lane mildly. CHAMPSACHAMP raced back to the turn, went inside to finish up well inside. TOMMYTOM up
close three wide to the turn, faltered in the stretch run. MR OPPORTUNITY raced a wide trip throughout lost ground and faded. DRAGON DREW well
placed early dropped back quickly.

SMOLTZ set all pace with good handling, stayed well clear of the field. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO far back to quarter, launched a wide run for place good effort.
KEIGHTLEY tried to keep up to the turn, lost position outside, re-rallied. TIME IS MONEY inside run throughout, with no late kick in the stretch run. OUR
THOMAS never a factor. GET TOUGH failed to menace. FISH TRAPPE ROAD good position early on, faded the stretch run. JROCK good position
throughout, faltered in the drive. DRAMA STAR through early, dropped far back. KITTEN FOR GRANNY far back from the start, pulled up in the stretch did
not finish.

bid in the labe for the place spot while no match for winner. ALLEN no speed to turn, rallied outside for show spot to finish well. MEGLEAH steady advance
to improve position for the super spot. MAKBULE raced along inside with no late kick when needed. TAKECHARGECOMANCHE speed outside to the turn
wile dueling but gave way in the stretch. HESITATION BLUES steadied sfter the start when in tight, never menaced. SNAPY TWELVES never a factor.
SEVEN SEVENTEEN close up to the turn, gave way readily thereafter.

LOUIE'S KINGDOM was hustled out of the gate to take the front, raced clear before the turn, was briefly engaged by a challenger at the top of the stretch
and drew off under a hand ride as much the best. QUEST FOR FIRE was off slow, raced unhurried, came four to five wide in the stretch and closed well to
pass foes for place. VANDROSS raced last and passed a tight group of tired foes in the sttretch to gain show. HIGH ESTEEM stayed off the pace, was
asked on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, split foes at the top of the lane and faltered. CHUCKLES CANDY chased the leader from inside to the
stretch and lacked a needed finishing kick. TIO MOSCO chased the leader, drew closer on the turn, challenged that foe at the top of the stretch but could
not keep pace.

MOON LAUNCH pressed the leader through the first turn to the far turn, passed that foe while in tandem with another runner, briefly dueled for the lead and
drew off at the top of the stretch to win clear. RIONERO was unhurried inside, angled out to pass a fading foe heading into the far turn, stayed on the rail in
the stretch and closed well. FALLS ROAD raced three wide on the first turn, dueled the winner on the far turn and lost position in the stretch to settle for
third. KALYDAR was bothered at the start, raced well gapped off the field, then passed a galloping foe in the stretch. MUSICAL INTEREST raced in front
while inside to the turn, dropped back and galloped past the wire.
