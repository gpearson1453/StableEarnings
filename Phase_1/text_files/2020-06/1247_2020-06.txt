Footnotes
SHIO stalked from outside off the early leaders, forced six wide on the turn, hit his best stride in the lane to edge past late under urging. DE BILLY'S BOY,
just off the leaders early racing between rivals into the turn, bid four wide on that bend, drifted about a bit in upper stretch, fought on to get up for place over
CAUSING CHAOS, who pressed the early pace three deep, took a narrow lead leaving the backstretch then faced an outside foe, edged just clear into
upper stretch while drifting just a touch, could not kick on with the winner and lost the nod for place late. THIRSTY MONKEY was forwardly-positioned early
between rivals, dropped back up the backstretch, chased two wide through the turn and asked for more past the quarter pole, kicked on mildly. LIL LATIGO
was within range off the early pace, went five wide on the turn, faced moderate traffic in upper stretch while weakening and was not persevered with late.
ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING lacked early speed after starting just a half-step slowly, trailed early, went in the three path on the turn and improved position in
the stretch. BENITO CHICO was coaxed forward inside to press the pace, dropped back and faded. CROWN N BULL chased in behind the leaders in the
three to four path and came up empty.

Footnotes
SOMBRA NEGRA set a pressured pace racing well off the inside up the backstretch, edged away while in the three path through the turn, was clear turning
for home and under steady handling held from ZIPTIME, who broke a half-step slowly and lost his path at the start, was thereupon allowed to settle,
advanced outside foes four then five wide on the turn, gained steadily in the stretch but was too late. E BAR GOLD steadied when in tight at the start,
moved up inside heading into the turn racing on then just off the rail through that bend, was within striking distance a furlong out but lacked the needed late
kick. REINING PESOS broke inwardly several paths bumping a rival, was outpaced early, went in the two to three path through the turn and failed to rally
while improving position. LORD CHARLES was in just a bit tight after breaking a half-step slowly, asked for run but devoid of early speed, raced on or just
off the rail through the turn and failed to make a bid. S. O. S. SCHILLER pressed outside the winner going four wide on the turn and came up empty.
WESTLEY was bumped at the break, chased two wide heading to the turn moving out a bit and going between two and four wide while dropping back on
that bend and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLACKBERRY LISA broke inwardly, vied between runners, took command by upper stretch and moved clear under steady handling. INDIA WILKES was
outside mid-pack, went five wide on the turn, was a little closer turning for home but proved no match while clearly second best. SELFISH WOMAN raced
mid-pack in behind the leading trio, went in the two to three path through the turn and improved position in the stretch. ACCLIMATED SONG vied inside
rivals but off the fence up the backstretch, began to lose ground slowly on the turn and continued to weaken in the lane. IRON TUFF vied outside for the
early lead, went five then four wide on the turn and was empty in the stretch. MY GOLDEN SCARLETT broke a half-step slowly and lost her path, raced off
the leaders going in the three to four path through the turn, had a rival clip her heels in behind and failed to rally. VIVIR MI VIDA chased from inside and was
not a threat. BELLADONTE was kept wide up the backstretch, raced mostly in the four to five path on the turn moving in late on that bend, steadied slightly
at the head of the stretch as an outside rival lost the rider and then kept on. RED RHUMBA raced greenly early, moved out leaving the turn after having
been on or just off the rail, clipped the heels of a rival and lost the rider, was caught past the wire and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action
was taken.

Footnotes
THE GREAT DOME moved out soon after the break and hooked up inside VIDAKS BACK, dueled inside that one but off the fence up the backstretch,
moved nearer the rail early on the turn, edged clear turning for home while drifting out then drifted back to the rail in upper stretch and drew off under urging.
DAPIRATE was coaxed along early racing outside a rival, went two to three wide on the turn swinging out four deep into upper stretch, ran on to gain the
place. CONFIDENTIALLY WHO settled in the back half racing off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn, moved out five wide turning for home
and gained mildly. VIDAKS BACK dueled outside the winner early going two to three wide through the turn then weakened in the stretch. MEGA SOURCE
tracked several lengths back off the leading pair racing well off the inside, moved in heading to the turn going in the three then two path on that bend, failed
to rally. GET A NOTION was bumped at the break, trailed early, went in the two to three path on the turn and asked for more past the three-eighths but was
never near enough to threaten. CIRCUSTOWN FLYER bumped the inside rival at the start, chased inside off the leaders racing on or just off the rail through
the turn then dropped back and faded. BILLY JOE WHO stumbled at the start, raced off the inside in the three to four path on the turn and was never a
threat.

Footnotes
WAGES tracked the leaders from inside, saved ground into the turn before advancing while coming off the fence a bit on that bend, came out further still
turning for home and engaged inside HEAD FAKE, dueled with that one before edging away late. HEAD FAKE vied three deep into the turn, edged to the
lead by the quarter pole, was challenged in upper stretch and proved second best. GROUND HOG COUNTY pressed from outside early, went five wide on
the turn, was no match for the top pair. DIAMANTE APPEAL raced mid-pack behind the leaders and off the fence into the turn going in the four to five path
on that bend, ran on to gain a position. ROWDY STORM trailed unhurriedly early, raced well off the fence in the four path through the turn before angling
seven wide turning into upper stretch, continued with mild late interest. SPEED BUMP broke a step slowly, shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn but made no bids. CRITICAL DECISION was forwardly-positioned four wide and between runners to the turn then dropped back and
faded. SHAKURA raced toward the rear along the inside, moved out to the three path past the quarter pole and made no bid. TWENTYFOUR K CAT
showed brief speed from between runners, shifted in two wide while dropping back leaving the backstretch and faded thereafter.
