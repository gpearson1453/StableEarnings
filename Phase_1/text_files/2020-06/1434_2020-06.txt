Footnotes
BUMPERDOO was allowed to settle early, moved up on the far turn while four wide, came six wide into the stretch while advancing, continued to close well
to get up in time, driving. SKYSCANNER was four wide into the first turn, then was rated and made a four wide move on the far turn to shake clear entering
the stretch, but was nailed on the wire, good effort. MUCHACHO was rated early from between horses, advanced on the turn three wide while making a bid,
finished well but needed more. ROYAL CRUSADER chased the early pace, was between horses on the backstretch, got shuffled back on the turn, swung
out stretch for racing room to have a belated rally. SENSE OF JUSTICE was well placed early and made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for the lead,
but was empty in the lane. FLIGHT RISK was allowed to settle early, raced on the inside down the backstretch, but offered no rally. SEA GHOST failed to
menace. SAINT ALFRED was not a threat. RISQUE REBEL set the pace then gave way on the turn. KAMEHAMEHA stumbled at the start, raced five wide
into the first turn, then proved to be no factor.

OUR HOISTED MAST pressed the early pace, moved up around the far turn to take command, raced in the three path through the stretch and drove clear
in the final stages. JAQUAVIOUS was off a step slow, raced towards the inside through the lane and finished well to get up to be second best. MUCHACHO
MACHO stalked the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. SINGLINO stalked the pace, moved up along the rail
through the stretch and flattened out in the latter stages. YOU ARE AWESOME was allowed to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no
rally. LION'S COURT was off slowly, raced four deep at the eighth pole and never was a factor. HAZELS LITTLE MAN was quick to begin and tired through
the drive. GONNA WIN IT dropped back early and failed to have a response.

TRAFFIC TROUBLE was well rated early towards the inside, made a four wide move on the far turn, then prevailed late after a long drive. EMBRACE THE
GRIND was well placed early, made a three wide bid on the turn to assume command leaving the eighth pole, then just missed after a long drive, game
effort. STRIKING IT LUCKY was allowed to settle early, came wide into the stretch, closed fast. OPTICAL ILLUSION was allowed to settle early, made a
four wide bid entering the stretch, stayed on but needed more. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT was reserved early while three wide, moved over to the inside on
the second turn, then had a belted rally on the inside. BOURBON AGOGO passed the tiring rivals. APPRAISED raced four wide early then weakened on the
turn. TOPHAT N WHITETIE set the pace before giving way. STYLEMEISTER failed to menace. PURRS AGAIN pressed the pace three wide before
weakening. LAKOTA SONG was not a threat. ORBIDORE was not a factor.

SHEMAKESMEHAPPY showed good early speed while saving ground, continued to save ground through the far turn into the stretch, dug in at the eighth
pole and just missed in a game effort. ARTFUL SPLATTER was forced six wide around the first turn, stalked the early pace, raced three wide at the eighth
pole and finished gamely to the wire. SWEET SAMI D raced five wide around the first turn, moved up three wide deep stretch splitting rivals and finished
willingly late. TRACE OF GRACE settled off the early pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late. UJJAYI was allowed to settle in the
early stages, raced in the three path in the drive and had no rally. MONEY FROMHEAVEN was forced six wide and checked around the first turn, settled
towards the back of the pack and failed to threaten. HELL OF AFIRE raced up close early and tired readily.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC AVENUE was well rated early, made a four wide bid entering the stretch to have dead aim on the top two, then lugged in badly inside the furlong
grounds, then jockey angled out for room, drew clear late, driving. THIRD CARD DOWN stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn,
gained a short advantage leaving the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner while being clearly second best. THE BAY EXPRESS set the early
pace, then dueled for the lead on the inside the eighth pole, but faded late. EVAN'S NICE NOW chased the early pace from the inside, swung out four wide
entering the stretch, was bumped there then offered a mild late rally. PAZ THE WINE was allowed to settle early, then offered a belated rally on the inside in
the stretch. COURTESY SHUFFLE was well placed early towards the inside, swung out three wide for the drive but was empty. FORTRESSA failed to
menace. S P F NINETYNINE was not a threat. MISS TOM TOM was not a factor. The jockey of THIRD CALL DOWN claimed foul versus ATLANTIC
AVENUE for alleged interference in the stretch. After the stewards reviewed the replay the result was left as is.

Footnotes
HIGH RIDER was allowed to settle early, advanced while four wide on the turn, came five wide entering the stretch, drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best. DISTILLED SPIRIT tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained the advantage entering the stretch, but proved to
be no match for the winner while second best. JUMP SHOT was allowed to settle early, offered no significant rally while getting up for the show. TOO
MUCH JOHNNIE was allowed to settle early, came into the stretch, offered a mild late rally for minor rewards. NICELY NICELY had a three to four wide trip
but offered no rally. ZEN ARCHER set the early pace while clear then gave way. MATHEW'S CHARM was away alertly, stalked the pace three wide before
weakening. ARNINA failed to menace. DOUBLE LUCK was not a threat. SURPRISE VISIT showed little. COFFEE PLEASE stopped.
