margin and was well clear while under steady urging. MARGIE'S ROUXBEE broke in at the start, bumped with a rival, chased the early pace from the
outside, remained closest to the leader entering the drive but was no match while clearly second best. TAKILLA SHOTZ forced the early pace from the

COWGIRL CALLIE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded to gain a clear margin at the eighth pole and was well
clear while kept to task. BORN TO D' WILD forced the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the drive and was along for the place. ALOHA KAI
pressed the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the drive and rallied late for the show. EMMA'S GIFT up close early from the outside, gained a
clear margin through the turn but came up empty in the drive. MALILA could only improve position. ACTIVE GIRL was no real factor. GO SELMA T chased
the early pace and tired in the drive. ROCKING SHOES broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin then had a steady fade.

Footnotes
DON GUILLERMO well placed from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, angled outside for the drive,
responded when asked and was along in time. A LITTLE RISKY stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded
entering the drive but could not reach the winner. CHAMBLISS up close early from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the
second turn, held on well but weakened late. ANDY JONES unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded and
rallied but too late. DON LOUIS could only improve position. ARTIES GAME dueled from the outside and tired. TONI'S STAR was no factor. TUNE MY
GUITAR was no threat. FLY GUY RAK forced the early pace outside and faded. BOSTON BIND chased the early pace and tired. HISTORY EARNED was
always outrun. Due to a timer issue running times have been omitted.

Footnotes
THEBOYZHOUR dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, responded to duel through the drive and outnodded
ILLUMINATINGAPPEAL the final strides. ILLUMINATINGAPPEAL dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth
pole but was caught late. FLASH ATTACK stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded and rallied late for the
show. WHISKEY BRAVO forced the early pace outside, remained forward but had no late response. IT'S MIKE'S TURN went evenly. BLUE CHOICE
chased the early pace inside but had nothing left. TY'S AGENDA was no factor. CANDY FOR THREE was never close. LASS SONG dueled from the
outside and gave way. SWEET KAYDEN showed little.
