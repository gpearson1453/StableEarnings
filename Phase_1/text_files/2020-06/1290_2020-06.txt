Footnotes
BOTTLE SHOCK showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, rounded the turn in the two path, shook clear outside the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off under the whip until near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride while much the
best. THE DEVILS BACK was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide late on that
bend, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just get the place. MAINTAINANCE MATT was reluctant to load, broke out and
bumped soundly with rivals, settled under some urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out near
the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. HARLEQUIN broke out and bumped with a foe then dropped back,
angled in early while off the pace, moved up near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed kick. SOURNOIS was well placed towards the front, dropped back while three wide on the turn, raced behind horses into the final furlong then
moved in for room and lacked the needed response. COSMIC HALO was urged along towards the rear on the outside, went three then two wide on the turn
and failed to threaten. MORHAWK was ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and failed to rally.
JEGGYJEGGY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. ARCHARCH TALE
disputed the pace between horses, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back near the quarter-pole, drifted out while continuing to drop back near the
furlong marker and tired. AUGUSTUS MAXIMUS was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside of two foes then in the four path on the turn,
dropped back near the quarter-pole and faded. (Rail at 20 Feet)

Footnotes
UNWANTED INTRUDER broke a step slow, settled near the middle of the field, was asked while five then six wide on the turn, rallied seven wide into the
stretch, closed strongly on the outside into the final furlong, bumped with the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-pole then jostled with that foe while making a
bid in the final sixteenth and prevailed at huge odds. BANDY'S MAP established a good position early, moved up between horses to dispute the pace briefly
around the five-eighths then dropped back while in tight midway down the backstretch, drafted behind the vanguard in the three path on the turn, swung six
wide into the stretch, rallied on the inside of the winner, bumped with that foe approaching the sixteenth-pole then jostled while making a bid and missed but
earned the place. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled and was off a bit slow, moved up leaving the chute then chased the
leaders on the outside, made a five wide bid on the turn, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths then moved clear while dropping to three wide into the
stretch, led while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth, drifted out closer to the top two as they posed a major threat and was caught while clear for
the show. MAJESTIC DAY was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, steadied off heels while gaining near the quarter-pole, came
six wide into the stretch and improved position. JUST ASK JOEL ducked in badly leaving the chute, settled under some urging, drafted inside to the two
path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty. HUNK OF A HIT settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole,
went two to three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. ANSWER IN THE WIND broke out at the start, showed good speed then disputed the
pace between horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and weakened. SAY WHEN moved up near
the five-eighths pole to contest the pace between horses, vied four wide while still between horses on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired.
FLEXATI showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and
capitulated. MR DIXIE CUP bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back while urged along, went four to five wide on the turn, came eight wide into the
stretch and was no factor. FINAL DECEPTION broke awkwardly and was off slow, moved out at the rear of the field, was ridden along on the far outside,
went six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MIDNIGHT REVOLT broke out at the start, moved up near the
five-eighths pole to contest the pace on the outside, vied four wide on the turn, dropped back passing the quarter-pole and faded. Following the race, the
stewards' posted the inquiry sign and the rider of BANDY'S MAP claimed foul against UNWANTED INTRUDER for alleged interference around the
sixteenth-pole. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
SWEET TOMATOE PIE pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, took the lead while three wide on the turn, moved clear nearing the quarter-pole then
dropped to the two path, extended the advantage into upper stretch, had the rider take a confident peak behind him before being asked at the eighth-pole,
was given one light tap of a down-turned whip outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while eased up late. WITT NINE angled in early, was
urged along off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped closer to the inside, cut the corner under a drive into the stretch and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BLUEGRASS DIXIE was urged along towards the back, went four wide for most of the turn then
moved five wide, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. CASH ON FIRE was urged along towards the
rear on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail before the three-eighths, shifted to the two path late on the turn then came four
wide into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. ASTROLOGY BLING disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the
rail on the turn, moved to the two path after losing touch with the winner late on that bend and tired. OUTSMARTED was urged along off the pace, raced
inside to the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide near the quarter-pole then came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. PADDLE WHEEL
was urged along on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and also failed to respond. TRIPLE
ACCOUNT moved up after the start to dispute the pace, vied between horses in the two path early on the turn, shifted three wide after losing touch with the
winner late on that bend and faded. CHAMISA lunged at the start and was last away, raced towards the rear under urging, went four to five wide on the turn
and was no factor.

Footnotes
MORO CHARLIE was sent hard to contest the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail while still inside of a foe on the turn, battled under a
drive into the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. TRULY BLING tossed his head at the start while
snatched with the left rein, raced towards the front under urging, went two to three wide on the turn, kept IMA REAL DEAL blocked to the inside in upper
stretch, made an outside bid into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place but failed to match strides with the winner. IMA REAL DEAL broke out
and bumped hard with a rival, bobbled and steadied while in tight between horses, was hard ridden near the back, went three then two wide on the turn then
was driven hard while gaining into the stretch, checked sharply while blocked behind the leading duo approaching the furlong marker, altered course
towards the inside around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show but lost all chance at victory in a tough journey. PAW'S SALTY PEPPER was
hustled from the start, went to the front, disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. MY TEXAS CHROME was urged along off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. UPTOWN
BLING was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide early on the turn, dropped to the rail late on that bend and failed to respond. THRIFT
SHOP tracked the pace on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. BETABEARLY bumped hard with a rival at the start,
raced at the back under urging, was pulled up late on the turn then unseated the rider, ran off to the far turn before being caught by the outrider then was
subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
ELLE'S TOWN went to the front then moved clear early, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace inside to the two path, responded well when set
down into upper stretch and held under strong urging. BREEZE RIDER broke in the air then bumped with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with good energy but was too late
while able to get the place. VALENTINES DAY saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along while inside early on the far turn then
shifted three wide near the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch and finished well to get the show. CHIKARA went around the first turn in the two
path, tracked the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN was bumped in the hindquarters at the
start, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to rally. JUST LEAVE came away
alertly but dropped back early, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, spun four
wide into the stretch and was no factor. FREEDOM PASSAGE brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was taken in hand very briefly then a rival passed
in front early, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and came up empty. (Rail at

Footnotes
AQWAAM bobbled at the start but recovered quickly to take the lead, dropped in entering the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was well rated
while setting the pace, came under urging under threat while inside to the two path on the far turn, dueled gamely with the runner-up in the stretch, came out
under a left-handed whip late then bumped with the aforementioned foe and prevailed in the end. PRAETORIAN was hustled from the start, went three wide
on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two to three path on the far turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch, was brushed
by that foe late and missed while well clear for the place. DEFENDER saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under urging while
inside on the far turn, was driven into upper stretch in the two path and weakened while best of the rest. FLATOUT WINNER broke out at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while shifting from three to five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
POTOMAC broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, passed the
five-sixteenths under the whip and came up empty. STARSHIP ZEUS moved in entering the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled towards the
rear, went two then three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. BROADWAY D'ORO bobbled at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was urged
along at the rear, went five then six wide early on the far turn, dropped to the four path late on that bend and was no factor. VICE VERSA went around the
first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. Following the race, the stewards' posted
the inquiry sign and the rider of PRAETORIAN claimed foul against AQWAAM alleging interference in deep stretch. Furthermore, the trainer of
PRAETORIAN also lodged an objection. Following the stewards' review, AQWAAM was disqualified from first and placed second.

UNCORKED HUMOR was away alertly, set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well under a
right-handed whip in the stretch and held under strong urging. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR hesitated at the start and was last away, raced outside while urged
along, went five wide on the turn and finished with good energy to just get the place. BRAVURA CREEK broke out and bumped with a rival, chased the
pace on the inside of a foe, went around the turn in the two to three path, pursued the winner in the stretch, gained on that opponent late and finished
willingly to just miss the place. KASILOF was ridden along while well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, moved off
the inside while gaining in the final furlong and finished willingly but was not urged in the final few strides and missed the trifecta. YOUNG HENDRICK broke
out and bumped solidly with a foe then was hustled, jumped tracks early and nearly unseated the rider, regained stride shortly thereafter and chased on the
far outside, went five wide on the turn, lugged out six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while still on his inside lead, drifted out late and faltered. ALL
BIZNESS was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to rally. EARS A WINNER bumped with a rival at the start, was urged
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped to three wide into the stretch then drifted further in and capitulated. G. C. CRACKERJACK was
urged along off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and came up empty. MY TRUE REWARD was urged along at the rear, went three to four
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. TRES CHIFLADOS was bumped solidly at the start, raced well back on the outside
under urging, went six wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TUMBLING SKY showed good speed, pressed the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back a bit nearing the quarter-pole, pursued
the leader into the final furlong, drifted in some passing the chute, re-bid near the sixteenth-pole then took the advantage and gamely prevailed.
NOVEMBER MIKE settled in third position, was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong,
altered course to the outside of the drifting leader nearing the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but missed while able to get the place. BOB'S
BAD BOY was urged along on the far outside, went five then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to get the
show. PAPA RIZZO settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, checked inside the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, gained into
the final sixteenth then paused and improved position. BETA LAKE was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, set the pace on the outside of the
winner, rounded the turn in the two to three path, drifted out while in front in upper stretch, drifted back in approaching the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken.
TIGERBEACH was urged along off the pace, went four wide early on the turn, steadied near the five-sixteenths then shifted five wide, came six wide into the
stretch and gained late but missed the superfecta. TALE OF A STORM was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the whip and failed to rally. HERITAGE PARK leapt in the air at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, drifted out near the
seven-sixteenths, steadied off heels and was forced out into the turn, went six then five wide on that bend and failed to threaten. VALID THOR was urged
along off the pace, checked badly into the turn then dropped to the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. (Rail at 20 Feet)

willingly for the place. BOGEY broke in then bumped with a rival and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, went five then
six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and finished with late energy for the show. WARRIOR'S KID settled off the pace, was roused while
inside on the turn, moved off the rail near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was urged along on the outside, went
five then four wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. THE RED DUDE bumped with a rival at the start,
