Footnotes
MO CUISHLE came away a step slow then raced in the four path the first turn, launched a bid past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the
five path, took the lead in the upper stretch, moved clear mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. QUICK ENERGY rated a slim early lead inside then
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dueled clear past the quarter pole but gave up the lead in the upper stretch and had to settle for
second. HATTA DOUBLE saved ground well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, checked off the heels of rivals midway on the far
turn, swung to the outside entering the stretch and was along for third. LIZZIE'S LAST stalked the runner-up two deep and challenged that one approaching
the three eighths pole, continued close through the far turn but weakened in the stretch. BERRY STRONG stalked the pace in the three path, challenged
toward the three eighths pole and remained close through the far turn before weakening.

Footnotes
STAR OF NIGHT rated with the early pace inside then relaxed a bit leaving the first turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two
deep midway on the far turn and drew off of her own initiative through the stretch. DUBAI WAS LIT settled back saving ground the opening turn then eased
out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and was along for second. PEACEFUL CHILD rounded
the opening turn in the five path and took the lead past the nine sixteenths pole, drew clear toward the seven sixteenths, but was caught at the rail midway
on the far turn and flattened stride. COMMCAT stalked the pace off the rail then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, but, showed little more on the far turn.
POWER FORWARD raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, made a mild bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened. IT'SMYINTENSION settled off the pace in the three and four paths then showed little response.
ALLEGHENY DBL LIME mostly saved ground. GATTOLOTTACHARM saved some early ground then faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
GRANDPA LOUIE picked up the chase and took the lead two deep approaching the top of the lane, raced clear into the lane and was steadily encouraged
to hold on well. CYCLOBOMB gave early chase toward the inside and had aim in the three path of the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn, dueled for second
in the upper stretch and finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. NATIVE COURAGE chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the
turn and was along for third mid-stretch while finishing evenly. FASTDRIVEN broke through the gate prior the start then came away sharply to sprint clear,
was caught approaching the top of the lane and weakened past the eighth pole. NICALOE came away a step slow then gave chase while saving ground.
YESUS STAR gave distant chase racing well off the rail and passed some rivals through the lane. EGREGIOUS chased the pace off the rail, rounded the
turn in the four path then weakened. JAMAKIN ME RUN chased the early pace toward the outside, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed
little more. TRACE'S BOY gave chase then faded through the turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ROAD GUARD POST was hustled along to contest the pace and kept the edge two deep rounding the turn, drifted a bit and gave up the lead leaving the
turn but dug in through the lane to recover the advantage in the final yards, and just held on. UNION GRACE gave chase outside and rounded the turn
about the four path, dug in leaving the turn to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. BEARCAT KITTEN pressured the pace from the
inside, dueled at a close disadvantage at the rail on the turn and took the lead nearing the head of the lane, held on to deep stretch but was caught in the
final yards. GOOD GENES chased the leaders inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. WIZARD OF ODDS gave early chase inside and
raced at the rail through the turn, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished evenly. CASTLE FIVE chased the pace from the three and four
paths then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CALL ME COWBOY lost traction leaving the gate then picked up the chase, though, faded on the turn.

Footnotes
BRIDGING THE GAP ducked sharply outward leaving the gate then angled back to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the far turn,
rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. MAMA'S GREY GHOST stalked the winner two deep then challenged that one
leaving the three eighths pole, continued close through the far turn but dropped back into the lane and raced evenly to the wire. BIRD TRAFFIC raced in the
three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three
path and showed little further. ALLISON K saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
but showed little more. OCEAN LILLY was bothered then pinched back at the start and raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, left the first turn
outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and had little left. After hitting the gate, SHE FIGURES was shut off at the start
and saved ground off the pace, then showed little response past the three eighths pole. EXCEED THE GOAL, without hind shoes, raced off the pace in the
three and four paths, came through the far turn in the five path and proved empty down the lane. DON'T SPIN ME broke awkwardly and outward, rounded
the first turn about the five path while stalking the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. CALL ME JELLY ROLL
became a bit restless in the gate, came away awkwardly and was squeezed a short stride later then never factored.

Footnotes
LINEA VERDE settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, was soon clear
then well handled through the lane. TIPSY TIME raced well back from early contention while saving ground, bid into the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn two deep and settled for second. COLD HEARTED GAL saved early ground and settled well off the pace, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and was just up for third. HALFY rounded the opening turn in the four path and was well off the
pace leaving the turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole then came in a path past the pole and showed little further in the lane. MIZZBANG settled off the
pace about the four path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, checked off the flank of Halfy past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride through the far
turn but flattened out down the lane. VENETIAN DRIVE saved ground off the pace and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail then weakened. MOHAWK MISS was not a factor. DOROTHY M was not a factor. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN angled to the inside to rate the pace,
came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then gave way. DOVES OUT raced off the early pace
inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn.
