Footnotes
BIG BOY DAVE REX broke on top, stalked the pace while off the inside, continued three wide in the run up the backstretch while maintaining forward
position, challenged on the outside with three furlongs remaining, gained the advantage soon after, held sway through the stretch while under firm handling.
ATLANTIC RULER void of early foot, rallied four wide through the second turn, continued a slow gain on the winner late, clearly second best. OUTLAW X.
away in good order, cleared to the inside before a quarter, set a soft pace, offered brief resistance to the winner in the second turn then could not keep up,
proved no match for the runner up late, remained well clear of the others. APPLEWOOD settled off the pace while racing in the two path, continued one
paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. GO FOR MOONSHINE pressured the leader while off the inside, between foes when offering a brief
challenge inside the winner in the far turn then began to falter. MISTER INTUITION off the pace while four wide through the first turn, lacked a closing
response when called on for the drive. COOL INDIVIDUAL lacked any kind of early foot, remained back in showing little. STRIKING STAR off a step slow,
five wide into the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ALYS EPISODE narrowly set the pace toward the inside, bit of a breather midway on the turn, shook off a rival to be clear entering the stretch, enough left
to last. LAWSUIT LUCY reserved off the pace and the inside, behind some traffic early in the turn, came three wide into the straight, called on when
straightened for home and then finished full of run through traffic to be getting to the winner late. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE forward from the start, pressed
the issue inside, fell back off the winner in the turn, continued to chase that rival past the furlong, lacked a winning response late, caught for the place.
KORAT QUEEN rank at the start to be off slowly, continued well back for almost a half, shifted out nearing the furlong ground, displayed some late interest
to improve position while well out in the course. MY HEART DOMINUS in mid pack early, moved out to bother a couple of outer foes late backstretch,
advanced to try the winner midway on the turn, flattened out in the drive to lose a couple of positions the final furlong. STOP THE FRIEND broke alertly,
raced forwardly early, gradually weakened. HALF DIALED back off the early pace and in the inside, checked up when bothered late backstretch and into the
turn, did not recover. VIKING VOYAGE remained back in failing to threaten. I'M ALL MIXED UP off a step slow, was used to move up on the outside the
opening quarter, gave way in the drive. GET DIRECTIONS off the pace out in the course, bothered slightly late backstretch, four wide through the turn, tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
THREE RUN HOMER broke on top, prompted the early leader from the inside, took over along the rail just after a half, steadily increased margin to the wire
while being kept to task. DICTATOR asked to clear after the start while off the inside, allowed the winner the rail before a half, briefly dueled with that one
the third quarter then could not keep up, remained clear for the place. DE BIRD IS DA WORD settled in mid pack while off the inside, asked along three
wide turning for home, steadily getting to the runner up place while holding sway for the show. ELLERBE off a step slow, remained well back for six furlongs,
came four wide out of the final turn, lodged a belated rally to be going best of all of the second flight at the end. DREWTEMPO went one paced toward the
inside,

Footnotes
ZYPTO in the second flight while off the inside, three wide and closest to the dueling leaders out of the turn, challenged on the outside past the furlong
marker, long drive to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. I'LL RAISE YOU broke back, continued to lack speed through the turn, came on the
outside for the drive, advanced on the winner inside the furlong marker then flattened out and could do little with that rival in the waning strides. JAZZ
MUSIC alternated up front while racing in the two path, narrowly showed the way past furlong marker, had little left int he late going while managing to save
the show. FIRE MAKERS STAR last to leave, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided. CAEUS IN
PASADENA raced in mid pack for three furlongs, had little left for the final furlong. D'ROCK dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered midstretch.

Footnotes
DIAMOND FOR CRIDER away in good order, was forwardly placed on the outside in the run up the backstretch, moved to challenge early in the turn,
dueled into the stretch while remaining off the inside, edged away the final furlong. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE pressed the issue early off the inside, vied between
rivals and inside the winner into the bend, dueled with that rival into and through upper stretch, proved no match for that one late, all out to save the place.
STANG IT behind the early pace while racing inside, moved out three wide midway on the turn, set down for the drive, getting to the runner up late while
outside that foe. ANGELIC KRISS last away, trailed early as a result, angled out for the drive, stage a mild rally out in the strip to improve position slighlty.
SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK settled off the pace, saved some ground into the turn, angled out around a tiring rival late in the bend, went evenly to the wire
and was never a serious threat. RUNNING ROSADO went one paced throughout in lacking a late kick. UNMENTIONABLE took control along the inside
soon after the start, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way when headed in the turn. G G HAS A SHOT finished early while racing four wide.

SR. CLARKY unhurried for three furlongs toward the inside, swung out to be five wide exiting the turn when beginning to advance, finished with a flourish
out in the middle of the strip to be up in time. DIVA'S RANSOM with the pace along the inside, dueled past the furlong marker, led late, caught, game for the
place. MY PAL TORRES close from the start, vied between rivals through the turn, dueled with the runner up past the furlong past the furlong marker, also
could not contain the winner late, outkicked for the place. CAJUN CARMELIZED broke well, dropped to the inside the opening furlong, tracked the leaders
through the turn, went evenly in the drive to lack a closing kick. PRAYER BOY broke back, lacked speed while racing toward the inside, improved position in
the drive without posing a serious threat. PERSONAL DOUBLE settled off the pace and the inside, raced four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing
response. SPARKY SPARKLES pressed the issue early, moved closer to vie three wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. BWANA GO was never a
serious factor. FANCY THIS last away and was always outrun. SPA SHACKALACKA broke out, raced back and outside, gave way into the stretch, jogged
in.

Footnotes
COMMANDER SCOTT forwardly placed inside, steered to to be three wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, challenged on the outside of the two
leaders into the stretch, drove steadily clear the final furlong. ANDIAMO GIACOMO back off the early pace off the inside, raced three wide through the turn,
set down for the drive, made late run to gain the nod for the place in the final stride. ARCTIC ROSE dueled up front closest to the inside, briefly responded
when the winner challenged entering the stretch, proved no match the final furlong for that one, nipped in the late going to miss the place. THUNK lacked
early foot outside, raced four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. PRINCE CARLOS back off the pace toward the inside, continued
to save some ground through the turn, went one paced through the stretch in lacking a serious response. CARLOS PUNCH broke alertly, alternated up front
while off the inside, weakened from between rivals upper stretch. DUSTY BOY void of early foot, four wide exiting the turn, improved position slightly while
never dangerous. CAJUN UP in the second flight for a half, faded. YANKEE CLIPPER last away, raced well back for a half, came six wide into the stretch,
passed tiring rivals. COCO'S MAN remained always back. BRAD EYE raced in mid pack early, had nothing left latee. FLASHBURN closest to the duel in
heading up the second flight for three furlongs, tired.

Footnotes
TENSAS THOUGHT closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch, eased out and advanced on that one late in the turn, extended and heated duel to
the wire, proved best in a game effort. ALOHA BETTY broke sharply, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way through the turn inside, responded when the
winner challenged from the outside exiting the turn, long drive to the wire, gave ground grudgingly, clearly second best. SKY DIETY behind the pace off the
inside while being asked for some run early, continued to chase that pair and proved no match for the dueling leaders in the stretch, clear of the others.
DUEFORADATE off a step slow, improved slightly while saving some ground turn, flattened out in the drive. MARQUEE MOMENT lacked early foot, failed
to muster a meaningful response when called on for the drive when four wide. MOONLIGHT MICHELLE forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady
retreat after three furlongs while off the inside.

Footnotes
CASTLEMAN away in good order, stalked the two leaders off the inside, engaged that pair turning for home in the three path, drove steadily clear.
AMAZING AMERICAN moved up to duel after the start, shook off the other speed as the winner was challenging entering the stretch, came off the inside,
proved no match the final furlong, dug in to prevail for the place. TROLL AND STROLL back off the pace, came on the outside for the drive, bid for the
place, outkicked for that position while also no match for the winner. FIRST METAL COUNT broke through the gate prior to the start, broke alertly, in the
second flight while inside, continued to save ground into the stretch when moving a bit closer, flattened out and lacked a further bid. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE
settled off the pace and the inside, turned in an even effort. OUR BUCKET LIST lacked early foot, improved slightly while never dangerous. HUGHES
DONT LOSE in mid pack while inside, saved ground to no avail. SAILING JETT void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, failed to rally. NOCOMET last
to leave, moved up to race in the main body early, had little left for the drive. ELISHER dueled up front in the two path for a half and gave way. TENSAS
GOLD finished early, trailed home.
