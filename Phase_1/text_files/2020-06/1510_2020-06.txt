DRESS SHOPPING tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady bid to wrest command and edge clear under firm handling. FLAN, urged outside a rival prompting the pace, dueled for command through the turn to
gain a brief advantage racing into upper stretch but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. CABLOOSIE BAY settled inside foes in the
opening stages, saved ground to the lane and finished well enough to gain a share late. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the turn, then steadily faded nearing the lane. DYNAMITE DAUGHTERS settled outside foes racing to the turn and never a mounted a serious
challenge. VEGAN GOES BEST, bumped at the start, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace just off the rail racing into the turn, then gave way into the
lane.

Footnotes
SO ALIVE settled inside a rival as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, continued near the rear to the far turn, was prompted to advance racing
into the stretch while swinging out four wide, then found his best stride in the closing stages to just edge JERRYS PRIDENJOY on the wire under brisk left
handed pressure. The latter broke sharply, sped clear while angling inwards to dictate the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, opened a commanding
margin racing into the far turn, held sway into upper stretch and just failed to contain the winner on the wire. CLEAR THE MINE settled outside the eventual
winner as part of the last flight in the opening half, shifted out three deep entering the far turn advancing on the pacesetter to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. TAPSOLUTE angled to the inside early tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance and steadily faded nearing the lane.
BOBBY BABY switched out to the four path racing into the first turn while being urged to a forward placing tracking the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of
that foe to the far turn and proved empty in the drive. ROCKNROLL ROCKET, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside
and faded from contention early.

Footnotes
HALEYS HEIST broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear racing into the stretch and was kept to pressure. FABLES
LOVE AFFAIR broke in the air while dropping out last, switched outside foes in the opening stages, steadily advanced four wide into upper stretch and
finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. PEARLE DE VEENE, urged disputing the pace from the outset while angling to the inside racing
into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked off the first flight three wide to the turn, made a brief advance in that path racing
into the lane but flattened out. DIAMOND DIVA switched off the inside early while being urged in pursuit of the leaders, gave way into the lane. WHO'S
FOOLING WHO settled between foes and failed to menace. SMOKEN DANNI dropped back early. TAKE ALETTER MARIA steadily faded.

RENTAL POOL broke sharply, sped clear of the field along the rail, opened a comfortable advantage racing to the far turn, then held sway to the end under
firm handling. TRENDY NEVE, pulled her way to a position just off the pacesetter tracking that foe inside a rival to the far turn, then made a steady advance
while shifting off the inside racing through the lane to close the gap nearing the wire. TWO BE ROYAL settled well off the second flight while angling to the
rail early, saved ground through the far turn steadily gaining contention, split foes while shifting out near midstretch and was going well late to prevail for a
share. STEAL THE THUNDER tracked off the second flight along the inside under light rating to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing through the
lane and finished evenly late. NORA'S LEGACY, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, made brief
progress to close the gap nearing upper stretch but gave way in the drive. LIL' RED DEVIL, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch,
offered no rally. LADY LANGFUHR stumbled at the start, was collected while settling outside foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch and steadily
faded while widest into the stretch.

Footnotes
WEE MS. BURNZIE, in touch with the first flight four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn pressing the pace
between foes, assumed command nearing upper stretch and kicked clear under firm handling. ALL NATIVE, reluctant to load, was rated off the first flight
three deep early, split foes nearing upper stretch, then angled four wide entering the lane and continued with interest to prove best of the others. BABY
GORDITA, urged to terms with the first flight five wide between foes, shifted inwards prompting the pace three deep racing into the turn, angled inside racing
into the lane but couldn't match the top pair. MZ JACKIE, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, gave way
after a half. STELLATIDE, a bit outpaced early, angled seven wide in the lane and passed tiring rivals. COWGIRL COURT broke readily, was caught six
wide in the opening stages, tracked just off the first flight racing four wide into the turn and gave way entering the lane. MY AWARD tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight and steadily faded into the lane. FOXYS IRISH AFFAIR proved no factor. BLUE MOON BELLE was urged along the inside
racing just off the first flight to the turn but steadily retreated nearing the lane. BIRDS VIEW bobbled at the start and dropped out early. VIVA LOVANGO
was outrun.

DREAMING BIZ was rated between foes in early stages tracking off the second flight, steadily worked her way to the inside nearing the far turn, gathered
momentum racing into upper stretch to split rivals just off the inside and prevailed in time under firm handling. TANTIMA tracked the pacesetter as part of
the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch, gained a brief advantage near midstretch
but couldn't fend off the winner. COME ON SWEET PEA tracked the leaders three, then four wide as part of the second flight, dropped back after a half,
then shifted inwards racing into the stretch to continue willingly between foes gaining position to the end. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN hesitated at the start, was
settled outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned seven wide racing into the lane but displayed some late interest to gain position nearing the wire. FOR
SARAS SAKE tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, shifted out racing into upper stretch but had no late bid. DROP O' CHOCOLATE
sprinted clear of the field, held sway on a commanding advantage to the far turn and gave out racing into upper stretch. AMANDA STORY tracked off the
second flight outside foes and lacked the needed late response. PEYTONS SKY DANCER was settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and proved
no threat. NOTE PAD tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out four wide entering the lane but proved empty in the
drive. WARREN'S WISH, forwardly placed pursuing the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way between foes racing into upper stretch. ADDY PADDY, a bit
rank between foes early, steadily faded nearing the lane. TOP SHELF SARA was outrun.

Footnotes
OMEN OF CHANGE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, was eased out to race four wide through the turn, steadily advanced in
that path racing into the stretch and prevailed under firm right handed pressure. CREATIVE ART tracked just off the first flight four deep in the opening
stages, advanced three wide into the turn to press the issue, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, was bumped leaving midstretch by
CABIN JOHN, resisted the winner's bid but yielded nearing the wire. TUCKER TIME exchanged bumps with KELA BREW at the start, switched outside foes
racing to the turn, angled six wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to prevail for a share. CABIN JOHN, in touch with the leaders three deep
in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes through the turn to upper stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker bumping CREATIVE ART
and gave out late. LONG STATION tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane but proved empty late.
GAME DAY DECISION tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight and faded into the stretch. MERANGO TANGO shifted out five wide early tracking off
the second flight and offered no rally. GREAT BLAKE pulled his way to the lead between foes, angled inwards disputing the issue inside foes racing into the
turn and gave way entering the lane. KELA BREW exchanged bumps at the start, was settled last and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
SAMURAI MIKE, forwardly placed three deep racing just off the first flight into the turn, was urged to challenge racing into upper stretch, contested the issue
in a protracted skirmish past midstretch but prevailed in time under firm encouragement. GEAUXCRO broke sharply, dueled for command outside a rival
racing into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch, shifted out resisting the winner's challenge grudgingly to the end but just failed to contain that foe. EPIC
DRAMA tracked the first flight from just out of striking distance while angling inside, shifted out entering the lane and continued with interest to prevail for a
share between foes nearing the wire. GIANT GAMBLE, urged along the rail from the outset pressing a rival's pace, dueled through the turn to upper stretch
and weakened in late stages. MASTERFUL STRIDE broke awkwardly, shifted in to track the leaders between foes racing into the turn and gained some
position late while making no real impression. FERLIN HUSKY tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the inside, swung out four wide
entering the lane but lacked a rally. FENDER BENDER settled along the inside early and trailed into the stretch.
