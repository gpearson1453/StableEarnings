Footnotes
ECHO LOCATION rushed up inside the early pacesetter, opened up a length on that one late backstretch, was pressed again on the turn and down the
stretch but held stubbornly, her margin diminishing in the late stages. DON'T SMILE LILAH had a short lead early before the winner came up inside of her to
take command before the turn, continued to stalk and press the eventual winner throughout the turn and down the lane but could not get by. SOUP DU
JOUR was in a bit tight early and fell back to trail, advanced two to four wide on the turn and continued to inch up down the stretch for the show spot without
threatening the top pair. FLAT OUT FABULOUS broke out at the start and settled in chasing in the three path, was in between runners and behind the
leaders in upper stretch and lugged in by the eighth pole, never seeming comfortable. ENHANCED FINANCE chased along the rail throughout, still there
top of the lane but had no response late.

Footnotes
SUPER CHOCOLATE stalked three wide early, bid for the front early on the turn and had a length on the field with the rider looking for competition in upper
stretch, finishing them off with a vigorous hand ride. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS dueled inside two rivals early, dropped back to chase those front runners on
the turn, angled out by the quarter pole and ran on a clear second best while drifting back to the inside late. SIMPLY MYSTERIOUS was off the pace and
three wide throughout, closing up in late stretch for the show spot without threatening the top pair. HELLO ANNIE was between pace rivals early before
getting the front and the rail into the turn, lost the lead mid turn and struggled in the late stages, falling back inside the final sixteenth. CLAIRESSENCE
began awkwardly from that inside post, rushed up to chase into the turn but could not continue her rally and fell back from mid turn.

TWICK brushed the side of the gate and trailed early, rushed up the inside to chase the leaders into the turn, came off the inside and split rivals in upper
stretch to drive past another closer at the sixteenth pole, inching away at the finish. CHEETAHRA settled in mid pack while three wide, circled into range
three to five wide on the turn and grabbed a brief lead by the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final sixteenth by the winner. FINE LADY stalked three
wide early and into the turn, fell back losing positions as the field turned for home, then re-rallied lat in the final sixteenth while wide for the show. NORDIC
PEARL was on the engine with pace rivals to her inside and out, shook off those two late turn but was drifting out as they turned for home, losing ground in
the final sixteenth. REAL CHOPPER fell off the pace early, was steadied when advancing between rivals midway on the turn, the shut off in mid stretch
when attempting to squeeze up the rail, running evenly to the wire. SPEEDY RUNNER was inside the early leader pressing the pace, fell back late on the
turn and had nothing left down the lane.

SEA LILY assumed command quickly, the rider up in the saddle while in front throughout, totally comfortable from pillar to post without being seriously
challenged. BIG MAMBA settled in mid pack, ranged up two to four wide on the turn and drifted out to the six or seven path turning for home, continuing on
gamely to nail down the place spot late. PURPLE SCOOTER stalked the winner early but was working much harder to keep close to that one, tried to bid on
the turn but was no match and lost the place spot late to a fellow rival. NO QUESTION closed from off the pace along the inside on the turn, angled out
around a tiring runner in upper stretch and had dead aim along the inside for the place spot but hung in the final seventy yards. SENORITA UNO was off the
pace early and closed two to five wide on the turn, floated out to the seven path as they turned for home and passed a few tired foes while lugging in down
the lane. MAXIS BABE chased along the inside, falling back midway on the turn and dropping further back in the upper stretch. WUK UP QUEEN was
steadied up soon after the start and off the pace, rallied nicely while three to five wide on the turn to appear a contender but tired from her big move and had
nothing left for the stretch.

TRUE DAT was off the pace early, got a dream run up the rail on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and nailed the leader in the final strides. SILENCIUM
shook off early challengers to open up a lead midway on the turn in the two path, was taken on again in upper stretch but opened up another time by the
sixteenth pole, only to be caught in the shadow of the wire. FRAC ATTACK was off the pace early, came up the rail nicely on the turn to be inside the
pacesetter in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair, although game to hold the show spot. D MAGICIAN stalked outside the pacesetter throughout,
bid to get by that one as they turned for home but was repelled, losing the show spot as well late. NORTHERN CRUSADER was off the pace and moving up
behind runners early into the turn when taken up hard by the rider, losing all chance and dropping back. ACT OF BOB pressed the early leader from the
inside, dropped off to chase the front two into the turn two to three wide, retreated from midway on the turn to the finish.

REAL MONEY led quickly, allowed a rival to take the front while still in hand on the turn, retook the front as the field turned for home and held the favorite off
safely under a stiff drive in the final furlong. RECONFIGURE was along the rail chasing the leaders while under restraint before angling out and splitting
rivals as the field turned for home, but the winner had something left and he could not get by. SILENT JIMMIE was at the back and over to the rail quickly,
stayed inside the entire trip, nailing down the show spot late with a fine stretch rally. SOUPER SMART was three wide and chasing around the turn, in a little
tight between foes nearing the turn for home, failing to hold the show spot late. CORDUROY ROAD stalked the winner early, had a brief lead on the turn but
lost it nearing the top of the stretch, then fell back and was shifting about in the lane under left handed handling. SOUPER SUCCESS was off the pace,
rallied two to four wide on the turn to move into contention, but tired from those efforts and fell back late. CLEAR DESTINATION was three wide stalking the
early pace, bid for the front as the field turned for home but fell back while lugging in down the lane.

PINK LLOYD hard held by his rider early, advanced three wide into second into the turn, bid for the front as the field turned for home, drifting in when taking
command by the eighth pole and widening along the rail in the final stages. MALIBU SECRET chased along the inside, got through along the fence to bid for
the front as the field turned into the stretch and may have got a very brief lead but was outrun by the winner in the final eighth and held a diminishing margin
late for the place spot. NOT SO QUIET led very briefly and stalked the pacesetter around the turn, fell back to last entering the stretch but re-rallied outside
for the show spot late finding his best stride the final seventy yards. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS took the lead after a sixteenth of a mile, led around the turn but
was tackled on both sides as they turned for home, fading inside the final furlong.

Footnotes
BUTTERMILK PIKE was quick to assume command, widened his advantage around the turn, had a clear lead in the stretch and was kept to his task to the
wire, never challenged. NOW WE ARE NINE was in mid pack along the inside, had to jam on the brakes when running up behind slowing rivals at the
quarter pole, got through inside in the upper stretch and closed very well when clear. LYRICAL NOTE was along the rail and off the pace, hustled four wide
by the quarter pole when closing and fanned into the six or seven path as they turned for home, getting up late for the show spot outside. DUKE OF MIAMI
chased along the rail, had the place spot turning for home but was outkicked down the lane, settling for a minor award. LEGAL GUMP chased three wide
throughout, was hard ridden into the stretch and drifted out a few paths, finishing evenly from that point. D'S BEN was brushed by a rival at the start and off
the pace, came three to five wide on the turn and floated into the seven or eight path at the top of the stretch, inched up late while widest in the final furlong.
LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL off the pace early, dropped from three wide to two wide on the turn and could only put in a mild close down the stretch. SPRING
EDITION brushed a rival at the start and was off the pace, came four to three wide on the turn but never reached contention. MAXIMUM PERFECTION
stalked the winner until the stretch, was pulled up by the eighth pole and was vanned off.
