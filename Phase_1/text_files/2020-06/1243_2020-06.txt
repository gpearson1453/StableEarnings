Footnotes
AMANGALLA went up to get the lead after the start, rated along in the two-path for six furlongs, kicked clear into the stretch and widened under pressure.
SENZAZIONE advanced four then three wide to loom a threat outside AMANGALLA late on the turn, flattened out through mid stretch and lugged in clear of
the rest. LIGHT FURY got bumped off stride by OMINOUS with the rider coming out of the irons at the start, had the rider recover them entering the main
track, moved to a forward position toward the inside, but lacked a stretch bid. PERFECT ENOUGH veered in and bumped FUTURE PRINCE at the start,
lagged well back early, and passed tired horses. MOUNTAIN BREEZE advanced three wide after a half-mile, but weakened approaching the stretch.
OMINOUS was bumped solidly between FUTURE PRINCE and LIGHT FURY at the start, prompted the early pace outside, and was finished before
reaching the stretch. INACEPTABLE saved ground to the turn, and moved out three wide while dropping far back. FUTURE PRINCE broke in at the start
bumping OMINOUS into LIGHT FURY and was then bumped by PERFECT ENOUGH as well, and retired early. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY
INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FAMOUS GENT advanced four wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and caught BAILEY from outside 50 yards out. BAILEY sat behind the dueling
leaders early, took over three wide turning for home, pulled clear through mid stretch, and yielded late while drifting out. GOD WARRIOR was urged
vigorously approaching the turn well back, came widest for the drive and finished willingly. CARSON CITY KID dueled outside PEPPI for three furlongs, and
weakened through the lane. CAPTURED THE CANDY broke in and bumped lightly with TOP BOSS, and saved ground to no avail. PEPPI dueled for
command inside CARSON CITY KID to the lane, and gave way on the wrong lead. TOP BOSS was bumped lightly by CAPTURED THE CANDY at the
start, chased the leaders two wide into the turn, and tired after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
VITAEMI stayed close early, moved off the rail to take over outside BAHAMA KITTEN midway on the turn, drew well clear through upper stretch under a
drive, and was hand urged the last 70 yards. BAHAMA KITTEN vied inside rivals for a half-mile, was no match for VITAEMI after six furlongs, and ran on to
save the place. YAKO lunged at the start to get away awkwardly, cut the corner beginning to find her best stride into the stretch, and rallied mildly. SPICY
NELLY was floated out a bit outside TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR entering the turn, moved in to the three-path near the top of the stretch, and lacked a bid. OUR
CLOSURE was driven with no response three wide on the turn. PAINT THE CORNERS faltered after six furlongs two wide. DIXIE PRINCESS vied early
outside BAHAMA KITTEN, and dropped back steadily on the turn three wide. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR was battling outside BAHAMA KITTEN when the left
rein broke going by the half-mile pole, drifted wide entering the turn with the rider struggling to grab hold of headgear, was pulled up without incident and
walked off.

Footnotes
MUKULWITZ advanced four wide past the quarter-pole, wrested command outside SAGAMORE MISCHIEF entering the final furlong, and drove well clear.
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF pressed R UNCLE ERIC from outside early, was put to a drive well before reaching the stretch, fought his way to a short lead
through the furlong grounds, could not go with the winner and just saved the place. SAIL AT SUNRISE lost his footing and broke inward smashing into
PRINCE IGOR, bumped with that rival again and buckled, came five wide off the turn and rallied with good courage on the far outside. YOUR AWESOME
BOSS saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid closing response. R UNCLE ERIC set the pace inside for three furlongs, shifted to the two-path entering
the stretch and gave way. PRINCE IGOR broke out slamming into SAIL AT SUNRISE at the start, then was bounced around between that one and
CARSON AND I and stumbled, and stayed well back three to four wide. DISCREET TUNE chased the leaders three wide into the turn, and was finished
after three furlongs. CARSON AND I broke out bumping with PRINCE IGOR a couple times, saved ground and was never close. TROUBLED AFFAIR was
sawed off and took up behind PRINCE IGOR and SAIL AT SUNRISE at the start, and was far back throughout. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY
INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
BIBIANA stumbled at the start and bumped lightly with MOMENTO, went along boxed in behind and between horses on the turn, tipped out four wide for
clearance entering the stretch, dueled late outside DANCING DESTROYER and gamely prevailed. DANCING DESTROYER moved up to loom a threat
three wide after a half-mile, forged to the front outside ONE HOT DRAMA approaching the eighth-pole, briefly edged away, then was bested inside BIBIANA
through the last 70 yards. GREY JAZMINE was well back and under a ride around the turn three wide, moved further out in the drive and rallied mildly on
the wrong lead. ONE HOT DRAMA chased outside ROYAL MISTRESS early, bid between that one and DANCING DESTROYER into the stretch, but faded
past the furlong marker. ROYAL MISTRESS was sent through to take over inside ONE HOT DRAMA after the start, showed the way to the stretch, and
gave way on the rail. MOMENTO bumped lightly with BIBIANA at the start, stayed close inside to the stretch, and came up empty.

Footnotes
MOZO BELLO went along covered up and reserved early, shifted out four wide getting his cue at the top of the lane, rallied up to the leaders from outside,
lugged in bumping a couple times with OVER THE CHANNEL in deep stretch and took a hard-fought decision. OVER THE CHANNEL hit the right side of
the gate at the start, advanced steadily after six furlongs in the four-path, reached the front with a furlong remaining, bumped with MOZO BELLO solidly
twice nearing the finish and just missed. AZRAEL vied for command outside HERO OF THE HOUR, got the best of that dispute as late challengers came up
to his outside after six furlongs, stayed on for the show and steadied inside the top two near the finish. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was slow into stride and
well back for a half-mile, came widest for the drive and rallied mildly for the last major share. BURN THE BOATS was a bit washy going to post, checked
along the inside entering the far turn and lost position, and finished with good courage between horses. RESIDENT LIBERAL was well back early inside,
went two then three wide on the far turn, and failed to menace. HE'S BANKABLE stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, bid briefly between horses
approaching the stretch, but gave way a furlong out. HERO OF THE HOUR had a short lead inside AZRAEL when he leapt awkwardly and steadied midway
up the backstretch, continued to contest the pace to the end of the far turn, and gave way. NETTLETON settled in the middle of the field two wide to the
lane, and had no rally. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF OVER THE CHANNEL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DARDANELLOS ranged up four wide late on the turn, ran by WELLWEST and SLIPPY to take over in upper stretch, and drew away under a drive. RED
FOG waited behind the leaders in hopes of slipping through inside from the five-sixteenths to the top of the lane, found no rail pass forthcoming, split horses
approaching the eighth-pole and could not gain on the winner while clearly second best. SLIPPY pressed WELLWEST early, got shaken off going to the
half-mile pole, took another run at the leader around the turn, and weakened through the stretch. MAGICAL MIKE saved ground for six furlongs, moved out
for the drive and posed no threat. DAZZLING PROSE steadied behind horses shortly after the start, and never factored. WELLWEST set the pace for six
furlongs, and faltered through the stretch on his left lead. LOOKIN FOREVER trailed throughout and showed nothing. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LAHINCH settled off the battling trio up front, moved up along the rail approaching the stretch, headed NEW YORK'S FINEST from the inside with a furlong
remaining and edged away. NEW YORK'S FINEST got bumped by CABLE CHANNEL at the start, went up inside to grab the lead inside WHAT'S INSIDE
and FACTORINO, shook loose in the two-path after three-eighths of a mile, yielded to the winner in mid stretch and ran on second best. CABLE CHANNEL
broke out bumping NEW YORK'S FINEST at the start, stayed on the fence outrun to the stretch, and rallied mildly. WHAT'S INSIDE pressed the early pace
between horses, could not stay with NEW YORK'S FINEST turning for home and weakened in the four-path. JUST THE FACTS was no factor inside.
TENACITY ZIP was outsprinted to the stretch two then three wide, and made no headway on the far outside. FACTORINO pressed the early pace three
wide, and was finished midway on the turn.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM saved ground unhurried to the far turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and wore down the leaders from
outside in the final yards. TRAPPEZOID was four wide prompting the early pace, rallied in the three-path to take over from outside after six furlongs, drew
clear through upper stretch but could not hold on. CANDY COVE prompted the pace near the three-path, had aim coming off the far turn, but was
outfinished between the top two on the wrong lead. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was keyed up inside and steadied along near the seven-eighths pole, lacked
room on the rail approaching the stretch and lost position, moved to the two-path for the drive and rallied mildly. LOVE NEST was three wide in the second
flight to the far turn, came five wide into the lane and gained mildly without threatening on his left lead. SHE TAKES HEART set the pace inside for six
furlongs, and faded through the stretch. DISCREET HEAT was no factor two wide. THE ROBERT was taken out widest in the five-path leaving the first turn,
stayed well out in the track and was through after six furlongs.
