Footnotes
QUIET DAWN was bumped at the start, drafted behind the leaders, moved up three wide on the turn, was clear by the quarter and increased the advantage
as best. DIXIE MOLL stayed toward the back, came widest into the stretch and drifted out and closed with good energy. REWARDED tracked at the rail and
held third down the stretch. SAMOA bumped a foe at the start, took over on the first turn, lost the lead near the quarter and faded late. SPECIAL
CONQUEST raced inside well of the pace, split horses moving into the turn,then came up one paced late. INCA PRINCESS was urged on the far turn but
lacked the needed rally in the lane. BOOMERANG BABY broke outward, pressed the lead on the backstretch and was empty in the lane. LOYAL broke
outward, was widest on the backstretch and was no threat.

DRAMA RUN saved ground throughout, got through and drove clear. ENTRUSTED had a tardy break outside with a wide run out of the turn and rallied
along for place. FORT MARSH speed to the front, held well to stretch but faltered late. SHE'S NO DRAMA saved ground, challenged late stretch but came
up empty in late stages. LEMON DROP TWIST saved ground to stretch, angled out with no late gain. DON'T STOP MARIA raced all out from turn with
nothing to offer in the drive. HEY HEY no speed to the stretch, never a real threat in the drive. APPEALING JULIA chased from outside to the stretch but
faded back late. SWEET BRYNLIE steadied along twice inside to the turn with no real chance.

Footnotes
MY PAL DAL unhurried to the turn inside, angled out for the drive and came flying late to be up in time. SIETE LEGUAS dueled early, took over into stretch,
looked home free but was run down right on the wire. BOOGIE MAN sharp break outside, dueled briefly, three wide turn while mildly late. INGENICO tried to
keep up inside to turn, out of gas and faded. SARDONIC SMILE never a threat well off rail. LUCKY ROMEO terrible start, no chanve thereafter. FLATOUT
BROKE speed inside, dueled to turn, with a steady fade from there.

Footnotes
MISHAWAKA was three wide on the first turn, stalked outside on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, rallied and hit the front at the eight pole
drawing clear. DRAYKE'S CHANNEL broke in and bumped a foe at the start, led, lost the lead at the eighth pole but was second best. CROWN THE
PRINCE unhurried to the stretch, came very wide into the lane and closed well. PRICE TO PAY raced mid pack, bumped a foe nearing the far turn, and
leveled out at the sixteenth while holding fourth. GRAY NAY was bumped while mid pack nearing the far turn and leveled out in the lane. NOBLE
COMPANION pressed the leader outside early and faltered in the stretch. HE'S RECKLESS was bumped hard at the start and posed no threat. JUST GUN
IT was not a factor. BRISKY chased the pace while on the rail and faded on the far turn. GOOD FORM stayed way back early and gained some position
late. ASPHALT contended to the far turn and dropped back from between horses. BULLETPROOF KITTEN raced mid pack early, but dropped back before
the far turn.

AIKEN FOR GOLD took the five path throufh the first turn, stayed wide while stalking the leaders, raced in the three path to the top of the turn and drew
clear. ROBOTRON was last of a compact field, moved up on the turn to challenge a foe in a place duel from the outside and managed to get up late.
GREEN GARNET pressed the leader from outside and dueled a foe for place, led inside but just failed to hold on. MUSHABOOM contended to the turn, lost
position coming widest into the stretch and regained position late. MY LADY DOWRY came up the rail nearing the turn, dropped back, re-rallied, split horses
on the turn, and finished with energy. SKIP AND A HOP broke inward, was urged to straighten out, led at the rail and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
SISTER'S CREED sprinted to the lead while well handled, stayed clear into the stretch and held sway to the wire. JERSEY BOUNCE chased winner
throughout while clearly best of the rest to the wire. MEP off tardy, rallied outside and ran on for show spot late. FLAT OUT BEAUTY off a beat slow while
never a real menace from outside in the stretch. LOVELY LADY LINDA chased inside to turn and gave way readily in the stretch run. POWER BANKER
never menaced from well off rail throughout.
