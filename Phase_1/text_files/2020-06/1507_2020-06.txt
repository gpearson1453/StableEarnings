Footnotes
GRAETZ remained forwardly placed after an alert getaway, stalked the pacesetter from the two path, a bit too far back to apply any serious pressure on that
rival, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths marker as the leader began to shake free, settled onto the head of the stretch and was turned loose, gained
ground readily once beyond the eighth pole, enough so as to strike the front about a sixteenth later, maintained her energy and kicked clear. LOVE ME
TOMORROW rushed up to the front end after breaking in midpack, cut over to the hedge with the advantage, carved out the pace rated and facing only the
mildest of pressure from the primary pursuer, that being the top one, extended the margin to its greatest as the half was being completed, made it to the
general area of the three-sixteenths pole and got turned loose, was overhauled by the winner with approximately a sixteenth remaining, stayed on to
salvage second. FUSI chased the the pace from path three, well rated at first, was switched over to stronger handling a short distance from the quarter pole,
stepped into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch, barely made it to the wire in time to preserve the show. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH off the inside
throughout, travelled three to four wide on the turn, came under a drive turning into the lane, fanned out into path five for the best of racing clearance,
displayed some late foot, missed out on third. DREAM CHASING in with initial step after tossing her head just as the field was about to be sent off the
running, was gathered by the pilot, tracked the front runners from along the hedge, slipped outward and managed to shoe-horn itself into the two path
midway on the turn, was still in it heading home, made no headway during the stretch run. PLINK FREUD four wide both at the top of the turn and at the top
of the stretch, launched no bids. GRINGOTTS three wide onto the turn, was sent out into path four exiting it, came up empty. CEMETERY V I P saved
ground for nearly a half, angled three wide entering the lane, had no offering. MIDNIGHT BANKER went over to the hedge after the start, backed away
before the half had been rattled off, then was allowed to fade away even further from midstretch while being coaxed along.

Footnotes
INSIDE INFO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand from the three path under some pressure from a pair, tucked inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail.
MINE THE COIN prompted the pace early on from the four path before remaining in hand and dropping back tucked to the two path through the turn,
remained on hold until set down angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. MANDATORY PAYOUT inside
briefly after the start, tipped out to chase three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and closed well
to secure the show honors in the very last jump. LARCENY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and ran on for the last major share just getting nosed for the show honors. MENTAL MODEL
brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five then four wide from mid pack, advanced through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. OUR STORMIN NORMAN five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to
three wide through the turn advancing to apply pressure to the front, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened.
IMPLIED VOLATILITY broke in at the start bumping OUR AMERICAN STAR, chased three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went five wide into
upper stretch and tired. OUR AMERICAN STAR bumped at the start by IMPLIED VOLATILITY, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. COMBAT RIBBON three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. CHUCKLES chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn,
got placed to a protective hold midway on the turn, was eased up and guided outside before being pulled up in upper stretch, then got escorted by pony
briefly before being walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MACHO BOY established control in short order, was rated showing the way on a loosely-contested advantage, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail,
waited until settled in at the head of the stretch before getting asked for more, even though some of his closest pursuers were already under some
encouragement themselves, gradually extended the margin, kept busy to the end. BRUNATE made contact with FROZEN ACCOUNT after bobbling to the
outside at the start, departed the backstretch from the four path, got cued up challenging in earnest entering the stretch, lugged in slightly a few jumps later,
proved no match while clear of the others for the place. IMPERIO D travelled three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail,
finished a non-threatening third. APEX PREDATOR chased the pace from the two path, between rivals for much of the time, got put to a drive prior to
spinning into the lane, gave way. TALESPIN hustled from the gate, wound up towards the back of the pack nonetheless, cut over to the rail before arriving
at the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed put on the bend, tipped out path two stepping into the lane, had some gain, but all done without impact.
FREUDIAN ANALYST spotted on the inside route on the turn, lacked the needed response. UNBRIDLED JOHN bumped lightly with CARNEGIE SONG in
the shadow of the starting gate, raced from path two on the turn, went into the stretch, made no impact. FROZEN ACCOUNT bumped right after the field
had been sent on its way, was three wide onto the turn and sent out five wide exiting it, had no offering. BROADWAY JOE took up position in midpack, was
in path two midpoint on the turn, got moved out for the drive, eventually wandering into path seven all the while not rallying. MARINER QUI strung out four
wide on the turn, was through by the quarter pole. CARNEGIE SONG bumped with UNBRIDLED JOHN after coming out slightly at the start, stepped onto
the turn from the three path, shifted out about six wide racing down the lane, never made its presence felt. STREET DANCE two wide in midpack, folded.

Footnotes
NOBLE THOUGHT tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced in concert with
the field on the once clear top pair near the quarter pole, angled four wide at that station, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then inched
away late on to the finish. WILLING TO SPEED coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went four
then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, took over command near the eighth pole, dug in coming inwards despite correction to the two path
and was displaced near the sixteenth marker, then ran on to safely preserve the place honors. RAPT two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. ABIDING STAR established the front and showed the way early on
just off the inside, had SIDING SPRING range up outside with six furlongs remaining and picked up the pace considerably widening away as a tandem from
the rest of the field, remained well ahead as a team through the far turn under light coaxing tucked inside from the half mile pole, had the rest of the field
take closer order and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front near the eighth pole and weakened through to the finish. MUSICAL HEART
inside early, tipped to the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response. SIDING SPRING forwardly placed three wide early on, advanced to knock heads with six furlongs
remaining and widened away as a pair with ABIDING STAR down the remainder of the backstretch and into the far turn from the rest of the field, had the
field take closer order swiftly near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch in the midst of getting shaken off and overwhelmed and weakened
through to the finish. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter and half times were corrected.

Footnotes
SARATOGA LOVE grabbed the top shortly after brushing with LEYTE in the shadow of the starting gate, led the others while pulling quite noticeably on the
bit, edged away during the final stages of the run around the bend, was switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, with
that action being when the previously-mentioned pulling ceased, left the eight pole in possession of her largest advantage, saw the runner up closing in
rapidly in the final furlong but was able to hold sway. QUANTITATIVBREEZIN corrected after coming in at the start, was unhurried while taking up the chase
from the two path in midpack, got cued spinning to the outside as the second split was about to be posted, completed the maneuver in the neighborhood of
path five, began to gain ground in chunks, lugged in twice in the final sixteenth, but with that erratic display most probably not having cost her the decision.
FRENCHIE FROU FROU pinched at the start, made it over to the hedge by the top of the turn, sat there towards the back of the pack, was fanned out
towards path six from upper to midstretch, rallied well enough to be along for the show. MAGICAL ROMANCE three wide entering the turn, was moved out
four wide exiting it, flattened out. SANDRA'S MINE a forward factor three wide for the opening half, gave way. EMPRESS LUCIANA guided over to the
inside prior to leaving the backstretch, got angled out seven wide during the initial portion of the stretch, made no headway. LUZMARIA bobbled after
brushing with another shortly after the start, went on to pursue the pace from the two path, between rivals for a good portion of the opening half, arrived into
the lane and backed away. LEYTE made light contact LUZMARIA after bobbling at the start, kept an eye on the winner from the pocket, was let out a notch
at the five-sixteenths marker, failed to respond much, faltered down the stretch. KEYPIT sent over to the hedge at the half mile pole, went on to save ground
to no avail. DEJA RACONTE prompted the top from from the two path, going about the task from between rivals on the turn, stepped into the lane and
folded.

MAKINGCENTS coaxed from the gate, vied from the two path briefly with a pair before shaking away to safe command in tandem with the runner up, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, and steadily shook clear, swung just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear
under a drive and was kept to task to the finish. SINGULAR SENSATION vied three to four wide down the backstretch before prompting the aforementioned
foe from the outside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one, dug in weakening late and just held on for the place honors. PRINCESS PINKY three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages just missing for the place honors. LEM ME HAVE
IT chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position. FIRST DAWN chased three to
four wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. OK HONEY forwardly placed five paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
FAST GETAWAY away well, disputed the pace from along the inside on the backstretch, took back as HUSHION was himself moved over to the hedge at
the top of the turn, was forced to draft behind the aforementioned rival beginning from the five-sixteenths marker, boxed in traffic, found room to shift course
to the outside coming up to the head of the stretch and deftly angled three wide onto it, kicked into its best when given his cue, out-fighting a twosome to the
left to emerge at the eighth pole in charge, edged away, kept to some urging to the end. BOURBON MISSION gently pinched at the start, was along the
inside by the conclusion of the backstretch, scurried into contention with a sustained run along the hedge, maintained the momentum getting steered out six
wide in upper stretch, becoming the widest of all, had a good finish down the center of the course to garner the place. DOWSE'S BEACH pressed the issue
from along the outside, worked out a tuck into path two at the half mile pole, kept the pressure on, challenged for the front end from between foes from
upper to midstretch, weakened into the show slot. ROYAL ASSET rode the hedge, was set down cutting the corner into the stretch, tipped out approximately
three wide in the final furlong,ventured onward with a mild response for the last major check. BUSTIN SHOUT came in at the start, raced at a considerable
distance from off the inside, going about the turn towards the four path and then swinging five wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response. VALMONT
strung out three wide on the turn, came up empty. DISCRETIONARY MARQ in range two wide from between opponents, gave way. HUSHION argued for
control , cut over to the inside at the top of the turn, was put to the test by a pair of rivals to the outside at the head of the stretch, succumbed by the furlong
grounds then steadily backed away. OUTRAGEOUS BET seen bobbling soon after the start, got guided over to the inside, went on to save ground to no
avail.

CELTIC STRIKER coaxed from the gate, established the front from the get go and showed the way six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
the rider keeping a close eye peering behind him several times on his only rival, had SONNEMAN advance and latch on briefly to his inside near the
nine-sixteenths and was given a notch tucked four wide into the turn, shook away through the bend steadily, went five to six wide into upper stretch roused
briefly, got shown an off side stick and then a near sided stick going clear through the stretch to the finish and was geared down through the final sixteenth.
SONNEMAN coaxed from the gate, couldn't match the early foot of his rival and chased six to seven paths off the inside early on before tucking to the four
path with six furlongs to run, advanced inside of the leader to latch on at the nine-sixteenths briefly before being shaken off into the far turn and tucked to the
two path, came under light coaxing at the half mile pole before coming under an off sided stick and a light drive seven-sixteenths from home, continued to
get steadily shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and was eased through the final furlong when unable to make
headway.

Footnotes
SILKY BLUE secured a forward position proceeding along the backstretch, departed it having successfully tucked into the two path, was reserved keeping
watch on the ongoing pace dispute going on only a short distance up ahead, tipped one path wider heading home, closed in on the ones to catch, began the
final furlong as one of the middle members of a four-way scramble for the top, emerged a sixteenth down the road engaged one on one with the second
place finisher, fought on gamely to narrowly win. FRESCO fell back towards midpack after breaking a length the fastest, moved inward and went on to take
up the chase from the two path on the turn, swung into action by swinging four wide into the lane, straightened away and rushed up to the front runners, left
the eighth pole vying as outermost of a quartet for the top, had that battle morph into a duel with the winner from the sixteenth onward, vied with vigour to
the end but came up the vanquished one. DANCING KIKI underwent a two wide pursuit on the bend, angled five wide into the lane, came home with good
energy rallying for third. UNICORN SALLY took the inside route until the quarter pole, was maneuvered out into path six from upper to midlane becoming
the widest of all, mustered up a mild response thereafter for the final significant slice of the purse. TOWERING GAZE argued for control from along the
inside, was put to a drive striking the quarter pole, saw the top twosome close in dangerously during the ensuing furlong, igniting a four-membered fight for
the top by the eighth pole, relinquished, participated for another sixteenth then weakened. HELENE JACQUELINE sparred for the top from the two path, got
turned loose turning into the stretch, did battle from between opponents from midlane until the vicinity of the sixteenth pole before tiring. GO FISH guided
over into the pocket well before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, got roused cutting the corner into the stretch, faltered. BANKERS DAUGHTER
sent over to the hedge at the half mile pole, tipped into the two path for entrance into the stretch, backed away. MONIFICENT two to three wide on the turn,
was more the latter stepping into the stretch, never reached a contending position. SHES EUPHORIC sprung from the gate somewhat awkwardly after
breaking to the outside with her initial step, was mostly along the hedge heading for the half mile pole, shifted into the three path from that station to
midpoint on the turn, went into the lane and wound up trailing throughout.
