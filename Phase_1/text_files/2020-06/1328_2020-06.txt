Footnotes
SHARM EL SHEIKH cleared inside around the first turn, rated along through an even pace, and was driving on his left lead to stay well in command. TIPSY
KITTEN waited behind horses on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, swapped late to his correct lead and was up for second. CASH CALL KITTEN
lagged well back early, advanced with a big move three wide going into the far turn, loomed a threat outside the pacesetter into the lane, but flattened out on
his left lead. SON OF OAHU was strung out four wide early, advanced three wide leaving the far turn, and could not sustain the rally. KEEP QUIET (FR)
broke a bit awkwardly, moved up three wide nearing the stretch, and made no further gains. GREAT KAHUNA was slow into stride, came four to five wide at
the top of the lane, and lacked a solid bid. GOSILENTLY was four wide on the first turn, and tired after six furlongs. DAKOTA'S DUDE steadied and lost
position soon after completing a quarter-mile, continued inside, took an awkward step early on the far turn and dropped far back, then showed some late
interest. BASELINE came off the rail and steadied behind horses entering the first turn, and tired after a half-mile. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT prompted the pace
outside the winner for six furlongs, and gave way. TOTONO was finished early inside. DRIVEN BY THUNDER steadied in the three-path entering the first
turn, and was done before reaching the stretch. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GREAT KAHUNA AGAINST TIPSY KITTEN ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ESPIA came off the inside midway on the turn, rallied three wide through the lane, caught MURRAY'S BAR from outside a sixteenth out, and held on late.
MY LIBERTY got bumped by BOURRE' TRICK and steadied back soon after the start, moved out rallying in upper stretch, and finished fastest outside the
winner. MURRAY'S BAR (IRE) sped clear early, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and weakened late inside the top two. BOURRE' TRICK bumped
with GABRIELLA SUNSHINE after the start, then bumped with MY LIBERTY soon after, chased two to three wide and had no final bid. EL GUAPO was
bumped between ESPIA and LITTLE NESSO at the start, chased inside to the stretch and faded. LITTLE NESSO bumped with EL GUAPO at the start, and
failed to menace. TESTIFIED dropped back early despite urging, and remained outrun. DOWNTOWN DOC BROWN bumped with GABRIELLA SUNSHINE
twice at the start, raced wide and never reached contention. GABRIELLA SUNSHINE bumped with DOWNTOWN DOC BROWN twice at the start, and was
outrun in the two-path.

Footnotes
VARSOVIA moved fast to join the leaders four wide after a half-mile, pulled clear into the stretch, drifted out under a drive and swapped back to her left lead
late. TRANS MISSISSIPPI steadied inside midway up the backstretch, shifted four wide approaching the lane, and rallied to best the others while not a
threat to the winner. LUXE DIAMOND steadied in the three-path as the winner went by to her outside late on the turn, and lacked a solid bid on the wrong
lead. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN lunged and hit the left side of the gate at the start, came five wide off the turn and improved mildly.
ANOTHERSONGNDANCE was forwardly placed to the stretch, and tired. MISS MAC broke slowly and was no factor. LOOKING FOR MORE broke
outward, dropped back early and remained well back. DISTINCTLY SASSY bumped with QUEEN KANTHAROS at the start, and faded after a half. QUEEN
KANTHAROS bumped with DISTINCTLY SASSY at the start, set the pace inside, and tired into the stretch.

Footnotes
SMELL OF ROSES bumped with STUCK WITH YOU at the start, took over outside HARD COUNT before going a quarter-mile, was under a stout hold
entering the backstretch and briefly relinquished command to RUSSIAN WINE, regained the lead still under restraint after a half, opened up around the far
turn in the two-path and remained clear hand urged. BAHAMIAN PARK saved ground advancing on the far turn, moved out for the drive and finished
willingly. BARBIE'S KING raced in the second flight for six furlongs, swung to the far outside turning for home and rallied for a share. HARD COUNT broke
alertly and led early, deferred to SMELL OF ROSES on the first turn, tracked inside to the lane, and faded on the fence. I STAND CORRECTED saved
ground early, came four wide off the far turn and made no headway. RUSSIAN WINE vied for command outside SMELL OF ROSES up the backstretch,
could not match strides into the far turn, and faded after six furlongs. SNORING BARTH was never prominent. DUELLIST was not a factor. BEINFUN was
four wide on the first turn, and retired early. OLE MOLE was three wide early, and faltered in the four-path on the far turn. STUCK WITH YOU took the worst
of a bump with SMELL OF ROSES and steadied back at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
DREAM D'ORO brushed the right side of the gate and SEMPER FI while away alertly, raced four wide in range for a half-mile, rallied steadily and
overhauled IRISH PAUL a sixteenth out, and drew clear. IRISH PAUL sped to the front at once, rated along clear in the two-path for a half, got set down at
the top of the stretch, yielded to the winner late and held for the place. SEMPER FI brushed with DREAM D'ORO at the start, raced in the two-path, and was
along for the show while not a threat. SILVER MAKER was outrun early four wide, and could not gain appreciably on the far outside. TEN MILES HIGH
chased outside IRISH PAUL to the stretch, and weakened on the wrong lead. STARSHIP EMPIRE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LORD ADARE set the early pace hounded from outside by AWESOME ACTION, shook clear in the two-path after a half-mile, and was all out to hang on
late. LONDON WEREWOLF tracked outside the battling leaders into the turn, rallied willingly and was getting to the winner late. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA
had a ground-saving trip, and could not gain late. QUASAR MOON was outrun to the stretch inside, and passed tired horses. AWESOME ACTION got
bumped by SHAKEM N BREAKEM at the start, pressed the pace outside LORD ADARE, and faded steadily after a half. SHAKEM N BREAKEM broke in
bumping AWESOME ACTION, was outsprinted early, and made no headway on the far outside. KINGSVILLE was driven three wide on the turn, and had no
response.

Footnotes
MS BIG SPRING pressed TIPSY AGAIN from inside before letting her go into the turn, moved out to take another run after a half-mile, wrested command
from outside in upper stretch, and was driving to secure the decision. NAPA RULES bobbled a stride from the gate and bumped with SENSE A MILLION,
advanced four wide off the turn, and finished with good courage between horses. SENSE A MILLION got bumped by NAPA RULES and steadied back at
the start, lagged well back for a half, came wide for the drive and gained gradually outside the top two. FAST VENEZUELA tracked three wide to the stretch,
and lacked the needed response. CHARGE ACCOUNT faded inside after a half. TIPSY AGAIN vied outside MS BIG SPRING early, cleared off and moved
inside around the turn, and weakened approaching the furlong grounds. PROBABLY GRACE broke open the gate prior to the start, drifted wide dropping far
back after a half, was eased up through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GRAND JOURNEY stayed in range for six furlongs while mostly three wide, shifted further out being roused approaching the stretch, reached the front
outside the leaders near the eighth-pole and powered clear. BIG AGENDA saved ground on the turns, moved out for the drive, and finished gamely between
horses in the five-path to get up for the place. BIRD'S EYE VIEW prompted the pace outside, challenged between horses three wide after six furlongs, and
was outkicked. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) was well back inside to the far turn, shifted out in the stretch and gained mildly in the six-path. THUNDER RIDE
controlled a moderate early pace inside, faced a host of challenges turning for home, and weakened on the rail. HIGH NOON RIDER was two wide to the far
turn, and could not gain widest through the late stages. GOLDEN DECISION saved ground on hold behind the leaders to the far turn, secured room with a
brief bid in the two-path between horses at the top of the lane, but gave way through the furlong grounds.

INTER MIAMI pressed the early pace, poked a head in front outside FAST LOADED and GOLDMINE CAT five-sixteenths out, drew clear into the lane and
held under pressure. GEMO raced four then five wide around the turn, and rallied outside for the place. MONEY RIDE saved ground being scrubbed along
through the turn, had the two-path with aim into the lane, and weakened slightly late. MEYER got brushed and pushed out by WITH A BIT OF LUCK at the
start, trailed inside on the turn despite urging, moved out in upper stretch and passed only tired horses. GOLDMINE CAT pressed the early pace between
horses, and began to give way late on the turn. FAST LOADED contested the pace inside rivals for nearly a half-mile, and shortened stride through the lane
on the wrong lead. RICKI TICKI TAFFI was finished early two wide. WITH A BIT OF LUCK broke out brushing and pushing out MEYER, tracked four wide to
the turn, and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
MEADOW BEAUTY unseated the rider and was loose in the chute for a few moments prior to loading, broke alertly and set a pressured early pace inside,
shook clear approaching the stretch, drifted about while swapping leads greenly through the last furlong, and held on. LADY BOSS advanced four wide off
the turn, loomed a threat outside the winner in mid stretch, swapped leads greenly and hesitated for an instant past the furlong marker, and hung. SHE'S
JUST QUALITY was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and rallied for a share. PRINCESS CORO tucked in saving ground behind the leaders for
three-eighths of a mile, and lacked the needed closing bid on the rail. THRILL tossed her head unruly through the opening strides, came five wide off the
turn and improved position on the far outside. FUDDLED (IRE) pressed the pace three wide, and weakened in the stretch. HUMOR ME DIXIE hit the right
side of the gate at the start, came four wide off the turn and posed no threat. MUDSLIDE WICKED pressed the early pace outside MEADOW BEAUTY, and
gave way after three furlongs. SAUCY TUNE stutter-stepped out of the gate and was slowest away, and remained well back. G T'S BLUE SQUALL lagged
far back to the stretch, and made no impact. THEARTOFCOMPROMISE showed brief speed two wide, and retreated. MATRACA hopped at the start and
was off tardily, and was far back throughout.
