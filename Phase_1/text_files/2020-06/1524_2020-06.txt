Footnotes
DIAL EM IN tracked leaders off the inside, advanced three wide to challenge turning for home, engaged the leader past the furlong marker, wore that rival
down under firm handling. FANCY MALLORY broke well, narrowly set the pace closest to the inside, shook off the other speed into the stretch, drifted out
when the winner came alongside just inside the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. PALMETTOVOWMENOT broke
back, one paced toward the inside, along for the show while continuing inside, no match for the top two. QUIET TRIP broke alertly, pressed the runner up
from the outside for three furlongs and began to weaken. COOL DEAL broke a bit awkward, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. KHALEESI'S GIFT
lacked speed, got out late in the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
HALF PIPE vied early while between foes, dueled the middle half, fell back off the issue turning for home, rebid from the outside, edged clear late under
steady handling. ROYAL GALAXY stalked the first flight for five furlongs, took over from the outside far turn, clear into the stretch, could not repel the winner
late, remained clear for the place. DRAX last to leave, trailed while saving ground, improved while continuing along the inside the third quarter, moved out
slightly for the drive, slowly getting to the top two late. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS void of speed, displayed a mild amount of late interest, far clear of the
others. OUR BUCKET LIST set or forced the pace for almost five furlongs and stopped. DREAM TWISTER vied early three wide, continued to race within
striking distance outside, four path turning for home, stopped. STARVICTORY was finished early, far back.

PAPER DOLL broke alertly, raced with the pace for three furlongs, fell off the leaders turning for home, rebid between rivals past the furlong marker, kicked
strongly clear. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY lacked early speed while in hand, moved closer four wide exiting the turn, proved no match for the winner, held sway
for the place. RED RED WINE hopped at the start to be away slowly, moved up soon after to contest the issue three wide into the turn, continued in a
forward position through the bend, dueled into the stretch, weakened a bit the final furlong but managed to save the show. JAMMINFORMEL away in good
order, set or forced the pace for a half along the inside, weakened the final furlong. LIL' SISTER LOU void of speed, passed tiring rivals. LIL MS BOSSY
PANTS was finished early. MINE MINE in mid pack in the early going, began a steady fade after a quarter.

Footnotes
HANDSOME GIRL dueled up front into the first turn along the inside, shook clear onto the backstretch, continued to show the way by daylight into the far
turn, let out a notch into the stretch, held the runner up at bay late under steady handling. ROYAL ALEXANDRA settled in the second flight early, moved out
into the far turn, roused in the four path entering the stretch, some gain on the winner inside the furlong marker but was held at bay late. TEMPLE SHADOW
dueled early outside the winner, chased that one up the backstretch and through the final turn, proved no match in the drive nor could she match strides with
the runner up, narrowly saved the show. ZAO'S DREAMS last away, trailed early, improved into the far turn, slowly gaining show with some mild late
interest. HAVINFUNYET remained always back. TAMARIU was through early, finished far back.

Footnotes
GRILLIN broke with the leaders, allowed that group to go before a furlong, chased that first flight through the turn, came on the outside for the drive,
challenged outside with less than a furlong remaining, wore that rival down to edge clear. LUCKY PRIORITY broke in good order, with the pace outside,
vied three wide through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, responded when confronted by the winner inside the furlong grounds then could not keep up
late, clearly second best. MY BABY BELE in the second flight off the inside, came four wide out of the turn when moving closer, could do little with the top
two the final furlong, lasted for the show. FLASH ANNIE last to leave, void of any early foot, two path into the lane, steered out a bit, lodged a belated rally to
be gaining for the show. GEAUX GOLDEN vied up front between horses in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the turn inside the runner up,
weakened in the drive. SUSURRO flashed brief speed along the inside and faltered. IFITSMEANTTOBE remained always back. K ONE COMET was
finished early. HALF MILE SPLIT UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
TUPELO HON E four wide when unhurried into the first turn, continued outside, four wide when beginning to move into the far turn, challenged three wide
turning for home, long duel, fully extended to prove narrowly best. ROMAN JEWELS dueled up front off the inside, continued to contest the issue while
between rivals through the second turn, extended duel inside the winner stretch, proved stubborn to the end. CATCAKE with the early pace, fell back the
middle half while firmly in hand, behind traffic in the second turn, steered out for the drive, no match top two final furlong, well clear of the others.
ORTHODRIVE broke out and a bit tardy, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SEE SASSY RUN stalked the leaders
off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide through the final turn, faltered in the drive. QUEEN GIGI vied up front for five furlongs along the inside and
gave way.

Footnotes
ELITE RUNNER settled in the second flight early off the inside, asked in the turn while continuing off the inside, finished full of run late to win going away.
SPARKY SPARKLES broke on top, dueled up front out in the strip, disposed of the other speed turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, proved no
match for the winner late, held the place. TIN ROOF RUSTED lacked speed while racing outside, roused four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be
getting to the runner up. SONG N A CAT settled in early mid pack while between horses, continued between rivals into the lane, went evenly to the wire in
lacking a closing response. DOMINANTE broke back, trailed for a half, steered out widest for the drive and improved position with some mild, belated
interest. PRAYER BOY broke a step slow, made little impact in failing to menace. JADE STAR fell back after the start to be void of speed, moved out, was
five wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE broke in good order, dueled inside the runner up into and through the
turn, had little left for the drive. RAZORBACK RED forwardly placed early inside, lost action along the rail entering the turn, fell back then continued to fade
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY vied up front while between foes from the start, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, continued between horses while drifting
slightly past the furlong marker, dug in late to narrowly prevail. BIG EM C also with the pace from the start, saved ground through the turn, raced on equal
terms inside the winner past midstretch to the wire, narrowly missed while outkicked in the final strides. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR last away of the small group,
with the pace outside the top two, carried out slightly by the drifting winner inside the furlong grounds, first to blink. RHETT N' SCARLETT fell back to trail
soon after the start and was never involved.

Footnotes
SUNSET SEVEN took control after the start, clear before a quarter, vied through the turn closest to the inside narrowly showed the way out of the turn,
shook clear when straightened for home, maintained a daylight advantage the final furlong while under firm handling. ALEX'S TURN closest to the early
leader, challenged between foes through the turn, could not keep up the winner through the stretch, remained clear for the place. CAJUN DUDE in the
second flight while outside, four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally midtrack to garner the show. ZYPTO in the second flight along the inside, saved
ground through the turn, evenly drive. KING BANDIT broke alertly, was forwardly placed outside, advanced to contest the issue three wide outside the top
two through the turn, weakened in the drive. BEAUTY BOY off a step slow, moved up to mid pack and went one paced throughout. JUST KISSING BUCK
lacked speed, four wide into the turn, remained back. PAPA'S BIG BOY veered out start, fell back, not a factor. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS broke back, was
always outrun.
