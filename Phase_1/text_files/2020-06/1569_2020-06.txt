Footnotes
SWEET YARE N DIRA showed rail speed early, opened up a clear advantage into the turn, maintained that edge until late stretch, the margin diminishing
somewhat but the result never in doubt. BELLA FIGURA chased three to four wide around the turn, closing well in the final eighth to nail down the place
spot. CLOSE IMAGE chased along the inside, rallied nicely into second as the field turned for home but failed to hold off a closer, settling for the show.
SUBZERO PLUS broke in and bumped a rival at the start, settled in mid pack, ranged up three wide on the turn but was outfinished in the final stages.
GIMBALA was bumped off stride at the start, recovered to stalk the leader early but lost contact with that one by the turn and fell back amongst closers
midway on the bend, running evenly in the stretch. AFLEET CONNECTION was far back early and never reached contention.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN VINNIE settled in midpack, ranged up four to five wide into contention by as they turned for home, continued his bid resolutely and won a head
bob to get the victory. KILKENNY PROSPECT sat a perfect trip in behind dueling leaders, angled out to the three path turning for home and drove by the
spent speed by the sixteenth pole, only to be nailed late by a rival. GIVE ME AN EYE was way back early, began to pick it up midway on the turn and closed
with a huge rush in the final stages to garner the show prize. FIRMLY GROUNDED led quickly but was taken on by a rival and dueled outside that one
around the turn, had a clear advantage in upper stretch but was headed by the sixteenth pole, giving up positions late. TORAH'S BLESSING was off the
pace, commenced a rally up the inside into the turn, came off the rail turning for home, dropped back to the fence by the eighth pole and continued to close
willingly. METADATA sat mid pack early, was in range while three to four wide on the turn, but could only run evenly down the lane outfinished by a number
of rivals. BREAD CRUMBS was far back early, closing mildly to catch up to the back of the pack down the lane. BLUE FORESTER moved up inside to
press the early leader, dueled around the turn, still a clear second in upper stretch but faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TRUEBELIEVE chased outside, came into range while three to four wide by the quarter pole, dipped inside in upper stretch, off the rail and splitting rivals in
the final seventy yards to be up in time. PINKY DUDE was between rivals and chasing backstretch, had dead aim on the pacesetter in upper stretch and got
by that one late, only to have the winner close better to his inside nearing the finish. STREET SILENCE showed speed, was stalked and then challenged by
a rival around the bend, shook clear in upper stretch but was headed at the seventy yard pole by the winner and lost the place spot late. TRAPPEZE
ARTIST stalked the early leader, pressed that one around the turn but drifted out as they turned for home and faded inside the sixteenth pole while in the six
path. CRAFTY CONQUEST was three wide chasing early, stayed three to four wide around the turn in contention but had nothing left for the stretch drive,
dropping back. LAKESIDE PARK hit the side of the gate hard at the start falling far back, mildly rallied into the turn but had nothing left for the stretch.
HUSHIN' RUSSIAN was inside chasing into the turn, but dropped back suddenly mid turn and never recovered.

Footnotes
FOUR ACES HIGH sprinted clear, shook off a couple of challengers through the turn and upper stretch, then dug in stubbornly to keep safe a late closing
rival. BETTER BOOGIE was in mid pack early, moved up two to four wide on the turn and fanned out into the six path turning for home, continued to rally
and had dead aim on the winner inside the final eighth but could not get by. BOKERMIN chased early, came off the inside late turn and upper stretch, kept
in by the eventual place finisher but closed doggedly outside once that one went by. STERLING ICE in mid pack backstretch, rallied up the fence on the turn
and down the lane to best the balance for a minor award. MISTER OAKLEY in the two path stalking the leader, stayed in contention until mid stretch but
wilted in the final stages. BORN TO BE KING trailed the field into the stretch, swung out to the five or six path turning for home and passed rivals while
giving his rider a tough time, lugging in. HOMELANDER was three wide stalking the pace under restraint, stayed in range until mid stretch when dropping
back. KING OF GYPSIES off the pace, only able to mildly rally past one tired foe late. MARITIME MAGIC had a very awkward start and fell off the pace,
never entering contention.

Footnotes
GOSPEL WAY chased the two duelers along the inside, angled out in upper stretch and had the leader in his sights, wearing that one down in the final forty
yards. DANCING DRAGON was inside pressed until opening a clear lead in upper stretch, but was caught by the winner in the final forty yards.
GREYSHOTT had the first call but quickly fell back to mid pack along the rail, angled out mid turn and was roused by the rider to rally in the four path down
the lane into the show spot. THREE MILE LIMIT chased outside the winner on the turn, fell back into the stretch but was gathered up by the rider and
re-rallied nicely in the final furlong for a minor award. DECIMATOR rallied along the inside from off the pace around the turn and down the lane, flashing
good energy throughout once started up. FOREST SURVIVOR pressed the early leader, dueled outside that rival around the turn, began to drop back
turning for home and faded from there. DOWNLOAD was off the pace and did not enter contention. LIARS CLUB hesitated at the start and broke in, falling
well off the pace and never a factor.

Footnotes
SPEEDY HANS closed into range while two to three wide on the turn, loomed dangerous outside the two leaders in upper stretch and drove to the front by
the sixteenth pole, inching away late under a vigorous ride. SPEEDY MOONLITE drove up between rivals to get the early lead, dueled a pace buddy into
submission by the upper stretch but couldn't hold the winner late, giving way grudgingly inside the final sixteenth. LAST AMERICAN EXIT was inside trying
for the front when steadied out and falling back to mid pack by the half mile pole, regrouped and rallied up the inside down the stretch, just missing the place
spot late. BEND IN THE RIVER was two to three wide for the lead early, pressed the leader on the turn and still in contention to the eighth pole, fading in the
final stages. IMPRESSIVE SPEED was pinched back in the early going when a scramble developed for the lead, dropped back to mid pack, rallied two to
three wide on the turn and continued willingly down the lane to best the balance. RACING IN THE RAIN settled off the pace, angled out for the stretch drive
and made up solid ground with a late burst of energy. UNION APPRECIATION moved up from off the pace ti midpack entering the turn, came three to two
wide around the bend but his rally stalled in the stretch. RED MERCURY was tentative inside of rivals by the half mile pole, dropped back to the inside,
roused by his rider on the turn but had no response. ARCHIE'S LINK was off the pace and never in contention. THERE WAS A GENERAL STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT BY THE HALF MILE POLE. AFTER REVIEW, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CONSTANTINO chased inside behind duelers, came off the rail to split rivals and get a clear advantage in upper stretch, holding onto a diminishing lead as
the wire approached. BIG LEAGUE was behind the duelers and outside the winner on the turn, angled out to the four path in upper stretch but could get the
perfect trip winner, inching up to make it interesting late. STRATE REMARK stalked and pressed the early leader, took a brief lead late on the turn and early
stretch when drifting out a bit, settling for the show spot. FRONT NINE was inside stalked and pressed by a pace rival, giving way grudgingly from the
quarter pole home. CRAWL FROM THE BAR came out sluggishly, was off the pace and closed steadily from the rear to be in behind the top four at the
wire. GROM was off the pace along the inside, never reaching contention. SAN NICOLA THUNDER trailed from the turn to the wire, never able to muster a
bid of any kind. PER RULING# 1094201 FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMSSION STRATE REMARK WAS DQD DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
PRINCESS FABIANA, taken up by her rider out of a six way scramble for the early lead, trailed into the turn, came with a three to five wide circle move and
into the eight path at the top of the stretch, closing resolutely to get the front three sixteenths out, inching away in the final stages. EGYPTIAN NIGHTS was
outside an early scramble for the lead, stayed three wide outside two rivals, stuck her head in front late on the turn and had a tentative advantage in upper
stretch while in the six path, headed at the three sixteenths but battled on gamely to hold the place. MISS ARIEL broke out at the start, advanced from off
the pace while four wide on the turn into contention, came into the seven path inside the winner turning for home and brushed with the eventual place
finisher in mid stretch, game down to the wire. DISCREET BEAR was in hand behind the top three duelers late on the turn, found a seam but it closed up
when a rival lugged in, steadied up and swung out to put in a mild close when clear. BOBBI'S LEGACY was inside a speed duel with two others around the
turn, stayed in contention to the eighth pole but folded from there. WEST PAW was in between rivals dueling around the turn, fell back in upper stretch and
lugged in impeding a rival mid stretch. TIZ MY RIGHT took out of an early scramble for the lead and trailed around the turn, the rider high in the saddle
down the lane when no response was forthcoming.

Footnotes
WESTERN TAFFY stalked the leader throughout, turned up the heat in upper stretch and drove by at the sixteenth pole, a clear winner at the wire.
BETWIXTING was off the pace, came three to four wide on the turn and in the six path at the top of the stretch, continuing on gamely to garner the place
spot while widest. SYSTEMIC RISK burst into the lead early, held the advantage until collared at the sixteenth pole, staying on gamely but losing the place
spot late. FACT CHECKING took back to trail inside out of gate,advanced into a tight spot behind runners late on the turn, had more traffic problems in mid
stretch and closed best of all in the middle when clear in the final seventy yards. ROMAN D'ORO in behind runners late on the turn, seemed uncomfortable
surrounded by rivals in mid stretch while laying in a bit, closed well when a seam opened up without threatening. MISS BOBBIT stalked the early pace,
loomed three wide at the top of the lane but flattened out in the final eighth while outside. AUNT TILLIE chased along the rail and had a nice spot inside
turning for home but could not quicken when asked down the lane.

Footnotes
RISETOTHECHALLENGE sat a perfect stalking trip just off dueling leaders, bid three wide at the top of the stretch and got the front at the quarter pole,
getting clear and holding safe to the wire. WAVE BABY came in and bumped a rival at the start, moved up four wide into mid pack on the turn, continued to
rally into range turning for home and roused widest in the stretch, clearly second best. LAST SENSATION settled in mid pack, moved up the inside on the
turn, tapped on the brakes before the stretch and brushed a rival coming out, then was in a tight space by the eighth pole before shooting through for the
show spot in a solid effort. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN broke slow and was off the pace, angled out by the three sixteenths and was closing best of all at the
wire. CREATIVE FORCE was off the pace, noticeably closing well down the stretch after trailing for most of the event. PRINCE MARTHEUS was bumped
by a rival at the start, moved up to mid pack into the turn, was between rivals and bumped nearing the stretch, re-rallying mildly late despite all the trouble.
LORD OF LEGENDS stalked the leader and assumed a very brief lead late on the turn but was immediately tackled by the winner and headed, fading down
the lane to the wire. STEEL WOOL led from the inside post to late on the far turn, but was headed by a stalker and retreated down the stretch.
