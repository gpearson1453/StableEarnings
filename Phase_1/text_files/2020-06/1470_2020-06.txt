POSITIVE FORCE dueled along the rail and pulled away late. SYMPHONY OF LOVE alternated for lead lapped on winner but was no match.
MAGICALLYDELICIOUS fell back slightly after a fast start, raced wide and had no kick. LA BELLA CHICA, between rivals early, came up empty. SWEET
REBELLION saved ground just off the pace then tired. DUBLIN MEGAN, three wide, had only brief speed. SOPHIA KATE saved ground and showed little.
WROTE TO A DIVA, very wide, failed to menace. ALL RIGHT GIRL was also very wide and was no threat.

vied between rivals for the early lead, chased on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) vied three wide for the early lead,
chased and weakened. SMART RAGS tracked along the inside, chased on the turn and weakened in the lane. YOU'RE NO SAINT raced off the pace inside
and failed to threaten. SALUTATION raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CHELIOS chased outside and faded.

CORN OFF THE COB chased from the five path, took the lead in early stretch then drew off. TAPETE CLAIRE was in the three path and just off the pace,
was no match late. ATINA SALSA, wide early, moved in on the far turn and faded late. HER DIVINENESS broke slowly, raced three wide and lacked a rally.
MISS MI MI broke slowly, was hustled to race just off the rail and just off pace then gave way. DOUBLE THE BET broke slowly, was between foes and tired.
SPECIAL RISK, two wide while outrun, never threatened. CHEVY TO THE LEVY was very wide and trailed.
