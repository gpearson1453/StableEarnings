Footnotes
MR. WITT opened up early, turned back rivals final turn, drew out. FINALLY FAMOUS trailed to stretch, advanced inside final turn, rallied up the rail. SIR
YARNALLTON, well placed inside, moved off rail final turn, rallied mildly for show. HELLO HOUSTON pressed wide, three-wide bid final turn, turned back,
tired. STARS IN THE PARK came in and bothered PADDLE WHEEL early, pressed between horses, bid on the final turn, was turned back, tired. PADDLE
WHEEL stumbled at the break, was bothered and squeezed between horses, saved ground. FOUR OH ONE KAY came out and bothered PADDLE WHEEL
at the same time as STARS IN THE PARK did the same thing from the outside, pressed between horses to late backstretch, faded badly. The rider aboard
PADDLE WHEEL lodged a claim of foul against the riders of FOUR OH ONE KAY and STARS IN THE PARK for early interference. There was no change.

MORE MO FOR ME, outside early, dueled three-wide between horses turn, shook rivals after passing eighth pole, held well. SWEET DESIGN saved
ground, stalked duel turn, rallied late for place. BYE Y'ALL, wide early, dueled 4-wide turn, gave best stretch, tired late. GOLD DIGGIN DARLIN opened up
early, dueled two-path between horses turn, bid to near mid stretch before tiring. BE AMAZING trailed early, advanced off rail. DIVINE RIDE advanced to
duel inside turn, gave way late turn. SIXTYSHADESOFBLUES showed little off rail.
