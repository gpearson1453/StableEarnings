TAKE ME UP BRADY raced forwardly while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and responded well to pressure. DAAHERS BULLY dueled,
held well into the stretch and was worn down late. LOVIN' THE RUSH outrun early, moved four wide into the stretch and managed a belated rally.
SONGSTER raced forwardly while four wide and lacked a rally. BROWDY BOY washy beforehand, saved ground, was steadied when short of room at both
the half mile marker and the eighth pole, finally shook free and offered a late bid. RED WHITE AND LOUD was bumped soundly at the start and did no
factor. GALAXY'S WILDCAT was brushed at the start and outrun. ROCKIN ROG swerved in at the start bothering RED WHITE AND LOUD and failed to
reach contention.

MYSTIC LINK gained the early lead, held well into the stretch and edged clear under right-handed pressure. HARLEQUIN stalked, proved no match and
kept on well. COLONEL TALBOT raced forwardly while three wide, was urged on the turn and lacked a rally. R V T THUNDER ROAD settled well, moved
closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. YORK ROAD was outpaced while four wide and did not factor. DUBNATION saved ground and weakened.
