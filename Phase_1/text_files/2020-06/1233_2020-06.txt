Footnotes
SWEET SARAH BEAR was unhurried to the half, moved up two wide on the second turn, shifted out and was three deep into the stretch, rallied to edge
away to mid stretch and held driving. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was also unhurried, made a run three deep to engage for the lead on the second turn, was
outkicked by the winner but never threatened for second. OH WHAT A RIDE trailed to the second turn, shifted off the rail and came three wide into the
stretch, was widest in the drive but did not menace the top two. BIG FUN had no speed, settled to the half, was three wide to the stretch but weakened in
the drive. FIRSTCLASSTOPARIS hustled to prompt the pace to the backstretch, shifted outside of DESERT FOG at the five eighths, was being outrun into
the second turn then had to check off heels at the five sixteenths and gave way in the stretch. DESERT FOG contested the pace to the second turn but
stopped after six furlongs, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
ANNA LEE ENCORE pressed the pace to the half, pushed up three wide to engage for the lead on the second turn, edged away to mid stretch then held on
determinedly. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE was outsprinted to the backstretch, closed the gap when the leaders came back to the field to the second turn, shifted
off the rail and rallied when set down but was too late. BABY HANG ON hopped slightly at the start, recovered but had no speed, circled rivals while rallying
four wide on the second turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch but could not sustain the needed response. SNOW PACK was chasing for a half, came two
wide to the stretch but also could not muster the needed late bid. CHARLIE'S BELLE also closed the gap on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch
but did not threaten in the drive. MISS YOU MOM was outrun to the backstretch, moved up and bid three wide on the second turn then was making up
ground belatedly. GALWALKSINTOABAR broke inward, straightened then was three wide while on the lead to the backstretch, was rated to the second turn
but tired after six furlongs and gave out in the drive.

A LITTLE BIT LUCKY had good speed and dueled for the lead between horses, pushed away under urging to mid stretch and held driving. FIREITUP
hesitated in the gate, broke slow then was green early, trailed, swung four wide into the stretch and closed with a rush to get the place. POSO CREEK was
a pace factor outside two others, dueled three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and got tagged on the wire for second. DRUMADOON
hustled to contest the pace inside, got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. SCARLET IRIS had no speed and was not a factor. THE HENRIETTA chased
the leaders two wide to the stretch then gave way.

THUNDER WOMAN stalked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then shifted out widest for the drive and closed steadily to be along in time.
ONLY THE FACTS pressed the pace early then was up to contest for the lead two wide to the stretch, battled DARLING DEMON through a long drive, could
not stall the winner then got the nod for the place. DARLING DEMON set the pace from the rail, dueled the runnerup to mid stretch then got outfinished late.
CULTURED PEARL was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was gaining some ground late. LA CROIX chased the pace, saved ground
to the stretch but did not threaten in the driven. TALIA had no speed and saved ground to no avail. MAXIMA ONLY stalked the pace to the turn but was
drifted four wide to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
EL BORRACHO was unhurried to the half, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to be along in time. SILVER FURY
pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up to engage CAPE POINT for the lead to the stretch, battled through a long drive but could not hold off the
winner. CAPE POINT set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in determinedly through a long drive then was bested late. NORTHERN QUEST chased
the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then finished steadily. LUCK IS MY NAME had no speed, settled to the second turn, saved
ground to the stretch, loomed boldly in mid stretch then flattened out. CHERRY PIE also had no speed, was through after six furlongs and stopped in the
stretch.

the place. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was well placed to the second turn, was also two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner to mid
stretch and lost the nod for second. MITHQAAL attended the pace two wide to the stretch but was tiring through the drive. HARVEST A STORM had good
speed and dueled inside of MITHQAAL for six furlongs, was outrun in upper stretch and also tired. ENGRAM was never a threat.

STREUSEL was outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then responded when set down, switched leads leaving the furlong grounds and closed
fast to be along in time. PACIFIC SILENCE set the pace under pressure from the rail, kicked away under urging to mid stretch but was tiring and got caught
late. SUPER PARTY was outsprinted to the turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch and closed the gap without threatening the top two. SPIRIT LAKE
was washy at the gate, had no speed, circled five wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. BLUE BREEZE had no speed, saved ground to
the stretch but could threaten in the drive. KEEPINMYPROMISE also had no speed, came two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. ENDLESS
STORY stalked the pace early, got fanned four wide to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TANGERINE pressed PACIFIC SILENCE two wide,
remained a threat to the stretch but gave way in the drive. FRENCH TUDOR chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked and gave way.
