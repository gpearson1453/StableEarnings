gamely at the end. JOYEUX slow early rallied to contention on the far turn cutting the corner to pressure for the lead in upper stretch battling rival from the
rail to the end. KING OF NEW YORK slow early lagged to the far turn, raced three path into upper stretch responding belatedly to improve after the fact.
CONFECTION FORTUNE hustled out set the pace through the far turn, hooked between horses in upper stretch would weaken ducking out under left hand
urging carrying a rival wide late. ROMANTIC CHANNEL gave a prompted middle move angling six wide into upper stretch, had lost momentum when being
carried out to the eight path late. STARLING'S LAW slow early lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the eight path. GIANT'S VOICE was steadied
when in tight between horses on the opening turn. BLUEGRASS BALL bore out in the first turn. AKTABANTAY (GB) raced evenly to the far turn then gave
way into upper stretch. EYES ON displayed poor action being eased on the far turn finishing the course walking off after the race. AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF CONFECTION FORTUNE AGAINST THE RIDER OF INDEPENDENT INDY CLAIMING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS

Footnotes
POSTIMPRESSIONIST stalked the pace laying close through the turn, bid clear in the four path upper stretch widening under a drive. TITERE slow early
rallied four wide into upper stretch angling inside responding to save place. MR. CLASS in close at the break was hustled in pursuit through the turn
extending on the rail down the lane weakening late. FORCEFUL ONE sent clear set the pace through the turn ceding in upper stretch weakening near mid
track. JUST DOING slow early played no factor. ROBERTOS TICKET chased early then faded to upper stretch. GO FOR FOUR FROSTY was never
involved. STUDY HABITS was always outrun. AND LEON folded up on the turn.
