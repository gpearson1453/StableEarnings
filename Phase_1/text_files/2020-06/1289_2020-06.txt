J M R VICTORY LAP was in range, a factor on the turn and with the lead in mid stretch was kept to task. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was off the pace, gained
ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. STROLLING POSSE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but
needed more. WHATSONEMORE tracked the leaders and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. J M R
SILENT LAKE was hustled early and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and had nothing left. TEXAS BOY was well back,
trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. DOCTOR ROBERT was in mid pack and saved ground on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. TRIGLAV showed no speed, chased on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STOLEN IDENTITY showed speed from the inside, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. OMAR stalked the
leader and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BALDUR was hustled early, saved ground
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. UNCLE LOU was in range and roused on the turn but from the four path
at the top of the stretch had no response. MAJESTIC HEIST had no speed, showed little and was never in contention. MASTER CONNOR was in touch
early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
MIDNITE SNACKATTAK set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. FLASH MAN showed
speed from the outside, dueled on the turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outgunned late. DES BOIS was in touch
and raced evenly on the turn but was no real threat. MY MARC ANDRE was in range and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
had no late kick. HARMONY HALL was off the pace, chased on the turn and was not a factor. SPINOS showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but
had no impact. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SPINOS AGAINST DES BOIS FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT
ALLOWED. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN MY MARC ANDRE BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SIXTH.

turn but had nothing left. STELLATARA was unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.
