SABER RUN dueled from the inside for the early margin, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the turn, gained a clear advantage at the
eighth pole and was clear late while under steady urging. REINSURE dueled from between foes early, remained engaged with the winner up the
backstretch, held a forward position for the drive but could not match strides. ACTIFDASH chased the early pace inside, made a bid entering the second
turn but could only hold position. HASHTAG SPEED stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded but was too
late. OUR BLUE JAY chased the early pace outside but had nothing left. SOVOL dueled from the inside and tired. BARROW ROAD was no factor. POWER
SERVE was never close. RULER'S GOLD was no threat.
