Footnotes
PURIM KING void of early foot after being the last to leave, continued to lag in the run up the backstretch, began to move far turn, rallied four wide into the
lane, collared the leader just inside the furlong grounds and drove clear. UPTOWN RULER behind the pace toward the inside, moved on the leader after a
half, took over in the final turn, clear into the lane, could not match the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. BUNYAN'S AXE settled off the pace
toward the inside, lost some position in the far turn, moved out late in that bend, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. I'M D'CAT unhurried for five
furlongs, moved closer in the two path early in the final turn, lacked clear room in traffic with a quarter remaining, came up empty when clear for the drive.
FLAT OUT LOVE pressed the issue early, took over and was clear before a half, continued to show the way into the final turn, gave way when headed by
the runner up soon after. SEAHAWK WAVE flashed brief speed along the inside and stopped. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED. Race times added after video review

Footnotes
HE'S A LADY TAMER in the second group while racing off the inside, patiently handled while remaining behind the pace late in the turn, engaged the leader
when straightened for home, gained the advantage a furlong out and drove clear. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE away in good order, set the pace along the
inside, shook off the other speed entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, dug in late to prevail for the place. SO SORRY
RUSTON behind the pace while inside the winner early, lost some position while saving ground through the turn, steered out, lodged a late bid for the place
but was outfinished for that position. BAYOU BODE settled well back off the pace, came four wide out of the turn, improved position without posing a
serious threat. FOOLISH PRINCE last away, trailed early, displayed some mild late interest to also improve position without seriously menacing for the win.
ELITE RUNNER went one paced early off the inside, crept a bit closer in the four path late in the turn then flattened out in the drive. CHIEF ENVOY pressed
the issue for a half off the inside and gave way. LANDONESE remained always back. LUCKY LYDGATE was finished early.

Footnotes
RUBY SIOUX unhurried early while racing outside, advanced three wide into contention far turn, challenged exiting that bend, shook clear inside the furlong
grounds, enough left to hold the next two rivals save late. IRISH HUSTLE settled off the early pace, moved closer with the winner in the second turn while
inside that one, two path into the straight, altered course to the outside with a furlong to run and closed well to be rapidly getting to the winner late.
HANDSOME GIRL off a step slow, void of speed, advanced four out to five wide through the second turn, angled in steadily for the drive and was also
getting to the winner late. HAVINFUNYET another who was devoid of early foot, roused four wide exiting the second turn and was also going well at the end
while widest of the first flight at the wire. ZAO'S DREAMS settled in mid pack, came four wide into the lane when moving a bit closer, failed to sustain that
advance in the run to the wire. MI COPA REBOSA chased the early leader, joined the fray up front before a half, showed the way through the final turn and
into the stretch, faltered the final furlong. COSTA SUGAR fell back after racing within striking distance early, failed to muster a response in the drive.
STORMIN CHARLOTTE prompted the early pace while racing three wide, gave way. STAR FORMULA broke on top, got clear to set the early pace,
stopped when headed.

Footnotes
PICACHO PEAK with the pace from the start while off the inside, dueled into the stretch in the two path, kicked well clear in the run to the wire while being
kept to task. G CISIVE lacked early foot, remained back through the turn, rallied through some traffic, split foes late and finished willingly to be up for the
place. HALF OURS N STORMY with the pace for a quarter inside, fell back to race in the second flight turn, closest to the winner late, nipped for the place.
FAZIO forwardly placed while racing off the inside, asked along late in the turn, came up empty in the late going. TIGER ROAD bothered at the start to be
off slow, remained back, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD lacked a response while racing outside. REDDING
COTEAU broke out to bother a foe, was straightened and vied up front early while between horses, dueled with the winner inside that into the stretch then
gave way the final furlong. GRAND LITTLE MAN trailed throughout in showing little while racing wide.

Footnotes
QUIET BARBARA broke out to bother RUN BY, settled in mid pack early, within striking distance into the far turn, split foes when continuing to advance
midway on the second turn, challenged and vied three wide into the lane, shook clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up in the
waning strides. VITA lacked early foot, advanced four wide through the second turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, getting to that one late,
clear of the others. LUCKY HARBORAGE well back for a half, mired in some traffic in the second turn, advanced inside of several rivals into the stretch, up
for the show while not a match for the top two. MIGHTY PEGASUS well back for a half, came six wide into the lane, improved position down the middle part
of the strip, not enough for the show. ENVOY'S GUILT in the second flight, saved ground inside of traffic in the second turn, roused into the lane, came up
empty. SALT LIFE ANGEL dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternated into the far turn, came in a bit to tight up a fellow pacesetter with less than
three furlongs remaining, gained a briefly larger advantage as a result, vied into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker and weakened.
TOGAROCK away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, in tight, steadied far turn, fell back, briefly lodged a rebid, vied into the lane and also
faltered the final furlong. BLUE RIDGE HEAT four wide into the first turn when within striking distance, continued outside, was four wide again through the
second bend and tired. J.'S GIRL in the second flight along the inside, continued to stalked the dueling leaders onto the backstretch, weakened. RUN BY
bothered at the start, raced wide into the first turn, continued wide and was in the five path in the second turn, failed to menace in the drive. CRIDER
CHASE in the second flight for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
DIGNITYTO INFINITY moved up steadily the initial furlong to narrowly set the pace, continued to show the way into and through the turn along the inside,
shook off the other speed into the stretch, extended advantage while being kept to task. STREETTALKINHOTTIE in the main body for a half off the inside,
dropped to the rail turning for home, improved to race closest to the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire,
narrowly held the place. FLASH ANNIE void of early foot, improved some while saving ground through the turn, steadily steered to the far outside by
midstretch, up late for the show. HALF HEROINE raced off the pace and the inside, was three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, not enough for
the place late. GALAXY STAR in the second flight for a half, came up empty for the stretch run. NONCHALANTLY lacked speed, four wide through the turn,
lacked a closing response. ENOUGH HEART broke on top, dueled up front outside the winner early, chased that rival through the turn and faltered. BEAR
TOOTH PASS was never a serious threat. OVERLY SWEET broke back and was never a factor. QUEEZER off slow, moved up to race closest to the
dueling leaders early, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
KICK N KISS unhurried for five furlongs, advanced in the second turn, split rivals into the straight, moved inside to challenge along the rail in midstretch,
spirited run to the wire, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. BLESSED ANNA broke alertly, allowed the speed to go early, advanced 3w far turn, bid,
brushed midstretch while widest of the top three, outkicked to the wire for the win while prevailing for the place. KATIE'S BAYOU a bit rank at the start, got
clear before a quarter, set a leisurely pace, shook off a rival in the far turn, was joined by the winner soon after, brushed with that one nearing midstretch as
the winner was challenging along the inside, weakened in the late going, comfortably clear of the other two. ZOLA settled off the pace and the inside, failed
to respond when called on for the drive. MARAMA hesitated at the start, lodged an early bid along the rail before a half, gave way far turn.

Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY broke with the field, settled behind the pace out in the strip, came four wide when beginning to advance exiting the turn, finished with
good resolve to be in time down the middle of the strip. PICKETT within striking distance toward the inside, continued in a forward position in the two path
entering the stretch, shifted out for room approaching midstretch, challenged, led late, missed. BUCKETS broke back,moved up to a forward position early,
chased the leader into the turn, challenged that one from the outside early in the bend, shook off that foe to be clear when straightened for home, weakened
and could not contain the top two. CAFE DU MONDE in the main body in the run up the backstretch while between rivals, three wide into the lane, floated in
late while improving slightly. FREEDOMFI last away, void of speed, four wide through the turn, improved position while drifting in a bit late. MY BOOK
settled off the early pace, fell back a bit while saving ground turn, not dangerous in the drive. A FLASH OF COPPER broke on top, cleared to the inside to
show the way up the backstretch,dueled through the turn, gave way in the drive. FLASH ME BACK was never a serious threat. FAST VERDICT back off the
early pace, steadied from between horses early in the turn, fell back and did not recover. AW ITE forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
NEWYORK GIANT moved up to a forward position soon after the start, bid between horses turning for home, drove clear under steady handling. TAPIT ON
RACE DAY in mid pack early outside, four wide through the turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, rallied for the place while not a serious threat to the
winner. MORO PHAROAH away in good order, fell back off the issue early, steered out to be five wide turning for home, long drive for the place, outfinished
for that position while also unable to do much with the winner late. DESIARD steadied at the start, recovered to made a steady advance, within striking
distance a furlong out, flattened. MAN ALIVE broke well, set or force the pace for four furlongs off the inside, faltered late. DR. GELP steadied at the start,
recovered to race in the main flight, had little left late. THE ROCKS CRY OUT forwardly placed inside, moved up to lodge a rail bid in the turn, was
beginning to tire when in a bit tight along the inside upper stretch,continued to tire the final furlong. SUPER INTENSE void of speed, passed tiring rivals
while never a threat. LONE STAR CLASS balk at loading, broke with the field, never a serious menace. D J'S FINALE broke out, remained always back.
LIONS HOT MESS broke alertly, alternated up front in the two path, stopped in the drive, eased and was jogged in.
