Footnotes
AIR ON FIRE set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. FORT ROYAL lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn then churned on
widest through the lane to gain the place. BIG BOOTS stalked the pace two wide, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch, raced between
rivals through most of the stretch and was outfinished for the place. LUCKY JUNIOR saved ground off the pace, tipped out near the quarter pole and had a
mild rally between rivals. MEO DESPERADO chased the pace two wide, angled to the rail for the stretch and finished evenly. MAJESTIC DOCTOR pressed
the pace in the three path and tired in the drive. SAVE ME PAULA had some early speed between foes and steadily faded inside.

MYSTIC TIMES stalked the pace inside, steadied off heels near the half-mile pole, angled three wide midway around the turn, bid between foes
approaching the lane, came in slightly and bumped with DESTRUCTION near the three-sixteenths pole then drove clear. DESTRUCTION vied two wide to
upper stretch, came out a bit and bumped with the winner in upper stretch, was no match for that foe but stayed on well to preserve the place. DEREK'S
BOY stalked the pace four wide, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out. MARYLAND BANDIT raced off the pace three wide and passed
tiring rivals. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY failed to menace while racing two wide. I'VE GOTTA PLAN played no factor while racing three wide. KATHAK vied
inside early and tired. TASKINAS was outrun inside. SCORCHED BY FIRE stumbled badly at the start and was never involved. The rider of
DESTRUCTION claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

READY AND RICH raced off the pace three wide, angled in leaving the quarter pole, rallied inside and was up and clear late. ZIGGY MON stalked the pace
three wide, was floated out turning for home and continued on willingly for the place. BULLETS CHILD set a clear pace in the two path, steadily drifted out
throughout the last quarter and weakened. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally.
GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN lagged well back two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TWIXY CAT failed to menace while racing
two wide. WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
BUDDY'S RUN stalked the pace three wide between foes, took the lead in upper stretch, drew clear, drifted out late and held sway. HALITE settled off the
pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, shifted further out in the stretch and rallied. FLIGHT RISK was in range while in somewhat tight between
foes down the backstretch, continued on two and three wide between foes around the turn, angled in nearing midstretch and rallied inside. ROYAL
CRUSADER stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, took the lead between foes near the five-sixteenths marker then weakened in the lane. SEA
GHOST chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. THEYALLCOMEHOME lacked speed while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch
and rallied belatedly. CAN'T PASS IT UP was sluggish at the start, dropped far back, swung out in upper stretch and finished with some interest.
CROUCHELLI set a rated pace between rivals and gave way nearing the lane. MARYLANDER had early speed inside and faded around the turn.
