Footnotes
LEADING FACTOR tracked inside to the far turn, tipped out to the three-path at the top of the lane, and rallied steadily to wear down RATIFY and edge
clear late. RATIFY prompted the pace outside BORGOBYTHESEA, took over after six furlongs, drew clear in mid stretch, but was worn down in the closing
stages. FARM STRONG settled in the middle of the pack to the stretch, and finished willingly in the two-path. WATER WALL steadied slightly entering the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, and lacked a solid bid. SKYRAY steadied along the rail entering the first turn, moved out three to four wide after
six furlongs, and improved without threatening. BORGOBYTHESEA set a moderate early pace inside, and gave way after six furlongs. CONCRETE
CHARLIE was four wide early, moved up outside rivals through the backstretch run, and had nothing further. I'M DOWN hit the left side of the gate at the
start, and was never prominent. WORDMAN raced two wide and was through early. SMOKEY SONG stayed in range early, and was finished after six
furlongs. FELIX LEITER broke slowly, and failed to menace. CAPODANNO lost contact with the field before reaching the stretch, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
UPSY DAISY DO tracked three wide early, rallied determinedly through the lane, and was up outside CRYSTALINA in the final strides. CRYSTALINA
prompted the pace outside LOLA WANTS, took over near the five-sixteenths, was clear through most of the stretch on the wrong lead, and could not hang
on. LET'S GO LUNA advanced four wide after a half-mile, had aim through the stretch and finished evenly on the far outside. NENITA raced close up inside
for a half, and lacked the needed late response. AMBER PRINCESS moved off the inside improving mildly after a half, and posed no threat. SIGNING
BONUS raced two wide on the turn, and passed tired horses. KREATIVE KISSER was never prominent four wide. LOLA WANTS set the pace inside to the
turn, yielded to CRYSTALINA after a half and folded up. MI TIA REGIS was finished early three wide. POWERFUL WORDS tossed her head at the start to
get off last, moved inside and remained far back. LUCKY ANGELS DREAM raced three to four wide, and was through early. NA NA DUDE stopped after a
half, and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
LI'L MEATBALL advanced three then four wide around the turn, rallied steadily and overtook the leaders from outside through the last sixteenth of a mile.
TIP SHEET was in the second flight for a half-mile two to three wide, and gained late on the far outside. BLACK PEPPER moved up to challenge between
horses after a half, and ran on willingly for a share. THE GIPPER raced widest up the backstretch, took over from outside five-sixteenths out, continued in
front past the furlong marker, but weakened late. GAME DAY DRAMA hit the left side of the gate at the start, chased the leaders into the turn, and was
through before reaching the stretch. PACHANGA PARTY vied outside SILENT TIGER early, cleared off and moved inside on the turn, and faded once
displaced up front. E J'S REVENGE came three wide off the turn, and made no impact. SILENT TIGER became skittish prior to the start and loaded without
the rider, grew more agitated in the gate, came away without incident and vied early inside PACHANGA PARTY, got shuffled back into the turn and
retreated steadily.

Footnotes
FOUR K'S broke alertly and let the leaders go early, dropped to the rail tracking from close range for nearly six furlongs, was guided out three wide at the
top of the stretch, collared LA INCONDICIONAL meeting little resistance entering the final furlong, and drew clear under a mild drive. PAINT THE
CORNERS settled in the middle of the field up the backstretch, raced two wide on the far turn, and finished with good energy outside the winner. LA
INCONDICIONAL raced four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace outside STRAIGHT UP SMARTY, wrested command turning for home, proved no
match for the winner through the furlong grounds, and weakened. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR was bumped between KYLLA INSTINCT and KUPURI at the start,
raced toward the inside in the second flight to the stretch, came off the rail late and finished with good energy. STRAIGHT UP SMARTY set the pace inside
for six furlongs, and gave way. KYLLA INSTINCT (GB) bumped with TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR at the start, and saved ground to no avail. YAKO raced four wide
early, and failed to become a factor. KUPURI bumped with TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR at the start, and was never prominent. AVENIDA MANANA stayed in
range to the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and weakened. NIGHT WATCH lunged at the start and landed awkwardly to begin five lengths behind the
next-to-last horse, and stayed far back. MUCH ABOUT IT was five wide early, and tired after six furlongs. FINAL FLURRY was far back throughout.

Footnotes
VIOLENT TRICK set the pace inside, was roused to repel a bid from DANCE D'ORO late on the turn, battled inside LIL MISS HOTSHOT through the furlong
grounds, and held firm. LIL MISS HOTSHOT raced three wide around the turn, bid outside VIOLENT TRICK and reached even terms in deep stretch, but
was outdueled to the wire. JUDY'S WAY ranged up four wide to loom a threat after six furlongs, had aim outside the leaders through mid stretch, but
flattened out. DANCE D'ORO prompted the pace outside VIOLENT TRICK, lodged a mild bid between horses three furlongs out, and gave way through the
lane. SOLITARY GEM saved ground early, moved out on the turn and was through after six furlongs. WRONG COLOR was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAL PAL was under a firm hold early, got steered out three wide given his cue after six furlongs, overtook the leaders in mid stretch, lugged
in after moving clear and held for the decision. LEADING WEST was slow early inside, angled widest into the stretch and rallied belatedly. METCALF
brushed the left side of the gate and brushed with IMPERIAL MOMENT at the start, closed some ground after six furlongs two wide, rallied between horses
through the last eighth of a mile and finished willingly. IMPERIAL MOMENT bobbled slightly and brushed with METCALF at the start, advanced three then
four wide around the far turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch but weakened through the late stages. WINTER'S WONDER broke out, raced three to four
wide around the turns, and was no threat with an even finish. FAKE MUSE sped off early through a sharp pace, brushed with SNOW JOB in upper stretch,
and weakened on the rail. SEVEN CHANNELS raced in the second flight throughout, and was no threat. ALASTOR saved ground to no avail. SNOW JOB
closed in outside the pacesetter after a half-mile, reached a short lead outside FAKE MUSE while brushing with that one in upper stretch, and weakened
through the furlong grounds. MIGHTY TOUGH was never close. STAR WEAVER was outrun early, advanced five wide midway on the far turn, but was
finished approaching the stretch. MY FIRST GRAMMY was outrun three wide.

VINCENT WILLIAM popped clear out of the gate, rated along inside for a half-mile, opened daylight roused turning for home, and stayed clear under
pressure. SMASH was outrun early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, and was up outside CAPTAIN DUKE to get the place late. CAPTAIN DUKE
got bounced around between OUR TIME and CAT GONE QUICK soon after the start and checked back to last, moved four wide to contention around the
turn, loomed outside the leader into the lane, but flattened out past the eighth-pole. SHANGHAI MOON was hemmed in awaiting room behind the leaders
coming to the quarter-pole, gained clearance once straightened away for the drive, and was no threat with an even finish. OUR TIME broke out and bumped
repeatedly with CAPTAIN DUKE, showed speed inside to the turn, and retreated. MAN WITH A PLAN lunged into the right side of the gate and was last
away, moved past horses outside up the backstretch, loomed a threat three wide late on the turn, but gave way between foes at the top of the stretch.
VENEZUELAN HEART dropped back inside around the turn. CAT GONE QUICK broke in bumping repeatedly with CAPTAIN DUKE, bid briefly between
horses near the five-sixteenths, and faltered at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT AND HEAVY tracked toward the inside for six furlongs, moved out and challenged outside DONJI in upper stretch, battled shoulder to shoulder with
that rival and prevailed after a long drive. DONJI broke out while away alertly, rated along through a manageable early pace, picked up the tempo to repel a
bid from MANHATTAN PROJECT after six furlongs, moved out in upper stretch, dueled inside HOT AND HEAVY through a bitter dispute and just missed.
GRAND NENUCO was four wide on the first turn, moved in prompting the pace outside DONJI, shifted back out to the four-path with aim turning for home,
could not go with the top two and remained clear of the rest. MORNING STRIDE raced four wide around the turns, and improved on the far outside for the
last major share. STREET CODE raced three wide early, moved in from the two-path coming off the far turn, and lacked the needed response. KING ORB
saved ground outrun early, was strung out five wide attempting to rally on the far turn, and finished evenly. BILLY BIG (IRE) broke slowly, advanced four
wide up the backstretch, and had nothing further approaching the lane three wide. COWBOY CULTURE was no factor in the second flight two to three wide.
MAJESTIC LUNA saved ground and posed no threat. MANHATTAN PROJECT was bothered a bit by DONJI at the break, rocketed past rivals four wide
around the far turn to get closest to the leader, but faltered once straightened away for the drive. MURRY SPUR steadied slightly midway on the far turn
near the back, circled five wide and made no gains. SHIDOSHI was outrun toward the inside.

EYE OF A JEDI crept a bit closer to the leaders shifting out five wide after six furlongs, rallied determinedly through the stretch, overtook RED CRESCENT
and DIAMOND OOPS from outside in deep stretch and edged away all out. DIAMOND OOPS pressed the early pace between WENTZ and RED
CRESCENT, got set down inside the latter turning for home and stayed on willingly. RED CRESCENT pressed the pace three wide, vied outside DIAMOND
OOPS through upper stretch, and yielded grudgingly. GARTER AND TIE raced four then five wide around the turn, and rallied mildly on the far outside for a
share. MATH WIZARD was unhurried early, advanced four wide approaching the quarter-pole between horses, and flattened out through mid stretch.
NOBLE DRAMA was widest early at the back, dropped inside approaching the turn, and remained outrun. COLOUR GUARD saved ground and tired after
six furlongs. WENTZ set the early pace pursued by a pair, and yielded readily approaching the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
SO LONG CHUCK broke out at the start, vied outside rivals up the backstretch, cleared off into the turn staying well out in the track, came five wide into the
stretch and was kept driving. JUST KIDDING stumbled and bumped with TELL ME A STORY at the start, vied inside rivals early, shifted out six wide
chasing after SO LONG CHUCK approaching the stretch, and ran on evenly. DESERT GENERAL moved up inside around the turn, had the rider drop the
whip a furlong out, and finished evenly. DEXTER ROAD was shut off between CHARGE CARD and KAHRAMANI at the start, advanced four to five wide
after six furlongs, and ran on for the last major share. JAIDEN'S BEST raced forwardly three wide early, and faded before reaching the stretch. TAKEDOWN
was outrun throughout. CHARGE CARD broke out bumping hard with KAHRAMANI, and was through early three wide. TELL ME A STORY bumped with
JUST KIDDING at the start, vied early between horses, and was done after a half-mile. YEAR OF THE KITTEN brushed the right side of the gate and was
crowded behind SO LONG CHUCK at the start, and retreated after a half. KAHRAMANI was knocked sideways at the start by CHARGE CARD with the
rider coming out of the irons, and dropped far back into the turn. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS
MADE OFFICIAL.
