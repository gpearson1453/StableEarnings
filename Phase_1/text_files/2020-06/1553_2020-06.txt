Footnotes
SAYWARD broke outwardly just a bit perhaps brushing with OUR NATIVE ANGEL, set the pace shadowed by that one racing off the rail, went in the two to
three path on the turn with a clear lead, extended the margin into upper stretch, was all out late to just hold from COOL AND QUICK, who stalked just off
and outside the leader, edged closer four wide and between runners into the turn moving in a path later on that bend, lost ground into upper stretch, shifted
to the rail gradually through mid-stretch, was gaining late inside but missed. EMILY WHO broke inwardly, switched out after clearing the gap, advanced
outside rivals into the turn going five then four wide on that bend and within striking distance but offered no late kick. OUR NATIVE ANGEL was in just a bit
tight between rivals at the start, flanked just off the pacesetter then chased three wide into the turn, shifted to the rail in the vicinity of the mid-point of that
bend, failed to rally but ran on. DIXIE JEN was back off the leaders and lost ground in the two to three path on the turn, swung out four to five wide for the
stretch run and showed some late interest from outside. REGOLA D'ORO trailed early, went in the three path on the turn, came out a bit for the drive and
showed mild late interest to pass a tired rival but was always outrun. CINDYS CHIME was last but one racing inside, came out in upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY SEASONED stalked from outside, went five then four wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the furlong marker, drove clear. CAN'T GET
AWAY bobbled slightly at the start but recovered to press the pace, continued to chase four then three wide on the turn as the leader got away, could not
kick on with the top one but was second best. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT broke out just a bit, continued to move out while gaining forward position, took the
lead after the opening three-sixteenths to dictate terms from the three path, moved in a path on the turn, was overtaken leaving that bend and had no extra
but kept on for show. I AM A DEPLORABLE broke a half-step slowly and was in tight, raced on or just off the rail up the backstretch into the turn, came out a
bit for the drive but failed to rally. STORM SHAKER broke just a half-step slowly, angled in early, saved ground inside and passed tired rivals. DAWN TERA
stumbled at the start and lightly brushed with inside and outside rivals, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. ROBTHEQUEEN exchanged a light
brush after the break, raced outside a rival mid-pack four wide through the turn and made no bids. TAMMY'S SHADOW raced well back early while off the
inside, went in the five path on the turn and was never a threat. FOLLOW THE GOLD was bumped at the start, was in behind rivals two to three wide up the
backstretch, moved out a bit on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
RECEPTION brushed the inside rival lightly at the start, moved up inside rivals to set the pace midway up the backstretch racing just off the rail, continued in
the two path on the turn with a larger lead, moved clear into upper stretch and was geared down in the final sixteenth. SHUGS CHARLIE was lightly brushed
at the start, settled into stride, raced on or just off the rail, captured the place but was no threat to the winner. LAUGHAROO attended the pace from outside
rivals, went four wide on the turn, weakened. CEDE'S DREAM raced outside the second group, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to rally.
GOOD FOR NOW failed to threaten while racing inside a foe early but off the inside and going in the three then four path on the turn. DIRECTED LADY was
forwardly-placed between rivals to vie for the lead up the backstretch, dropped back three wide by the quarter pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
HANKY PANKY KIM moved up with mild encouragement after not breaking terribly sharply to take the lead after the opening three-sixteenths, dictated the
tempo from there on out racing removed from the inside, went in the three to two path through the turn and moved clear into upper stretch, widened the
margin thereafter under steady handling. INVODKAWETRUST switched outside a rival leaving the backstretch, went two wide on the turn, moved up inside
a foe in upper- to mid-stretch to be second best. CRITICAL DECISION pressed outside the winner going four to three wide on the turn then weakened in the
stretch. SHADOW ME GRAY broke just a hair slowly and was lacking speed from the gate, trailed early going in the three path into the turn and moving out
five wide by the latter part of that bend, came out further still to be six or seven deep and rallied widest. WE OUTTA HERE tucked in behind a rival late up
the backstretch, went in the four path on the turn advancing past foes into upper stretch but could not sustain the effort. HUMDINGER settled last but one,
raced just off the fence through the turn, came out in upper stretch and showed mild late interest. GROUND HOG COUNTY was fractious in the gate,
chased five wide through the turn and came up empty. TWENTYFOUR K CAT chased the leaders from inside, saved ground but steadily weakened.
CANNES' HALO chased from outside up the backstretch, moved in from six deep to the four path while dropping back on the turn, tired.
