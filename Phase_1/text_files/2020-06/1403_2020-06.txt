Footnotes
SO DARN HOT remained forwardly placed after out-breaking the competition, cut over into the three path, vied as the outermost of a threesome for the top
for almost six furlongs, saw the pilot chilly atop leading the others by a slim margin into the stretch, got called upon for more at the thee-sixteenths pole,
gave the desired response lengthening away, finished off the last few jumps geared down. THANKFUL took up residence in midapck after the the field had
been sent off and running, kept an eye on the ongoing pace dispute while under a ride on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch
becoming the widest of all, went on to secure second. SKY QUEEN pocketed, was being urged along for most of the journey on the turn, tipped into the two
path stepping onto the head of the stretch, got outfinished. LOVE ON THE RUN disputed the pace from between opponents in path two for three-quarters,
ventured onward for the next two panels in a tussle with the eventual winner, failed to keep up when the nemesis got roused and backed away steadily.
SNEER towards the inside route, was forced to fend off a pair of rivals to the outside, remained at the task until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole
before faltering. YELLOW BRICK ROAD sluggish proceeding on the backstretch, departed it from the three path, didn't pick it when asked on the turn,
wandered out four to five once in the stretch falling farther and farther back.

MAKE MISCHIEF got switched over to lighter urging on the turn after being more feverishly ridden on the backstretch, stalked the winner from the three
path, came under rousing once again spinning into the lane, made little progress on the one to catch during the ensuing furlong, began to chip afterwards
however, was looming dangerously close to JILL'S A HOT MESS when forced to steady while shying away after that one began to race wayward with
approximately a sixteenth to go, struck the front with a few strides to spare before the finish line and edged away. JILL'S A HOT MESS placed to a hand ride
springing from the starting gate, had control established by the conclusion of the backstretch, moved onto the inside route, showed the way on a
loosely-pressed advantage, coaxed along, was settling onto the head of the stretch when put to a drive, shifted into path two, came out a few paths after
some left side stick work with about a sixteenth to go, got corrected, was reeled in soon afterwards. PLEASURE LUCK made it over to the rail prior to
entering the turn, went about it initially being hand urged, got set down after crossing the midway point, cut the corner and went on to secured the show.
SHESADIRTYDANCER took up the chase from the three path on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, made no headway. GOING GOING GONE
underwent a two wide pursuit, was being ridden along seemingly from the get-go, came into the lane and weakened. CARA'S DREAMER sent over to the
rail by the top of the turn, failed to make an impact off the subsequent ground-saving journey. CHASING CARA away last, travelled two wide on the turn, got
sent out into path six from upper to midlane, had no rally. DOROTHY'S STAR strung out four wide on the turn, was moved out into path seven for the drive
home, gave way.

MILLS chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take
command inside the final sixteenth, then prevailed on the wire inching away at the end. SCARF IT DOWN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was collared inside the sixteenth
marker while running on to preserve the place honors. STREET TRUST just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along clear of the rest for the show honors. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL
dueled in hand from the two path with PROUD ENOUGH to his outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
went two to three wide into upper stretch, shook off his main pace rival confronted by SCARF IT DOWN, yielded the front near the eighth pole and
weakened in the late stages. EDEN RIDGE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch, kept
on through to the finish but was outkicked. VINCENTO coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY five to six wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs out, went seven wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. PROUD ENOUGH dueled in hand three then two wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SHIRAZ away forwardly placed, remained so, cut over towards the inside, contended for the top while being well rated in the two path, snatched away the
advantage shortly after the second split had been posted on the board, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker and with several others in hot
pursuit when turned loose, saw the runner up closing in with good energy but mustered up determination to meet the challenge. BAD GUY took the inside
route during the opening phases, flashed momentum getting sent into the three path midway around the turn, angled out approximately five wide into the
lane, narrowed in on the winner, continued onward willingly with a good finish down the center of the course to garner the place. IMPAZIBLE ODDS secured
the pocket after the start, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners, slipped out and knifed its way into the two path at the five-sixteenths pole, scooting
by former pace contestant SEPTIMUS SEVERUS a sixteenth down the road, got given his cue for the drive home, flattened out. VARIANT PERCEPTION
along the outside throughout, raced three to four wide on the turn, crept up to the front runners after the half had been rattled off, was put to a drive bidding
for the lead entering the stretch, failed to make headway. CABINET PIK three wide stepping off the backstretch, was one path farther off the rail exiting the
bend, lacked a solid closing punch. JEROME AVENUE saved ground until the end of the bend, got sent out five wide for the drive home, made no impact.
NICKI DE NEPHEW appeared unsettled nestled in between and amongst rivals on the backstretch, pursued the pace from path two on the turn, fanned out
into path six from upper to midstretch, came up empty. IRISH ROAR (IRE) briefly involved trying to secure the front end, was allowed to ease back, travelled
two to three wide on the turn, shifted out into path five upon entering the stretch, gave way. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS guided over to the rail after securing the
lead, argued with the winner afterwards until the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane and readily backed away.

QUID broke out at the start bumping G C CAM, tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying into contention a furlong out, leaned on SHANDIAN at that station, was
in tight between foes and came out slightly surging late to split rivals and get up on the wire while forcing SHANDIAN to be taken in hand at the finish.
SUMMER TUNE three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, closed well
through the stretch to challenge through the final sixteenth and just missed on the wire. SPITBALL established the front and showed the way in hand just off
the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the stretch drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in under threat from a trio and was nailed by a pair on the line. SHANDIAN just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled
until set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive through the stretch challenging through to the finish, got leaned on by QUID a
furlong out as that rival made some room in a seam between foes, then got forced to steady steps from the finish while battling on latched on just off the top
trio. G C CAM got bumped at the start by QUID who broke outwards, raced along the inside early on and then two to three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently
vanned off. HOSTILE WITNESS chased four wide under a ride at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
CAMOUFLAGED KISSER chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MUCHO SUNSHINE chased three then two wide under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MASTERIO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NOT SO EASY just off the inside at the tail of the field, grew detached from the
main body of the field and tucked inside half a mile from home, came under urging at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and was unable to
make an impact. DRINK TO THE CLOWN chased three to four wide just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home
and weakened.

ITS ALL RELEVANT grabbed control shortly after the break, carved out the pace, well rated along the inside route until the end of the bend, was towards
the two path when given his cue at the five-sixteenths marker, squandered much of its lead in the final furlong but managed to hold sway. PRIORITIZE sat
reserved from the two path for nearly threee-quarters, flashed interest splitting rivals a short distance from the quarter pole, tipped out three wide and took
off after the winner, cut into the gap in the last eighth en route for the place. PROVEN RESERVES off the inside, raced three to four wide having been set to
a prolonged drive on the turn, fanned out slightly wider spinning into the stretch, proved no match. I LOVE JAXSON sent over to the rail coming up to the
conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner under a drive, lacked the needed response. WINSTON'S CHANCE took up the chase three wide, got let loose
approaching the five-sixteenths marker, stepped into the lane and gave way. FELIX IN FABULA mostly along the inside during the journey leading up to the
half mile pole, was more in the two path for the run around the bend, having shifted there while pulling on the left side, swung into the and backed away
readily, still pulling quite a bit.

BARREL OF DESTINY coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside from just off the pace, remained patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside for home taking over command, then inched away under a drive kept to task. SUMMER AT THE SPA three then two wide near the rear of
the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in and secure the place honors
in the final jumps. ASTORIA KITTEN established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand from the three path after a brief tussle with a
pair, tucked inside six furlongs from home after clearing those foes, remained patiently through the far turn, got headed at the quarter pole and cut the
corner roused into upper stretch, then kept on to chase the winner home and was collared in the final jumps for the place honors. MISS JEN saved ground
near the rear of the field, got set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly for the last major share. MARQUET LEGACY a bit
reluctant to load prior to the start, chased three then two wide just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home and
weakened in the late stages. AMOS three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. PECATONICA three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to run, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made
no late headway. MORNING COLORS chased along the inside forwardly placed, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the
drive. SKY KITTEN saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. DIAMOND N
SIMON coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, got roused spinning three wide for home and
offered no rally. WEAR MY RING saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped out three wide through the far turn coming under a ride at the seven-sixteenths,
continued three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

RATAJKOWSKI away without apparent mishap, established the top by the top of the backstretch, slid onto the inside route, was lightly hand urged cutting
the pace, tailed by MISS MISCHIEF to the outside, continued along on the same scenario until the end of the bend, swung into the lane, arrived at the
three-sixteenths marker and was asked for her best, gave a response, emerging at the furlong holding her largest lead, saw the runner up closing in readily
late but kept going well enough long enough to prevail. MRS. ORB brushed with NO HAYNE NO GAYNE at the start, showed no ill effects from that mild
bump despite winding up at the back of the pack during the initial stages, raced three to four wide on the turn, as the widest of all, got set down at the
five-sixteenths pole, angled towards the five path spinning into the lane, closed in well down the center of the strip en route for place honors. MORE
MISCHIEF pressed the winner from the two path, was slightly wider challenging in earnest heading into the stretch, got staved off. THE GREAT JOHANNA
took up the chase from the three path, was driven four wide into the lane, proved no match. NO HAYNE NO GAYNE went over to the rail after making light
contact with the second place finisher, got roused leaving the three-eighths pole, spun approximately four wide into the lane, made no headway, then after
being placed to a protective hold, was allowed to fade away from midlane onward. ENGLISH SOUL remained stationed along the inside route after the field
had been sent off and running, went about the first half mile, appearing keen and pulling on the left, bore out badly during the run around the bend, dropping
way back, got pulled up after being eased coming into the lane, walked off the track.

Footnotes
ABBY NORMAL shied out at the start in reaction to BEANS N RICE who broke outwards and bumped with SARATOGA LULLABY, raced two to three wide
in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under
a drive closing well outside and was just up in the shadow of the wire to prevail. MENZAMENZ veered in at the start bumping LITTLE RED BUTTON into
BIG RED GIRL and forcing PIPPI to be taken in hand when pinched between those rivals hindquarters, tracked the pace along the inside, remained
patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong from home, dug in under threat and was
nailed in the very last jump to the finish. BIG RED GIRL bumped at the start by LITTLE RED BUTTON due to pressure from MENZAMENZ who veered
inwards, settled in the two path in mid pack and was clipped behind by PIPPI nearing the five-eighths pole, tossed her head in reaction for a few strides
before settling once more, remained just off the inside through the far turn on hold in behind rivals until given daylight cutting the corner into upper stretch
roused, got taken in hand briefly straightened away as LITTLE RED BUTTON came inwards before being put back to a drive, rallied up the inside with good
courage to just get her nose on the line for the show honors. LITTLE RED BUTTON broke in at the start bumping with PIPPI then got bumped herself by
MENZAMENZ veering in and in turn bumped BIG RED GIRL while forcing PIPPI to be taken in hand and pinched between foes, chased three then two wide
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, came in straightened away forcing BIG RED GIRL to be taken in
hand briefly before being corrected, dug in under a drive and offered up a mild bid to just miss the show honors by a whisker. TUCK IN broke in at the start
bumping FUNNY PURSUIT in tandem with SISTERWILLIAMAGNES, chased four wide down the backstretch, attempted to remain four wide getting out
slightly before being corrected into the turn tucking to the two path near the three-eighths, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly but was outfinished. DEVILS RENDEZVOUS three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then got outfinished in the late stages. PIPPI broke out
at the start brushing the off side stall and bumped with LITTLE RED BUTTON, then got bumped and taken in hand when pinched between foes due to
pressure from MENZAMENZ veering inwards, pulled on the bit early on and clipped heels with the back of BIG RED GIRL near the five-eighths bobbling
before being gathered up and righted, continued to be a bit headstrong down the backstretch requiring the rider to be under a hard hold at times off heels of
a rival before tipping three to four wide into the turn gaining clearance, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid before flattening out in the late going. SARATOGA LULLABY bumped at the start by ABBY NORMAL who shied out in reaction to
BEANS N RICE breaking outwards, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BEANS N RICE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in
hand just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
was collared a furlong out, then weakened through to the finish. FUNNY PURSUIT got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch and tired. SISTERWILLIAMAGNES broke out at the start bumping FUNNY PURSUIT in concert with TUCK IN, then got forced to
steady and bobbled as SARATOGA LULLABY was pushed directly in front by pressure from ABBY NORMAL, chased two to three wide from the tail of the
field, came under coaxing near the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. PASTURE PRINCESS broke on
top under coaxing before settling five paths off the inside down the backstretch in range of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.
