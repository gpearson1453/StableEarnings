Footnotes
SUSAN JONES dueled from the inside early, battled with MANDOLINE STAR through the turn, put that one away entering the drive, gained a commanding
margin at the eighth pole and was much the best while never asked. MANDOLINE STAR dueled with the winner from the outside, remained engaged
through the turn but was no match while clearly second best. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH chased the early pace from the inside but could only hold position.
BROOKLYN'S GRIP went evenly. GLITTER TIME ducked in at the gap, hit the rail, recovered, steadily advanced through the turn and finished belatedly.
BREEZIN BYE YOU was never close.
