COLONIAL CREED hopped in a bit of a slow start, saved ground stalking the pace, split horses into the stretch, came out in upper stretch and rallied under
urging between foes in deep stretch to get up approaching the wire. MAXIM RATE chased outside a rival then three deep on the second turn and into the
stretch, rallied four wide in deep stretch and continued willingly to the wire. AMUSE sped to the early lead, drifted out into the first turn then angled in and set
the pace a bit off the rail, fought back inside on the second turn, inched away again in the stretch and held on well to deep stretch then saved the show.
DUPIONI (IRE) saved ground stalking the pace, went outside a rival on the second turn and three wide into the stretch, was between horses in deep stretch
and was edged for third. MISS HOT LEGS a step slow to begin, pulled three deep early then stalked outside a rival, bid alongside the pacesetter on the
second turn and between foes iinto the stretch and was outfinished. ZEE DROP pulled between horses then a bit off the rail, angled in on the first turn and
stalked inside, continued along the fence in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.

Footnotes
MY GIRL RED had speed between horses then angled in and dueled inside, drew clear in the stretch and proved best under a strong hand ride and steady
handling late. MISS BAYLEE bumped at the start, chased outside a rival then off the rail on the turn, came three deep into the stretch, drifted in some and
was clearly second best. MIZ LOLA LA DARE had speed inside foes then stalked off the rail, angled in some leaving the turn and edged rivals for the show.
JEANNE B four wide early, angled in and dueled outside the winner to the stretch, drifted to the inside in the final furlong and was edged for third. BRIO IS
AWESOME bumped at the start, chased inside, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and put in a late bid at a minor award. SUPER STEAMY
dropped back off the rail on the backstretch and turn, came out into the stretch and failed to menace.

BAD BEAT sped to the early lead, set the pace inside, met a pair of bids on the turn, inched away a quarter mile out, came a bit off the rail into the stretch,
drifted in a bit in the drive and held on gamely under some urging. SUMMER FIRE angled in and saved ground stalking the pace, came out some a
sixteenth out and continued willingly. SHOOTIN MONEY stalked just off the rail, bid between horses then outside the winner on the turn, continued outside
the runner-up in midstretch and held third. PROMISE NOTHING angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out into the stretch and again in upper

CRYSTAL BALL sped to the early lead, angled in and set all the pace along the inside, shook clear again when rivals loomed into the second turn and drew
off in the stretch under a couple cracks of the whip and steady handling then a long hold late. LAST FIRST KISS sent inside then came off the rail in the run
to the first turn, stalked just off the inside to the stretch and was clearly second best. VIA ANGELICA three deep into the first turn, stalked outside the
runner-up to the stretch and just held third. DOLCI angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out on the second turn and into the stretch and was
edged for the show.

Footnotes
DOGTAG pulled between horses and steadied nearing the wire the first time, chased outside a rival then three deep into and on the second turn and four
wide into the stretch, took the lead outside the pacesetter in upper stretch, drifted in and inched clear and held under a couple taps of the whip and energetic
handling. DON'T BLAME JUDY angled in and chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, split horses into the second turn, came out
four wide into the stretch, also drifted in some and got up for the place. PRETTY POINT angled in on the hill and saved ground chasing the pace, came out
leaving the second turn and into the stretch, angled out again in upper stretch and finished well to be edge for second. DESERT OASIS (GB) pulled to the
early lead, set the pace inside, fought back in upper stretch, continued willingly in deep stretch and was outfinished for a minor award late. STRIKE AT
DAWN tugged three deep then stalked outside a rival, went up three wide leaving the second turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
STREAK OF LUCK pressed the pace outside a rival then stalked just off t he rail to the stretch, was between foes in upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. OUT OF BALANCE saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back in the stretch and also weakened.
