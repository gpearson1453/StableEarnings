pressed the pace two wide into the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and lost ground. COTTONWOOD CANYON bobbled at the start and

REINVESTEDINTEREST prompted the pace two wide into the turn, assumed command before the five sixteenths pole, drifted in through upper stretch and
won as much the best while in hand. MACADOOOO KID stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide, drifted in despite left handed urging near the
sixteenth pole and finished. SOMETHING SACRED close up from the start, rallied two wide into the stretch, was shut off nearing the sixteenth pole while
along the rail and finished with good courage. BRILLIANTBENNY failed to menace. BELTON AVE bore in at the start then was no threat.
CHILLINLIKAVILLIN was bumped and shut off at the start then no factor. ADMIRAL GLEN bore in at the start bumping hard with CHILLINLIKAVILLIN, set
the pace along the rail into the turn then stopped. THE RIDER OF SOMETHING SACRED LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
MACADOOOO KID FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MACADOOOO KID AND PLACED HIM
