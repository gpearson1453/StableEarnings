Footnotes
W W KAN DO hesitated at the break, advanced outside to soon share the lead, moved clear and angled in to be just off the rail on the turn, was under a
drive in the lane and widened command the final eighth. MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET hustled to stay close while toward the outside on the backstretch,
advanced three wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the turn, was no match for the leader in the stretch but stayed clear for the place. PETEIZUM
contested the early pace between rivals, did not keep up on the turn, fanned outside MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET for the stretch run then battled outside G G'S
SECONDCHANCE for third. G G'S SECONDCHANCE displayed early speed from inside, also did not stay with W W KAN DO on the turn, found himself
boxed in upper stretch, his rider lost his whip after entering the last furlong and did not gain a clear path until seventy yards out. DATA BREACH was an
early factor from outside, lost ground on the turn, drifted out to the middle of the track for the stretch run and had little to offer. TRUE TEN was a brief
contender from inside but gave way with three furlongs to go. INGE urged along just off the rail on the backstretch, gave way from inside on the bend.

Footnotes
MY FOUROONE KPLAN jostled briefly with WADDLE at the break, quickly recovered to contest the pace inside rivals, stayed off the rail taking the bend
and shed BOOHOO SUE under a drive inside the last furlong. BOOHOO SUE pressed from between horses, went to MY FOUROONE KPLAN from outside
on the turn, fought to inside the eighth pole, did not have enough left but was clearly second best. SHOWIT broke outward, also jostling with WADDLE, had
the rail on the bend, swung out between horses for the drive, steadily progressed and gained third. WOOD NOT MIND passed outside tired ones in the
stretch. TOUR ON was an early factor from inside, came off the rail some for the turn then flattened out the last furlong. ELIZABETH'S FEVER displayed
early speed from outside, lost ground four to six wide through the turn then flattened out for the drive. CUDDLE ME somewhat awkward at the break, failed
to menace. ECO STAR prominent between rivals, was steadied when her path was taken into the turn, altered in and steadily yielded. WADDLE was
shuffled back at the start, saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
MARYS LAST SONG was kept close between horses, went for the lead outside MIZ BLUE, dueled with that one in the stretch and edged ahead inside the
last furlong. LIPLINER prominent early, had the inside on the bend, altered out midstretch for a clear path and got up for second. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS
stumbled at the break, lost ground into the lane but closed well. MIZ BLUE broke in stride and sprinted clear, was challenged on the bend and flattened out
the final eighth. B REWARDING was reluctant to load, chased from outside once the race began and failed to have a late bid between rivals. ROCK THE
BIRDHOUSE saved ground on the bend then could only improve position just off the inside in the lane without threatening. BELLA MY ELLA chased from
midpack just off the rail through the bend and had no serious stretch bid. BOBBIE TOO TOO raced in the second flight from outside, was three wide on the
turn and gave way for the drive. TAP'S LULLABY faded from inside on the bend. N ARIANNA ATTACK showed little.

Footnotes
DON'T DALLY vied for the lead from outside, was kept wide staying outside MORA VALLEY through the bend, battled in the stretch and edged ahead
nearing the wire. MORA VALLEY set a pressured pace off the rail, was engaged from outside on the turn, drifted out further entering the stretch, fought
gamely under steady urging but had to settle for second best. TEMPLESIS in contention early between rivals, was three wide on the bend, lacked a serious
stretch bid but got up for third late. COOLER SCHEDULE without early speed, improved position from path three on the turn, swung out further for the drive
and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. TOMASITA prominent between horses, moved to the rail into the bend, did not keep up through the turn and
ran evenly from inside in the stretch. MISS LEARJET in contention early between horses, advanced four wide on the turn then ran evenly through the lane.
LION'S WAGER just off the inside taking the turn, failed to have a significant stretch response. D'CODE'M forwardly placed outside, faded widest on the
turn. DANCING WELL gave way from inside on the bend.

Footnotes
I'VE GOT ISSUES without early speed from between horses, swung to the outside entering the bend, was widest through the turn, surged from the middle
of the track in the lane and swept past PRAISEM with fifty yards to go. PRAISEM forwardly placed outside, advanced outside BROWN SHOES on the turn,
took over from between rivals inside the last furlong, did not have enough left and was outfinished. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN in contention early, did not keep
up three wide on the bend, swung outside PRAISEM for the stretch run and found best stride too late. HELEN MAE'S SONG well placed along the rail,
angled out some and dropped back through the turn, came again between rivals to threaten midstretch but leveled off in the waning yards. ALLEY 'O
MALLEY chased from outside, improved position just off the inside on the turn, swung out behind PRAISEM for the stretch run and showed late interest.
ARCTIC MUSIC set a pressured pace between rivals on the backstretch, moved clear on the turn then wore down the final furlong. BROWN SHOES
pressed from between horses early, did not keep up into the turn, moved to the rail, also regained a striking position upper stretch but flattened out instead.
RULER RUNAWAY failed to menace from just off the inside. LADY FURBEIN chased from outside, came into the lane from path four and had no late bid.
DANCING HIGH faded from inside on the bend.

SPLASH FOR GOLD contested the pace outside AT GUARD from the early going, battled in the lane, edged ahead with seventy yards left and held off
LOST IN MANHATTAN. The later was forwardly placed between horses from the beginning, followed SPLASH FOR GOLD on the bend, fanned outside that
one into the stretch, rallied belatedly but caught AT GUARD for second. AT GUARD disputed the pace from the start between rivals, fought through the
stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. BRADDOCK forwardly placed from outside, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend and
gradually wore down through the stretch. SUMMERDUCK stumbled at the start, advanced two wide on the turn to gain a striking position midstretch but
leveled off in the late going. FORT RIDGE chased from outside, improved position three wide on the bend, lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of
the track for the stretch run and leveled off the last furlong. TAP FEVER vied for the lead from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn and
flattened out the final eighth. VOLGOGRAD showed little in a wide trip. SERIOUS TALK steadily faded from inside.

Footnotes
GREAT GRET rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, steadily widened command through the stretch and was kept to
task to the wire. HE'S THUNDER chased from midpack, advanced between rivals in close quarters four wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane
and gained second. DONNER PASS lugging in through the early going, bumped a couple times with UNBRIDLED RULER, was checked and altered in,
advanced two wide on the turn, progressed inside horses in the lane, fought for second deep stretch but was outfinished. PRIME NITE prominent early, was
three to four wide through the bend, took over second leaving the turn then lacked the extra needed deep stretch to hold his position. HONEYDOLIST three
wide on the turn, showed a willingness to run late from between rivals. TREASURE NAP moved to the outside early on, was widest through the turn then
closed the gap on the second flight deep stretch. PISINERO bumped with GALAHAD KID near the half mile marker, did not keep up two wide on the bend
but also showed interest in closing the last furlong. UNBRIDLED RULER was bumped a couple times midway on the backstretch, advanced five wide on the
turn, fanned out further into the stretch and flattened. GALAHAD KID bumped with PISINERO nearing the half mile marker and soon gave way along the
rail. PACIFIC SONG displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with GREAT GRET on the turn and steadily faded the last two furlongs.
