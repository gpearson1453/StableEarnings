REGAL LADY pressed the pace early, bid three wide to get on terms into the stretch, inched away under urging to mid stretch and held stubbornly.
PROPEPPY chased the pace inside to mid turn, shifted out three wide into the stretch, could not impact the winner but gamely held off GAMBLER'S
APPEAL for second. GAMBLER'S APPEAL was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch then also could not menace the winner,
battled for the place but missed. SUGARSEEKER had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. TIZFIT chased the pace
outside of PROPEPPY, was two wide to the stretch then came up empty. COLONEL DEERING hustled to set the pace to the turn, was collared while racing
off the rail to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DRAW ME chased the pace to the turn, was three wide then swung out widest for the drive, rallied when set down, failed to switch leads but closed steadily
to prevail. SADIE BLUEGRASS was on the pace from the outset, raced two then three wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then could not hold off
the winner but saved second. HABOBANERO hustled to duel outside of SADIE BLUEGRASS to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly late. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, was roused inside rivals in the
drive but did not threaten. SURELY A SMILE attended the pace inside two others to mid turn, was two wide into the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch
and weakened. GOING TO SHABOOMS had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SILVER FURY had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded to pressure to inside the furlong grounds then was eased up in the
final hundred yards. SINGLE BARREL pressed the winner throughout, was three wide to the stretch then did not threaten but was easily second best. GEM
STATE stalked the pace to the half, raced three wide while being outrun to the stretch and came up empty in the drive. TEQUILA BLANCO got outsprinted
to the backstretch, moved closer inside rivals to the second turn then continued to save ground to the stretch but gave way. FORT YORK was never far
back the half, raced four wide on the second turn then tired after six furlongs. ONE EYED ROBIN had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REY COLIMAN was unhurried to the second turn, bid four wide then swung out six deep into the stretch, rallied to catch DIRT ROAD RED leaving mid
stretch, could not shake loose but dug in stubbornly to hold. DIRT ROAD RED was settled for a half mile, rallied two wide to the stretch, pushed to the front
in mid stretch but was quickly collared by the winner leaving the furlong grounds but refused to give up and battled gamely to the line. TURNAROUND
pressed the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, was overtaken nearing mid stretch and weakened. MAGIC RATE trailed to the second
turn, was four then five wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. PURELY POLITICAL was chasing for a half mile, raced three wide to the stretch
but gave way in the drive. FUZZY DOLPHIN hustled to the first turn, dueled three wide to the second turn but tired after six furlongs. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE
settled mid pack, dropped back on the second turn and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR pressed the pace three wide, drifted out slightly into the stretch, rallied to duel in mid stretch then dug in gamely to prevail. MY FATHER
FOOTSTEP chased the leaders to the turn, was four wide then shifted five wide outside the winner into the stretch, rallied determinedly but was second
best. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was close up early but had to check between rivals, tracked the pace two wide to the stretch, loomed boldly in mid stretch
then came up empty. THE LATTE FACTOR chased the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied inside three rivals to loom a threat to mid stretch then
weakened. DI LAURIAN had no speed, was three wide on the turn, swung out for the drive but did not threaten. AHIMAAZ hustled to contest the pace off
the rail to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and tired. JERSEYS BIG GIRL was choppy early, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. RUN IT TO
WIN had no speed and showed little. The rider on MY FATHER FOOTSTEP lodged an objection against the winner for alleged interference into the stretch
but the claim was not allowed by the stewards.

COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) went right to the front, set all the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded and held under steady urging. FABRIANA had
no speed, settled to the second turn, advanced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but held second. BABY FRANKIE also had no
speed, was fanned five wide to the stretch but could not impact late. RATE FOR ME was outrun for a half mile, raced three wide on the second turn but
came up empty in the drive. AZTEC WARRIOR chased the pace four wide for six furlongs then came up empty. MR. DIPLOMAT was outsprinted to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but gave way in the lane. COOL HUNTER pressed the winner for six furlongs then gave
out. KATZUMOTO had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ILLAPAWNIE was never far back, rallied inside DARLING DEMON into the stretch to gain command and extended her advantage driving. SENORITA
ESTRELLA pressed the pace from the outside, had a bid into the lane but could not match strides with the winner. DARLING DEMON set the pace from off
the rail and slackened in the stretch. TIBBY GEE was unhurried early,came three wide to the stretch and had no response. CULTURED PEARL lagged
early, angled three wide on the turn but failed to reach contention. HEATSKY was never a serious factor and raced four wide on the turn.
