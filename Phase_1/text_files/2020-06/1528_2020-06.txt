Footnotes
TOP HAT SCRUTINY sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, held a clear advantage around the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and was
kept to his business in the stretch run. LUCERITO prompted the pace outside the winner in a willing effort. DAPER'S DRINK , four wide the first turn, chased
the pace three wide around the far turn and tired through the stretch. CECIL THE LION lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn and failed to be a
factor. RUNNER RUNNER INDY broke through the starting gate before the race then was outrun. ALEPH , three wide the first turn, was under urging along
the inner rail near the three eighths pole and retreated through the stretch. YIKES , three wide the first turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
THREE QUARTER TIME broke sharply then was rated back off the leader and angled out, prompted two wide under good handling, bid to apply pressure
leaving the far turn, wrested command in upper stretch, drew clear heading to the eighth pole, widened under right handed rousing approaching the
sixteenth marker then held firm. ROCKSTAR GIRL stalked inside, eased out for the drive and kept on willingly to gain the place in the final seventy yards.
BOURBON GAL cleared around the first turn then dropped in to set the pace, was joined by the winner leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane then gave
way grudgingly in the final yards. AWESOME JAZZ settled off the pace while saving ground, awaited room from the three eighths to about the quarter pole,
swung out soon into the lane, straightened and finished with good energy to gain. TIDE STORM stalked the pace three wide, was under pressure into the
lane and faded in the final furlong. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE was floated out nearing the first turn, lost ground four to five wide and lacked a bid. BIZ
SMARTS broke slowly then steadied soon after, regrouped to settle well back, circled the final turn but lacked a rally. POLISHED COPPER failed to
menace. FAIRY WISH saved ground and gave way. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY , rank and difficult to handle early, was steadied along into the backstretch,
chased to the far turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
FUSED gained a stalking position off the inside, edged up into the far turn, was under a strong ride chasing the leader past the five sixteenths, moved to
engage soon into the lane, took over under stout left handed rousing heading to the furlong grounds, edged clear inside the sixteenth pole, wandered
outward and held sway. MINT GAME , taken to rate while saving ground, shifted out near the far turn, advanced three wide into the lane, continued
progression past mid stretch, dropped in some late and finished gamely. BACK CHARGE prompted the early issue outside SWEET ASTA, took over from
that one entering the backstretch, cleared soon after, set the pace towards the fence, was joined in upper stretch, dueled past mid stretch and faded late.
EJE GAMA , three deep the first turn, remained three wide making a mild run past the three eighths, chased the leaders into the lane but came up empty.
SWEET ASTA led early, ceded into the backstretch while along the inner rail, chased to the far turn then gave way. ORBONTHEBAYOU , between rivals
early, was not a factor. IN AWE AGAIN dropped inside early, lagged back, angled out leaving the far turn but lacked a response. MEADOW MAGIC saved
ground early and was outrun. ONE REAL COWBOY failed to menace. FLASHARINO gave early pursuit while saving ground and faltered.

LEONA lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, angled to the eight path turning for home, floated to the ten path in mid stretch and rallied late. COBH ,
three wide chasing the pace around the turn, had aim on the lead between horses in mid stretch and lacked the necessary late response. SAPPHIRE
SHILLING bumped with LUCID DREAM leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace two wide and weakened late. DEDICATED raced between horses in the
stretch and flattened out. TWIN VALOR saved ground on the turn, angled off the rail turning for home, challenged for the lead between horses near the
eighth pole and weakened in the drive. QUIT YOUR MOANIN , between horses in the stretch run, failed to rally. UNEQUIVOCAL , four wide on the turn,
floated to the six path turning for home and lacked a rally. BEST OFFER disputed the pace racing near the rail and weakend. LUCID DREAM bumped with
SAPPHIRE SHILLING leaving the starting gate, raced in the seven path turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
FIYA broke sharply, was confidently handled outside the leader, drew alongside without asking mid turn, seized command in upper stretch, spurted clear
when put to urging near the three sixteenths, eagerly widened under a drive leaving mid stretch and was kept alert to the finish. CHAUFFEUR had speed to
the inside of a rival early on, eased back off the leader into the turn and tracked under rating, moved off the inside near mid stretch and continued willingly to
be second best. DREAMING OF CARATS set a pressured pace inside, was no match for the winner leaving the quarter pole, stayed willingly to the
sixteenth marker then faded. MAKOTO stalked the pace, raced between runners into the lane but lacked a solid finish. ROYAL THUNDER edged up three
deep early on, stalked the leaders mid turn, came under pressure into the stretch, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded late. ARTISTIC REASON
lacked speed, saved ground throughout and lacked a bid. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN rated three wide, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
KARAN'S NOTION broke slowly, was a bit keen between rivals early and failed to menace. LOCK , four wide outside rivals raced in range to the head of the
lane then faded. CATTY LAD was outrun.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KILLMAIN , off the pace, angled out leaving the far turn, moved up between rivals past the three sixteenths, leveled off when put to right handed
rousing, drew alongside TANDA'S JOY approaching the sixteenth marker, battled outside that one under strong hand encouragement and earned a narrow
decision in the final yards. TANDA'S JOY relaxed in range while saving ground, angled out in upper stretch, bid to gain a slim lead outside the leader soon
past mid stretch, dug in when confronted soon after, fought valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. EIFS , unhurried early off the inside, circled under hand
pressure into the lane and offered a belated response. GLORIA'S GAL saved ground, angled out in upper stretch, shifted in briefly, altered back out and
rallied mildly. LADY ROZINA pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the lane, shook clear past the quarter pole, could not resist TANDA'S JOY
leaving the furlong grounds and gave way. MARIE FROM PARIE stalked the leaders three wide, remained in range to upper stretch then retreated. JERSEY
LIFE stalked outside a rival, angled four wide into the lane and weakened. BRUJA BUG sped to the front, was joined into the turn, handled outside pressure
around the turn, lost command into the lane and faltered.

TIGHTLY TWISTED saved ground around the turns, eased out to the two path turning for home and rallied mildly between horses. NOT IN JEOPARDY ,
two wide the far turn, raced between horses in the stretch and flattened out. IONIC set an easy pace, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and in the
stretch and faltered approaching the eighth pole. MADAME X. , three deep the far turn, gave way.

Footnotes
GODLOVESASINNER chased the pace three wide, moved up into the lane, shifted out a bit, sustained under right handed rousing and moved to the front a
sixteenth from home, kept on under a drive and dug in to narrowly prevail. START WITH YES drafted back off the pace after a good beginning, saved
ground around the turn and into the lane, shifted out past the quarter pole, moved up to contention leaving the furlong grounds, switched over to his left lead
with a sixteenth to go, kept on and just missed. GEYSER , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, angled out five to six wide and closed steadily.
NAUTICAL NATURE , sent to the front, set a solid pace towards the inside, spurted away a bit past the three sixteenths, was headed a sixteenth out and
faded. EL DULCE pressed the pace two wide, was under pressure into the lane, continued effort past the furlong marker but went evenly in the final yards.
YOU CAN NEVER TELL stalked the pace while saving ground, moved up some into the stretch then faded in the final sixteenth. MYSTIC TIMES , two to
three wide, was not a factor. WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY , bumped at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to recover. DAPPER MUN broke outward
and bumped with LAWN BOY (GB), dropped well off the pace and failed to respond. LAWN BOY (GB) , off slow when rank, was bumped and pinched soon
after and failed to overcome the early adversity.
