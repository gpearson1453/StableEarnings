Footnotes
EL SENOR DE LATUNA held the rail pressing dueling rivals, and dug in late to hold of rival. HARPER'S GEM dueled three wide throughout, entered the
stretch two wide, and was drifting out under urging late. OVERKOTER chased rivals in between, lacked room from the five sixteenths marker to the quarter
pole, once in the clear responded willingly to urging. SOUND CHECKERS bobbled and bumped at the start, settled in behind two wide, responded well to
urging and finishing well in between rivals. LOST THE MINISTER stalked the pace three wide, entered the turn four wide, drifted out into the stretch five
wide and had no rally under urging. NAHOY settled along the rail, entered the lane two wide, responded mildly to urging while passing tiring foe.
STARTLING hopped and bumped at the break, rushed to lead in between to duel with rival, started to tire at three sixteenths pole and was hand ridden
through the lane. CANADIAN WARRIOR broke out and bumped break, did not respond to whip urging on backside, entered the stretch two wide and was
hand ridden to the finish.

SEA GLASS chased rival two wide, headed rival at top of lane and responded well to urging and pulled away nicely. SHE BE FIRE N ICE broke sharp and
cleared easily, held rail throughout turn, headed at top of the lane and gamely fought and tired last sixteenth. IN IT FOR LIFE chased pace four wide early,
and angled in to the rail early in the turn, stayed on rail entering the lane and held third under steady urging. BAYONCE chased the pace in between rivals,
entered the turn three wide, and drifted out into the lane five wide, and weakened under urging. PLAYA CHICA lacked speed under hand shove early, held
rail throughout the turn and never threatened. KATHIA settled in the back two wide, was under urging in the turn, entered the stretch three wide and was
hand ridden to the finish.
