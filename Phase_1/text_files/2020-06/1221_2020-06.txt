WRITTEN was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the five path through the stretch was kept to task. GLORIOUS FREEDOM showed no speed
and had a mild gain on the turn but was no match for the winner. D'WONDERFUL was up close and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no late kick. PERFECT ROAD dueled early but chased on the turn and had nothing left.

PERFECT MINE showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and drew clear late. NOT A HOUSE FRAU tracked the leader, was a factor on the
turn and was second best in a good effort. AWESOME FLIGHT was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was
no real threat. PENNIESFROMABOVE had no speed and saved ground on the turn but had no rally. STORMY SUZIE was well back and showed little in a
dull effort. MY FINAL TRICK was in touch but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
PACHAMAMA set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path through the stretch was much the best. SECRET TRICK had no speed, was
hustled along on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. EXPRESS BANKING stalked the early leader and raced evenly
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. SECRETARIATS HONOR was unhurried early and trailed the field on the turn but
passed tired foes through the stretch. DIXIE BREW was away alertly and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
IT'SNICETOBENICE was in range early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

CHILITO PIQUIN was settled off the pace, roused on the turn, a factor in mid stretch and drew off. YALLHAVEANICEDAY set a pressured pace and dueled
on the turn but was no match for the winner in deep stretch. BALDUR showed no speed and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch needed more. BEEN WAITING was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes.
OMAR was up close and a factor from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. BIG BAND BENNY broke
poorly and had a slim lead on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.
