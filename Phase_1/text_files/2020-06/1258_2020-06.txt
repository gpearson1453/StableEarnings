Footnotes
RAVENEL stalked the pace under confident handling, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead outside FENDER BABY near the sixteenth pole then drove
clear. FENDER BABY , quickly clear after an alert break, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN , in the hand
of an assistant starter when the field broke, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied. CANOOCHEE hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled out in
upper stretch and failed to menace in an even effort. TRIMMED IN GREY , two wide around the turn while chasing the pace, weakened the final furlong.
CASE DISMISSED hugged the inner rail around the turn while outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry, DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN was declared a non starter
for pari mutuel purposes and raced for purse money only.

Footnotes
CAROUSEL MARGE , with the pace three deep to the turn, emerged in a duel outside PRINCESS ANNE past the half mile marker, gained a slim lead into
the lane, responded when put to a stout drive past the quarter pole, edged clear a furlong out and held firm while kept to task. SAYYIDA AL HURRA sparred
between runners, rated back near the half mile pole, shifted out three wide and had aim into the lane, kept on willingly but was second best. PRINCESS
ANNE hopped at the break to be away slowly, was sent up inside rivals leaving the chute and contested the pace, held a short advantage mid turn, kept up
the fight past the three sixteenths then faded. BROKEN ENGLISH , within range of the dueling leaders into the turn, failed to kick on around the turn and
retreated.

had a mild advance entering the stretch then gave way. COOL MAN CLETUS , swung to the four path in upper stretch, lacked a rally. JERICHO MARSH ,
three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. NAUTICAL NATURE , two wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. AWESOME AT

RAPIDASHQUEEN , brushed at the break, was sent up between foes to take command, sped clear heading to the half mile pole, moved away around the
turn, opened up a solid margin while under a drive in mid stretch and was kept to task. LE PETITE PAPILLON broke a bit slow, showed good acceleration to
recover, saved ground chasing the winner, moved up past the eighth pole and continued gamely to bridge the gap. KHALOS VISION chased two to three
wide, swung five wide for the drive and offered a mild response. MOUSE CAT hopped a bit at the break, angled in towards the fence in the opening furlong,
continued inside from there and churned on. FILLE D'ESPRIT , five wide outside rivals early on, made a four wide run past the five sixteenths, chased past
mid stretch then came up empty late. THIRSTY AGAIN , brushed at the break, saved ground in mid pack and lacked a bid. AIM FOR THE STARS , away
alertly, chased the winner while two to three wide and gave way in the final sixteenth. HOSS KITTEN steadied nearing the turn, dropped in soon after but
failed to respond. LUNA DE FUEGO failed to pose a threat after racing four wide into the lane. PADRINA , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

WONDRWHERECRAIGIS broke a bit slow, quickly recovered and moved up between rivals to be in range, advanced three wide outside a pair of foes
heading to the quarter pole, shifted out a bit wider into the lane, responded when put to a strong left handed drive in mid stretch, closed determinedly and
forged past late. DAY THE MUSIC DIED broke a step slow, hustled up and tracked, bid three deep mid turn, took over with a quarter to go, spurted away
under a drive past three sixteenths but failed to last the final yards. SEANY P checked near the five eighths pole, recovered and advanced while saving
ground mid turn, eased out to progress between runners into the lane, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds then flattened out in deep stretch. CAREY
TIMES had speed and prompted the pace outside OFF THE RECORD, took over leaving the far turn, was taken on from his outside soon after, ceded the
lead entering the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. THATWOULDBEGRAND , off the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch
and offered a mild kick between rivals. COUSIN JIMMY chased three wide and lacked a solid run. GLORY SONG , off the pace and off the rail leaving the
far turn, angled four wide into the lane but failed to generate the needed run. CLASSY SOLUTION was lightly steadied soon after the break, dropped back
nearing the turn, raced wide in the drive but did not pose a threat. OFF THE RECORD sped to command along the rail, was hounded into the turn, lost the
lead three furlongs out, stayed on to about the quarter pole then faltered.

HARPERS FIRST RIDE stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead outside JOHN JONES in upper stretch, drew away under brisk, right
hand urging and switched to his left lead inside the sixteenth pole. TYBALT saved ground around the turn, was taken to the three path in upper stretch and
rallied. JOHN JONES prompted the pace two wide on the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch and gradually weakened in the drive. TOUGHEST
'OMBRE set the pace along the rail and steadily weakened the final quarter mile. CHARGIN STORM , fanned wide turning for home, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SACRED LADY saved ground within range, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, got through and challenged along the rail in mid stretch, wrested
command near the sixteenth marker and edged clear late under a drive. MAKE IT A DOUBLE had speed inside to contest the early pace, eased back off the
leader nearing the half mile marker, angled out, rebid three wide, took command then went clear after a half mile, wandered outward while battling past the
eighth pole, had her rider briefly lose his right rein in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. ZIG , taken to rate, advanced four wide to loom past the five
sixteenths, pursued into the lane and kept trying to the line. GO AMANDA , off the pace while between runners into the turn, angled four wide making some
headway into the lane but failed to seriously sustain. OLIVE'S BUMPA , four wide between rivals leaving the far turn, offered a mild response.
DON'TBAGGAGECHECK bobbled at the break but wasn't that affected, vied outside MAKE IT A DOUBLE before going clear heading to the half mile
marker, set the pace two wide, was joined mid turn, stayed willingly to upper stretch then gave way. IT'S SO EASY broke a step slow, was hustled inside
and failed to respond. MILLIE CHILD was steadied between runners early, checked off heels leaving the three eighths pole, came three wide for the drive
but failed to recover. PASSION'S IMAGE lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane but failed to rally. HEELSTOTHESKY , four wide chasing the
leaders, raced five wide into the lane and faltered. HARD ROCKIN BLUES , sluggish from the start, was urged along while very wide but was outrun.

UPLIFTING broke sharply and was clear early on, was joined by rivals and took some pressure past the five eighths, went back clear nearing the half mile
pole, was well rated about two wide, thwarted a challenge from HIS NAME IS SUE nearing the lane, kicked away after being set down right handed in upper
stretch then held firm through the final furlong. HIS NAME IS SUE moved up outside rivals nearing the turn, prompted the winner three wide, was denied
past the quarter pole but stayed willingly to preserve the place. SPARTY chased between foes mid turn, had his rider lose the whip in mid stretch then
continued on with interest to just nab the show. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR saved ground, edged up nearing mid stretch but failed to sustain. KINGSTON PIKE
, four wide, made a mild run into the stretch then flattened out. SOUND OFF , off the pace, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. TEN HUT , an
early factor while between rivals, rated back past the five eighths, dropped further back leaving the far turn and failed to respond. NO MORE TALK, inside
rivals, was shuffled back nearing the turn, angled out near the furlong grounds but failed to recover
