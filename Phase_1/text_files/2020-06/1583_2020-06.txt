Footnotes
FU ROO away alertly, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run through the final furlong
to win going away under a strong hand ride. IT'S A MANS WORLD well placed, offered a mild bid in the five path into the stretch then was no match for the
winner while second best. OLE WATASHI stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the three path. TAPSHOT unhurried early, had a mild late
rally in the five path. JUST CHESTER broke in front, dropped inside, set the pace into the turn, chased the winner until mid stretch then weakened. DOUGS
MORNING PICK went evenly. CHOCOLATE PHILLING was no factor. SLICK SIX inside, got out down the backstretch and failed to reach contention. BOLD
CHASE had speed into the turn then gave way. DOUGIE D ORO bore in at the start, quickly lost contact with his field, pulled up before three sixteenths and
was walked off.

THREE ILLUSIONS broke outward, shifted outside the leaders, stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the
stretch, drifted out through the final furlong and won under a strong hand ride. SPRING CITY GAL unhurried early, swung wide entering the stretch, drifted
back inward to the four path under right handed urging and rallied for second near the five path. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY chased the pace from the three
path for five furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out past the five path and was outfinished. KENNEDIE SKY hit the gate then
stumbled a few strides out and was no threat. RACINROSEMARY failed to menace. ALPHABETTING away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the far
turn and weakened in the stretch. CIPHERIN' SUE was outrun. MISS D IRISH was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN

winner three then two wide and finished clear for second in the four path. SHAKURR never far back, finished with good courage in the five path. GOT GRIT
trailed from the start and closed a gap late near the inside. ADVENTUROUS FOX failed to menace. MR JOSHUA within striking distance along the inside,
shifted out to the five path on the turn then lacked the needed response. SOUL OF DISCRETION dueled for the lead between rivals two wide into the turn
then gave way. SKIBBEREEN was through early.

passed tiring rivals in the eight path through deep stretch. A PERFECT SKY pressed the pace three wide while out in the five path and faded in the stretch.
PINK HALDER had speed for a half then weakened. A FABULOUS KISS with the second flight three wide, lacked the needed response. DIVA POWER was
unprepared start, broke without her rider and was declared a non starter. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW
DECLARED DIVA POWER A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
COSI MOMOSI settled just off the leaders four wide, dropped back a bit before the turn, came on again late three wide under right handed urging and got up
in the strides. EASY EYES broke slowly, rallied three then two wide through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. NOT REGRET away alertly, set a
pressured pace two wide into the stretch, shook clear and was outfinished in the final strides. MISS IRISH BOSS prompted the early pace three wide then
went evenly. TIN CAN ALLIE pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. DREAM ON GORGEOUS trailed.
