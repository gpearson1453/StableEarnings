TRISTAN'S GOLD broke in and bumped lightly with a foe, showed good speed and disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn,
shook clear while coming off the rail into upper stretch, drew off under the whip into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. DOC'S
DENITA was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, moved in while urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, slipped through inside of a foe
near the five-sixteenths, came off the rail into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SILVER COIN broke out at the start,
chased the pace on the outside, inched closer passing the seven-sixteenths, vied three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened
while able to get the show. MS. RED ROCKETTE was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail under a drive
inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. ENFANT DE PACQUE showed speed and disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, dropped back
while two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and tired. GOLDEN PAREE broke in and bumped with a rival, was urged along on the
outside, chased four wide on the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch and capitulated. THEWHISKEYWORKED bumped lightly with a foe at the start,
was ridden along at the rear of the field, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and
failed to threaten. TWIRLING AROUND reared very badly just prior to the gate opening, unseated the rider then remained in the gate while attended to by
the assistant starter and was walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the start, TWIRLING AROUND was determined to have caused her own problem
at the start and no change was made.

Footnotes
SIMPLE PLEASURE went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, stalked the leader in the two path on the far turn, took the
advantage coming to the three-sixteenths, moved clear briefly into upper stretch before being challenged by the runner-up, battled with that foe in the final
furlong then bumped nearing the wire and narrowly prevailed. WENEEDTOTALK was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, saved ground on the
first turn, settled off the pace, steadied briefly leaving the backstretch then was roused on the inside, shifted three wide near the quarter-pole, rallied four
wide into the stretch, made an outside bid around the eighth-pole, battled with the winner in the final furlong, bumped with that opponent nearing the wire
and just missed while clear for the place. SUNDANCE SEVEN bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide early on the first turn, dropped to the two
path then the rail later on that bend, settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished
willingly to narrowly earn the show. TENTHOUSANDREASONS was bumped at the start and forced in, tossed his head into the first turn then was given a
crack of the whip, went three wide on that bend, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into
the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the show. EYE ON HARPER bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back while in a bit tight,
went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back on the outside, was ridden along while four then five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed
kick then was taken up crossing the wire. SHE'S TOO COOL went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the inside of a foe, took the
lead nearing the seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail on the far turn, lost the advantage around the three-sixteenths and tired. BUTTON MUSHROOM broke
in and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside under some urging, moved in near the half-mile pole, was ridden along in the two
path early on the far turn then shifted four wide and failed to respond. SEXY DANCE rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was urged
along while three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. TIZ THE STORM went around the first turn in the five path, set the pace on the outside, lost the
lead near the seven-sixteenths and stopped. R T ALAMO went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty while four then
five wide on the far turn and retreated. Following a stewards' inquiry and a rider claim of foul by the rider of WENEEDTOTALK against SIMPLE PLEASURE,
no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
FREEDOM HILL bumped with a rival at the start, set the pace under some pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked for her best
in upper stretch and held under strong urging. MADELYN'S WILD MAX was urged along towards the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, went four
wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to garner the place. HE'S A RANGER was hustled from the start then urged
along off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide while advancing and finished with good
courage but missed the place while clear for the show. KANSAS CITY ZIP moved up to press the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the three path
on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. DEVILS HALO chased the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and lacked
the needed kick. FAFA was urged along while well back, moved out near the half-mile pole went five wide on the turn and was outrun. TRE LEE DIVINE
was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. JUSTAS LOUD bumped with a rival at
the start and was slow into stride while last away, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
KANDY GINGER disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four path on the turn, moved clear inside the quarter-pole, showed strong
acceleration while extending the advantage into upper stretch and powered away with the rider poised like a statue in the irons to win handily. SARAH'S
VISION disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two to three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner into the stretch, drifted out into the final
furlong and safely secured the place. MEAN CANNON contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and weakened then lost the show. SPOTTED BULL broke out and bumped with a foe, moved up while urged along, went five then six wide on the
turn and tired. PIRATE JUNCTION was carried out at the start, raced on the outside while urged along, went five then four wide early on the turn, dropped to
the two path near the five-sixteenths then the rail around the quarter-pole and failed to respond. OSCAR CHOICE chased the leading trio, went four then
five wide on the turn and came up empty. VISIONS OF GOLD was away awkwardly, dropped back while ridden along, started the turn in the two path,
moved to three then four wide late on that bend then was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TEXAS EMPIRE was hard ridden off the
pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL was bumped at the start and
forced out, went four then five on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
