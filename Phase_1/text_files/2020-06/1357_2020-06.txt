REUNITE bumped with a rival at the start then went to the front, raced two path to the inside on the first turn, extended the advantage with five furlongs to
run, widened along the rail under light coaxing on the far turn, responded well under a mild hand ride in the stretch then was flagged with the whip late while
kept to task and was much the best. LEMON ROSES went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back with five
furlongs to run, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, battled gamely with CLAY'S MOON STONE for the place and narrowly earned that
position. CLAY'S MOON STONE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, battled with the runner-up
for the place and just missed that position while well clear for the show. INGLENOOK came out at the start then bumped hard with a rival, went three then
four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HOLY
CREED went four to five wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and was no factor.
GOOD FAITH bumped hard with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
urged along midway down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path and also failed to respond. WENDELIN B was last away, went around the
first turn in the three path, lagged well behind, went four to five wide on the far turn and was eased but walked off.

the two path, engaged that foe on the far turn, took a slim lead at the three-sixteenths, dueled gamely in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong
urging. SUNLIT SONG was restless in the gate then came away awkwardly, moved up to take the lead then was well rated on the inside, came under urging
while challenged by the winner on the far turn, dueled gamely with that foe in the stretch and was denied while clear for the place. BONJOUR BABY broke
out at the start, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging near the three-eighths, chased inside on the far turn, was driven
three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get the show. MOOJAB JR raced under a tight hold
into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was reserved towards the rear, raced inside on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and gained late
while securing the last spot in the superfecta. LETHAL MOVE was bumped lightly in the hindquarters just after the start, rounded the first turn in the two
path, was unhurried near the back, raced in the two path early on the far turn, dropped to the rail then was roused near the quarter-pole, cut the corner into
the stretch and failed to rally. BETTER THAN MAGIC went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on
the far turn and failed to threaten. RIGHT LANE LUKASZ bumped lightly with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved near the
back, went four wide under urging on the far turn and was no factor. WOULDA COULDA DID went two to three wide on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and retreated. (Rail at 20 Feet)
