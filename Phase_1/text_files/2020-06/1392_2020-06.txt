Footnotes
FROSTY FLIRT broke readily, shifted to the inside nearing the turn disputing the pace, shook clear racing into upper stretch and held sway under pressure.
MUSTANG MOLLY, forwardly placed four wide, then three wide tracking just off the first flight, continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others.
GOLDEN LILY settled outside a rival in the last flight, angled five wide racing into the stretch and continued with late interest to edge a rival for a share on
the wire. BISCOTTINI stumbled badly at the start, settled into stride while dropping out last, shifted out to split foes three entering the lane but was outkicked
for a share. MIZONEY switched off the inside early to track off the first flight between foes but steadily faded into the lane. PLACATI, urged to terms
prompting a rival's pace into the turn, gave way after a half. FAIRY SURPRISE, restless in the post parade, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight but
retreated early.

HOT SHOT KID tracked off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch and produced a steady late
response to prevail under firm encouragement. MR. JAGERMEISTER, urged to dispute pace the inside a rival on a narrow advantage, edged forward on the
turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane and was collared late. FIREMAN OSCAR broke readily, angled to the rail stalking just off the leaders, came through
to challenge inside the pacesetter when presented an opening nearing midstretch, but was taken in hand the final sixteenth losing momentum when caught
in tight quarters. CINCO STAR, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, gave way into upper stretch. ZOE'S DELIGHT tracked off the first flight outside foes
and dropped out early.

WATER PATROL, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the first flight, continued with a steady bid to challenge racing into the lane and edged forward
under left handed pressure. HOMELAND MESSA, urged prompting the pace three wide between foes into the backstretch, pressed the issue into upper
stretch but was no match late. WHATA SHOW OFF was rated off the first flight between rivals to the far turn, shifted out five wide racing through the stretch
and edged rivals for a share. CAMPAIGN SPY, pulled his way between foes to gain terms with the first flight racing into the backstretch, dueled for
command inside foes racing through the far turn and gave way late. MICA BAY, off slowly, settled well off the leaders, then found some late stride to gain
position four wide between foes in the closing stages. LISTEN TO ROSE was rated inside foes tracking off the first flight to the far turn and steadily faded
into the stretch. SUMMER LOVIN, held up out of close quarters early, switched outside foes to make brief progress five wide racing into the far turn but
proved empty in the drive. HARRY THE HITMAN was hustled to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn but was spent early.

ROYAL PRIVACY broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and
held sway to the end under pressure. SAVED BY ZERO angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight, shifted out three wide on the turn and continued
with a steady effort to prove best of the others. AZARUK, unhurried outside foes racing to the turn, swung out entering the lane and continued with interest
to gain a share. OHTANI settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and made an effort to improve position. LANGS LEGEND bobbled at the start
while brushing DION, was urged pressing the pace racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. RISKY BOY proved no factor. DION, brushed at the
start, switched out widest racing into the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
LADY HIDEAWAY, reserved well off the leaders while angling to the inside, saved ground through the second bend gathering momentum, swung out four
wide in upper stretch to split foes and just caught SHE'S FIRE AND ICE on the wire under firm handling. The latter was prompted to a forward placing along
the inside, stalked the leaders along the rail to the far turn, came out entering the lane to gain a brief advantage late and just missed. SPITFIRE SUZIE
tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted three deep to challenge outside foes midstretch but lacked the needed final kick. AND
ISLES was guided to the inside early to track just off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and improved position. MY HEART SINGS, reserved
between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out six wide entering the lane and gained some position in a mild bid. AVIE'S PARADISE, bumped at the
start, angled to the inside early tracking in second flight, shifted out nearing the lane but had no rally. PLENTY OF MUNNY, carried wide racing into the first
turn while being prompted to join the leaders, shifted in racing into the backstretch to gain the advantage between calls, dueled for command into the far turn
to gain a brief advantage nearing the lane but gave way midstretch. JAKEALINA, caught four wide racing to the backstretch as part of the second flight,
retreated into the lane. BRAHMS IS WHO proved no factor. MS SASSY ATITUDE, carried out five wide on the first turn, shifted in to press the issue outside
a rival to the far turn and gave way. FURZY bore out racing into the first turn while being urged to contest the pace impeding several rivals and dropped out
early.

MAYWOOD HOPE, reserved in the opening stages while angling to the inside, continued unhurried to the far turn, saved ground through the second bend,
shifted out nearing upper stretch to split rivals just off the inside, angled inside the pacesetter to bid for command through the stretch and edged forward in
time under steady handling. APPEALING AUDREY tracked off the second flight outside a rival under light rating to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance shifting out four wide racing through the far turn and continued with interest in that path while just outkicked by the winner. FIRST HUNTER sped to
the lead racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, briefly resisted several challengers through the far turn to upper
stretch but yielded between foes late. VIVA FOREVER tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening half, shifted out to lodge a bid entering
the far turn but flattened out into the lane. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE tracked off the second flight along the inside, switched out entering the lane but had no rally.

deep in second flight, lodged a brief bid on the far turn but proved empty in the drive. SHE MIGHT TELL settled last and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DAME PLATA tracked the pace inside foes as part of the second flight, gained position between foes racing through the far turn, shifted out midstretch while
moving to wrest command and went clear under firm handling. GATO GUAPO tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out four
wide racing into the lane and edged second late. MALIBU PRO broke inwards bumping, was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch,
moved to open a brief advantage nearing upper stretch but faltered once headed by the winner. CHRIS AND DAVE tracked off the first flight four wide in
early stages, lodged a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but faded in the drive. NET GAIN settled last, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch,
was fanned five wide into the lane and continued evenly. UNITED PATRIOT tracked off the first flight three wide between foes to the far turn and gave way
into the stretch. GIANT PAYDAY, reluctant to load in the starting gate, tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch and lacked a rally.
CENTRAL PARK, bumped at the start, was urged between foes to gain the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dueled inside a rival to the far turn
and abruptly gave way. PRIMO TOUCH settled inside foes in early stages and failed to menace.
