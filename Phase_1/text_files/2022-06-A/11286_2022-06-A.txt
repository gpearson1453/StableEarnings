DA CRIMSON PASS hustled from outset and gained first command, led the field from an inside pose around the bend and inched away in the final strides.
ST PATRICKS SWORD established an inside stance on the heels of the pacesetter, followed that rival around the bend then rallied for place in the
homestretch. TERRIFIC INDY rushed from outset nd led the second flight along the backstretch, trekked te two path around the bend, was within striking
distance at upper stretch but was nipped for the place by a rallying foe. ZIONITE improved position in the final furlong after giving chase to the pacesetter
from a three wide pose. HERE'S YOUR DRINK tucked behind rivals shortly after the start to save ground, chased the field through the turn, and passed a
tiring foe in late stretch. MAHOMEITE chased the frontrunners from a wide stance, rated mid track at upper stretch and tired in the end.

Footnotes
GOSPEL JOSY JAN stalked the pacesetter while trekking the two path, was urged nearing the final bend, gained command nearing the quarter pole and
dug in for the score while holding off the late rally of DEDE'S TRICK , who showed reserve and trailed the field through the opening half, was asked for
response nearing the quarter pole, angled out to four wide at upper stretch and rallied in the final furlong for the place. SWIFTY DAWN rated close up as the
widest of all rivals through the opening half, closed the gap on the frontrunner inside the quarter pole, but was outfinished in final furlong. CAT TALE
BREEZE established an inside pose and led the field to upper stretch but failed to sustain command and was caught in final furlong. RIVER CHARMER
settled into mid pack along the inside, gave chase into upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. ONE CLASSY CHICK gave chase through the opening half
from a three wide stance and tired in the late going.

RUBY BE JUDGED earned the score under a stiff drive after stalking the pacesetter from a three wide pose through the turn. EUROTIGRE flashed early
foot and led the field along the backstretch, was on even terms at upper stretch but was outfinished in closing strides. DO ME A FAVOR rallied mildly for the
show after showing reserve and settling into the second flight and travelling the three path around the turn. BAD AT LOVE rushed from outset and pressed
the pace along the backstretch from an inside stance then weakened in the final sixteenth. EUROBOUTTOGETIT lacked a rally to improve position after
giving chase from the second flight while saving ground. LA CAPRICHOSA trailed from outset and was never involved.

Footnotes
MR L B J hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem while travelling the two path, gained sole command through the final bend and inched away in the
final sixteenth. OUTCASHED failed to match strides in the late stages after setting the pace in tandem as the inner most rival. SWAY BACK WHEN settled
along the inside behind the pacesetters, loomed boldly along the backstretch, but was no match for top pair in final furlong. SEEK FIRST lacked rally after
settling in behind the pacesetting duo and trekking the two path. NABS settled along the inside, chased the pacesetters through the opening half and tired in
the late going. LA' HOPPER trailed the field in early going, trekked the widest of all around the bends and lacked a serious bid.

ZCAT'S CHATAIN stalked the pacesetter along the backstretch, angled out three wide at upper stretch and kicked clear in final strides. KID SLIPPER
surged late to secure the place after giving chase early and angling out to four wide at upper stretch. TIME TO FIGHT rushed form outset and led the field
into and through the turn but was over taken in final sixteenth and forced to settle for the show. BAPTISM faded rapidly after flashing early foot and
establishing an inside stance. MAJOR SHIPMAN travelled widest of all and trailed from outset. GRADESTER tucked to inside and saved ground to no avail.

GONNA GETCHA rushed from outset to gain early command, led the field along the backstretch, established an inside pose through the final bend and held
off the challenge of rival in final furlong for the score. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE stalked the pacesetting duo from a two path stance, was roused along the
backstretch and closed the gap nearing the quarter pole but was outkicked in the final furlong. CANDY BARON finished evenly for the show after giving
chase as the outer rival of two abreast in the second flight. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND showed early speed and rated close up through opening half before
fading in closing stages. WOODS OF CONGAREE passed tiring foe in the late going after trailing the field from outset. KAT'S HITMAN was reserved in the
early stages, swung to three wide at upper stretch and lacked a late bid. THE UNION FOREVER tucked behind rivals in the early going to save ground and
tired in the crucial portion of contest.

THE ONE FOR FUN pressed the pace two wide in early going, circled rival three wide midway, rated two wide at upper stretch, and kicked clear in final
sixteenth. JESSIE'S VALENTINE showed reserve in the early portion, advanced near the halfway point by circling rivals and rallied for the place. BILLIE G
travelled widest of all in the opening turn, gained command between calls but was outfinished in the latter stages. PEARLY lacked room early and was
shuffled back in the opening bend, trekked widest at the midway point, and finished willingly while gaining on the leaders at the finish. AWESOME SUNSET
failed to menace after being unhurried from outset and passing tiring foe in late stages. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL rushed from outset and led the field through
opening half before eclipsing in the crucial stages of contest.

while trekking two wide, responded well to asking and was gaining at the finish. HOPE AND A DREAM trailed the field from outset through the opening
bend, angled out at upper stretch and rallied strongly to earn the show. INAGOODWAY lacked a closing bid after giving chase from a three path pose.

Footnotes
OKIE FREEZE rushed from outset and established instant command, led every step of the way, and denied all challengers. STEPPIN SHEP travelled wide
through the first turn, lost ground on the leaders then fought back to be gaining at the finish. TRUE DOMINUS finished strongly and improved placing in the
late going after being reserved and trekking the two path through the opening half. TAKING ENERGY chased the pacesetting duo through the opening
bend, advanced on those rivals along the backstretch, rated close up at upper stretch and gave way in late strides. PUPPY POWER lacked a rally after
being unhurried and settling mid pack through the opening half. ROWDY GALE failed to threaten and steadily faded. DON'T BUG ME flashed early foot and
pressed the pace through the first call before fading rapidly in crucial stages. FIRST COPY failed to menace and trailed from outset. DUBBED IN SEATTLE
settled into mid pack and stopped midway.

Footnotes
FRIGERATOR hustled from outset and established an inside pose, led the field at every call, and held off all rivals for a gate to wire score. HALLOWED
RIVER pressed the pace from a two path stance, responded well to asking, but was unable to catch leader in final furlong. WHIP trekked three wide in
opening stages, made a bold bid through the closing bend and held on for the show. KYEMBEA settled into a four path stance and gave chase to
pacesetters then finished under strong urging to be gaining at finish. CHARING CROSS lacked a needed rally after settling in the second flight and trekking
the two path. GLIMPSE OF GLORY showed reserve in early strides, established a ground saving stance, and finished with strong late kick. MISTY'S FOOL
travelled widest of all and lost ground to front runners. ULTRA SPECIAL gave chase from between rivals and failed to threaten. RAINBOWS TREASURE
trailed from outset.

Footnotes
EVENING STORM travelled widest early, gained command along the backstretch, and proved best in the stretch duel. VALENTINA LIL trekked the four
path through the opening turn, tucked to rail in the closing bend, came on even terms near upper stretch but was outdueled in final strides. ON A
SHOESTRING rushed from outset and set pace in tandem with rival, relished command nearing end of backstretch then fought back for the show honors.
DOWNONDIXIEBEACH came up empty in final strides after bttling between foes and leading the charge briefly at the second call. SEXY RAGS showed
reserve and chased rivals through the opening half before improving placing with late interest. MY CITY GIRL settled into mid pack shortly after the start,
lost ground to front runners in the first turn then gained mildly in closing strides. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT failed to menace while rating back. PURE SILK
lacked a needed rally after rating mid pack through the opening half. GOSPEL GINA pressed the pace from a two path pose through the opening half and
quickly faded thereafter.
