Footnotes
MY MY MUNNY set the pace two wide early on before clearing an inner rival approaching the five furlong pole, showed the way inside of a vying SWEET
CONFUSION into and around the turn, shook clear of that foe while shifting out to the four path entering the lane, and held sway from a chasing
BEACHSIDE BUNNY through the final furlong. BEACHSIDE BUNNY laid close up along the inside early on, backed off to stalk after a furlong, tipped
outside of the top pair into the turn, took aim while being floated to the six path entering the lane, but only managed to chase a clearing MY MY MUNNY
while drifting outwardly in midstretch, and lacked the needed kick to make a bid. SWEET CONFUSION stalked three wide, tugged to engage the pace setter
with nine-sixteenths to go, vied two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart while being floated out entering the lane, then
chased the top two through the final furlong while clinging to place from an inner foe. LADY PROTONICO raced off of the pace two wide around the turn,
then stayed on mildly to bid for show inside of SWEET CONFUSION in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. CUZZYWUZZY laid off of the pace along the
inside, but was outrun.

Footnotes
TOP RECRUIT vied for the lead two wide, inched away from his inner counterpart turning for home, built a clear margin passing the quarter pole, held sway
well into the final furlong, and lasted as his aforementioned competitor re-bid in the closing stages. ROMAN GIANT vied for the lead inside of TOP
RECRUIT, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, yet sustained stride to battle for place inside of JEREMY'S JET in upper stretch, rallied
while shifting outside of the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, and came again to produce a late re-bid, but ran out of ground. TIVY lost all chance
while bumped and severely bothered by an inner rival at the start, recovered to track from midpack three wide and between horses into the turn, shifted to
the four path entering the lane, and stayed on to secure show. CORTESE came in soon after the start and bumped a rival, tracked from midpack two wide
and among foes, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, then drifted back in in upper stretch, and improved between horses in the final furlong.
JEREMY'S JET bobbled outwardly and hindered a group of rivals while regaining balance at the start, stalked in the three path as the dueling pair's closest
pursuer around the turn, inched closer to bid for place at the quarter pole, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. ZAICI bumped with an
outer foe soon after the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. KIGALI flipped and got loose briefly when first attempting to load, then was
fractious and lost the rider on his second try, finally was successfully loaded after the removal of a lip-chain, then was bumped and pinched between horses
at the start, took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and made little impact. BREAD WINNER was bumped between horses and crowded soon
after the start, raced far back along the inside, got rank behind rivals' kick back into the turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to
factor. CANAL was hard to load after seeing a prior competitor act up, then was sandwiched between horses at the start, trailed the field around the turn,
came into the lane in the nine path, and moved up. JOHANNES broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from midpack four wide around the
turn, floated to the six path entering the lane, and tired. FADETHENOISE took up when bumped and put to tight quarters between horses soon after the
start, took the turn in the four path while far back, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
RED QUEEN set the pace inside of a vying rival, drew clear of that foe at the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure through upper stretch, and was
ridden out through the final furlong. WORLD OF WONDER prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart at the quarter
pole, and remained well clear of show thereafter. SWEET SPIN laid off of the pace four wide, bid for show entering the lane, gained that position in upper
stretch, and stayed on while no threatening the top pair. LA NEBLINA bobbled a bit at the start, trailed in the three path around the turn, shifted inwardly in
upper stretch, stayed in hopes of bidding for show inside of SWEET SPIN in the final furlong, but failed to menace. DOLLY DIMPLE stalked three wide while
under a snug hold outside of the top pair into the turn, but was outkicked in upper stretch while chasing between horses, and faded. BITTER VIXEN stalked
along the inside, but was through turning for home, then post-race was deemed to have bled..

Footnotes
FOREVER HOME vied for the lead two wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, inched a clear advantage in upper stretch, held sway from a chasing foe
through midstretch, and lasted from an outer on-charging foe in the closing stages. MEJTHAAM trailed in the five path around the turn, then rallied outside
of foes through the lane, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader while reaching place at the wire. MRS. NUSHI stalked along the inside under a snug hold
approaching the turn, shifted outside of the leading pair into that junction, but only managed to chase a leading FOREVER HOME through the lane, stayed
on to reach place entering the final sixteenth, then threatened the leader late while getting outkicked for place by an outer rallying rival. SWEET BEAUTY
took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. SLAM DIEGO vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but was headed by
that foe turning for home, failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, and yielded minor rewards in the final sixteenth. RIO LADY took the turn in the four
path at the rear of the field, and never got involved. WILLAMINA chased four wide in midpack around the turn, and tired.
