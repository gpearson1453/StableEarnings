Footnotes
PLEASURE'S GOLD stalked the frontrunner throughout, took the lead entering the stretch, opened up inside the eighth pole to win convincingly.
BOSSKAYE brushed the gate at the break, was between horses on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and closed well to get the place. WELL
ACTUALLY stalked inside down the backside, waited on the turn behind the leaders and ran on well just missing second money. TICKLE HER TOE rated
mid pack, was roused three wide on the turn and evened out through the stretch. CRIMSON SKY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, headed at
the top of the stretch and stopped. ZIPPITY DAY was allowed to settle outside early but never reached contention. BONNIECREST saved ground
throughout but was never a factor.

Footnotes
TAPITURE WAY set the pace from the inside while clear, then widened the margin nearing the quarter pole, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the
best under a drive. CLIFF'S HEAD was rated along the inside, eased out by the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane, rallied well for the place
award while no match to the winner. PHIL IN ECHO was reserved early, advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, had a late rally to
gain the show award. VERMONT HOLIDAY stalked the pacde three to two wide and weakened in the drive. SEEDS OF GRANDEUR was bumped at the
start, settled in the back early, moved to the outside on the turn and advanced five wide by the quarter pole,came six wide into the lane and offered a
belated rally. IVICTORY was settled early and saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. KEYSTONE LAW broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the
start, settled two to three wide on the turn and dropped back. IMPULSIVELY was off a bit slow and bumped at the start, four wide pursuit on the backstretch,
then was three wide on the turn and weakened. TIZINGA broke outwardly at the start bumping IMPULSIVELY, then had a four to five wide journey and was
not a threat.

Footnotes
CAHIRA'S BLESSING was in range of the leader on the turn, glided to the lead at the three sixteenth pole and was mildly urged to draw away in the final
stages. FEDALINE was between horses through the turn, angled out entering the stretch and fought gamely to outkick inside foe for second money. JOKES
UP broke in at the start, moved inside horses entering the turn to get a good stalking position and rallied well inside just missing out on the battle for place.
GOLDEN TRAIN was mid field while between horses early and finished well to get a minor share. LOKI'S LIGHTNING set the early fractions, was collared
turning for home and stopped along the rail. CELTIC REVIVAL was rated mid pack outside of horses and offered little down the stretch. BIG BANG BLUE
was outrun early and never got involved.

Footnotes
MEN ON THE HILL (IRE) was rated mid pack inside through the turns, angled outside for the drive and was full of run late to get up in the final sixteenth.
DAY TRIPPER was well rated setting the early fractions, opened up in the stretch, ran gamely through the lane but could not hold off a fast closing winner.
OPUS NORTH was roused outside on the final turn, then dropped inside turning for home to finish strongly on the rail to grab show. LANGSTAFF ROAD
stalked early on, chased the leader entering the stretch and weakened late to just miss third. MORE THAN A DANCE saved ground inside on both turns
while rated and ran willingly around the final turn and stretch. MAGNIFICENT MARIO broke sluggish, trailed early and finished up well with interest. GO
TAKE CHARGE was three wide throughout and offered no finish. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was near the back and never threated. BET was three wide
throughout and was empty for the drive. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY showed early speed inside and backed up through the field.

GREEN FLEET was allowed to settle early, then was two wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and closed well to get up in deep stretch and
edged away under a drive. FULL SCREEN was well rated two to three wide, made a four wide move to take over leaving the turn, then wandered in the
furlong grounds and was caught late, second best. BLAST IN THE SNOW pressed the early pace three wide, made as two wide bid on the turn to briefly
lead, then faded in the drive, bested rest. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE was reserved early, then was two to three wide on the turn and angled out in the drive and
had a late rally. H C HOLIDAY was reserved early on the inside, then lacked room by the five eighths marker, then shifted to the outside on the turn and
advanced five wide, came six wide into the drive and had no late kick. CUPID'S DUDE was four wide into the first turn, settled while wide and came four to
five wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. RUNNINFORCOVER set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and weakened.
LOMAKI'S GEM pressed the pace four to three wide early and tired. VICTORY JET chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LOMAKI FORCE was

Footnotes
THE MINKSTER stalked the early speed, took command at the quarter pole, opened up mid stretch and held off a fast closing rival for the win. RONDURE
was allowed to settle down the backstretch, angled outside turning for home and finished strong finding his best stride late. IRONSTONE rated inside near
the leaders early on, waited behind horses on the turn then angled out in the lane to rally well. DUKE OF LOVE tracked outside on the turn, loomed up at
the quarter pole but could not keep up with the leaders in the final stages. HIDDEN HONOR was outrun in the beginning, moved into contention inside on
the turn, and stalled through the stretch. SIR FOR SURE was near the rear early, roused on the turn while outside horses and had nothing for the drive. HIS
TIME showed speed inside, was headed at the quarter pole and offered little on the rail in the stretch.

marker, finished well but could not go with the winner late, second best. SALVATOR MUNDI was rated along on the turn and made a four wide bid leaving
the turn but flattened out, held show award. SPEEDY HANS was rated along early and was two wide on the turn, shifted out five wide leaving the three
sixteenths and had a mild late rally. TIMESKIP was reserved early, came five wide into the lane, was in traffic and blocked by the furlong marker, angled out
for racing room at the sixteenth pole and had a belated rally once clear. DRAGON'S BREW was settled back early, came nine wide into the land and had a
mild late rally. DOWNY BOY was reserved early, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and was blocked at the furlong marker and had to check losing all
chance, no rally. BOURBON EXTENSION stalked the pace three to two wide and weakened. MARTEN RIVER set the pace on the inside and weakened the
