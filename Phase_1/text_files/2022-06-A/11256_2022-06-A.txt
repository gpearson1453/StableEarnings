the early leader, chased inside around the turn, flattened off the top pair in the upper stretch but stayed clear for a share. BIZZY RUN raced off the early
speed, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. BLUEGRASS FLIGHT raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the turn

Footnotes
ZENCHUA SKY was forwardly placed into the turn, tracked three wide in striking distance at the quarter pole, coaxed four wide at the head of the lane,
sustained response under firm handling and forged ahead in the final sixteenth. HOT CAVIAR set a pressured pace in opening stages then dueled around
the turn, fought back gamely into the final furlong, shook free, briefly held the lead then got outkicked by the winner. DERONDA raced off the second flight
entering the turn then shifted out turning for home, hustled along four to five wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and prevailed for a share. SUE
HAPPY raced in contention along the inside, lacked a clear path in the upper stretch, got through along the rail, advanced into close contention then gave
way. SPITFIRE SUZIE pressed the early pace, dueled with HOT CAVIAR around the turn then weakened in the final furlong. GREAT MILLS ROAD lacked
speed and raced in the back, raced along the outside into the lane then angled in and failed to factor. QUEEN OF THE SHIP raced off the second flight
going by the half mile marker, went three to four wide around the turn and steadily faded.

CALL KRYSTAL dueled for the early lead with NIFTY DAZE, shook off rival leaving the backstretch and took on the challenge from ROME'S BURNING,
dueled then dug in gamely and turned back bid turning for home, stayed on determinedly under right handed pressure and held clear. PROUD FOOT raced
in range along the inside, launched bid in the two path at the head of the lane, sustained a solid bid but had to settle for second best. ROME'S BURNING
veered out and bumped WILD BEAUTY at the start, dueled with the winner around the turn then stayed on for a share. MIZHIPZLETUS raced four wide in
range at the quarter pole then flattened out in the upper stretch. WILD BEAUTY got pushed outward and steadied at the start, quickly dropped back to last
and never reached contention. NIFTY DAZE dueled for the lead through the backstretch then faded around the turn. ALWAYS VALENTINA was off slow at
the start and had no response.

SHUT UP MAN got bumped at the start then hustled up from the gate and dueled inside of SWEET WHEAT for the early lead, continued to match strides
around the turn, dug in gamely and shook free in the upper stretch, was all out late under firm handling and just lasted. A BRUSH OF LUCK broke sharp
and edged back to track the top pair in opening stages, came under a ride mid-way around the turn, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch, stayed
on determinedly, was inching up on the winner in closing strides and just missed. FINISH UP tracked inside a rival off the top flight entering the turn, hustled
up two wide at the head of the lane, sustained steady response and prevailed for a share. SWEET WHEAT vied outside of SHUT UP MAN for the lead up
the backstretch and continued to battle around the turn, failed to kick on with the winner in the upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. EVIL
KNIEVEL settled in early stages and saved ground around the turn, given cue along the rail in the upper stretch and failed to move on.
