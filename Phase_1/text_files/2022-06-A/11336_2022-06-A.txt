Footnotes
PLUM BLUE sat mid pack, angled out to the four path nearing the quarter pole, struck the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving.
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE lead the way into the backstretch, angled in just off the rail, saw margins diminish in the final turn, and held on for place. MARYAM
saved from the rail, took closer order and lacked the kick that was required. SKY DESTINY unhurried early, lodged bid from the rail into the stretch and was
unable to improve position. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY raced at the back of the pack from outside and lodged a mild late bid. BLACKBERRY LISA last away,
chased outside and tired.

Footnotes
CABOT TRAIL saved ground while setting the pace, responded to challenge from SOUTHERN WARLORD at the quarter pole, and drew clear late stretch.
SOUTHERN WARLORD sat just off the pace, moved up alongside CABOT TRAIL nearing the quarter pole but was unable to get by. YORKTOWN sat in
striking position while three wide, asked to quicken into the final turn, and lacked the kick needed. RED CHOCOLATE raced three wide leaving the
backstretch and rallied belatedly. NO SUPAH FOR YOU last away, lodged a rail bid nearing the quarter pole, and flattened late. MAJESTIC CAFE raced
wide through the backstretch and passed tiring rival. WEEKEND WIZARD raced four wide in second flight, and faded in the final furlong.

HIGH KELLY SONG angled inside leaving the backstretch, rallied between rivals into the stretch and edged away for the win. TAKE NO PRISONERS
prompted the pace while three to four wide, gained a slim advantage into the lane, was rundown and held for place. CAB SAV raced wide through the
backstretch, took closer order leaving final turn, rallied outside, and just missed out for second. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN broke alertly to set the pace, was
overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and flattened along the rail. ESTIFRAAD stalked the pacesetters, and lacked response when asked.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR pressed between rivals, was unable to move on with rivals and gave way. FREUDS VISION chased outside and was outrun.

Footnotes
SHAKEITFORMEGIRL rated off the pace from the five path, went in pursuit of the leader after passing the quarter pole, and won driving. BE MY ALIBI sent
for speed then was under a snug hold through the backstretch, held good margins through the far turn, was showing signs of tiring in the final sixteenth and
was able to just hold on for place. STUBBORN LOVE chased from the rail, shifted out into the lane, closed well and missed out for place honors. JIG'S
DESTINY raced in closest pursuit, chased hard nearing the head of the stretch, and lacked the closing response needed. FRAN FROM PERU fanned four
wide into the far turn, and failed to threaten in the drive. FOREVER LADY lacked early speed and was unable to improve position late. WILD RUNNIN
MAGGIE unhurried early and lacked a bid. PUNCH PERFECT showed little.

Footnotes
H K MELODY last away, stalked from the rail, lacked a clear path on the rail, angled out sharply, dug in gamely and narrowly prevailed. INDEPENDENCE
NEIGH contested the early pace inside of CHRIS'S COMMAND, gained the advantage into the final turn, and was out finished. SILVERFOOT dropped in to
the three path leaving the backstretch, chased into the stretch and held sway. VIRTUAL SILVER chased near the back of the field, closed outside and
weakened deep stretch. LAST OF WAR dropped back in the final turn, and lodged a mild bid into stretch. INCREDIBLE HARLEY stalked the pacesetters
while four wide, and lacked a closing response. TOLUI chased outside and failed to threaten. CHRIS'S COMMAND set a pressed pace, was unable to move
on with rival and gave way. I'M SATISFIED fractious in gate, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SANDY BEACH vied for the early lead, sat in striking position just off the leader, gained the lead at the head of the stretch, and drew clear. GOTCHA
JENNY saved ground early, closed gradually and dug in late to earn place honors. STEAMIN DEMON reserved off the early pacesetters, gained closer
order into the final turn, closed gap on the leader and was bested late. NO MORE RINGS shifted outside into the lane, drifted out and rallied belatedly.
LASKA showed mild interest late. HIGH KELLY BABE unhurried early, lodged a rail bid and weakened late drifting inward. SAVYSKYE rated off the pace
while four wide, lacked a response and room late when called upon. SMOKEDYA late mild bid. THE RIVER GREY vied three wide for the early lead, held a
short advantage through the turn, was quickly overtaken near the quarter pole and had nothing left in reserve. ROSA RICHTER passed a tiring rival late.
THIS TIME SWEETIE hurried away and was outrun.
