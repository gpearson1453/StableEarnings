PROFUSION Fractious as the gates opened, spotted the field a length, unhurried along the two path, began to gain three from the rail into the last turn,
challenged three across with a furlong remaining and under pressure outran VIBE SETTER to the wire. VIBE SETTER Tracked along the three path, gained
to challenge nearing the quarter pole, battled from between at the furlong marker, continued to match strides with the winner to the wire and finished
gamely. MAJESTIC SKY Away best, set the pace off the rail, was collared at the top of the lane, battled inside and weakened. SLEEPY JOE Tracked along
the rail to the three-eighths pole and tired inside. TAKE THE EDGE Well placed along the two path around the turns and tired. BLIZZ Broke sluggishly,
lagged back, four wide into the lane, was outrun. YOU'VE GOT MALE Saved ground on the turns and tired.
