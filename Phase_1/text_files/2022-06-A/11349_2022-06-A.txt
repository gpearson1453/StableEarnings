Footnotes
VOLNAY tapered in to stay with the early pace, took the lead two deep nearing the nine sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Calypso Ghost toward the seven
sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the stretch. MI CLEOPATRA AND I came away awkwardly and made contact with
Fudge Cake then settled off the rail, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but couldn't improve further in the
lane. STYLISH PAINT settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, left the
turn outside and ran evenly in the lane. TALKTHETALK ran in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, continued in the three path
of the far turn but flattened past the eighth pole. SHERIFF'S KID raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail but showed little in the lane. CALYPSO GHOST set the early pace inside, was caught toward the nine sixteenths pole,
gave chase from that point but dropped back approaching the seven sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. FUDGE CAKE came away awkwardly
and made contact with Mi Cleopatra And I, saved ground on the first turn and showed little response in the backstretch.

BRION was hustled to the front at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn then kept alert in the stretch. PAPA
DON chased, rounded the turn off the rail and proved no match. TOLLER broke in and made sharp contact with Uncle Remi then gave chase, rounded the
turn at the rail and dueled through the stretch for third. ANGUSONIC gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and was outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. STEAL THE CASH chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. CASA GRANDE was
sluggish into stride then saved ground. UNCLE REMI, racing without front shoes, was bumped off stride on the chute, gave chase and rounded the turn
near the rail.

THE BETTER ONE settled inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, took the nod entering the stretch,
dueled clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen. AIM'S JUBILEE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the far turn, cleared BOUNDTOBEOK nearing mid-stretch but had to settle for second best. The latter,
raced with the pace three wide in the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, challenged and took a slim lead at the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear
toward the three eighths but was met at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. CEDARS BULLS EYE stumbled at the break and
settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. SHUTUPN'KISSME set a slim early
pace inside, was met nearing the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded through the backstretch. RIVER REWARDS RVF raced with the early
pace two deep while between horses, dueled to a slim briefe lead nearing the half mile pole, was caught at the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from
that point, but faded at the rail on the far turn, eased in the stretch then trailered off while appearing sore.

rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead past the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely
through the upper stretch before relenting; reluctantly. KNOT ANYMORE rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was
caught leaving the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. NAVY SWORD steadied at the break then mostly saved ground.

U S FUNDS took an immediate lead and set a pressured pace, angled in past the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. CHEESE LOUISE chased through the backstretch, ran two deep on the turn, dueled clear of AT THE HALF deep stretch and was
gaining on the winner. The latter chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened in the stretch duel for second. WEST VIRGINIA PAM chased
outside, ran in the five path of the turn and passed rivals widest. NOT FOR GOLD engaged in close early chase but was shuffled back in the vicinity of the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. LA RUFINA was reluctant to load and lunged leaving the gate, gave close
early chase, rounded the turn about the four path and weakened. THREE BOPS chased off the rail, was jostled between horses in the vicinity of the five
sixteenths pole and faded on the turn.
