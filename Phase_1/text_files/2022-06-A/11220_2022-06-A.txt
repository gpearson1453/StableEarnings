Footnotes
RIDE THE PLAN broke sharply, raced outside of FREE LOVE in the tracking flight down the backstretch and into the turn, was asked approaching the five
sixteenths, bid outside of ULIKEAPPLES approaching the quarter, felt the crop once in upper stretch, headed ULIKEAPPLES near the three sixteenths,
began to draw off under a light hand ride near the furlong pole and continued to increase her advantage at will to the wire. FREE LOVE was sent for speed
inside but did not outjump ULIKEAPPLES to the lead, tracked the leader inside of RIDE THE PLAN down the backstretch and while hugging the rail around
the turn, came into the lane in the pocket just behind the pacesetter, proved no match for RIDE THE PLAN past the three sixteenths, kept on outside of
ULIKEAPPLES past midstretch and got clear late for place. ULIKEAPPLES broke sharply despite coming inward and bumping TENSE in the opening
strides, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, was engaged by RIDE THE PLAN approaching the quarter, lost the lead to
that foe near the three sixteenths, proved no match as she began to draw off, and was outfinished by FREE LOVE for the place late. WEDDING BOURBON
was grazed by TENSE in the opening strides as a chain reaction from ULIKEAPPLES breaking inward, raced three deep toward the rear down the
backstretch, continued three wide toward the rear on the turn, was pushed along approaching the three eighths and then driven five wide into the lane,
lacked the needed kick to prove a threat but kept on well enough to capture fourth from DOROTA late. DOROTA chased well off the leading trio down the
backstretch, continued near the rear in the two path on the turn inside of WEDDING BOURBON, came four wide into the lane, and had no rally under a
drive. TENSE was bumped soundly at the start by ULIKEAPPLES, settled between horses near the rear early, trailed in the four to five path around the turn,
came five wide into the lane and offered no bid.

DRAGONFLY KISSES trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an outside drive in midstretch and gained ground to the
wire, getting up for the win late. WATERMARK hit the gate leaving it, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge in the two
path headed into the turn, dueled from there, flattened out in the final furlong and was caught in the final strides. LOCK IT DOWN hit the gate and bumped
with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the field through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn and
weakened in the stretch. PIPPITY DO DA stumbled leaving the gate, bumping with the horse to her inside in the process, chased the frontrunner up the
backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
KHOZYS CROWN was sent for speed between horses, took mild prompting from NIFF down the backstretch, cleared while saving ground on the turn,
spurted further clear while positioned two wide in upper stretch, and kept on to hold safe. NIFF broke sharply, prompted the pace outside the leader down
the back straight, stalked two wide around the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, proved no match for KHOZYS CROWN and chased on second
best. FULLY AWARE broke well but was taken back to midfield inside near the five eighths, tracked the leading pair from there, chased along the rail around
the turn, continued inside into the lane and chased on evenly down the lane. PRINCESS CONSUELA settled at the rear of a compact field early, chased
three deep in the five path around the turn, offered a brief bid outside the leading pair approaching the quarter pole, floated five wide into the lane and failed
to sustain her bid. MUD HUT chased outside foes down the back straight, continued between horses in the three to four path around the turn, chased four
wide in the lane and lacked the needed rally. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY settled near the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, and had no response four
wide in the lane.

swung wide into the stretch, relinquished the lead while drifting out and battled back in the final furlong to get up in time. INDICIA raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid approaching the three
sixteenths pole, gained ground and led briefly in late stretch and was caught in the final strides. ENGLISH saved ground around the first turn, tracked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched an inside bid entering the stretch and finished well. WAVE
OF GOODNESS came around the first turn in the two path, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, launched a four
wide bid approaching the quarter pole and finished evenly. GRAND PRIZE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn and weakened in late stretch. ZANDREA'S raced into traffic while saving ground around
the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, steadied headed into the far turn when she ran into traffic once more, saved ground from
there, veered out in midstretch and was outkicked to the wire. APRIL'S GEM raced in tight quarters and was steadied slightly in the opening strides,
recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn between horses in the three path and tired in
the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, ALL FRACTIONS EXCEPT THE QUARTER AND FINAL ARE HAND TIMED.

AHEADOFTHEGAME broke inward and bumped DASH TO THE CASH, tracked outside of LUCKY POSITION down the backstretch and in the three to four
path on the turn, encroached from near the three eighths, headed the pacesetter past the five sixteenths, vied with him into upper stretch, took over
approaching the furlong mark, kicked clear to the sixteenth, and held. DIAMND CON SUERTE broke outward and bumped LUKE ATTACK, chased the
leading pair down the back straight and in the five path on the turn, raced four wide into the lane, finished well under a drive in the final furlong and just
missed. LUCKY POSITION was sent for pace, made the running down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, was engaged from the
outside by AHEADOFTHEGAME past the three eighths and headed by that foe past the five sixteenths, kept on inside that foe into upper stretch, but proved
no match approaching the furlong mark and flattened. DASH TO THE CASH was squeezed between horses in the opening strides, settled at the rear, raced
in the three path on the turn and began to inch forward when asked near the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane, and chased on mildly best of the
rest. DASTARDLY DEEDS chased outside down the backstretch, continued in the four path on the turn, came three wide between horses to the lane, and
lacked the needed rally. LUKE ATTACK was squeezed between horses in the opening strides, settled near the rear, was pushed along past the five eighths
to chase inside of DIAMND CON SUERTE, raced in the two path on the turn near the rear, was driven inside into the lane and came up empty.

TUFF ATTACK stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a surging bid between horses passing the three eighths pole, entered the
stretch three wide and dueled to the wire, getting up in the final sixteenth of a mile. COMISKEY PARK tracked the frontrunners on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge approaching the five sixteenths pole and continued to battle down
the lane, giving way in the final strides. KENNESAW raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began
a bid entering the stretch, switched to the outside near the eighth pole and gained ground on the outside to the wire. DIVE DEEP pressed the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. REMEMBER THE MAINE trailed the
field on the inside in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. STORMIN EL PRADO dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. COURTHOUSE COVE
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly while never threatening. MIDNIGHT
LEWIS raced at the back of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, tried to run out while racing in tight quarters in the three path
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. SKYLINE hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three and four path and was not a threat. BASEBALL POLITICS hit the gate leaving it, recovered to duel for the
lead between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to fade from there. HALF-MILE

Footnotes
LADY ATLANTIC vied on the pace between horses, continued to vie outside of FLYING BUSINESS into the lane while having that foe in tight against the
rail, came in further approaching the furlong mark, drove clear and held. FANCY EMPRESS raced with the leading flight early in the opening half furlong but
settled back to chase from near the five eighths, chased in the three to four path on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and began to improve,
found her best in the final sixteenth and gained to the wire. FLYING BUSINESS vied inside down the backstretch, continued to attend inside the leading
flight while in tight between LADY ATLANTIC and the rail, vied inside of LADY ATLANTIC in upper stretch while still in tight, took back and altered out when
LADY ATLANTIC came in further midstretch, and chased on willingly under a drive. HOPPESTRY was anxious in the gate, broke with the main flight but
settled back from near the five eighths, raced into the turn near the rear, continued near the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper
stretch, angled out gradually from midstretch and improved mildly. GHAALEB'S APPEAL broke in a line with most of the field but settled back to the rear
near the five eighths, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, raced in the four path at the rear into upper stretch, and ran on belatedly between horses.
SINGING ALLI vied three wide down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, floated five wide into the lane, and flattened while drifting out.
GODSGIFT broke just behind the rest of the field, inched forward past the five eighths to chase, continued to chase the leading flight in the five path on the
turn, edged closer past the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane, and weakened while drifting out. THERE WAS A JOCKEY'S CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF FLYING BUSINESS, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE BY LADY ATLANTIC IN THE LANE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
LADY ATLANTIC FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER THIRD.

ANOTHER MYSTERY raced inside at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to bide his time while saving ground
around the far turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and wore down his rivals to get up in the final sixteenth of a mile. TEMPER TANTRUM brushed
with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the second turn, took over with a furlong to go and dueled gamely to the wire, giving way in the final strides. RICHIESGOTGAME raced in the two and three
path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and
gained ground on the outside in late stretch. VALIANT VINNY brushed with horse to his inside leaving the gate, was sent to an early lead while saving
ground around the first turn, opened up while racing up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded in the final furlong. IOYA AGAIN
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, raced between horses in the two path
around the far turn and was outfinished in the lane. BLUE SKY KOWBOY raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far
turn from the three path, swung wide while beginning a bid entering the stretch and flattened out late. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE HALF MILE
FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED AND NO TIME IS AVAIALABLE FOR THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT attended the pace two wide through the opening furlong, led near the five eighths, raced a bit keenly on the lead in the three path on the turn,
turned back SOUPERHIGHVOLTAGE near the quarter, kicked away into the lane, and held safe ridden out. TWIRLING ROSES led inside for the opening
furlong, tracked BIG SPORT inside past that point, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, switched outside of BIG SPORT in upper stretch,
chased on willingly under a drive but proved second best. HATCHET CREEK chased outside of JACK'S ADVANTAGE down the backstretch, continued to
chase the leading trio in the three path on the turn, was driven up the inside into the lane, proved no match for BIG SPORT and TWIRLING ROSES but held
third while all out along the inside. DEVIL'S RULE settled at the rear, raced with the rear flight in the three to four path on the turn, came four wide into the
lane, angled inward in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses between late. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE tracked the leading pair early, joined outside
TWIRLING ROSES to track the leader near the half, edged closer to the leader in the four path past the three eighths, loomed approaching the quarter,
emptied out into the stretch, and drifted out. JACK'S ADVANTAGE chased inside of HATCHET CREEK down the backstretch, raced toward the rear in the
two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane and mustered no rally. SMUGGLER'S GHOST settled near the rear, raced in the rear flight in the four to
five path on the turn, floated six wide into the lane and offered no response.
