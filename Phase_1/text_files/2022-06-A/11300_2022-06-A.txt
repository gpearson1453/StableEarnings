Footnotes
RECKLESS SERGEANT showed good early speed but was in a two wide speed duel until the head of the stretch edged clear through the stretch and then
held off the late run of T J's First for the win. T J'S FIRST was just of the pace along the inside until the top of the stretch angled out for the drive and raced
erratically through the lane while continuing to get closer to the winner. THIRSTY SISTER showed good eatrly speed and had the rail both turns hung
gamely until inside the sixteenth pole and then tired. THETHRILLERSGONE was carried four wide in the first turn then was in the two path the remainder of
the race while in the second tier and did not mount a serious rally. MILU ROCKET was of a step slow to trail the field early losing about two lengths raced in
the two path and never mounted a serious rally. TIZ MY PLAN was off a step slow and was in the back of the pack made a three wide bid on the second
turn but flattened out in the stretch. LOOKING HOT raced mid pack towards the inside but began to fade going into the second turn and was not a factor.

EXPECT OURS showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail was challenged from the outset took a clear lead in the stretch and held
gamely. VIVA EL CAPITAN was along the inside for much of the race had to move to the outside in the stretch as Expect Ours drifted in and was gaining in
the final yards. SUMMERJUSTBET HER settled in the two path behind the early speed swung four to five wide on the turn and entering the stretch to make
her bid but flattened out in the stretch. NONEYA was along the inside on the turn swung at least four wide turning for home and was in the center of the
course late while making up some ground. PI YO PRINCESS was well off the pace along the inside and passed a tried rival late while never a serious
factor. FLOWERS APRIORITY was away very quickly but had to race in the two path was prominent until the top of the stretch and gave way quickly.

TAPPED OUT showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail was challenged up the backstretch but shook clear on the second turn and drew
off to win handily under mild urging. CLASSIC'S OMEGA raced along the inside and found his best stride along the inside to close for second while never a
threat to the winner. ROYAL DE BE was hung four wide in the first turn then made a sweeping four wide move on the second turn to get into second but
tired late and had to settle for show. NO HUDDLE was off very slow spotting the field about eight lengths raced very wide in the first turn and up the
backstretch while moving up continued very wide on the second turn and then gave way. MAGIC ICE raced three wide in the first turn then tried to go to the
inside into the second turn and checked briefly when Everydayschristmas came over and never mounted a rally after that. EVERYDAYSCHRISTMAS
showed good early speed while in the two path but then gave way into the second turn and was not a factor. ROYAL D D raced mid pack along the inside
then gave way suddenly up the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GUITARTUITION PLZZ stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch as the rider looked for an opening swung to the outside in the stretch and then
went by the leaders and edged clear for the victory. HUDSON'S TURN was full of run up the backstretch came three wide on the second turn to take the
lead opened a clear lead but could not fend off the winner in the final eighth. A MILLION LIGHTS showed good early speed in the two path to engage for the
lead hung tough until mid stretch and could not go with the top two late. MO CREDO showed the best early speed along the rail held the advantage until the
stretch but then gave way. BIG JABOT trailed from the outset and was never a serious factor.

Footnotes
FORTUNA ADIUVAT was not the quickest away from the gates but was rushed to the front quickly along the inside battled for the lead disposed of Little
And Nan at the head of the stretch to take a clear lead and held off all challengers through the lane to get the win. ST MARIA was bumped hard and lost her
path early then raced three wide up the backstretch and on the turn to get into contention but could not go by the winner in a very strong effort. MARILYN'S
MAGIC was well back while saving ground along the rail to the top of the stretch angled out between rivals and then was finishing well for third. PINTLALA
raced in the two path then came with a run between foes in the stretch and finished with interest. I DONT KNOW EITHER raced along the inside while well
off the pace angled out for the drive and made a mild bid. LILLIE AND NAN showed good early speed in the two path could not match strides with the
winner turning for home and then faded through the stretch. BATTY came in at the start to bump St Maria then showed good early speed while three deep
then gave way into the turn. MISS CHECKMARK raced mid pack along the inside up the backstretch but then began a steady fade going into the turn.

WHEN'S TEE TIME was allowed to settle behind the speed saved ground on the second turn then angled out to mid track in the stretch and wore down the
leaders and edged clear late. OKUDAH was allowed to settle off the pace on the inside came three wide on the turn took a clear lead but could not hold off
the eventual winner in the final sixteenth. CPRIORITY showed good early speed along the inside but could not go with the top two through the stretch.
MAGIC LIGHTNING broke outwards and bumped Full Dinner Jacket at the break showed good early speed in the two path but gave way through the
stretch. WEDINGTON was away quickly but forced three wide in the first turn raced two wide up the backstretch and in the second turn but gave way in the
stretch. MY BOY SAM was along the inside towards the rear of the field angled out mid stretch but was not a serious factor. DOUBLE BOGEY raced along
the inside and was full of run with no where to go up the backstretch stayed along the inside in the stretch and had nothing left. FULL DINNER JACKET
bumped hard at the start and was pushed out into the first turn trailed the field up the backstretch and never mounted a rally. EXCLAIM was well back along
the inside and never offered a rally.
