Footnotes
SUMMER RETREAT showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. FAFA FOOEY was up close and a factor on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN SIDNEY tracked the early leaders and was hustled along on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and was up for a
share. OVERBEARING was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. BE THE CHANGE was away alertly and raced
evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FEDERAL LAW was off the pace, showed little and from the six path at the top
of the stretch had no impact. BRADY O'BRADY stalked the leaders from the inside and was roused on the turn but had no response.

KATY AND EMMA set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch prevailed. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER showed
no speed, lacked room on the far turn and rallied late. MS. P'S BELLA stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top
of the stretch held show. CEEBETT'S BOW was off the pace and gained ground on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more.
