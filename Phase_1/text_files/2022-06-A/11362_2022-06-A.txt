Footnotes
COLOR ME LEGENDARY, forwardly placed three wide racing just off the dueling leaders on the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path entering the
turn, dueled for command outside a rival racing into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. KOVACS broke sharply, was urged prompting
the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing into the turn, dueled for command while shifting to the inside racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner
past midstretch but proved only second best. MIDNIGHT ROYAL was rated off the flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, tipped outside the leaders
entering the stretch while being prompted to advance but continued evenly three wide late. SWEET ANALYZER tracked just off the first flight four wide
racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. KAL EL, off last, was settled while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground
to the lane but failed to gain contention. SMART OXIE was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to the turn, gave way nearing the lane and
drifted out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WESTONS WILDCAT broke readily, shifted to the inside while under firm rating attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue inside foes racing into the turn,
shifted out to the three path racing through upper stretch but maintained a narrow advantage to the end under firm encouragement. RUNAWAY READY was
rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then advanced along the rail to bid inside foes late and edged rivals
narrowly for the place honors. CANDY WOMPUS broke outwards bumping SILVER DASH, was settled last while switching outside foes on the backstretch,
was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide nearing upper stretch, then continued widest to late stages while displaying some late interest to
edge a rival for a share. BLAME BISHOP was urged pressing the pace between foes from the outset into the turn, drifted out racing through upper stretch
and weakened between foes late. SILVER DASH, bumped at the start, was righted, then urged to prompt the leaders three wide racing into the turn but
gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SONNY SMACK broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the lead to the first turn, continued to race as part of the pace to the second bend,
responded when urged to dispatch JAILHOUSE KITTEN nearing upper stretch, shook clear entering the lane and was kept to firm encouragement to
maintain that advantage. ZUMURUDEE angled to the rail in the opening stages while being reserved as part of the last flight to the first turn, gained some
position inside foes entering the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, came through inside foes entering the stretch, drifted out in
the closing stages and was always only second best. HARD ATTACK, caught a bit wide tracking off the first flight leaving the chute, tracked the leaders
outside foes to the far turn, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide in the stretch but continued to improve position to the end. BUDRO
TALKING, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, failed to mount a serious challenge. GIANT PAYDAY was rated off the first flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the lane and gave way into upper stretch. JAILHOUSE KITTEN was urged prompting the
pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, then gave way racing into upper stretch.

SHABAM, reserved last to the backstretch, tipped outside foes nearing the second bend, continued under light reserve gaining position three deep on the
far turn, was prompted to advance in that path racing through the stretch and responded to firm handling to wrest the advantage in time. LOOKIN SO
LUCKY was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling awaiting an opening racing into the far turn,
switched outside foes racing into upper stretch, angled four wide racing past the furlong marker and continued with late interest to prevail for the place
honors. SWANAGE, urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch
but proved no match for the to pair late. KALLINIKI, forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch tracking just off the leaders, was urged to advance
in that path entering the far turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes but came up empty leaving midstretch. MIZZANNA,
pulling against restraint along the inside racing just behind the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued under rating tracking off the first flight racing to the
far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, tipped out entering the lane but offered no rally. RENTAL POOL, urged between foes from the
outset prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HATTIES JEWEL angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the far turn, came around a stricken rival to
challenge for command inside a rival racing into upper stretch and went clear through the lane under firm handling. TOP OF THE GAME was settled last
along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, tipped out racing three wide through the stretch and prevailed
for the place honors. SIDE STREET DAVE, urged to a forward placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on
the far turn, inherited the lead nearing upper stretch but yielded to the top pair in the drive. SPIRIT MISSION tracked off the first flight outside a rival, then
between foes racing to the far turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing response. CHICORY BLUE angled to the inside racing
to the first turn tracking off the second flight, switched out three wide midway through the backstretch to race on terms with the second flight to the far turn
but gave way nearing the lane. JUST ASK JOEL settled into stride while shifting off the inside racing to the first turn and failed to menace thereafter. IKE
was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace to the second bend, dueled for command entering the far turn, was pulled up abruptly after
taking an awkward step nearing the quarter mile, then was vanned off the course following the race. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
A ROZE AND WINE broke readily, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, shook clear entering upper
stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. AUNT RUTHIE, off slowly, angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the
bend, saved ground gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, tipped off the inside while being roused to advance but proved only second best. IN THE
RED, a step slow into stride, was settled last, saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort to improve position inside foes late. LUVIN BULLIES was
rated off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the stretch but made no impression. TORENO, forwardly placed three
deep racing just off the leaders, continued in pursuit in that path racing into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. BECAUSE, urged pressing the pace
outside a rival, then between foes into the turn, couldn't stay on terms with the winner entering the lane and gave way midstretch.

Footnotes
DOCTOR OSCAR hopped at the start while breaking slowly, switched out four wide on the backstretch, commenced an early move in that path nearing the
turn, loomed outside the leaders racing into upper stretch, then continued with a grudging effort through the stretch to wrest the advantage leaving the
sixteenth marker and edged clear in a prolonged drive. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn,
tipped off the inside entering upper stretch, resisted the winner past the furlong marker but proved only second best. COUSVINNYSACANUCK settled
outside foes racing through the backstretch, angled to the four path entering the stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share nearing the
wire. DON'T BOX ME IN shied at the start, then settled inside rivals on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but was
outkicked for a share. JOHNNY UP settled between foes racing to the turn, angled inside entering the lane but failed to menace. HAP HOT angled inwards
to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. WESTA WAVERLY, forwardly placed tracking
the leaders from just out of striking distance, was urged in pursuit of those foes three deep between foes nearing the bend but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN PINE was rated between foes just off the first flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the turn commencing a steady
advance, moved to challenge for command in that path leaving midstretch and prevailed under firm encouragement. COAL TOWN ROAD, forwardly placed
three wide attending the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue in that path racing into the turn to gain a narrow advantage after a half, resisted the
winner's bid past midstretch but proved only second best. DIABLO CUERNO broke readily, angled inwards disputing the pace between foes on a narrow
advantage to the turn, dueled inside the top pair to midstretch and weakened late. LEAD OFF, bumped just after the start by HALO'S LADDIE, switched
outside the leaders early tracking the pace from out of striking distance racing to the turn and made no impression in the closing stages. VLOCK, urged
inside rivals prompting the pace through the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders on the turn and gave way nearing the lane. HALO'S LADDIE stumbled at
the start, then ducked righting himself bumping LEAD OFF, switched outside foes on the backstretch and retreated early.
