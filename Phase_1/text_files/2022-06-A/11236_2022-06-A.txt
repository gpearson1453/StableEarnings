Footnotes
HUSKER LEGACY slipped inside the mishap in the first turn to avoid trouble and gain a clear lead, was joined by a rival into the far turn, continued to dig in
and kept that one safe to the end. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT was carried wide in the first turn as a rival bore out, recovered to rally and challenge outside the
winner into the far turn, continued with that one but could not get by. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN steadied inside a fallen rider in the first turn, rallied to
contention going to the far turn but weakened some. DIAMANTE JOSE bore out in the first turn to carry a rival wide, recovered to reach contention going to
the far turn but had no further run while five wide into the lane. TIZ BRIGHTER took a bad step while showing speed into the first turn and unseated his
rider, went loose around the track and walked off under his own power. A stewards inquiry was conducted into the incidents in the first turn with no action
found necessary.

going to the far turn, could not get to the winner but was well clear for the place. PRUD AS PUNCH gained the lead out of the first turn as the winner took
up, was overtaken before reaching the far turn and weakened. DIXIE DELTA floated out and went over a rivals heels in the first turn, moved back inside
