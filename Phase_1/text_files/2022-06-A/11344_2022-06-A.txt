Footnotes
GENERAL EISENHOWER away well, soon clear by several lengths, set all the pace in the two path, maintained a comfortable advantage through the
stretch under firm handling. MAJESTIC SOCIETY back off the early pace while in the four path through the first turn, continued outside in the run up the
backstretch, moved closest to the winner while still in the four path second turn, made little headway on that one through the lane, edged clear for the
second spot. UNBRIDLED PULPIT settled off the pace while dropping to the inside in the first turn, continued to save ground into and through the second
bend, finished up evenly to report home best of the rest. AMBASSADOR HOUSE broke alertly, headed up the second flight in the two path, continued in the
second group, lacked a closing response when set down for the drive. MISTA VALENTINE chased the winner for a half in the three path and began to
weaken. STARVICTORY hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
WE NEED A FIVE away in good order, allowed the two leaders to go in the first turn, pursued that pair up the backstretch, advanced on the lone leader late
in the final turn, took over entering the stretch, salted the runner up away while inside that one inside the furlong marker and pulled away under steady
pressure. OAK HILL LG raced back off the early pace, moved closer the middle half mile off the inside, advanced with the winner toward the front late in the
final turn three wide and outside that one, lodged a brief bid in upper stretch then could not keep up. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT last to leave, trailed for a half,
began to advance off the inside far turn, three wide into the lane, continued a mild rally to be clear for the show, not a threat to the top two. PALANTE broke
prominently, with the pace into the first turn, scooted away with the other speed from the main flight through the first turn, put the other pacesetter away in
the second turn to be briefly clear, faltered in turn when headed by the top two entering the stretch inside that pair. ST BASIL settled off the pace and the
inside, went evenly throughout in lacking a closing response. BIG BOSS MAN broke with leaders, dueled through the first turn closest to the inside,
continued be a pace factor up the backstretch then was first to blink midway on the final turn. HOPE FOR CHANGE four wide through the first turn when
lacking speed, continued outside, tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
BIND FAITH maintained forward position early while under encouragement, raced in the second flight between horses into the turn, came three wide for the
drive, drifted out under a single left handed crop a furlong out, was righted, roused right handed, late surge to be up at the wire. DREWMAZING also
forwardly placed from the start following an alert break, raced in the second group three wide and outside the winner, advanced to challenge outside the
early leader turning for home, showed the way past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, nailed at the wire. LAURI'S WISH sprinted clear soon after
the start, showed the way into and through the turn closest to the inside, responded when the runner up came alongside exiting the bend, proved stubborn
to the end while closest to the inside of the first flight, remained clear of the others. WOODS N WATER lacked speed inside, fell back to trail late in the turn
while continuing to save ground, improved position up the rail through the lane while not a threat to the top three. DIXIE STAR last away, trailed early well
out in the strip, continued back turn, came in the five path and widest for the drive, improved a bit while also not posing a serious threat. ADIEU LE CHAT
lacked speed while in the two path for a half, three wide into the lane, moved a bit closer under firm handling a furlong out then flattened in the run to the
wire. MAD GOLD in the main body while four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. JANET'S DEVIL in the second flight early along the inside, began a
steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
LAWSUIT LUCY settled off the early pace inside, continued to save ground turn, steady rally up the rail to be in time and prove best. JUST A WIN broke
alertly, sprinted clear soon after in the two path, shrugged off nearest pursuer when straightened for home to be clear again, allowed the winner the inside
soon after, could not contain that one late. CALL ME DARLIN closest to the runner up early, tried that one from the outside in the three path turning for
home, failed to sustain that advance upper stretch, finished up best of the others. GOOD GIRL SHORTY within striking distance outside, raced four wide out
of the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. COZZY KISS off a step slow, lacked speed toward the inside, two path into the stretch,
improved slightly without posing a serious threat. KATIE'S C in mid pack while outside, raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a
response when called on. LUKIA off a step slow, remained back while racing off the inside. PERFECT PUDDING broke sluggishly, trailed throughout.
QUARTER MILE AND HALF MILE SPLITS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ARCHIE broke on top, cleared into the first turn, set a soft set of fractions toward the inside, plenty left to kick well clear through the lane. OUTLAW X. in
hand while rating off the early pace but within striking distance, lost some position while continuing to save ground final turn, set down drive, gained the nod
for the place late while not a threat to the winner. MIAS MOONBEAM taken back off the pace, came four wide out of the final turn when called on for run,
rallied mildly while remaining widest to the wire, narrowly missed the place. DEALIN' STELEN lacked early foot, moved out, loomed a threat three wide
turning for home, flattened out in the run to the wire. HUMPHREY chased the winner early off the inside, fell back before a half, 3w into lane when going
evenly, pinched 3/16, remained back. SHAE'S DAY in midpack through the first turn, moved closer on the outside before a half, pressured the winner
through most of the final turn then had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CZAR'S BALLERINA within striking distance inside and in hand, crept closer into and through the far turn, shifted out a bit and engaged the leader in the
two path turning for home, took command while drifting out, well clear late. LADY CHURCHILL broke on top, set the pace inside, continued to show the way
through the final turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch then proved no match the final furlong, clearly second best. WORLD OF
HURT broke back, was slow to settle while four wide in the first turn, continued back in the run up the backstretch, advanced three wide second bend,
steered out widest when straightened for home, rallied willingly to be clear of others, no threat to the top two. HIGH VALUE TARGET within striking distance
while three wide, continued to maintain contact with the leader far turn, had little left for the stretch run to finish up evenly. SADIE'S PORT pressured the
leader for five furlongs in the two path, weakened. GLENNEYMAX four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second
bend, came up empty for the drive. ZEEROCK ran off prior to the start, broke mid pack, lacked speed and remained always back. VISIONLADY unprepared
for the start then broke in the air to spot the field several lengths, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GEE GEE broke running from the outside, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, briefly clear early turn in hand, held the advantage into the
lane under a continued light hold, pulled away gradually down the lane while being kept to task with a firm right handed crop the final furlong. GREEN
MONSTER forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer in the three path to lodge a mild bid turning home, chased the winner past the furlong marker and
could do little with that one the final furlong, fully extended to save the place. CAVE CREEK broke toward the back, back off the pace and the inside the
opening half mile, between horses into the stretch, shifted out a bit, late run to be getting to the runner up late. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO within striking
distance well off the inside, bit closer three to four wide exiting the turn, lacked a further response to finish up evenly. OPPS MY BAD pressed the winner
from along the inside the opening quarter, fell back off that one a bit through the turn, continued to gradually weaken through the stretch. ZYDECO MUSIC
void of speed while racing in the two path, picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. ORB'S SOUL broke back, came five wide out of the turn,
failed to produce a rally when called on. COLD HEARTED WENCH last to leave, trailed most of the way while five wide out of the turn. MAW MAW'S
SOPHIA in mid pack for a half, traffic exiting the turn, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALLIACEOUS bothered at the start to be last away, moved out and was four wide onto and up the backstretch when off the pace, ranged up three wide to
challenge turning for home, drifted in, proved best under firm handlng. FOUR PRINCESSES broke out to bother the winner, chased early, fell back the
middle half, advanced and challenged between horses with less than a furlong remaining, outkicked in the late going, game for the place. MI LIA raced back
off the pace, moved closer before a half, stalled in some traffic exiting the final turn, bid closest to the inside with a furlong to run, also was outfinished in the
late going. KIND WAYS broke alertly, cleared early, set the pace just off the inside, faltered when headed past the furlong marker to lose several positions
late. SPELLBINDING in the second flight early while off the inside, dropped to the inside second turn, within striking distance along the rail turning for home,
had little left for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
CHAPEL OF DREAMS close out of the chute off the inside, pressed in the two path up the backstretch, vied three wide into the turn, put a head in front
turning for home, long drive, all out to prevail in game fashion. HESACALENDARBOY pressed the issue early inside, held a narrow advantage through the
turn, held on stubbornly through the lane, held sway for the place. SAMURAI ISLAND in mid pack off the inside, three to four wide turning for home, staged
a mild rally to annex the show, slowly getting to the runner up. UNBRIDLED HOPE within striking distance in the two path, remained within striking distance
into the stretch, lacked a significant closing response. I'M A FLASHY KID void of speed in racing far back early, four wide into the lane, found best stride too
late while remaining outside. PALIMONIUM lacked early foot, made a four to five wide middle move late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance through
the lane. TOUGH START lacked speed, failed to muster a closing response. HIGHHOPES DIAMOND off a step slow, advanced into contention with an
inside move through the turn, gave way in the drive. VALIANT CHARGE broke alertly, vied up front early between foes up the backstretch, finished before a
half. SONNY GETS BLUE was finished early, trailed home. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
