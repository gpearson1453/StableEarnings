RISQUE REBEL stumbled at the start, recovered quickly, settled outside, bid on the final turn, took over into the stretch and drew off driving. KINGS
HIGHWAY trailed far behind to the stretch then finished well wide. AMERICAN ROMA raced in closest pursuit of the loose pacesetter, bid at the quarter
pole then weakened. AMERICAN FLEET bobbled at the break, chased near the inside and lacked a bid. MARCO ISLAND hustled to a clear lead for five
furlongs then faded in the stretch. MISSION OBERON saved ground, was put to urging on the final turn but faltered.

KOBE B stalked the pacesetter, took over near the quarter pole then extended his advantage while kept to a drive. GUSHING OIL dropped back wide down
the backstretch, bid on the turn but proved no match for the winner. BIRCHMOUNT RD saved ground throughout, loomed a threat into the lane then
flattened out. SKY TEMPLE broke alertly then dropped far behind before offering some late energy outside. BUFFALO SHUFFLE set a measured pace to
midway on the turn and weakened. FOLE'S NOTION angled inside trailing the field down the backstretch and was no factor. OUCH OUCH OUCH chased
inside and gave way readily.

CHELSEA WALL reserved outside off the pace, rallied wide into the stretch, collared the leaders and drew off while kept to her task. PLIANTLEA settled
inside, tried to move with the winner in the stretch but was second best. POSITIVE POWER saved ground throughout and finished well to gain third.
NURTURING quickly took control, widened on the final turn then weakened in the stretch. PUMPERNICKEL trailed for half a mile, advanced wide then
flattened out in the lane. SHETALKSTOMUCH raced just off the leader inside then stopped through the stretch. A RING THING prompted the pace three
wide for half a mile and gave way. BOLD'N NAUGHTY chased outside and weakened steadily.

TWO PRINCES lacked speed, advanced three wide on the turn, moved clear in the stretch and lasted driving. MR. TUTTLE dropped back early, bid into the
stretch then was taken up splitting foes at the eighth pole, angled out and closed well. ITS ABOUT MY TIME quickly pulled clear, remained well ahead to
midstretch then weakened. MACLEAN'S LEGACY went after the pacesetter three wide on the turn then flattened out. AYE urged close up early, angled to
the rail on the turn and lacked a rally. EXPLAIN bumped early, trailed long way then passed fading rivals. E T'S SUPER STAR chased within range along
the inside then faltered. DREAMING THOUSAND raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter to midway on the turn and stopped. FIELD OFFICER dropped
back after the start and raced far back throughout.

to the final stages and continued gamely to the finish. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE pursued the loose pacesetter outside, loomed a stretch threat and finished
willingly. FED POLICY trailed far behind early then finished strongly too late. DRIVEN BY SPEED moved close up in the two path then inside and flattened
out. BLUE SHINE raced within range three wide and continued willingly. NATOMA dropped back early outside and lacked a rally. WEST HORIZEN dropped
far behind and was never a factor. FINE ONE WON saved ground close up to the far turn and gave way. SIDEREAL raced outside and gave readily.
