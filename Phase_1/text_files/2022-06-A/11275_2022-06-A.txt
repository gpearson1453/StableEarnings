Footnotes
DISCREET SMILE set the pace two off the rail, was in a long drive coming into upper stretch and was kept to task to the end. THREEWICKEDWISHES
chased the pace while two wide, then bid five wide on the far turn, dug in gamely mid stretch and closed willingly in the end. CHA CHA MISSION chased the
pace while three wide, then menaced two wide on the far turn into the stretch drive and was up for show. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT raced from the inside, was
in a steady drive around the far turn to make a mild bid three wide in the stretch drive and just missed the show prize. MIZONEY bore out at the start then
settled along the rail into the far turn then bid six wide in the upper stretch but was no threat. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN was forwardly placed on the first turn,
then stalked the leader down the backstretch, was in a hard drive around the far turn, dropped back and stopped.

Footnotes
CATS GOTTA CHANCE stalked the pace, from the three path down the backstretch, made a bid rolling around the turn, angled out a bit more to get around
bunch, and drew off down the lane to win easily. BOLD EXCAPER chased the pace, racing along the inside, then angled out coming off the turn and rallied,
four wide in the stretch drive to get up for second. PERFECT TOM was in the middle of the pack early on, running in the four path all the way, made a bid
down the lane and got up for show. LIONS NOT SHEEP pressed the pace early, going two wide, made a bid at the head of the stretch but hung late.
INITIATOR was near the back in the early goings, running alone in the three path and passed a tiring rival. STORM THREAT made the early lead, saving
ground along the rail and dropped back at the quarter pole. DONNELLY got off slow out of the gates, trailing the field the whole way and was no factor.

Footnotes
REAL TAP was near the back early on, started a bid going into the turn, four wide, running a bit erratic down the lane until the rider switched to a left handed
crop, and closed willingly with a driving finish to take the win late. MUCH ALOHA was forwardly placed, racing three wide, rallied down the lane but was
outfinished late, holding on to second monies. LET FREEDOM BLING dueled for the lead through the turn, from the two path, gained command briefly, in
mid stretch and gave way grudgingly in late stretch. GUITAR GROUPIE had no early foot, racing along the rail and offered a mild rally down the lane.
TRICKY CARLA pressed the pace early, going two wide, then failed to respond in the stretch drive. K K'S HEART was near the back, three wide and had no
late run, showing little. IT'S STORMY dueled for the lead early, racing along the inside and was through going into the turn. PEYTON KENNEDY was mid
field, going four wide, made a bid on the turn, then dropped back in the stretch.

TURN ON THE BLING set the pace while two wide, cleared the turn, then drew off mid stretch to prove best in the end. DIAMONDS N ACES tracked the
pace while three wide then came out five five in upper stretch, dug in gamely and was up for place. CUPID'S MUSIC chased the pace while four wide, was
gaining on the turn to rally in the stretch but was caught in the end for place. MORO LINGERIE chased the leader while three wide into the turn, made a
mild bid mid stretch then continued race evenly in the final furlongs. DAVID'S DREAM GIRL stalked the pace from inside, made a mild mid on the turn then
flattened out in the end. GEE SHE'S FANCY was unhurried early and no factor. ADELE'S BLING settled along the inside and never fired.

Footnotes
CABOT was racing in the middle of the pack, from the three path, then closed willingly down the lane, drawing off from the field to get up for the win in good
fashion. SAMS TIME set the pace early on, saving ground along the rail, getting pressed from the outside by CABOT, but faltered in late stretch and held on
for second. AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN was mid field, four wide, angled in sharply going into the turn, stacking up rivals on the inside and was disqualified
and placed last. HARD CANDY was mid pack racing two wide down the backstretch, got checked sharply, going into the turn, then gathered up a rally in the
stretch drive. FRANK THE MAYOR had no early foot, traveling four wide, then offered a mild rally in late stretch. RIVER RULER was mid field, racing in the
two path and had an even effort down the lane. MAGIC BOW was mid pack early on, racing along the rail, then got checked sharply and stacked up, going
into the turn and never fired. Following the running of the race, there was a Steward's Inquiry, regarding the incident going into the turn. After reviewing the
films, AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN was disqualified and place last for angling in going into the turn and stacking up foes.

TEXAS REMINGTON stalked the pace in the early goings, then rallied from the four path at the head of the stretch, drawing off from the field and blowing
them away for the win. TRUE DAKOTAN was near the back, saving ground along the inside, closed well, up the rail to get up for place and was second best
today. SECRET SURVIVOR was unhurried early and moved off the rail, three wide into the first turn, and staying in the three path, closed fast down the lane
to get up for show. RAMSHACK chased the pace in the early going, then angled out, four wide from the far turn but only had an even effort. STUCK made
the lead early on, traveling two off the rail and gave way in the stretch drive. HAMMERSCHMIDT stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch
and failed to respond down the lane. TWIST OF FATE pressed the pace down the backstretch and dropped back in the stretch drive. CAIRO SKY was mid
pack, three wide and faded in the far turn. BORN TO BE BRAVE trailed the field, going three wide and was no factor.
