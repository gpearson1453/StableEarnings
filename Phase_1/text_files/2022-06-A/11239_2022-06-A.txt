the pace along the inside, angled four wide through the stretch and couldn't get by the winner in the drive to finish second best. TANAGER settled off the
early pace, raced along the inside through the far turn, continued to race along the inside through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair in
the drive. JUSTA POPPIN was unhurried early on, moved up along the outside through the far turn through the stretch and had no late run. AQUINAS was
slow early, raced along the inside and had no response. CAMEO SHORES tracked the early leader while racing two wide and faded the final quarter of a

Footnotes
ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE was forwardly placed early on, made a good three wide bid and drove clear in the drive under steady pressure. MISS BELLA was
bumped at the break, stalked the pace, raced near the inside in the lane and finished second best. TIME TO MEDDLE stalked the pace, moved up five wide
near the quarter pole, raced along the outside in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. HERMISTON settled off the early going, raced near the inside
and had not enough in the drive. INFERNAL TIGER was slow early, passed tired ones late and never was a serious threat while racing from the inside.
SAILING IN was bumped at the break, stalked the pace while racing between, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.
DAVENPORT was off slowly, raced five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. BOLDACIOUS showed good early speed to set the pace,
was injured and had to be vanned off.

BIG FASHION broke out, bumped rival at the break, stalked the pace, made a good rail bid in the drive and held well to prevail under all out pressure.
NOOSITA pressed the pace, raced near the four path near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. SHE'S MY RIDE was slow early,
raced near the inside near the quarter pole, shifted out through the stretch run and moved up. LOVELY HUSSAR settled off the early pace, raced three to
four wide in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. WAHASHA showed good early speed from the inside and faded. LADY ELIANA was bumped,
shuffled back at the break, raced five wide through the upper lane and never threatened.
