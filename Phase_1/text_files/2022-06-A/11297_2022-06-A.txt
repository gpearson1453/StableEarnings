Footnotes
GIMBALA stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. LOUEMMA was
unhurried early, roused on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA set the pace and dueled on the turn
but had nothing left. SHOW SOME SKIN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MISS
TEA BLONDE stumbled at the start and saved ground on the turn but was no factor. CINDERVELLA was in range but chased on the turn and from the five
path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
PAPERBACK HERO was off slow, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. CORE tracked the early leaders and had
a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. M C JACKHAMMER was hustled early and had the
lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. PIPER AT WAR was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and was the best
of the rest. CALMING INFLUENCE was up close early but trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. MR. DYNAMIC was in mid
pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. BLACK TAFFY was away alertly and hustled along on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. I'M SO FLY was in range but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.
SPIRIT SOUL BODY broke poorly and showed nothing while outrun.
