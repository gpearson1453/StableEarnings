Footnotes
TEXAS LONHRO was forwardly placed early on, tracked the solid pace from a two wide path, closed on the pacesetter in mid-stretch, was confronted by
TIZ VICIOUS inside of the sixteenth-marker and gamely dug in to prevail in the final strides. TIZ VICIOUS settled just off of the pace, mounted a four wide
rally into the drive, ranged up inside of the furlong marker, confronted TEXAS LONHRO inside of the sixteenth-marker and was denied the win by that game
foe while besting the rest. FULL OF LIFE was sent leaving the break, set contested fractions to the turn, extended the lead nearing the quarter marker, was
all out in the final furlong and was caught inside of the sixteenth-marker while holding for the show. BORKAN exchanged bumps with FULL OF LIFE and
was bothered leaving the start, chased the pace from the inside, improved position in upper stretch, lacked room in midstretch and could not muster a late
rally. DIAMOND WILLOW broke alertly and took back in the early going, came three wide along the turn and did not mount a late rally. TOM'S BIRTHDAY
was hard to place in the early stages and pulled on the rider to the turn, was two wide between foes then lost ground nearing the quarter marker and lacked
a late response.

DAY PLAN was sent leaving the start, contested the quick pace through the turn, disposed of the two pressing rivals in upper stretch and kicked clear in the
drive. NORTHWEST FACTOR was off a step slowly, chased the pace from the inside through the turn while never far back, angled out at the head of the
stretch, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on well to be best of the rest. TIP TOP GAL showed early speed and was two wide between foes while
disputing the quick early pace, held position through the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a late rally, while clear of the rest for third. STRIKE
AT DAWN chased the early pace, found a stalking position on the turn while three wide, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the end. THE
PHARAOH'S GIRL engaged with her stablemate soon after the break and disputed the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faded
in the late stages.

Footnotes
CRAZY DREAMS broke alertly and was sent to the front, established a clear early lead on the first turn, was well handled through the backstretch run,
drifted a bit into the second turn, was given a reminder and extended the lead into the drive, came under mild late pressure from the oncoming runner-up but
held safely in the end. TABLE FOR TWO was unhurried in the early stages, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, improved position while three
wide on the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, closed well in the late stages and could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest.
BID ON THE PRIZE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the early pace, was a bit green in spots through the backstretch run, was no match
for the top two in the stretch run but showed good late interest and was clear for third in the end. TAM'S TIME stumbled leaving the break but recovered to
be forwardly placed into the first turn, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, lost position along the second turn and weakened the stretch run. YOU
KIDDING ME came four wide into the first turn while racing just off of the pace, advanced along the backstretch run, gave ground to the winner on the far
turn and tired in the drive. GOOD FOCUS saved ground into the first turn while running in the midflight, made a middle move nearing the half-mile marker,
could not sustain that run on the second turn and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
FAR WEST won the break and led into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, repelled the bid of MAGIC TIGER
nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead into upper stretch, was kept to task through the lane and drew clear in the end. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY
was under a tight early hold while just off of the early pace, slipped to the inside along the second turn while gaining ground, tipped out at the head of the
stretch, was outfinished in the drive but held safely in the end for the place. MAGIC TIGER was close to the pace while three wide along the first turn, kept
close attendance to FAR WEST through the backstretch run, advanced to challenge that foe nearing the quarter marker, was repelled in that effort and was
outkicked in the drive, while clear of the rest for third. KNOWN was allowed to settled in the early going, trailed through the backstretch run and into the
second turn, was roused and went four wide into the stretch run and lacked a late rally in the drive. SUNNY SPOT was a bit hard to load, came three wide
into the first turn and made contact with IMPLICITLY heading into that bend, maintained position through the backstretch run, checked entering the second
turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late response. IMPLICITLY was a bit rank into the first turn and made contact with SUNNY SPOT leaving the
seven furlong marker, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, remained in contention along the second turn while three wide but dropped back in
upper stretch and came up empty in the end.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST broke alertly and was sent to set the early pace, was prompted through the backstretch run, turned away a bid from DEL MAR FLASH
nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and won in a drive at the end. GRIGORO came three wide into the first turn while stalking the
pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced while three then four wide approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked in the drive but
stayed on to get the nod for second in the end. DEL MAR FLASH hopped at the start but recovered nicely to be forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked
the moderate pace to the second turn, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, was outrun in upper stretch and was just edged in the end for
second, while holding for third. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was allowed to settle in the early stages, was roused to go two wide nearing the quarter marker,
ran evenly to the stretch but found her best stride in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. FOGGY BOTTOM settled just off of the early
pace while in midpack, saved ground to the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. NICOLE GRACE was unhurried in
the early going, lost contact along the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY AROUSAL was sent along the inside leaving the break and contested the early lead to the first turn, inched to a narrow lead along the backstretch
run, was well rated through the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and held safely in the end. DICK BEST contested the early pace then took
back off of the early speed, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, closed in midstretch, drifted in inside of the sixteenth marker while under
firm right-handed urging, pressured the winner in the final yards but could not reel him in and held for second. SAFE COMBINATION broke sideways and
was off slowly, settled outside of foes into the first turn, was carried out six wide along the first turn, recovered along the backstretch run and shifted in to go
two wide into the second turn, lacked room in upper stretch, advanced inside of the furlong marker, was squeezed by the drifting DICK BEST inside of the
sixteenth marker and was outfinished, while holding for third. DADDYS SPECIALDARK settled just off of the early pace, saved all of the ground to the
second turn, rallied along the inside in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. OMAHA RUTSCH left the gate in pursuit of a frontward position,
backed off the speed in the first turn under a snug hold, was allowed to pursue the leaders passing the six furlong marker, engaged HOLIDAY AROUSAL
from there to the stretch, but had no response when that one quickened for home. SLIGHT APPROVAL broke well, began to drift out entering the first turn
and impeded SAFE COMBINATION, exited the first turn six-wide and remained there the length of the backstretch, made a steady gain to get within aim of
the leaders then drifted out even wider on the far turn, lost ground into the drive, dropped back to last but managed to pass one tiring rival. FANTASTIC
DREAM hustled for the lead and was caught five wide as part of a quartet contending for the early lead, backed off the duel entering the backstretch, moved
up and was poised to challenge the leaders leaving the half, failed to quicken with the rest of the pack and tired under pressure.
