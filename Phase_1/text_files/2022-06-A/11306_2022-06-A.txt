Footnotes
ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED tracked pace to stretch, took over in mid stretch while all out and held on under stout handling to the wire. JOE BRRRR no
speed to the stretch, rallied through the lane and coming on too late. BE MY DOCTOR was a bit slow into stride, rushed up to contend, ran on evenly
though the stretch run for the show spot. LITTLE RED SCOOTER had inside speed to the front, dueled to quarter pole but weakened in the late going.
FATHER PATRICK slow into stride and never menaced while outside through the stretch run. ROCKA BARRY good position to the turn but weakened
through the stretch run. CINDY'S STORM chased outside to turn and gave way readily. HIDDEN HOOK was through early and dropped far back.
