Footnotes
BOSSHIP Contested the lead along the two path, kicked loose some and under the whip outran GREY INVASION to the wire. GREY INVASION Well
placed in hand along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, responded and closed determinedly. TRAPPE THE DREAM Lagged far back, three path
on the turn and rallied. SYNCOPY Well placed in hand along the three path on the turn, asked when straightened out and hung. LUCKY MANNY Well
placed in hand along the rail and weakened inside. OLIVER WITHA TWIST Broke sluggishly, three path on the turn, was not a threat. SMART STORM Vied
for the lead along the rail to the lane and gave way. HANGAR ONE Broke slow, two path on the turn and tired.
