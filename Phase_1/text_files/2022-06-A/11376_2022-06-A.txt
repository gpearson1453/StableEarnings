Footnotes
CHARMING CHARLIE led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and in
upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and pulled clear under a drive. POETIC CODE raced six wide around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a four wide bid coming around the far turn and gained ground on the outside to the wire. STRONG
AGAIN raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a bid from the three path
passing the three eighths pole, raced in tight quarters in midstretch, split horses near the eighth pole and gained ground between rivals late. OUR NOBLE
ORTEGA brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, stalked the leader from the three path through the opening half mile, dueled from the three
path around the far turn and gave way in the final furlong. SILVER MATT hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the two path early,
began to improve position coming up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and flattened out in the lane. DUKE SKYWALKER raced off
the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed
tiring horses on the outside in the stretch. CAJUN BAYOU hit the gate leaving it, raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off
the pace on the far outside, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and made no bid. MILLENNIUM CONDO bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled between horses from the two
path around the second turn, gave way entering the stretch and weakened further from there. MAGIC BOMB raced in the two path around the first turn,
chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded entering the stretch. CAN'T BE BROKEN tracked the
leaders while saving ground around the first turn, raced in tight quarters up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and
tired further from there. WARRIORS IN LACE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up
the backstretch and around the second bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MIA CAMILA raced in the three path around the first turn, began to improve position on the outside coming up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the three path, dueled down the lane, and pulled clear while drifting in late. YOLANDA'S PRIDE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground with a late surge to the wire. OGLALA chased the frontrunner on
the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled down the lane
and was forced to check near the wire when MIA CAMILA drifted into her lane. Z FIRST led the way from the two path through the opening half mile, dueled
while saving ground around the far turn and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. HARDLY SOCIAL trailed the field around the firs turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. FISH MOONEY raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch and around the far turn at the back of the pack and made no bid. RIVETING SPIRIT saved ground around
the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, switched to the outside for the run around the far turn and was empty from
there. BOTH A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS OBJECTION WAS LODGED ALLEGING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE SEVEN AGAINST HORSE
SIX IN LATE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SEVEN CAUSED HORSE SIX A FAIR CHANCE AT PLACING
SECOND AND HORSE SEVEN WAS DISQUALIFIED TO THIRD.

Footnotes
JOYFUL SURPRISE set the pace well off the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. ASTRAL RIDE stalked the winner three and
four wide, could not gain on that foe but held clear of the rest. PIPITO raced off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes around the turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. UNIQUE TIME hopped at the start, chased the pace two wide and weakened in the lane.
COLORS pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive. J P CORNETTA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. EXTRACTION WILL
steadied early, raced three wide and never threatened. REGIO hit the starting gate, raced four wide and made little impact. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE had
brief speed inside. BROADWAY RUCKUS trailed inside. THIS WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MISS YOUNIVERSE settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced between foes around the turn, tipped further out turning for home, moved to the
front nearing the eighth pole and widened under a drive. CAPRIDREY raced off the pace two wide, advanced between rivals around the turn, idled in mild
traffic between the quarter pole and the three-sixteenths marker, angled four wide near the eighth pole and finished strongly from there. ROUGH ENOUGH
disputed the pace inside of foes in the two pat, was collared in upper stretch and stayed on well enough to preserve the show. RIDE LITTLE GIRL was
bumped at the start, raced well back two wide and rallied for a minor share. HOLIDAY PRINCESS failed to menace while racing three wide. THE JOKES
ON ME had speed between foes and faded in the lane. HARD CHOICE played no factor while racing four wide. MANGORITA was bumped at the start,
raced five to six wide and made little impact. JUANITA R disputed the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. IRISH SAMURAI chased the pace
inside and came up empty in the lane. KATNISS played no factor while racing five wide. RUN LULU RUN stopped after a half and was easing through the
lane.

Footnotes
SPLICER was clipped behind soon after the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, swept to the front leaving the eighth
pole and drew off under a drive. MISS BETH'EL raced two wide in midpack, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. VANDALIA stalked
the pace two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole then weakened. FULL OF ATTITUDE was
up close three wide, could not keep pace around the far turn but churned on to regain some position in the lane. HONORARY GUEST stalked the pace
three wide, briefly led between foes around the far turn and weakened through the lane. VEXEDNRELAXED set the pace in the two path and tired nearing
the lane. MISS MAMBA clipped heels soon after the start, saved ground and never threatened. ADELE KAT saved ground in range, steadied late on the first
turn, was put to a drive entering the far turn and lacked a solid response. DANCIN DEE was fractious in the starting gate, lunged at the start then played no
factor while racing three wide. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was outrun while racing four to six wide. PLAYA INCLUSION settled off the early pace three wide,
made a three wide middle move, briefly led near the five-sixteenths pole then stopped soon after.

Footnotes
MARYQUITECONTRARY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled gamely down the lane and prevailed late. ROSIE'S HALO pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to
challenge while racing in the two path around the turn, dueled gamely in the stretch and gave way in the final strides. MILES OF SMILES tracked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground while while drifting out mildly in the final furlong. ADIOS BABY
stalked the pace setters on the outside in the early going, launched a bid from the three path coming around the turn and flattened out in the lane. TAG HER
led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and gave way entering the stretch. FAR HEART trailed the field up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. SHEZA SPITFIRE chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the two path and tired from there. KELSEY'S SHOT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn
in the two path and was empty in the stretch. LOLA LOCA stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the opening stages, navigated the turn
from the two and three path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SISTER LOU ANN set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. SATURDAY NITE GIRL prompted the pace two
wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to narrow the gap late. JAN'S GIRL was off a step slow, tracked the pace
three wide for five furlongs, angled in entering the far turn, saved ground around most of that bend, angled back out to split rivals three wide entering the
lane and had a mild stretch rally. MISS YOU ELLA saved ground off the pace, advanced between foes down the backstretch, checked entering the far turn,
raced two wide around that bend, tipped out in upper stretch and finished strongly. LOVE HER LOTS broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace three and
four wide, came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. THEREARENORULES steadied nearing the first turn, saved ground around both turns
and never threatened. OMIXOCHITL settled off the early pace two wide, launched a three wide bid around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA FROLIC settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide between rivals around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch,
quickly cleared then lasted under a steady drive. TREASURE KING tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and just
missed. KLUGMAN broke awkwardly and slowly, advanced three wide around the first turn, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, turned for home
on near even terms but was no match for the top two. TRUST DADDY steadied along while in tight between foes through the opening quarter, went three
wide around the far turn and was no threat. OLD TOWN ROAD set the pace along the rail and wilted in the lane. MERLIN saved ground and failed to
menace. BOB MARCO raced off the pace four wide, was pulling hard down the backstretch, bid four wide around the far turn and retreated through the
stretch. THIS WAS HAND-TIMED.

HIERRO dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off a late closer to the wire. MEADE raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire.
BLESSED JOURNEY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, launched a bid between horses approaching the three
eighths pole, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked late. PLATO raced off the pace on the outside up the chute and backstretch, began to
improve position from the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground in late stretch. POCO CHARLIE raced at the back of the pack on the
inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, improved position mildly in upper stretch and finished evenly. BENEFACTOR tracked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the final furlong. DEVOTED KITTEN trailed the field up the long
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and came up empty from there. TONE FEELIN dueled on the outside through the opening half mile,

Footnotes
IMPRESSIVE SPEED settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced inside around the far turn, got through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch,
seized command near the eighth pole, edged ahead from a wall of rivals then dug in to repel MY MAN FLINT in the later yards. MY MAN FLINT stalked the
pace inside, angled four wide in upper stretch, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, bumped with TULFARRIS in midstretch and battled to the wire.
TULFARRIS (GB) stalked the pace three wide and four wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, bumped near the eighth pole, could not match strides with
the top two from there but stayed on for the show. MY BOY BLUE raced three wide in midpack early, advanced five wide around the far turn, bid in
midstretch and flattened out. BIRDMAN RICHIE was off slow, raced three and four wide and never threatened. BARAHIN set the pace along the rail around
the first turn and in the two path around the far turn, battled to midstretch then gave way. SOLAR TAP pressed the pace two and three wide, bid between
foes in upper stretch, steadied in tight in midstretch and had no further bids. LOVE ME ARCHIE failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
ORIENTAL PARK played no factor while racing two and three wide. FAST PAYDAY was outrun while racing three wide.
