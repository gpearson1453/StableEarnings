Footnotes
SHELLY D'ORO was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker, responded when challenged
by OUR ISLAND GIRL with a furlong to run and drew clear through the final yards. OUR ISLAND GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, engaged the winner with a furlong to run but failed to sustain her rally. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC broke
sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. UNBRIDLED DIVA chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
gave way after going a half. MAMIE'S WARRIOR was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. BLUE LUNA WHO
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. WILEO PROCEED was off a step slow and lagged throughout.
