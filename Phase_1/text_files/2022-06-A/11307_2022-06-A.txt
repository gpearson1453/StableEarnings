DEPUTY LAW broke readily, dueled for command inside a rival while angling to the inside racing into the bend, shook clear racing through the stretch was
kept to pressure. STILLWATER BROWN tracked off the leaders along the inside from just out of striking distance racing into the bend, shifted out racing
through the stretch and edged second in late stages. TAPIT SAM settled inside foes in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued
with interest to prevail for the place honors. STUN GUN tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the bend, was urged to make a brief bid between
foes but flattened out in upper stretch. HEAVENLY GAZEBO was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, drifted out five
wide in the stretch and gave way. A P GUNNER dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHINNY angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, continued under light reserve on the far turn awaiting an opening nearing
the lane, then came through when presented an opening in upper stretch to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. THIRTY SECONDS
OUT was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped off the rail racing into the stretch, resisted the winner's bid
to late stages but proved only second best. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, faded in
the drive. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY, reserved along the inside for the opening five furlongs, tipped out racing through the stretch and continued evenly.
YAK tracked outside rivals racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. AIGLE dwelt at the start and was never involved. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
READY TO RUNAWAY was urged along the inside to the first turn, disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, met a rival's challenge racing through the far
turn, edged clear in upper stretch, went clear under firm encouragement in the closing stages and was taken in hand approaching the wire. STREET OF
DREAMS, urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset to the far turn, proved no match in the drive while best of the others.
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY angled inwards tracking off the first flight in the opening five furlongs, swung out racing into upper stretch and continued well
enough to edge a rival for a share. SAILING ALONG tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out three wide nearing the lane while
being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. A BROKEN BREEZE switched outside foes racing to the backstretch and faded after a half. OWEN'S
PLEASURE dropped out early.

Footnotes
VIOLIN MAKER was rated off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, tipped out three wide entering the far turn, advanced between foes in that
path racing through the stretch and produced a steady late response to just edge LIGHT CRUISER in time under firm encouragement. The latter was rated
off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch splitting rivals just off the inside, moved to
challenge for command leaving the furlong marker to lead between calls late and just missed. WHISKEY PLANK, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in
the opening half, edged forward nearing the lane to gain a clear advantage but was collared by the top pair late. WHERE'D THE DAY GO tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, then continued willingly in that path to
close the gap. TOUR THE WORLD settled well off the leaders while angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped off the inside entering upper
stretch while being roused to advance and continued to make mild progress between foes to the end. EDGIE REGGIE tracked off the first flight along the
inside racing to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. BIG MERRILL settled last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. WARNING LABEL,
urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the backstretch, was spent after a half. HONOR STRIKE, urged three wide early prompting the
pace in the opening half, continued to press the issue outside a rival on the far turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
ASENA sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin through the turn, then widened through the stretch under firm left
handed pressure. CHAI TEA tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the lane and edged a rival for second
in late stages. LAC VIEUX DESERT tracked off the second flight along the inside through the backstretch, tipped out to the four path racing into upper
stretch and edged a rival for a share. HONEY BELLA settled into stride outside a rival in early stages, angled inside saving ground on the turn and
continued with interest inside foes to improve position. APART OF MY CHARM tracked the pacesetter four wide racing as part of the second flight on the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the winner in the three path to upper stretch and faded late. FULL SPEED ASTERN settled last in early stages and failed
to menace thereafter. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME, washy, in the post parade, flashed brief pace between foes but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
TWIRLING SAVI, caught five wide in the opening stages, was prompted to a forward placing three deep nearing the turn, lost some ground to a rival
entering the bend, but continued with a steady three wide rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm hand urging. REPASADO was urged while angling
to the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn, held sway past midstretch but couldn't fend
off the winner. MIA BABY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the bend, came through nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid but drifting
out while coming up empty in late stages. PLANETARY tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening three sixteenths, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with interest to improve position. RATTLEME, urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way into the turn. SECRET HIDEAWAY
broke slowly, settled last racing to the turn and passed only tiring rivals. WREXHAM was taken in had to be rated off the first flight between foes while going
a bit erratically nearing the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. MIZ GISELA was reserved off the second flight outside a rival in early stages and
emptied out abruptly racing into the turn.
