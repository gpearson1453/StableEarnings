DIAL IT UP A NOTCH sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way up the backstretch, widened advantage around the turn then was coaxed
three wide at the head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away. OUR CLOVER GAL raced behind the pacesetter and hustled along two wide
around the turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane and had to settle for second best. MUSE raced in pursuit of the top pair heading into the turn, stayed on
two to three wide into the lane and churned on for a share. CORAGEOUSCHRISTINE was ridden along three to four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
SUEZ was allowed to settle in early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, shifted to the three path in the final furlong, finished determinedly and
got up in time. ARISTOCAT rated three to four near midpack up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid in the upper stretch, briefly gained the lead then
got caught by the winner. PREGAME stalked up the backstretch then roused forward and dueled for the lead around the far turn, shook clear in the upper
stretch and got outkicked in late stages. KEEN CONTENDER rated along the inside through early stages, cut the corner entering the lane then shifted out
three wide and failed to kick on. LUCKY DUDE was off awkwardly at the start, settled through early stages then made a bid between foes and steadied
mid-way around the far turn, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. YOUNG O' DAINE dueled for the lead in early stages,
continued to battle around the far turn then tired in the drive. OH LITTLE BRUTHA dueled inside of YOUNG O' DIANE up the backstretch and weakened in
the final turn.

Footnotes
MOLLIES ROCKET tracked the top flight up the backstretch then roused forward and vied four deep around the turn, continued to battle for command into
the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling in the final furlong and edged away. TOPPER T was a step slow at the start and settled off the early pace,
saved ground then given cue along the rail at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and captured place. WOKE UP IN LOVE raced off the early
pace, hustled up leaving the turn, raced wide into the lane and rallied for a share. BASIC CHANCE dueled for the early lead and continued to battle around
the turn, drifted out a path in the upper stretch causing SIR WALLY WALLY to steady, fought back to the furlong marker then gave way. TIME GOES ON
vied between rivals for the early lead, continued to duel around the far turn then tired in the drive. GREEDY CREEDY raced in the last flight, was ridden
along two to three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. SCRUTINIZER dueled four deep for the early lead, remained up close around the turn then
faded in the lane. SIR WALLY WALLY dueled between rivals for the early lead, continued to battle for command around the turn then steadied when BASIC
CHANCE drifted out in the upper stretch, lost all momentum and dropped back. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEY OBJECTION FROM THE
RIDER OF SIR WALLY WALLY, BASIC CHANCE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST
