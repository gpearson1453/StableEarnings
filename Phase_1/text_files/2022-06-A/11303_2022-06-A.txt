Footnotes
ALPHA PREDATOR tracked the pace well back, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then shook
clear and drew off while being kept to the task. MAQAMAT sent from the gate, stalked the pace on outside, moved up to gain a short lead into the second
turn, shook clear through the turn, then was no match for the winner in the lane and held the place. RICHARD HOOTY allowed to settle, looped up three
wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in under right hand urging and closed for the show. SEA CAPTAIN sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then weakened in the lane and held a share. SURPRISE KICK was no factor.

TIDAL WATERS stalked the pace from between, edged ahead into the turn, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the lane and lasted. SILVER
TOKEN allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner
late. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, evened out and held the show.
KOOSMAN tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly. FIERCE WARRIOR well placed
and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. GOLDEN OAK ran evenly for a half and had no rally. WILD ENOUGH set
the early pace inside and faded through the turn.

held. HARROW well placed and off the rail, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not
threaten the winner and held the place. CREATIVE CHOICE bumped by both sides at the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. MARK THE MOOSE steadied into the first turn, was unhurried, moved up two and three wide
through the second turn and passed a tiring rival. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER steadied into the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside and faded through
