Footnotes
GLENDORA MINECAT dueled for the lead with SUN TREADER while racing three-wide, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and edged away late.
SUN TREADER was away alertly to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied through a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly late.
ATTILA'S FLAG was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. SWITCHERONIMO settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. REALREALGOOD raced unhurried early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and failed to menace. TESTING THE WATERS broke sharply to vie for the lead for a half and weakened. SANTIAGO'S TOWER
was slow to begin, lagged, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. CEDAR EXTRA BOLD raced off the pacesetters and
gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off.
SUPERBLEA stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker but could not match strides with the
winner in the drive. STORM N GOLD chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. CYNICAL GIRL settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. GRAN MANNA raced off the pacesetters from between foes, saved ground through
the turn and was not a factor. GABRIELLA WHO sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.
SPEED SEAL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. OLIVE COUNTY lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not menace. PARTYATTHECAPITAL lagged throughout.

CHIPPSTER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards to be
going away late. SUPER HUNK broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage with a furlong to run, gained a brief lead but
could not match strides with the winner late. OKIE CITY chased the pace of INDIAN NIGHTS while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter and
gave way late. INDIAN NIGHTS sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged nearing the quarter and gave way grudgingly in the drive.
TAB ME OUT lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. DUDE ROW showed brief speed, weakened and was eased
through the lane. PER RULING 2022-RUI-62 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, SUPER HUNK WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
CERVEZA raced unhurried early while racing from between foes, angled in with a sixteenth to run and was up in the final jump. ON A WARPATH dueled for
the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run, remained in control through mid-stretch and just failed to last. STORMIN FAST was
away in good order to dispute the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. EVACUEE showed no early
speed, checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out and finished with good late energy. NEXT AFFAIR was off a step slow, settled just off the
leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. TUCUM showed brief speed and weakened. MR GOLD MAN broke sharply to vie for the lead while
racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.
