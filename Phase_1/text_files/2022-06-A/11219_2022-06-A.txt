Footnotes
ALLEYCAT stalked the early pace from a two wide path, was two wide between foes into the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter marker to go
three wide into the drive, came within aim inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task and drew clear in the end. RUNAWAY KRISTIN settled just off of the
early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and was overtaken by ALLEYCAT
in the final sixteenth, while edging clear for second. HULA KING was sent leaving the break, set moderate fractions to the second turn, came under
pressure nearing the quarter marker, was able to hold the top two at bay through the furlong marker but gave way in the end. HAWK'S RISING settled of of
the pace, was a bit rank into the backstretch run, was roused three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. RICH WARRIOR was away a step slowly
and was hustled to be just off of the early pace, was kept to a tight hold through the early stages, saved ground into the second turn and faded late. FOUR
O'FIVE settled off of the pace while three wide on the first turn, was asked for run leaving the three-eighths marker and came up empty.

Footnotes
PRINCE DE PRINCE broke alertly and took back off of the pace, was roused three wide along the turn, made a steady bid through the drive, overtook
COUNTING CARDS inside of the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. COUNTING CARDS was sent leaving the break, dueled with BETITO
through the turn while carving out quick fractions, shook free of that rival inside of the final furlong, could not hold off the winner in the late stages and just
held for second. CLAIM OF PASSION chased the quick pace from the inside, advanced in upper stretch, tipped out leaving the sixteenth marker, closed
well late and just missed for the place. MCGEORGE lacked speed through the turn, swung out nearing the furlong marker, found his best stride late but was
unable to make an impact. BETITO was hustled out of the gate, engaged with COUNTING CARDS leaving the break and dueled with that rival through the
turn while setting quick fractions, lost ground leaving the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. EMERALD MAGIC chased the pace, lost ground in
upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
LAST STARFIGHTER broke alertly, pressed the moderate pace through the turn, overtook ALY'S NATION in upper stretch and inched clear nearing the
furlong marker, came under late pressure and just held on to prevail. DIZZY DAZMURA was off a bit slowly and was a bit green in the first furlong, lacked
speed into the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker but was blocked approaching the top of the stretch, advanced in midstretch, closed well in the final
stages, drifted in under right-handed urging and just missed for the win on the line, while holding for second. DEAREST BARBARA stalked the pace to the
turn, came three wide approaching the top of the stretch, was outfinished in the drive and held safely in the end for third. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY chased the
moderate pace from a three wide path and was outkicked in the stretch run. DADDY'SFAVORITESON chased the pace from the inside, gained ground in
upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole, flattened out in that effort and took up in the final yards when bothered by a drifting rival. RUNAWAY
PRINCESS was bumped sharply at the break and was off slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals and finished evenly in the drive. ALY'S NATION was
sent leaving the break and set moderate fractions through the turn while being pressed by the winner, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the late
going. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH INVOLVING #3 DIZZY DAZMURA AND #1
DADDY'SFAVORITESON AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT DIZZY DAZMURA DRIFTED IN IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH AND IMPEDED
DADDY'SFAVORITESON, COSTING DADDY'SFAVORITESON THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED DIZZY DAZMURA
FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH. ALSO, THE RIDER OF #1 DADDY'SFAVORITESON LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3
DIZZY DAZMURA FOR THE SAME INCIDENT.

Footnotes
GEMMA ROYAL broke alertly and sped to a clear early lead, set the quick pace through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, was challenged in the
final stages by her stablemate, was all out in the final yards and held on to prevail. JUMPING JILL FLASH tracked the quick pace through the turn, closed
on her stablemate in the final sixteenth to pressure that foe but was outfinished in the end, while holding safely for second. KISS RIDE GOODBYE stalked
the pace from a three wide path through the turn, gained ground in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the top pair in the end. AMBA chased the pace
outside of rivals through the quarter marker, rallied in the drive but could not impact the top three. GARDEES WORLD chased the quick early pace from the
inside and did not offer a late rally. STAND IN YOUR LOVE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, trailed through the turn while saving ground, advanced
in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
COASTARANDO was unhurried in the early stages while saving all of the ground, improved position off of the turn, made a strong late run along the rail and
drew clear late. SHOUT IT OUT chased the early pace to the turn, advanced approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead in upper stretch and took a slim
advantage into the final furlong, was overhauled by the winner in the final sixteenth and held for second. LA POPIS broke in at the start and was off a bit
slowly, chased the pace on the turn while two wide, was boxed in leaving the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, angled out nearing the
sixteenth-marker and was outfinished in the final stages, while securing the show. DANCE LADY chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, came four
wide nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. YES YOUR GRAZE was sent leaving the break and showed
good early speed while setting solid fractions, was confronted nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late going. MISS ARROWHEAD stalked the
early pace, steadied between runners leaving the three furlong marker, advanced nearing the quarter marker while three wide but could not sustain that run
and weakened in the late stages. CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) was prominent early on, lost position along the turn and was empty in the drive.

HOLY GHOST saved ground while settling off of the early fractions, maintained a rail trip through the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, tipped out leaving the
furlong marker, came within aim in the final sixteenth and surged in the end to prevail. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was forwardly placed to the first turn, tracked
the leader into the backstretch run then advanced to prompt the pace through the second turn, closed in the drive to vie for the lead in the final sixteenth but
was outfinished in the end, while securing the place. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE broke alertly and was sent to the front, set prompted fractions to the second
turn, edged clear in upper stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides, while clear of the rest for third. POUR ON THE COLE
settled off of the quick early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, came three wide nearing the quarter pole, gained ground in upper
stretch but could not mount a late rally. DESCARTES settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the second turn, improved position in upper stretch
but lacked a late response. FINAL FINAL was a bit slow out of the gate and was unhurried in the early stages, came two wide along the second turn while
trailing and was not a factor.

LA REINE'S LEGACY tracked the pace while in hand through the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, overtook PROOF OF JAZZ in upper
stretch, shook free of that rival inside of the furlong marker and held safely in the end. PROOF OF JAZZ stumbled a bit leaving the break but recovered to
go to the front, set moderate fractions while through the backstretch run, came under pressure in upper stretch and was overtaken, shifted outside of the
winner and stayed on well in the end and held for second over an oncoming rival. SHEZARUNAWAY was unhurried early on, trailed to the second turn while
saving ground and not far back, improved position in upper stretch and continued that rally in the final sixteenth to just miss for second while securing third
in the end. GEA was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position on the second turn while four wide, was roused at the head of the lane and was
outkicked in the drive. MERCY MERCY was three wide along the first turn while sitting off of the pace, improved position along the backstretch run,
continued to advance while three wide nearing the quarter pole but did not rally in the stretch run. WHISTLER'S STYLE was forwardly placed to the first
turn, steadied and made contact with MOMMA MOCCA nearing the seven-furlong marker, stalked the pace through the backstretch run and into the second
turn, remained in contention into midstretch but weakened in the final stages. MOMMA MOCCA stalked the early pace, steadied and made contact with
WHISTLER'S STYLE entering the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run and into the second turn and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
JASMINE CHIEFTAIN settled just off of the early lead while maintaining a ground saving path, was well handled through the turn, gained in upper stretch,
gamely split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker to come within aim and made a good late push to prevail. PERSUASIVE LIPS showed early speed and
pressed the pace through the turn, gave ground in upper stretch but closed well inside of the furlong marker, took a narrow lead into the final yards and was
tagged for the win while clear of the rest for the place. LILA AT THE BEACH broke alertly and took back to stalk the pace to the turn while outside of rivals,
gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outfinished in the drive but held for third in the end. LIAM'S SECRET hit the gate at the break and was away
slowly, chased the pace from the rear through the turn, closed well through traffic in the drive and finished willingly while unable to impact the top three. DR
WYSONG broke slightly inward after the break, settled near the rail at the back of the pack with LIAM'S SECRET to her outside, remained behind horses
into the turn, quickened with the pack into the stretch and finished with some interest but only passed a pair of tiring horses in the end. BENGAL TIGER was
away best of all and opened up a clear lead while running in the two path, repelled a pair of challenges from the midpoint and opened up on the field but
gave way in the final yards. SEGURO from the gate well while four wide, was good striking position to the final quarter but faltered in the late stages.
