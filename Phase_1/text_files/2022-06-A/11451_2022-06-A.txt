Footnotes
REAL CITY SPEED broke a bit awkwardly to be last away and off slow, hustled up the inside to a position in the second flight the opening furlong, waited in
tight along the rail with four furlongs to run to see that advance stall, continued behind the leaders along the inside turn, knifed out and hit a moving seam in
upper straight, challenged soon after from the outside, edged clear under steady handling. AHIMAAZ took control soon after the start, continued to set the
pace closest to the inside through the turn, shook off nearest pursuer turning for home, responded when challenged by the winner a furlong out, gave
ground grudgingly to that foe while saving the place late. LULOS broke back, continued to lack speed through the turn in the two path, dropped to the inside
for the drive, made a late bid for the second spot, denied. FAMOUS YANKEE back off the pace while racing outside, four wide through the turn and into the
straight, lacked the necessary closing kick. CORN POP went one paced while racing three wide. WHISKEY GENT pressured the runner up for three
furlongs from the outside in the two path and gave way. SUN STRIKER fell back to trail after the start and never menaced. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TESTO outrun early while off the inside, settled in the second flight up the backstretch, asked along far turn, came three wide for the drive,
engaged the leader from the outside inside the furlong grounds and wore that rival down under continued steady handling. DRIED PEPPER pressed the
leader from the outside for six furlongs, took over turning for home, responded when the winner challenged with less that a furlong remaining, yielded to that
one late, saved the place. TRIVISTA broke out, brushed with JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT, lacked speed, swung out widest behind the winner turning for home,
late gain while remaining well out in the strip. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT brushed at the break, showed the way into the first turn, set all the pace until a quarter
remained, stopped when headed by the runner up, jogged across late.

Footnotes
BRINEE took control after the start. WENDY WILECAT tracked the leaders inside, continued to save ground turn, got through along the rail into the straight
to improve position, extended drive for the second spot, determined to earn that position, no real threat to the winner. TEXAS PROMO GIRL closest to the
leader off the inside, hooked up with the runner up a furlong out, outkicked late, best of the rest. CRYPTO BRAVE off the pace and the inside, raced three
wide through the turn, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. VALID BREAK unprepared for the start to spot the field several lengths, trailed
early as a result, remained back turn, steered out widest for the drive, finished up willingly down the middle of the course to better herself late. BOSTON
BELLE broke outward but with the leaders, vied three wide into the turn, began to weaken late in the bend then continued to back up through the stretch.
MACEE with the early pace while outside the winner and between foes, also began to falter in the turn. OUR LIBERINA steadied at the start, remained
always back in failing to threaten. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CITADEL hesitated at the break, lacked speed for five furlongs, began to move on the outside far turn, circled toward the front four wide into the lane, bid,
quickly clear. WISE GUY moved up to contend on the outside and four wide early in the first turn, dueled in the two path up the backstretch and into the final
turn, held a small advantage into the lane, offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch, held sway for the second spot. OCTOBER SURPRISE
lacked early speed off the inside, raced four wide through the final turn, set down the for drive, slowly getting to the runner up. HONORARIAN broke with the
leaders, dueled up front inside the runner up, remained on equal terms with that one through the final turn then began to gradually weaken. SOBEK broke a
step slow, lacked speed, remained back into the far turn, came five wide for the drive, roused, improved position. JEHA mid pack and off the inside,
continued in the two path through the final turn, failed to respond in the drive. SEMI CHARMED LIFE rank in the first turn when rank, continued unsettled
onto the backstretch when chasing the dueling leaders, gave way. END ZONE forwardly placed early, was finished before a half.

Footnotes
LONE STAR DIVA broke with the leaders, moved closer before a half off the inside, bid, took over late in the final turn, kicked well clear under steady
handling. HUSHED COURT ROOM broke in to bother NIN TO WIN who in turn bumped and bothered MISSGREELEY'SSONG, was righted and raced
forwardly early inside, remained in a striking position in the two path second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best.
MSCHITCHATTOUR back off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane between horses, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no threat
to the top apair. NIN TO WIN bothered and bumped with MISSGREELEYS'SONG at the break, raced back in lacking speed, fanned five wide into the lane,
also bettered herself with a mild rally out in the course. MY SWEET SOPHIA chased the leader early, fell back before a half, went evenly to the wire after
angling out late in the final turn. TUGBOAT broke alertly, set the pace for almost six furlongs, faltered when headed by the winner turning for home.
MISSGREELEY'SSONG bumped and then was floated in and broke into the gap at the break, remained back in failing to threaten. AGIRLNAMEDSYD last
to leave, void of speed, fanned six wide into the lane, failed to mount a rally.

Footnotes
FRANK THE MAYOR allowed the pace to go early, saved some ground behind the first flight turn, tipped out for the drive, finished with good resolve to win
going away out in the middle of the strip. HONOR MY SPEED away in good order, with the pace in the two path and between horses, held a narrow
advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, proved game for the second split. DEBONNAIRE DUDE set or forced the pace in the three
path outside the runner up, also proved not a match for the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. OVERDELIVER broke out but a alertly, also raced
with the pace, closest to the inside, weakened. MISTAKE PRESENT pressed the issue while four wide and between horses into the turn, fell back a bit
through the turn and had little left for the drive. SR. CLARKY forced the pace while five wide for a half and also tired through the stretch. SONOMA CRUSH
in tight at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE broke sharp, ,worked way clear soon after, set all the pace along the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker,
fully extended to just last. FATHER GOOSE in the second flight inside, continued to save ground into the lane, shifted outside the winner past the furlong
marker, finished willingly to rapidly close the gap to narrowly missed. YOUNG BULL broke with the leaders, fell back into the turn, saved ground into the
stretch then rallied up the inside to earn the show. ROSIE'S OUTLAW in mid pack off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, improved position
slightly without posing a serious threat. HEZA PRIORITY in the second flight while racing in the two path, came up empty when called on for the drive.
SMOOTH COLLIERY broke back and failed to menace. TAPIZARS SECRET chased the winner for three furlongs then gave way when the real running
began at the head of the straight. IN THE ARCH last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.
