Footnotes
COMMANDER COMPTON was away alertly, angled in at once, set the pace toward the inside, relinquished command after a half, boxed on between rivals
doggedly to the stretch, wrestled control back inside the furlong marker and proved narrowly best. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE was reserved off of the
pace along the inside, slipped through and sieged the lead after a half, fought on gamely, was headed in midstretch, dug in but was kept at bay. DUAL
THREAT settled off of the inside, got through entering the stretch and was fully extended to earn the minor award. CALIPARI tracked three wide in hand,
ranged up four wide to engage the leaders on the second turn, but wilted in the drive and faded. ARROW STRIKE pressed between horses for six furlongs
and tired. BRIGHT SPARK was shuffled back early, settled three deep, was fanned out further on the second turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ESTABLISHED settled in hand, came under a ride into the turn, looped up four wide, churned on through the drive and wore down IRISH HOKIE in the final
jump. IRISH HOKIE broke sharp, settled off of the pace off of the inside, launched a bold bid between rivals, opened clear and widened into the lane, kept
on willingly but was turned away in the shadow of the wire. IN SKY WE TRUST settled saving ground, angled out leaving the turn, kicked on and was
making up ground. CARAMELITO was close up along the inside, shifted out a bit entering the stretch, offered a mild bid but lacked the needed late
response. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN was unhurried into stride and was never a factor. ESTILO VARONIL rushed to the lead, opened clear and angled in to
set the pace, was headed nearing the five-sixteenths marker and gave way readily.

Footnotes
AIDANIKE stalked three wide, moved up into the turn, loomed large entering the stretch, was forced wider when DIAMOND LYDIAMARIE came out, shook
off that one and quickly kicked away. DIAMOND LYDIAMARIE was away in good order, set the pace along the inside, widened leaving the chute, drifted out
entering the stretch to meet the challenge of AIDANIKE near the three-sixteenths pole, was unable to go on with that foe but stayed on to hold the place.
FIELD DAISEY saved ground in the second flight, advanced between horses, failed to menace the top two, then was all out to earn the show spot. BEAUTY
DAY was allowed to settle three wide, circled into the stretch five wide but failed to make headway. MONTGOMERY PARK was close up off of the inside,
but faltered leaving the turn and faded. HER GIANT showed little. C V THUNDER broke awkwardly and never recovered.

Footnotes
PATNA came away flat footed, tugged to contention outside, was wrangled back off of the leader before going a half, turned up the pressure on the turn,
poked her head in front a quarter mile out, was shaken up once straightened for the drive and edged clear. STANLEY MARKET sprinted clear to set the
pace, was unable to go on with the winner entering the stretch, but kept on fairly well to clearly prove the best of the rest. FANNIE AND FREDDIE settled in
hand, ranged up three wide through the turn, offered a mild bid entering the stretch but flattened in the drive. QUEROBIN DOURADA was forwardly placed
along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, loomed a danger but faltered in the final furlong. SEQUIST trailed.

CAN MAN DO dueled along the inside with SPEED BOAT through the turn, shook clear with three-sixteenths to run, was kept to task and maintained a
diminishing advantage. DROP ANCHOR broke outwardly, bumped BRONZE BEAST early, settled inside, moved up through turn, shifted out and was
getting to the winner. SPEED BOAT dueled outside through the turn, weakened entering the stretch but had enough left to hold the show. CAPTAIN
FANTASTIC was bumped early, was allowed to settle, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, circled four wide through the turn and into the lane, and
improved position. TOM'S LAST GENERAL was away alertly, settled off of the pace, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. BRONZE BEAST was
bumped and squeezed at the start and never recovered.

SALUTE THE FLAG was forwardly placed along the inside, tipped out entering the stretch, quickened once uncovered, engulfed the leader and was up in
the final yards. NOSILVERSPOONSHERE tracked three deep, launched his bid between rivals, forged command inside the three-sixteenths pole, edged
clear and kept on but was unable to resist the winner. SUNNY ISLE BEACH was unhurried into stride, took closer order into the second turn, angled out and
came four wide, improved position but failed to seriously threaten. TAKE CHARGE LORIN was fractious in the gate, came away in good order, angled in to
set the pace, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way once headed. RICHEBOURG broke slow, moved up outside, engaged the leaders midway
through the second turn, but came up empty entering the lane and retreated.

MUMAYAZ tracked between rivals, took over midway through the turn, opened clear and widened. OUR TEAM sped clear to dictate terms, proved no match
for the winner nearing the five-sixteenths marker, but kept on fairly well to hold the place. SCOTCH NO ROCKS came away a step slow, moved up along
the inside, angled out on the turn, came four wide and continued on willingly. ONYOURMARKGETSETGO was close up four wide through the turn and
weakened. FEROCITY was forwardly placed along the inside, but came up empty leaving the bend and faded. HONORABLE VOW was slow into stride and
showed little. GREENRIDGE THUNDER broke slow, went wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE BLAZE was away alertly, tracked in hand outside, took over midway through the turn and drew away. RUN UP THE SCORE stalked the pace three
deep, came four wide, failed to menace the winner but kept on willingly to prove best of rest. AMERICAN PYRAMID was allowed to settle, looped into the
stretch five wide and was along for the show. MORE THAN VOWS rushed to the lead along the inside, was headed near the five-sixteenths marker, was no
match for the winner, weakened further in the drive and faded. MAHOMEBRED went greenly in traffic and checked losing position, mounted an advance
between foes through the turn, but flattened in the final furlong. LAMASCO was slow into stride, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten.
TWENTYTWENTY HOAX failed to make headway. SUPER CHRISTIE was bumped early, altered out four wide to be clear, took closer order through the
turn, but failed to sustain the drive. SURCHARGE contended between foes, dropped back and tucked in to save ground, but showed little thereafer. BAL A
BAE BEE broke slow, dropped far back and was never a factor. PISTOLPACKINPOLLY contended inside for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
LIBERTY M D settled saving ground, took closer order through the turn, got through entering the stretch and was fully extended to prevail. GERRI B settled
off of the inside, moved with the winner through the turn, continued the rally between horses, kept on well and was getting to the winner. LADY ANNA was
away alertly, contested the pace outside, weakened between rivals but stayed on to hold the minor award. MALLOY was allowed to settle, angled out
entering the stretch and finished with a belated gain. KAELY'S SISTER rushed to the lead between horses early, disputed the pace through the turn, but
faltered between foes in the final furlong. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) was close up outside through the turn and tired. CONNIE K pulled to contention along the
inside, angled out leaving the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and dropped out. SALT PLAGE broke in the air and in a tangle, was away well
behind her field and was never a factor. RAZOR GLASS was through early, dropped far back, was distanced through the lane but walked off.

JUST MIGHT set the contest pace along the inside, shook off CHARCOAL nearing the furlong pole and kicked away. CHARCOAL disputed the pace
outside, was unable to go on with JUST MIGHT in the drive but kept on to clearly prove the best of the rest. BAYTOWN BEAR dropped off of the top two
into the bend, was within striking distance to the stretch and kept on willingly. JOHNNY UNLEASHED was hustled along three deep in the second flight and
went evenly. OCEANIC was allowed to settle four wide and failed to threaten. MAJOR WAGER saved ground to no avail.

OVERTAXED settled saving ground, angled out into the turn, looped five wide through the turn, finished full of run and was up in the final strides. MR SIPPI
was allowed to settle, came five wide, loomed large entering the stretch, kept on well but was overtaken in the final yards. MINICONJOU settled off of the
inside, rallied four wide between horses, offered a bold bid entering the stretch, but wasn't quite good enough. READY TO ANSWER was unhurried into
stride, angled out entering the stretch, finished well but found his best stride too late. ROUGHIN THE CITY was allowed to settle, came five wide and made
a belated improvement. STAYED IN FOR HALF was allowed to settle, moved up between horses, offered a mild bid entering the stretch but failed to sustain
the drive. LEND IT TEWMEY was hustled along off of the inside, angled in entering the stretch, lacked room near the furlong marker, shifted out but failed to
make headway. LOCK UP sprinted clear to set the pace, but faltered in the final furlong and faded. JURA contended three wide to the stretch and dropped
out. SEIZE THE TREASURE was through before going a half.
