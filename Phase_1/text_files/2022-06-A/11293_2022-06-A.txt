CRISTALINDA veered out at the start, stalked the pace into the stretch, surged late while drifting out and was along in time near mid track. DOLLY DEAR
stumbled at the start, rushed to the lead three wide before a quarter, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the winner. CARMEN OHIO broke in
front and set the early pace, kept pressure from the inside, was in a bit tight nearing the turn, angled in, chased the pace from there and was outfinished.
BEST OF YOU passed tiring rivals. JETTIN PEGASUS was shut off at the start, advanced five wide into the turn then came up empty. HEIDI'S BACK vied
for the lead along the rail early, checked when in tight just past the seven sixteenths pole and dropped out of it. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

the stretch to the six path and finished evenly. COLOMBARD pressed the early pace two wide, led between calls into the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
SWEET QUEEN BEE raced in the five path into the clubhouse turn, was gradually righted, chased the pace into the stretch, responded under left handed
urging to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear under confident handling. PASSIONFORTREASURE away alertly, set the pace under
pressure through the first turn, shook clear before a half, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. WEST SIDE GIRL trailed for five
furlongs, advanced into the stretch, drifted to the six path and leveled off. TELLER TO SING well placed, failed to respond. CEVICHE was through after a
half. QUARANTINA was hung wide into the first turn and no factor.
