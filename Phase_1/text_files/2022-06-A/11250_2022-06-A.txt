Footnotes
MISS MORENO , always up close, saved ground on the turn, found room along the inner rail to secure command turning for home, drew off under urging
and switched to her left lead late. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and held the place.
ARBUTUS , in the three path between horses while chasing the pace around the turn, faded in the stretch. POSTINO'S SECRET , in the two path on the
turn, swung four wide turning for home and failed to menace. LIFE IN FLASH , no factor, raced along the inner rail throughout. GOT A GOOD REASON set
the pace near the inner rail, drifted to the two path entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PATRIARCH ARTIE sped to the front inside rivals and set a pressured early pace while under rating, edged clear approaching the stretch, thwarted an
outside challenge from FOMO past the quarter pole, kicked back away under a drive then held firm while racing on his left lead. FOMO had speed between
rivals then rated back and angled in approaching the turn, quickly gained to the inside of a rival nearing the lane, eased out to mount a bid soon into the
lane, was turned away by the winner but kept on with good energy to hold down the place. BERKS broke outward, corrected and hustled up four wide,
angled in some and chased outside a rival around the turn, raced between foes past the furlong grounds and churned on. ONE TEN , off the pace while
saving ground, was under a ride into the lane, eased out for the final furlong and had some late action between runners. H R H JELLYBEAN rated kindly
while saving ground and not too far back, moved up a bit into the lane, shifted out past the three sixteenths but one paced from there. CHAUFFEUR , inside
and under a ride around the turn, moved up some past the eighth pole then flattened out. LAW OF THE LAND settled off the rail, moved up between
runners nearing the lane, swung widest past the three sixteenths but failed to bring a finishing kick. BILLINGSGATE forced the pace outside the winner,
wandered outward into the stretch and gave way. FORTH gave some early chase, dropped back around the turn, circled four to five wide into the lane and
continued to fade.

Footnotes
M'LADY THATCHER , steadied in traffic about a furlong after the break, was well placed near the inner rail on the backstretch, impeded NICE QUIST when
drifting out near the half mile pole, moved up inside horses entering the turn, swung outside leaving the turn, took command in upper stretch and drew out
under steady handling. GUSTAV'S GIRL showed speed outside CALIFORNIA BELLA down the backstretch, was carried wide by that one entering the turn,
angled to the two path leaving the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. LADRO DI FICHI stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in
the three path leaving the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail on the turn, was well placed along the rail in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong.
NICE QUIST , steadied when bearing out at the break, stalked the pace between horses, stumbled when clipping the heels of M'LADY THATCHER leaving
the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and was esaed. HEARD , steadied in traffic about a furlong after the break, was outrun. CALIFORNIA BELLA
showed speed near the inner rail, bore out when going lame entering the turn, pulled up and was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry, M'LADY
THATCHER was disqualified and placed third. An objection by the rider of NICE QUIST against LADRO DI FICHI for alleged interference leaving the
backstretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
BLOODPROF rated in the clear and well within range, crept up in hand off the rail past the three eighths, angled five wide soon into the lane and responded
after being set down, forged clear in mid stretch then held sway while kept to task. BOURBON AND ICE saved ground under some rating, swung out from
behind foes leaving the three sixteenths and straightened to be about five wide, advanced past mid stretch and kept on gamely to steadily bridge the gap.
RAD PAISLEY sped clear early and dropped in to set the pace, met bids nearing the lane, kicked back clear soon into the stretch, failed to contain the
winner's charge nearing the eighth pole and faded. AUCHINCRUIVE , off slow when forced in at the break, regrouped and raced outside a rival and three
wide mid turn, angled very wide in the drive and finished with interest. PUTIN ONLINE tracked to the inside of a rival early on, steadied out of a tight spot
into the turn, recovered to make a rail run into the stretch, eased out to loom, failed to kick on near the eighth pole and faded. WORLD OF FOOLS settled
outside early on, angled and moved up six wide past the quarter pole but failed to seriously sustain in the final furlong. FIRST CRUSADER lightly steadied
early, rated inside leaving the far turn, eased out and came up empty. SMITTEN ENOUGH stalked outside, ranged up and bid three deep nearing the lane,
drifted in with pursuit past the three sixteenths and weakened. EXPENSIVE , fractious pre race, was rated back after the start, saved ground and was
outrun. HAIR OF THE DOG stalked the pace, bid between rivals nearing the stretch, pressed, saw the leader kick back clear, stayed on to chase, steadied
when put in close by SMITTEN ENOUGH then gave way.

Footnotes
DESHACKLED , a bit fractious in the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, was challenged by YO NESSROUNDONKERN approaching
the eighth pole, dueled with that one and determinedly prevailed. YO NESSROUNDONKERN saved ground around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch,
bid for the lead approaching the eighth pole, dueled and hung. DEJOHN , two wide on the turn, chased the pace and gradually weakened. AMICALOLA
FALLS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch and offered a mild gain. DONTFORGETTOBLINK , three wide on the
turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and weakened. SCHOOLYARD BULLY raced in the two path on the turn and was no factor. VIRGINIA FIB was
outrun. THRUSTER unseated his rider when he ducked out mid way down the backstretch. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the
backstretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
AUDACIOUS QUALITY settled nicely off the pace while saving ground, eased out for a clear run near the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane,
responded when roused and leveled off nicely leaving the three sixteenths, surged past ROYNE with about a sixteenth to go and eagerly drew clear under
left handed encouragement. ROYNE cleared early and dropped in, was taken on from his outside by COSMICALITY soon into the first turn, rated off that
one early in the backstretch run, shifted out to track, rebid past the five sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner but continued
with effort to the wire. CONSULTANT , bumped around at the break, regrouped and settled in a good spot towards the inside, edged up behind rivals
around the final turn, waited briefly as the winner went by to his outside entering the lane, angled out but could only muster up a mild kick. TWIST 'N TWIRL
saved ground stalking the pace, was under a hearty ride to the inside of rivals mid way on the final turn, eased out in upper stretch and churned on.
COSMICALITY moved up three wide into the first turn to join ROYNE, sparred briefly before clearing, set the pace towards the rail, was re engaged past the
three eighths, battled nearing the quarter pole then weakened in the final seventy yards. SPITBALL stalked off the inside, was under asking between rivals
leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. AUCTION KINGDOM , between runners in range nearing the half mile pole,
dropped back some around the final turn then lacked a stretch kick. THE MAN TO SEE rated off foes soon after the break then was taken about five wide
nearing the backstretch, edged up three wide leaving the far turn, chased outside rivals to the quarter pole, failed to sustain and faded in the final furlong.
POTUS failed to menace. BELTWAY BOB , bumped then pinched back at the break, raced well wide for the drive and lacked a bid. EXTRA MEDIUM ,
bumped around at the break, was not a factor. EXCALIBUR exchanged bumps at the break, lost ground four wide past the five eighths and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
PLOT THE DOTS saved ground on the turns stalking the pace, waited for room entering the stretch, found an opening along the inner rail in upper stretch,
closed determinedly and was up approaching the finish. GENTLEMAN JOE , three wide the first turn, remained outside horses, rushed up four deep leaving
the far turn, sprinted clear in upper stretch, finished gamely but missed. WORKIN ON A DREAM stalked the pace three deep down the backstretch, raced in
the three path between horses entering the stretch, moved to the four path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BENANDJOE set the pace along
the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and faded. TAPPIN CAT prompted the pace outside BENANDJOE and gave way in upper stretch. OLLIEMYBOY
raced near the inner rail throughout and trailed.

Footnotes
WHISPURRING KITTEN , under a snug hold three wide and in a forward position, shifted out a bit wider into the lane and responded, forged clear heading
to the eighth pole then dug in late to prevail over EPIC IDEA. EPIC IDEA settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out with some momentum mid turn,
swung six wide for the drive, straightened away and finished strong. ELLANATION , under firm rating early, steadied sharply near the turn, regrouped and
stayed towards the inside, got through to advance in mid stretch and kept on willingly. POLISHED GAL , three deep leaving the far turn, angled five wide in
upper stretch, progressed between runners near the sixteenth pole then flattened out. RESPONSE TIME took over between rivals and handled some
pressure into the turn, moved clear and set the pace two wide into the lane, failed to contain the winner past the three sixteenths then faded. PRECIOUS , in
close at the break, was forced wider leaving the far turn, shifted out in the drive and kept on with effort. BEHIND THE COUCH pulled her way forward
outside rivals in the opening furlong, prompted the pace outside RESPONSE TIME, lacked a kick past the three sixteenths and weakened. CAVALIER
CUPID had speed then rated back off foes to save ground, eased out with some run into the lane, lacked a punch past mid stretch and gave way. MUCHA
MEZQUINA , between runners early, was taken up sharply out of a tight spot nearing the three eighths then was unable to make a significant recovery.

Footnotes
BUFF HELLO bumped with ASKIN FOR A BASKIN at the start, showed speed, disputed the pace, saved ground around the turn, sprinted clear in mid
stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole, drifted out under left hand urging in deep stretch and lasted. SEA GHOST , well
off the duel, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. IMAGE MAKER , well positioned along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the
four path turning for home and flattened out. KRACHENWAGEN circled the turn three wide, angled to the five path in upper stretch, offered a mild move in
mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid. WHAT DOES IT TAKE stalked the duel, raced in the two path on the turn and gave way. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN
bumped with the winner at the start, dueled outside that one for six furlongs and tired. SILENT SERVICE showed speed three deep down the backstretch
and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
VIOLENT ROCK rated kindly outside a rival while not far back, moved up in upper stretch, altered out past the three sixteenths, closed under pressure
outside rivals, took command in deep stretch and prevailed. LUNAR DASH tracked inside foes leaving the three eighths, steadied in traffic in upper stretch,
worked between rivals inside the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. IMAGINE IT ALL stalked three wide, bid between runners in deep stretch but wasn't
quite good enough. SECOND TERM rated outside the leader, bid two wide nearing the lane, kicked clear under asking in mid stretch, dug in when collared
then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. FATHER RED , in close at the break, steadied soon after, angled out through the drive and rallied. THE LAST
SCIP , four wide off the early pace, angled wider for the drive and gained. A LOT LIKE XMAS , off the pace around the turn, eased out three to four wide,
made a mild run between foes then lacked a solid finish. UNCLE REMI had speed inside and went clear heading to the turn, was engaged approaching the
stretch, gave effort to mid stretch then faded. WAR AND ROSES broke slowly, saved ground with and advance, angled out and came up empty.
