Footnotes
EXPECT THE BOSS came out of the gate, headed for the lead, dueled through the turn, from the inside, then drew off, exploding away from the field to win
easily. ESPERANZA ROSE was in contention early, racing along the rail, made a bid in the turn, angling out in the stretch to the three path, but was second
best. JIMENA was near the back, then closed well, between horses, three wide to get up for show. PHARME'S PHINALE chased the pace, from along the
rail, made a bid around the turn, but flattened out in the stretch drive. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN got hustled away from the gates hard, then steadied into the
turn, angled out sharply down the lane, with a mild bid and an erratic trip. MADAME RUE was mid field early, three wide and had an even effort. SHERRYS
BABY was near the front early, then got carried very wide in the turn and had no late run. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER dueled for the lead, two wide early, then
blew the turn, carrying a foe wide, and faded in the stretch.

DUTCH TREAT tracked the pace from the inside, was gaining on the far turn, took command at the top of the stretch, then drew away to score easily
proving much the best. COCO LOCO MAMA raced while two wide, then dropped back on the far turn, came on again in the stretch to make a mild two wide
but it was not enough. SHESMYBROKER was unhurried early, then continued to race along the rail on the far turn, made a mild bid two wide down the
stretch drive but it was too little too late. FETCHING tracked the pace while four wide, then made a mild bid in upper stretch then flattened out in the end
was no threat. GALILETA set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive, was hard used on the far turn and tired in the final furlongs.

RIFT VALLEY was allowed to settle, well off the pace, then kicked into gear going into the far turn, digging in and closing willingly to grab the win. FEDERAL
HILL set the pace early on, racing two wide, shook off the pressure from the outside, into the stretch, but could not turn back the winner. MUNDACIOUS
broke sharp, pressing the pace down the backstretch, racing three wide, but gave way in the stretch drive and held on to third. GAMMA RAY was mid pack,
running in the three path and had no late run. MOUNTAIN BREEZE trailed the field throughout, two wide and was no factor.

RVALENTINA set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive to clear the far turn then drew off in the stretch and proved much the best. AUTOSTRADA
chased the pace while in the three path, was in a steady drive on the backstretch, then menaced at the top of the lane but it was not enough to catch the
leader. FAST AND FEMININE was unhurried early, then saved ground to rally four wide coming into the stretch and was closing well in the end. LADY EVE
chased the pace while four wide, was in a long drive to bid three wide on the far turn but flattened out in the end. NO COMMENT chased the pace while two
wide into the backstretch, then drop back entering the far turn and failed to fire. THE CAT CAME BACK was brushed at the start then steadied, settled
inside on the backstretch and failed to menace on the far turn and eased across the finish.

GETTINHOT'NHERE dueled for the lead briefly down the backstretch, then gained command, heading into the turn and drew off from the field for an easy
win. KNIGHTED was mid field early on, then rallied down the lane, three wide to get up for place in late stretch. NEVER OVER ME dueled for the lead
briefly, made a mild bid in the turn but flattened out in the stretch drive to hold on to third. OAK HILL SOLUTION was mid pack, traveling in the four path and
had an even effort. AUTO BE THE MAN was near the back, two wide and failed to fire. CONGO'S TALE was hustled away early, racing along the rail, then
was checked sharply at the three eighths pole and was no menace.

GOLDEN SECRET broke sharp from the gates, then settled in just off the lead, gaining command at the head of the stretch to grab the win in a blanket
finish. WHIPUM NAENAE chased the pace down the backstretch, angling out around the half, then closed fast around the turn, racing five wide, just missing
at the wire. DIXIE CARROUSEL was near the back early on, then rallied up the rail in the stretch drive, for a game third. FACESTER made the lead, racing
along the rail and gave way in mid stretch. WITT'S TENNY TEN was near the front, on the inside and dropped back in the stretch. THATSALOTOFBLING
reared at the start, coming out of the gate, following the two path and was no menace. WHITE WOMAN CREEK stumbled at the start, getting pulled up at
the half and walked off. Following the race, there was a Stewards Inquiry regarding the start for THATSALOTOFBLING. After reviewing the films it was
determined he had the opportunity to run a fair race and he would be considered a starter.

CATCHUSIFYOUCAN made the lead out of the gate, clearing the field early, then continued to draw off down the lane and was a complete runaway for the
win. MISS RITA tracked the leader from the outside, just off his hip, then rallied in the stretch drive, three wide, to hold on for second. MIGHTY HAPPY
chased the pace and rallied up the rail to hang on to third. COSTANARMANDALEG was mid field early on, three wide and offered an even effort down the
lane. AUNT JOIE was mid pack, racing in the two path but failed to fire in the stretch. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL was mid field early, then made a mild bid
around the turn, drifting out, five wide but had no late run. IT'S ALL A BLUR was near the back, racing wide throughout and failed to fire. GEE SHE'S
PRETTY was near the back, racing wide, and showed little.
