Footnotes
WHERE'S FRANKIE set the pace racing well off the rail, went in the two to three path through the turn, widened a bit in upper stretch when asked and held
safe while being kept to task. EVEN PANDURA stalked the winner from outside going three to four wide on the turn, was no match but clearly second best.
SILLY NOTION switched outside heading to the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, failed to rally. LYRICAL tracked in behind, raced on or just off the
rail through the turn, weakened in the stretch. TICK TOCK received several light bumps late up the backstretch, raced inside a rival on the turn, swung six
wide turning for home and was never a threat. CIRCULODEGANADORAS bumped the aforementioned a few times lightly late up the backstretch, raced
outside that one through the turn, fanned seven wide into the stretch and was not a threat.

Footnotes
XTREME V. I. P. set the pace racing off the rail, drew away when asked in upper stretch and was eased up through the final sixteenth. HONEY'S
SUPERMAN tracked in behind the eventual winner two to three wide, was encouraged along about the seven-sixteenths, proved no match for the winner.
CALICO JOE stalked outside three to four wide and failed to rally. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK exchanged repeated bumps at the break and into the first
turn going four wide on that bend, encouraged along three wide on the far turn moving out five deep later on that bend before angling out further still at the
top of the stretch, failed to threaten. ARIES REIGNS exchanged repeated bumps with inside and outside rivals at the start as well as heading into the first
turn, went three wide through that bend, two wide and between runners into the far turn moving out four wide on that bend, altered inside a drifting rival near
the three-sixteenths and was never near enough to threaten. THIRSTY KISS exchanged bumps at the start and early heading into the turn, steadied slightly
at that juncture and moved to the rail, saved ground inside till drifting four wide into the stretch, was not a threat.

Footnotes
DREAMING BIZ stalked the pace three wide, moved to the fore about the quarter pole, kicked clear in the stretch and held sway. GYPSY REWARD was
unhurried early taking up the rear racing off the rail, angled six wide turning for home, kept on late to get up for second. WITHHERBOOTSON settled inside
last but one early, switched out leaving the first turn, advanced outside five wide on the far turn, ran on. MINNESOTA NICE exchanged light contact early,
held up in behind horses at times racing three to four wide, had room in the stretch but needed more. STYLIN N PROFILIN saved ground inside through
both turns finding room along the rail into upper stretch and within striking distance but was outkicked. THAT WOULD BE NICE exchanged light brushes
early racing two wide between foes through the first turn and up the backstretch, came out for room at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. START
SINGING set the pace racing just off the rail, was overtaken at the quarter pole, faltered and faded. ICYWILBURNYEH chased four wide, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SOUL COAXING moved in while clearing the field early on the first turn to dictate terms in the clear, extended the margin in the stretch and held well.
HARDLY A SECRET switched out early on the first turn to race in the three path, stalked the leader going in the three to four path on the second turn, kept
on in the stretch to secure the place. TWISTED DIXIE shifted in to the two path early on the first turn, tracked the pace from near inside, was outkicked for
the place. VENTURE FORTH saved ground on or just off the rail early, moved out up the backstretch going three wide on the far turn, ran on. PERFECT
WAGER was forwardly-placed up the backstretch having gone three to four wide on the first turn, dropped back four to five wide on the far turn and came up
empty. KNIEVEL raced mostly two to four wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WAR CHEST settled mid-pack three to four wide, drove past late. ITS A BOY saved ground early tracking the leaders mid-pack, came out a path to
challenge late on the far turn, dueled with PAPA RIZZO and outfinished that one for the place. PAPA RIZZO set the pace inside, dueled in the stretch and
lost the place. EXETER was forwardly-positioned three to four wide and in range of the leader, ran on evenly. CHOCOLATEICECREAM was urged at the
break but lacked early speed racing four to five wide through the first turn, went three to four deep on the far turn and improved position. MR. WHO raced in
the two to three path through the first turn off the leaders, shifted in and saved ground on the far turn, was never able to menace. DAYS OF GLORY was
forwardly-positioned stalking two to three wide, shifted to the rail on the far turn, came up empty. WHERE'S JORDAN shifted in heading to the first turn and
settled last but one, swung six wide into the stretch and ran on. TIZONA tracked two to three wide, came up empty. HOLY VOW was outrun.

MARDEN bumped with a rival at the start, tracked from between runners two wide, shifted in once in upper stretch, bid inside foes and kicked clear.
FENDER BENDER tracked in behind three wide, found room between rivals to move through in late stretch and get up for the place. HERBIE switched
outside the pacesetter early as that one moved in, chased three then four wide, kept on in the stretch. SEEK N JUSTICE exchanged several hard bumps at
the break causing a couple lengths early loss, moved out, went five wide on the turn, ran on well but needed more. SPENDAHOLIC shifted in while moving
clear, dictated terms in the two path, weakened in the stretch. KING OF THE COURT bumped with a rival hard a couple times at the start causing a couple
lengths delay before getting into stride, switched out and made a swift early advance four wide to pursue the leaders from outside, flattened out. EL
CENTENARIO chased inside, was in a bit tight past the three-sixteenths and came out while weakening.

Footnotes
AGENT PETER GRAVES bumped the inside rival at the start then quickly moved to the fore to set the pace racing two wide with pressure from inside and
outside rivals, kicked clear in the stretch. JOKER MATT eased back off the leaders and shifted in two wide heading into the first turn, settled off the leaders,
began to advance two to three wide on the far turn, gained the place late. JOE PHILLIPS was bumped at the start, saved ground early, tracked in behind the
leaders, came out four wide near the quarter pole, lost place late. ROBINSON exchanged a light brush at the start, saved ground on the first turn, tipped out
and moved three to four wide on the far turn, ran on mildly. MARK IN GREELEY shifted in early settling off the leaders, went two to three wide on the far
turn, angled six wide coming to the furlong marker and ran on. GREAT BRITAIN stalked three wide, was in good position into upper stretch then flattened
out. THORN HILL CAT tucked in to the two path early, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to menace. MISTER BANJOMAN exchanged a light
brush at the start, pressed inside, gave way. CAVE HILL raced on or just off the rail and was never a threat.

Footnotes
THICK HAZE stalked three to four wide, moved to challenge outside on the far turn, edged clear in mid-stretch. BOB'S ALL IN settled in off the leaders three
wide, edged closer coming into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place. KING NATE shifted in two wide early settling toward the rear, came out five
wide coming to the quarter pole, gained late. COASTAL WATERS tucked in early, saved ground, came out in upper stretch and ran on mildly. MARTINI
BLU pressed the pace two to three wide, took a narrow lead late up the backstretch, contended between runners on the far turn, flattened out in the drive.
SOUTHERN PECAN set the early pace inside, vied with outside challengers into and on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. YOUR TIME'S COMING
tracked from inside, failed to rally. BAYOU PROSPECTOR was taken back soon after the start and switched outside runners going three to four wide on the
first turn, made a swift early advance up the backstretch outside runners to be close up to the leaders, could not sustain the effort.
