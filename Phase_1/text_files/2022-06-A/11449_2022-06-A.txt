MIDNIGHT TRICK tracked three wide, raced three wide while making progress around the turn, tipped into the four path into the stretch, and ran on.
CREATIVE MAGIC led inside, was roused inside around the turn while yielding the lead, but managed to hold off Rayo Negro to show. RAYO NEGRO
steadied at the start, rated between rivals, was driven two wide into stretch, but finished evenly. FIFTH OF NOVEMBER trailed along the inside and was
never a factor. LUCKY FOR SHORE pressed three wide early but backed out around the turn.

Footnotes
NANTUCKETER stalked between foes, was roused two wide into the stretch, and held gamely. STALKING was slowly away, raced three wide around the
turn, four wide into the stretch, and ran on for place. TINY TIN tracked inside, was ridden two wide into the stretch, and rallied show. CHILLING SECRET
raced in mid pack from the three path, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, and finished evenly. SPECIAL MEISTER pressed two wide, floated
into the four path into the stretch, but faded. CHIEF CHARLIE set the pace inside but yielded around the turn. GUNHAND trailed from the two path, was five
wide into the stretch, but was empty. AKINGISALWAYSKING hopped at the start, and was done after a half.
