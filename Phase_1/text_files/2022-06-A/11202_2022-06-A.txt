Footnotes
BET THE QUEEN pressured the pace, raced off the rail on the turn, her rider lost his whip entering the stretch, but she dug in under a hand ride to take over
the final yards. MIDNIGHT PASS was hustled to the front toward the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in under steady encouragement
leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. BALLYMENA gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. NOBLE
CITY became fractious in the gate, gave chase inside and ran at the rail on the turn, then flattened the final furlong. AMERICAN BLONDE gave chase
outside, ran in the four path of the turn then weakened the final furlong. Arista The Cat ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch by the Stewards.

CARNIVAL LUCKY settled inside on the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the
head of the lane, took the lead mid-stretch and raced clear late. HOOK THE CHAIN settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path then dug in from the eighth pole to take second the final yards. STONES ROAD moved to the inside and rated the
pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in leaving the turn but was met mid-stretch and flattened the
final sixteenth. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS was forced in at the break and rated just off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, then faded at the rail on the far turn. CHOPRA veered in at the start and rated just off the pace in the two and three paths, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. SHOOFLY PIE was shuffled back at the start and showed little response.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT REGRET rated a short lead inside, widened at the rail on the far turn and proved much the best of her own initiative. LACE REVOLUTION raced
back about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second best.
TALENTED CORINNA bobbled at the break and saved ground into the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the
far turn and showed little in the lane. CAST NO STONES exchanged contact with FESSIN UP leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, but faded off the rail on the far turn. The latter exchanged contact with Cast No Stones leaving the gate, saved ground on the first
turn and was not a factor. WICKED FELINA stalked in the three path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

SPECTACULO took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn
and was steadily handled through the lane. IRISH FLIGHT raced off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, ran at the rail
on the far turn and settled for second best. SIENTE EL AMOR flipped behind the gate and was briefly loose, became a bit fractious in the gate then stalked
the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. WATCHING SNOW FLY stalked the
early pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, then weakened in the four path of the far turn. LOGSTRADAMUS settled back
in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and never factored. GANGHIS KHAN settled in the four path the first turn, proved no factor and was
eased in the lane. SOMESAYNEIGH rounded the first turn off the rail, was never a factor and eased in the lane.

leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, came between horses mid-stretch and finished well. ALLEN CAN DO IT settled off the

was steadily encouraged through the lane. WHOSE THAT LADY stalked from the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off
the rail on the far turn and cleared second later yards. TOTALLY PERFECT veered out at the break then saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the
