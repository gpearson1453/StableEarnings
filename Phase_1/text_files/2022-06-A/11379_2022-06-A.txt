chase, rounded the turn about the three path, was steadily asked from the head of the lane then nipped from second at the wire. BOTTOM DECK gave
chase inside, drifted and made light contact with Froggy The Gremlin midway on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. ROCKET APPEAL chased the early
pace outside, ran in the four path of the turn then flattened in the lane. FROGGY THE GREMLIN chased through the backstretch, was brushed midway on

BUZZHOUND raced well off the early pace inside, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased just outside the
pace-setter leaving the eighth pole, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear the final yards. VOLTAMOUR settled in the two and three paths the first
turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and steadily closed to take second the final yards. WIDGET FACTORY
raced with the pace two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled close in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final furlong. DON'T
DARE ME rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail rounding the turn but was
caught flattening stride mid-stretch. FIND YOUR BOAZ raced well back from early contention, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, ran six wide on the far turn and closed the gap widest in the lane. BLACK STEEL settled in the three and four paths of the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. QUAD EIGHTS stalked from the three path,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MY EXPENSIVE GIFT took over on the chute and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, contested the edge two deep on the turn, dueled clear
toward mid-stretch and held on well. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE chased and raced close off the rail on the turn, eased outward leaving the turn and dug in to
take second later yards. LOOKIN BACK chased through the backstretch, eased to the five path rounding the turn and finished well for third later yards. TOY
TIGER gave chase, checked at the rail off the heels of Whycantthisbelove nearing the quarter pole but came back to finish evenly. REINE SECRET
pressured the pace, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn then weakened toward mid-stretch. MIDNIGHT DRAGON became
fractious in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and raced close in the three path on the turn, but drifted to the six path toward the head of the lane
and flattened the final sixteenth. SUPER WILDCAT became fractious in the gate, angled to the outside and rounded the turn about the seven path.
FLIRTING FUHR AVIE saved ground. LA DAME broke through prior the break, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the six path of the turn and
weakened.

SPECTACULO rounded the opening turn about the four path and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod approaching the five
sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. FELICIAS CASTLE rated close off the rail on the first turn, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, ronded the far turn near the rail, eased outward into the lane and finished well while getting to the winner. MIO GRACELAND
raced with the pace through the front stretch then showed the way from the five eighths pole, was met nearing the five sixteenths, steadied at the rail toward
the quarter and faded on the far turn. SARGENT KOBE rounded the first turn about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and showed little in the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS hopped at the break, saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch, then rounded the far turn in the four and five paths. LEG UP raced with the early pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then
faded into the far turn. CHAMPSTER saved ground.

Footnotes
HYPOTHESIS chased outside, contested at a close disadvantage about the four path on the turn, took the nod into the stretch and dug in determinedly to
edge out the game effort of PENGUIN POWER, who pressured the early pace and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, took a brief lead two
deep approaching the quarter pole, was met toward the head of the lane, but dug in gamely to the finish. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY chased outside,
rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. NICO came away a bit awkwardly and was shuffled back on the chute, picked up the chase
outside, rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. BULL MEECHUM gave close chase, rounded the turn two deep then flattened
stride the final sixteenth. FIBER AND EMILY chased inside, steadied in tight at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, raced in the two and three paths of the
turn and showed little more. GOLDEN KEY was hustled to a brief early lead then dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, dropped back at the rail
midway on the turn and weakened into the lane. CATS DIAMOND BOY gave chase then weakened into the turn. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHANNEL SCENT settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch but
dug in under steady encouragement to take the nod under the wire. PRACTICAL KITTY settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the
three eighths pole, took the lead nearing the quarter, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but missed the nod under the wire.
SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER exchanged contact with WANTA BALLERINA leaving the gate then saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, progressed in the five path of the far turn and came along for third late. The latter exchanged contact with Shesahumblehustler
leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path and left the turn outside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the
far turn and flattened in the lane. BANTAM ROOSTER saved ground off the pace on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened off the rail midway on the far turn. MY BRIDGET VERDOT raced off the early pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through
the backstretch. CHOSEN MISS raced well back about the three path the first turn and never factored. BOTTLE COURAGE showed little response. NOBLE
CITY ducked out leaving the gate then rated the early pace inside, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, was caught toward the quarter and
faded at the rail on the far turn.
