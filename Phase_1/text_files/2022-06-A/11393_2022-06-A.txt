Footnotes
ITASCA away alertly, set all the pace under pressure while nicely rated and wore down rivals in a game effort. COSMIC TREASURE stalked the pace for a
half, loomed boldly three wide midway on the far turn, matched strides to the wire and couldn't pass. FRANKIE BARONE stalked the pace into the stretch,
surged along the rail before the furlong marker and finished with good courage. MAKE THE RULES had a mild late rally in the five path. SHELL FIRE saved
ground, steadied entering the the stretch, angled out and finished determinedly in the four path. MAN DOWN with the second flight, failed to respond. MR.

Footnotes
TIDE RISING stalked the early pace, rallied three wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole and prevailed under right handed urging. THE GOSPEL
OF MARK allowed to settle, advanced steadily four wide and got up for second. MOESTER trailed early then closed fast three wide for the show. RED HOT
POWER dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. SPLIT MY BRITCHES saved ground and lacked the needed response.
VOLUME OF TRUST was no threat. POWERFUL PHIL battled for the lead two wide into the turn then weakened. VOLUME LEADER was through after a
half.

Footnotes
LILAC LACE never far back, closed fast four wide, made the lead past the furlong marker, drifted to the eight path and won going away.
TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY slow early, swung wide, rallied determinedly in the nine path and got up for second. LUCKY TO HAVE ME trailed into the
stretch, swung wide then closed willingly past mid track for a minor part. WHOVILLE never far back, loomed boldly three wide on the turn then was
outfinished. DREAM FEVER bobbled at the start, lacked room along the rail nearing the turn, shifted out to the four path and closed a gap late. LAPIS
STORM pressed the pace three then two wide, matched strides into the stretch then came up empty. TALKBACK battled for the lead two wide then along
the inside until mid stretch then weakened. FASHION FRAME had good early speed near the inside, also lacked room nearing the turn then faded. JILLY
FROM JERSEY was through early. WAR CAT battled for the early lead along the rail then stopped.
