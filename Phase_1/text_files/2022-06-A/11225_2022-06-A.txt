ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT tracked the front runner two wide, then made a three wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms by the furlong marker and then
slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. NICE WEATHER set the early pace on the inside while well clear, then was headed by the winner by the
eighth pole, kept on willingly but could not match strides with that rival, second best. PALACE SUPERNOVA was allowed to settle early, then was between
rivals on the turn, then finished willingly to best the rest. MACHO SMOKE was allowed to settle and saved ground throughout but had no rally. AMIGOS
GUITAR was allowed to settle and raced three wide on the turn and had no rally. SASSY LAD was settled while four to five wide and stopped.

WOW WHATA SUMMER was well rated early on the inside, then made a inside middle move to vie for command, shook clear on the turn and remained
clear by the furlong marker, then was able to keep ANNAPOLIS at bay late to prove bets under a drive. ANNAPOLIS tracked the pace three wide and came
four wide into the drive, then was given a few pops left handed with the riding crop nearing the furlong marker, shifted out, then switched to right handed
crop urging to be corrected and was gaining late but needed more. UNCAPTURED SPIRIT set the early pace while racing off the inside and gave way
grudgingly, bested rest. RED DANGER was allowed to settle three wide early, then switched to the inside on the far turn and advanced, swung out five wide
for the drive and had no late kick. FORT WASHINGTON passed the tiring rivals. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE chased the pace two wide and weakened. WITTY
was four to five wide and had no response. NONEEDTOWORRY failed to menace.

RIDGELYSREDHOT set the pace on the inside, then came off the inside leaving the turn and was headed nearing the furlong marker, switched to left
handed crop urging and prevailed to prove best after a long drive. WICKED T was with the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to go on even
terms for the lead by the furlong marker, but was outfinished late. ALLISON K was reserved early, angled out in the drive and closed the gap fast late.
TEACHER DRAMA was well rated on the inside, made a two wide bid leaving the turn,. tried to split rivals nearing the furlong marker but was shut off and
had to check, then was empty. LANA lacked a rally. PRIDE IN THE BIZ tracked the pace three wide and weakened. The jockey on TEACHER DRAMA
claimed foul against both RIDGELYSREDHOT and WICKED T for alleged interference at the eighth pole, after the Stewards reviewed the replays the
objections were dismissed and the race left as is.

outside by the three sixteenths and closed well to get up in time under left handed crop urging. KHAKI JACK dueled for the lead on the inside and made a
bid nearing the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was nailed at the wire to just miss. YANKEE EMPIRE

then was two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. MISTER GARY was fractious in the gate, tracked the pace on the inside, then shifted off the
