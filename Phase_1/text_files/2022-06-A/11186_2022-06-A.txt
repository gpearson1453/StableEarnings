CUSTOM MADE with the early pace into the first turn along the inside, fell back before a quarter, moved out and challenged the dueling three wide turning
for home, kicked clear under steady handling. JIG TIME BANDIT broke on top, vied into the first turn, between foes, dueled the middle half closest to the
inside, could not match the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. HALOS ALARM moved up opening quarter, dueled up front most of the way outside
the runner up in the two path, weakened between foes through the stretch. STERLING MEMORY raced off the pace while out in the strip, failed to muster a
closing response. REVOLUTIONARY LASS off a step slow, trailed far back along the inside in showing little. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WILD MALLORY took command soon after the start, set the pace inside, stole off to a larger lead into the straight, remained well clear to the wire under
steady handling. GALAXY THIRTYSIX last to leave, raced well back three wide into the turn, briefly lost action when confronted by a goose into the turn
while three wide, was righted, two path into the lane, dropped down to the inside and made a late run to annex the place. PUZZLING PRIORITY in mid pack
early toward the inside, moved closer along the rail late in the turn, steered out into the stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for
the place. SHADES OF TRUTH broke alertly, raced closest to the winner in the two path into and through the turn, had little left for the drive to gradually
weaken. ROARING QUINN remained always back. SUMMERTIME BANDIT forwardly placed early three wide, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
MY GUITAR within striking distance three wide early, continued to stalk the pace up the backstretch, called on for run far turn, challenged into the stretch on
the outside, edged clear under firm handling, held the runner up safe late. TIN DELAY last to leave, void of speed while four wide onto the backstretch,
continued outside, remained four wide into the lane, closed the gap past the midstretch point, made little more inroads on the winner, drew clear for the
second spot. MY LITTLE FLACO settled in mid pack while saving ground, continued along the rail into and through the final turn, finished up best of the rest
after shifting out around a tiring foe inside the furlong grounds. CUSTOM KAT in the main body while racing off the inside, between rivals in the two path
final turn, improved position slightly the final furlong without posing a serious threat. THE THREE KS broke on top, soon clear, set the pace along the inside,
faltered when headed in uypper stretch. FLASHBURN closest to the leader for five furlongs, challenged between rivals and inside the winner late in the
second turn, gave way the final furlong to lose several positions. SIR POKERFACE last to leave, lacked speed, never menaced. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL
SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED MOON close from the start outside, pressed three wide into the turn, put a head in front late in the bend, drew well clear the final furlong
under steady handling. CHAIRMAN MOO in the second flight along the inside for three furlongs, rallied from between foes when straightened for home,
edged clear for the place, not a match for the winner. TEN BUDS in the second group outside the runner up, two path into the lane, steered out for room in
upper stretch, staged a mild rally to be in time for the show. FIFTY PROTECTION set or forced the pace while closest to the inside, had little left for the
stretch turn. TRAELEE void of speed toward but not on the inside, came three wide for the drive, improved inside of several foes, not a serious threat.
CLOSING AMERICAN lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. TIME TWISTER went one paced four wide throughout in failing
to threaten. GOODROCKINALVIN with the pace for three furlongs while between horses, backed up through the stretch, trailed home. FRACTIONAL
TIMES AND FINAL WERE HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
KNIGHTS SWORD closest to the leader for three furlongs while racing in the two path, took over entering the stretch, strongly clear under a brisk right
handed crop. IN FOR A PENNY forwardly placed while racing three wide, asked late turn, slight drift, up late second, no match for the winner. JULIO
CHOICE in mid pack while racing inside, moved a bit closer toward the rail into the lane, flattened out a bit the final furlong, passed the tiring early leader to
be along for the show. SUGAR STAR back off the pace while racing outside, four wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire. MAGIC APRIORITY broke
alertly, cleared soon after, set the pace for three furlongs along the inside, caved in readily when headed by the winner when straightened for home. KIKI
KAT last away, lacked speed, made little impact off the inside. UGOTTAGO fell back to trail, showed little. FRACTIONAL TIMES AND FINAL WERE HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
JUBELLA forwardly placed along the inside early, continued to prompt the issue up the backstretch and into the far turn, fell back a bit while continuing to
save ground into the stretch, roused, found more to battle back and narrowly gain the nod in the final strides. SPECIAL CONNECTION stalked the two
leaders off the inside, ranged up to challenge and put a head in front midway on the final turn, dueled outside the winner the final furlong, narrowly missed to
be outfinished at the wire. CATCAKE away well, narrowly showed the way in the two path, continued with the pace when headed between horses midway
on the final turn, yielded while continuing between the top two the final furlong. SHE A HOT MESS last to leave, raced five wide into the first turn, closer
onto the backstretch while keen and continuing outside, four wide still entering the far bend, went one paced thereafter in lacking a closing response.
FLURRY OF FEATHERS fell back, trailed the middle half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals toward the inside while never a serious threat. GATOR PROUD
four wide into the first turn when off the pace, continued to lack speed and remained always back. OUR LITTLE GIRL in mid pack for six furlongs, backed up
through the stretch. HALF MILE FRA CTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
GET THEM JUSTIN four wide when forwardly placed through the first turn, maintained forward position while three wide into the second bend, stalled in
upper stretch, late push outside the leader to be up at the wire. STANDING MAN narrowly showed the way through the first turn in the two path, dueled
while remaining one off the rail through the second bend, disposed of that rival to be briefly clear a furlong out, nailed at the wire. UNFATHOMED forwardly
placed while three wide and a bit rank in the first turn, continued to race within striking distance, chased the winner past the furlong marker, failed to mount
the late bid of the winner while saving the show. WISE VERDICT back off the early pace toward the inside, asked along second turn, brushed while being
floated out four wide into the lane, improved position and was slowly gaining for the show. ALIGNED INTEREST last away, trailed for the first five furlongs,
angled out to be three wide into the lane, brushed, bettered position a bit while not having enough for the show. FREEDOMFI lacked speed, came five wide
out of the final turn, failed to muster a rally. VENN set or forced the pace for six furlongs along the inside, gave way for the drive. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL
SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA MIRACLE in the main body while four wide in to the first turn, closer after a half, challenged three wide second turn, narrowly showed the way
past the furlong marker, garnered a larger advantage with less than a furlong remaining, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SOCIAL
AFLEET lacked early foot outside, raced four wide through the second bend, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, coming outside, too late. WISE
GUY narrowly set the pace off the inside, continued in the two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, put the other speed away just as the winner was
challenging midway on that bend, gave ground grudgingly while closest to the inside of the first flight at the wire. GENTRIFIED void of speed, moved closer
after four furlongs, three wide through the second, kept grinding through the lane to be slowly gaining late. SHANGHAI RONNIE settled off the pace, saved
ground through the second turn, had little left for the drive. FLASHING ANGELBABY pressed inside, helped set a legit pace, stopped in the stretch. COOL
CATOMINE in three wide through the first turn, was finished after a half. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.
