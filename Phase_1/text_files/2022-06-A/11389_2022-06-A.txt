Footnotes
IRISH VALOR was allowed to settle in opening stages and saved ground around the first turn, raced in the last flight up the backstretch then made a move
near the quarter pole, roused forward into contention, stayed on determinedly under firm handling and got up in final stride. VERRAZANO FIRST stalked
three wide in early stages then took over the lead mid-way around the far turn, hustled along two to three wide into the upper stretch, continued clear a
furlong out then got nipped on the wire. PRINCIPE GUILHERME was unhurried and raced in the last flight, picked up the pace three to four wide near the
quarter pole, sustained response into the lane and steadily edged up closer. RIDE RICHIE RIDE held a slim lead around the first turn and set the pace up
the backstretch, got collared by VERRAZANO FIRST mid-way around the far turn and gave way. PINSON raced four wide around the first turn, tracked the
pace up the backstretch then faded around the far turn. MARQUEE THUNDER prompted the pace around the first turn, continued forwardly placed through
the backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.

Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN stumbled hard at the start, lost all momentum and trailed the field, picked up the pace late on the far turn, set sights on
ITSALLINTHENOTES at the head of the lane, rallied gamely and edged away. ITSALLINTHENOTES dueled inside of MIZZEN AIR around the first turn and
up the backstretch, shook free midway around the far turn, held clear a furlong out then got reeled in late. FIRST EMPRESS stalked the embattled pair up
the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn and churned on for a share. JOPLIN rated off the early pace, hustled up three to four wide
around the final turn and failed to move on. SLIME QUEEN settled off the top trio in early stages, saved ground around the far turn and had no response.
MIZZEN AIR dueled outside of ITSALLINTHENOTES around the first turn and up the backstretch then faded in the lane. DO YOU BILEVE failed to move
into contention.

CANDY ANNE sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, took on challengers from both sides in upper stretch, dueled for command into the
final furlong, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK tracked the leader along the inside, cut the corner and roused
forward along the rail to challenge CANDY ANNE for the lead, dueled into the final furlong and got outfinished. NO ONE CARES raced off the top trio in
early stages, chased three to four wide around the turn, advanced into striking distance a furlong out then ran on evenly late. EPWORTH was forwardly
placed in early stage, launched a three wide bid around the turn, raced up close into the final furlong then weakened late. LIL DITTY'S KITTY raced in the
last flight, chased two to three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. PREF RIGHT raced in the last flight, was ridden along the outside around the turn
then shifted in and never menaced.

DOWNTOWNER moved up closer two wide entering the turn, launched a bid for command at the quarter pole, cleared the lead at the head of the lane and
finished going away. RUBIGINOUS hustled along in steady pursuit four then three wide into the turn, sustained response into the lane and finished clearly
second best. MY BOY GUS set the pace up the backstretch and held a slim lead around the turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane and
weakened to show. KEESAWAH lacked speed and raced in the back, came five to six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HALO JAX chased two to
three wide in early contention, raced in tight quarters entering the turn, checked sharply and retreated. EAST MOON LAKE raced in range along the inside
up the backstretch then gave way mid-way around the turn. UNSOLVED failed to move into contention. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY WHICH

Footnotes
AX MAN was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pace up the backstretch, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter
pole, vied in the upper stretch then kicked clear a furlong out. CALIBRATE rated outside off the early pace, made a four wide move around the far turn, dug
in four deep a furlong out and got up late for place. BIG DREAMING got bumped and steadied at the start, dropped to last and continued off the early pace,
began to edge up closer along the inside late on the backstretch, lacked racing room around the far turn, waited then launched a three wide at the eighth
pole and just missed place. ITS A WRAP set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, got collared by the winner in the
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MAN IN THE CAN prompted the pace around the first turn and continued to force the issue through the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn then gave way in the lane. HOLD TIGHT was unhurried in the back, saved ground then tipped three wide and failed
to rally. GREAT FACES rated along the inside in early stages, shifted out five wide leaving the far turn and never threatened. NUMBER ONE DUDE tracked
the pace four wide u-p the backstretch then faded around the final turn.

ROME sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, came two wide into the lane, took on the challenge
from FEEL THE FEAR in the upper stretch, dueled into the final furlong, dug in determinedly, repelled bid and held clear. FEEL THE FEAR stalked inside
through early stages, was patiently handled along the inside around the far turn, launched a bid along the rail at the head of the lane, challenged ROME for
the lead, dueled into the final furlong but could not match late. AIN'T LIFE GRAND rated near midpack up the backstretch, launched a bid for command at
the quarter pole, came four wide into the upper stretch and stayed on with good response. RUGGS stalked the pacesetter through early stages, hustled up
three wide around the far turn, failed to move on and gave way. DIAMOND RIM was not too far back early on, chased two wide around the final turn and
failed to threaten. JERRY'S EIGHTY rated outside through the backstretch, raced four wide in range midway around the far turn then faded. BECKETT'S
LUCKYDAY raced off the pace saving ground, shifted out around the far turn and had no response. KNOCKER DOWN was fractious in the gate and raced
in the back throughout.

Footnotes
BUTTERBEAN got brushed a bit out of the gate and raced in the back, remained well reserved trailing in the back, began to pick up the tempo late on the
far turn, quickly rallied into contention, came three to four wide into the upper stretch, responded willingly under right handed encouragement, swept by and
finished going away. HARTLEY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, showed the way by a
clear advantage into the upper stretch then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. WARRIOR'S BATTLE tracked the pace up the backstretch,
launched a bid along the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and stayed on for a share. SANDSTONE was never too far back and rated
outside through early stages, came under a ride three to four wide around the final turn and failed to respond. SEA LEVEL stalked the pace in the early
going, sustained a three wide bid around the far turn then faded. ADRIA was forwardly placed tracking the early pacesetter, sustained a bid through the far
turn then came up empty.
