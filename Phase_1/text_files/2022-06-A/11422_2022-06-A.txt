EUROBOND rushed from outset, gained first command and led every step of the way for a gate to wire score. CATALE STORM stalked the front runner
from a two path stance and was outkicked in final sixteenth. COVINGTON QUALITY gave chase to pacesetter from a three path pose, rated within striking
distance while three wide at upper stretch, but proved to be no match for top pair in final furlong. SPECIAL FORTUNE showed reserve along the
backstretch, trekked the two path around the bend and steadily faded. OKIE BUCK rated well back and failed to menace.

TIMELY REPLY showed reserve in the early going, angled out and circled foes at the midway point, and finished under a stiff drive to kick clear in
homestretch. MR. SHAPOOR pressed the pace from a two path pose, gained command nearing the quarter pole, tucked to rail arond final bend, but was
unable to fend off eventual winner in the homestretch. SPECTACTICAL gave chase to early pacesetters from an inside stance, trekked wide through the
closing turn, rated widest at upper stretch, but lacked a closing rally. PROUD MOMENTS trailed the field through the opening half, tucked to rail around final
bend, and rallied along the rail while gaining on leaders at finish. GRADESTER rushed from outset to lead the field through the first call while saving ground,
shared command approaching the quarter pole, then eclipsed in closing portion of contest.

RUMBLING THUNDER hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem with CITY OF HOPE and proved best in duel for the score. CITY OF HOPE rushed
form outset and was side by side with pacesetter along the backstretch and around the bend before being outdueled in final sixteenth. TIZ STRONG settled
in behind the pacesetting duo as the lone rival in the second flight but proved to be no match for that pair in the end. IM THE MAN NOW trailed the field and
lost ground to front runners by travelling extra wide through the turn.

HARPERS VISION was unhurried early and trailed the field into the backstretch, was asked for run along the backstretch, trekked the three path at upper
stretch, split foes inside the sixteenth pole and rallied in time for the score. BLING MOON was amongst the early pacesetters while trekking a three wide
pose, led from between rivals at upper stretch, but was nailed at wire for the score. MISS COFFEYVILLE rushed from outset and set the pace in tandem as
the inner most of four abreast, maintained that inside track around the final turn, but was unable to fend off rivals in the final sixteenth. HUSHED came up
empty after pressing the pace from a four wide stance early and a three wide pose in final turn. SHAWK'S LIL AVA broke alertly and shared early command
from between rivals then backed out and faded inside the quarter pole.

SHE'S A PLAYER shared command as the outer rival of two abreast through the opening turn, gained sole command midway down the backstretch, and
drew off in final furlong for a clear score. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC forced the pace from a ground saving stance and finished a clear second while being no
match for winner in final furlong. CHERISH THE DAY finished evenly nd held on for show after saving ground and giving chase from the second flight.
DERBYSHIRE lacked a needed rally after trekking wide early, rating in the second flight, and travelling the three path at upper stretch. CULEBRA showed
reserve in the early stages and travelled along the two path before tiring in the crucial portion of contest. FAT TUESDAY gave chase from a two path pose
and failed to threaten while steadily retreating.

Footnotes
STACCATO showed reserve through the first call, circled rivals along the backstretch, trekked the two path at upper stretch and proved best in the stretch
duel. TOTALLY TIGER tucked behind the early pacesetters to save ground, angled out to three wide along the backstretch, gained command at the quarter
pole, but was outdueled in the final furlong. SHADES OF GLORY settled into the second flight and trekked the two path for the opening half, lost ground to
leaders along the backstretch, then rallied back to earn the show. JOHN ALLEN rushed from outset and led the field from a ground saving stance around
the first bend, relished command along the backstretch, then faded in closing stages. FORT KNOX was unhurried in early portion of contest, saved ground
around the first two turns, angled out at upper stretch but failed to produce a rally. HUNTER QUICK tired in the crucial stages after travelling three wide
early and leading the field between calls. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS hustled from outset to press the pace from between rivals through the opening half before
fading in the latter stages.

OKIE FRONT gained command on first stride, saved ground throughout and steadily widened margin while never relishing command. SUNDAY'S VISION
trekked the three path early and was unhurried before rallying along the rail in final furlong to earn the place. NORTHERN DYNASTY chased the front
runner from a three wide pose through the first turn, closed the gap on leader midway then weakened in the closing strides. SNOWTRICK saved ground for
the opening half and angled out to the three path at upper stretch to no avail. MARIA ELENA Y. G stalked the pacesetter through the first call before fading
steadily in the late going.

Footnotes
OKLAHOMA LINE settled into mid pack around the opening bend, swung wide inside the quarter pole and rallied for the score. HUNTER'S LEGACY stalked
the early pacesetter throught he first turn while saving ground, gained command along the backstretch, led the field at upper stretch, then was nipped at wire
by the late rally of OKLAHOMA LINE. MY REAL DIAMOND settled into second flight and gave chase from a two path stance, rated three wide at upper
stretch and rallied mildly for the show. EURONTHEMONEY flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half but failed to sustain the bid in the
final stages. SMOOTH OPERATOR was unhurried, hugged the inside throughout nd failed to menace. WOODS OF CONGAREE trailed the field from
outset and passed a tiring foe in the closing furlong. CRAFTY HEAT pressed the early pace from a two path stance, tucked to inside around the closing
bend, and steadily retreated in the crucial portion of contest.
