OPEONGO set the unchallenged pace while racing off the inside, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best while being kept to pressure. CINQUE
AMORE tracked the winner three wide and shifted out in the drive and proved no match for that rival, saved place award. NO EASY ANSWER chased the
pace and was three wide on the turn and had no kick, held show award. BALI was settled back early, came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally to
just miss the show award. FROSTED ANGEL chased the pace on the inside and faded in the drive. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL was settled early, came six wide
into the lane and had no rally. POSITIVE FORCE chased the pace between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
BONITA LASSIE set the pace on the inside and was well handled, sent down leaving the three sixteenths and was given a pop left handed with the riding
crop, then switched to the right handed and responded well to remain clear to prove best. EARLY FROST stalked the early pace four wide, then made a
three wide bid to press the pace on the backstretch but could not get by the winner in the drive, second best. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS stalked the early
pace three wide, then was hard held and between rivals on the backstretch, tipped out four wide leaving the turn but had no kick. TEACHER DRAMA
passed the tiring rivals. GIZMO'S DESTINY tracked the pace on the inside and tired. FRED'S SHEILA checked after the start, chased the pace four to three
wide and tired.
