Footnotes
BOOTDADDY JUSTICE was reserved off the pace while near the inside, continued along the rail into the lane, caught the leader just outside the eighth
pole, cleared soon after and widened to the wire. BINGE moved off to a long lead soon after the start, continued clear into the lane, was no match for the
winner then kept on to save the place spot. MUSTY RED was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up for the show spot while not a
threat. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. GO RODNEY was in the three path through the turn
and into the lane and never factored. HENRY RULES chased the pace into the turn while along the inside then faded.

duel through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, had aim on the top two when straightened, could not gain on the winner but got up for the place
spot late. FAITH'S REWARD vied for the lead two wide through the turn, yielded to the winner outside the eighth pole, kept on then lost the place spot late.
QUALITY CHROME was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and was gaining to the end. TAKE CHARGE CHLOE was unhurried while in the
two path through the turn, guided to the fie path through late stretch and was gaining belatedly. KEEN LADY chased the pace from the three path into the

EVERYTHING'S ROSY unhurried while in the two path into the far turn, came into the lane from the two or three path, guided to the five path to avoid a
drifting leader then finished with good energy to be up in time. SKYS IMAGE vied for the lead along the inside while well in front of the field, continued to
duel into the lane, inched away from challenger inside the eighth pole then was caught late. HOOSIER PREMIUM vied two wide from the outset, was still on
near even terms into the lane, yielded to the dueling challenger inside the eighth pole but stayed on to save the show spot. AMAZINGNESS was unhurried
while in the two path through the turns, came into the lane off the inside then was gaining to end from back along the rail. NO TRUST was in the two path
into the far turn, took first run at dueling leaders into the lane then hung inside the eighth pole. Z'S LUCKY GIRL chased the pace from along the inside into
the far turn then tired.

Footnotes
COMPLEX JUSTICE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, gained the lead in late turn, came into the lane from the five path, cleared outside the
eighth pole then continued clear while drifting into the seven path. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT was unhurried early while off the rail, gained momentum through
mid-turn, came into the lane from the two path and slowly gained to the end. MR. SPRINGTIME vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, came
into the lane from the two path while losing contact with the winner then just lasted for the show spot. ORIENT MAGIC saved ground through the turn and
into the lane and lacked a closing response. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was close up between rivals into mid-turn, dropped back and appeared done, re-bid into
the lane and finished with good energy. SUDDEN SHIFT raced in the two path through the turn and offered a mild gain. FASHION NUGGET was never a
factor while in the two path. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY chased the pace from the three path through late turn then faded through the lane. GIVEUSTHISDAY
raced in the four to five path through the turn when beyond mid-pack, continued to fan seven wide into the lane and tired. JEFF THE RUNNER chased the
pace four wide through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFULSYMPHONY chased the pace along the inside through turn, cut the corner into the lane, got through when straightening then drew clear in a
perfect trip. INDIGO MISS set the early pace then was joined by two others in mid-turn, continued to duel into the lane while in the two path, was passed on
the inside by the winner while straightening into the lane, stayed on well to be well clear of the place rival and second best. SILENCING vied for the lead two
wide and in the three path through the turn, continued three wide when straightening then could not keep up while finishing clear of the next rival. BIKINI
raced in the two path through the turn and moved up while not a threat. HAPPY OUT chased the pace from the five to the four path, came into the lane from
the five path and weakened. OCEAN SIZE staked the dueling rivals through mid-turn, bid three wide, was under a drive approaching the quarter pole then
faded. STRONG DEMAND never a factor while along the inside.

four wide in the stretch and gained the show spot late. SCONCE stalked the pace outside and then lacked a late bid. SPLIT DECISION raced in the five
path and improved position late. AUNT RUTH pressed the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. ENCHANTING LUCILLE raced outside and had
no late bid. FLORA passed tired rivals. DEVIOUS led briefly inside, pressed the pace, then gave way in the stretch. DEEP IN JOY faded. DREAMERS
