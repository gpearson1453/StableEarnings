Footnotes
GANCHO was in an inside stalking position early, waited for room on the turn and split horses at the eighth pole and drew away. HIGH HEAT chased the
early speed while outside, took command turning for home and fought on well but could not hold off the winner. SAILOR'S PASSION trailed in the
beginning, roused outside on the turn, then angled out 5 wide in the stretch to rally mildly. MAD DOG N JOE was near the back early, saved ground all
through the race and passed tiring foes in the stretch to get a minor share. BOUND LUCKY stalked on the outside down the backside and turn, was in
contention entering the stretch and had nothing left for the drive. BIG BAD BEAST showed early speed on the rail, was collared entering the stretch and
stopped.

Footnotes
BENLION was unhurried in the early going, moved up three wide through the far turn, angled five to six wide through the drive and just got up under strong
handling. STAR SCHOLAR stalked the pace, moved up five wide through the upper stretch, took a narrow lead near the eighth pole but just missed in a
game effort. POINT TO THE STARS chased the early pace down the backstretch, raced near the two path in the stretch run, challenged for the lead near
the eighth marker and kept on to the wire. MAGIC SPIN stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
STORMIN' HUMOR was coaxed along early, raced two to three wide and had not enough in the drive. SEA TO AIR showed good early speed to set the
pace from the outside and weakened the final eighth while racing the rail. RELOAD TIME was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and never was a
factor. MY BUYBACK settled off the early pace and failed to have a response. CLASS IN MAX was off a step slow, raced four wide into the lane and never
threatened.

BREATHING FIRE stalked horses through the turn, then took command at the eighth pole and was drawing away late. YA MAR was well rated while setting
the early fractions, game through the stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final eighth. SPIDER BELLE was near the rear early on, roused mid turn
while the widest and offered a mild rally on the outside. OLD SECRETS trailed early on, then was roused between horses through the turn, angled outside
for the drive and closed belatedly. WINYAH BAY chased the speed in the opening stages while just outside, was asked at the 1/4 pole and offered little
response. BOBBI'S LEGACY tracked early on while saving ground throughout but had no finishing kick down the stretch.

Footnotes
TRISH THE DISH was unhurried early, made a good five wide bid in the stretch run and finished best to edge clear under strong encouragement. ASHA
IRONBORN showed good early speed from the inside to set the pace, led near the sixteenth pole and was wore down to finish second best. VERY SAVVY
stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. GABBY SQUARED settled off the early going, moved up
through the far turn, raced two wide, angled in to race near the rail in the stretch run, was blocked nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly to the
wire. PIPESTONE tracked the early leader down the backstretch, raced just off the inside in the drive and weakened a bit in the final stages. AWILDAS
TREASURE settled off the early going, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. SUPER LEGGERA settled off the early going,
raced five wide in the lane and had no response. WHAT A BEAUT settled off the early going, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and never was a factor. BOSSALINA stalked the pace, raced along the inside, checked near the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
ICE FLOE chased the pacesetter throughout, was slowly gaining down the stretch and got up in the final strides. SASSYWITHATTITUDE set all the
fractions, was game through the stretch and gave way stubbornly close to the wire. AT THE LYRIC stalked the leaders while four wide on the turn, loomed
entering the stretch but could not pick up the top two runners. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE trailed early while saving ground and ran evenly through the
stretch for a minor share. SURFEIT was asked to keep up entering the turn, offered a mild rally on the turn and levelled out down the lane.
SHESALOOSECANNON was near the rear, asked on the turn while 3 wide and offered little response.

Footnotes
MACHISIMA chased the front runners into the first turn, took command entering the backstretch and widened turning for home to be much the best.
MAMITA'S CHICA broke slow ,trailed early, circled horses while 6 wide on the final turn and closed well to be a clear second. PURE ELEGANCE was four
wide on the first turn, chased the winner through the backstretch and faded down the lane while still holding onto third. MUSKOKA LADY rated in the early
stages, split horses on the turn and closed inside belatedly for a minor placing. TEXT ME UP stalked down the backstretch, loomed up turning for home and
levelled out the final eighth. FINDING PERFECTION showed brief speed, fell back down the backstretch, and passed tiring foes late. SAN NICOLA STAR
showed early speed inside, backed up entering the turn and was empty in the stretch. SPEAK ENGLISH was near the rear and never factored. RIDER
CLAIM OF FOUL #1 MUSKOKA LADY ON #7 PURE ELEGANCE NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ROYAL CITY REIGN settled off the early pace, made a good advance through the far turn, made an outside bid in the stretch run closed strongly to get up
under steady pressure. FRERET was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths, led deep stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. STUNNING RIVERS was unhurried early on, raced four to three wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. PALIO SIENA pressed Freret
in the early going, raced near the rail in the drive and weakened. TWOCANKEEPASECRET was unhurried early on, raced three to deep around the turn,
was five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. I AM I SAID settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide through the upper
stretch, angled in near the rail and had no late rally. ALLPAIDUP stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened a bit the
final eighth of a mile. PEGGY BANK stalked the top pair early on weakened in the stretch run while racing three wide. FLAWLESS PINK raced near the
inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response.
