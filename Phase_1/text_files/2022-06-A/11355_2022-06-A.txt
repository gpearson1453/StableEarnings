Footnotes
NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. WF FRANKLY
MY DEAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner but finished well to gain the place. BYE
BYE HEATH chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that foe and gave way late for the runner-up award. NEW MEXICO LINDY was
void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SWAYEM was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually
weakened. PLAYTHEMARKER was off a step slow, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. ORBITING BEAUTY raced off the pacesetters
early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. STORMY DAME was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.
VIPERS PRINCESS broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. JOJO'S GIRL showed no early
speed, saved ground throughout and did not offer a bid.

Z MARKS THE SPOT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by STORM LEADERS nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and held that rival safely to the wire. STORM LEADER broke sharply to press the pace of the
winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths marker but could not match strides in the drive. MARKED MONEY
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. MUSICS MY VICE raced off the pacesetters early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. BEACH RUNNER raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. HIGH DOLLAR HUSH was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. OL' MCCLINTOCK was off
slow, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. PRETTY PEPPY showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.
CATTALOU showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. STORM SIPPIN was void of early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
GUARDING ELK CAMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off.
OVERTIDE was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. MARILYN MONEYROLL
dueled for the lead with OVERTIDE while racing from the inside and gave way in the drive. BAND OF GLORY was never far back, saved ground through
the turn and finished evenly late. CITYONTHENILE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
NOBLE MISS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. RANGER MOLLY raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. STONE TOP lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PEARL
DRAGON showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid.

early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. VODKA TWIST settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run. SIDNEY'S HOPE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MANOSO chased
