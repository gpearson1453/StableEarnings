Footnotes
A THOUSAND DREAMS stalked between early, tipped out and bid three deep into the stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and held off the runner-up.
CHEERFUL CHARM off slow in the beginning, became rank soon after the start, continued to fight the rider all the way to upper stretch, rallied late but could
not get by the winner. DERBY QUEST got crowded and shuffled between rivals early, moved to the inside stalking the leaders, waited for room leaving the
far turn, found an opening and split foes at the eight pole, then finished willingly to gain the show. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY fractious in the gate, chased
three wide or three deep early on, spun four wide into the drive and finished evenly late. BACK ON THE STREET stumbled leaving the gate, went up to duel
for command from outside early, chased outside the leader up the backstretch, re-bid at the three-eighths pole, vied between rivals in upper stretch, drifted
and bobbled midstretch and flattened out. ST HELENA threw her head and came away a bit slow to start, recovered quickly and went up to challenge for
command along the rail, inched away from rival in the middle stages, challenged entering the far turn, battled to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch
and weakened along the inside. WESTWARD BREEZE pulled a bit while in the three path, remained off the rail to the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
AGENCY stumbled and shifted in a bit at the start, got caught in a bit tight between rivals early, tracked in the two path around the turn, steered out in the
lane, rallied and overhauled the top pair late. CROWNING GOLD vied three deep into and around the turn, had the rider lose his whip when switching hands
in upper stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth and was overtaken by the winner late. PACIFIC STATES vied with a pair of rivals along the rail to the
stretch, fought inside CROWING GOLD down the lane and got outkicked in deep stretch. HENRY Q chased the top trio four wide through the turn, put in a
mild bid in the lane, got floated out a bit by CROWNING GOLD in deep stretch and lacked the needed late punch. CRYPTOHOLIC hit the gate and came
away step slow, chased along the inside around the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and could not rally. EAGLES LANDING dropped back early, went
four then five wide around the turn and made no impact. ROYAL HALO vied for command between rivals, fought to upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
OCTOPUS off a bit slow from inside, moved up inside the pacesetter, steadied in tight entering the turn, tipped two wide around the bend, bid between in
the final furlong and got up late. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH sped to the front, led off the rail then angled in entering the turn, met a pair of bids with a furlong to
go, resisted into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. SLAM DUNK SERMON chased off the inside, bid three deep in the stretch, fought to the wire and
proved a game third. BEAR CHUM (AUS) broke out, tracked well off the rail, moved into the three path while passing rivals then came four wide into the
stretch and flattened out. CASTLE GATE stumbled leaving the gate, went three then two wide around the bend, came out in the stretch and lacked further
response. STEPHEN JAMES raced in range to the turn, dropped back two wide then along the rail on the turn and weakened.

FLY THE SKY was off a bit slow to begin, settled four wide down the hill, moved into the two path, gained three wide on the far turn, bid three deep in upper
stretch, held a short lead through the final furlong, drifted in and made light contact with BEE CATCHER late and gamely prevailed. BEE CATCHER stalked
in the two path or a bit off the rail, driven two wide into the stretch, bid between foes in the lane, got floated in by the winner in the final sixteenth and kept on
gamely to the wire. DOMINANT SOUL took control early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, fought on into the
the final sixteenth then got put in tight quarters and shuffled back to third with no time to recover. PROUD PEDRO (FR) off slow from outside, tracked in the
two path down the hill then came out crossing over the dirt, moved back to the two path then along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to
respond when asked. TARTINI settled off the rail then moved inside, roused between rivals on the last turn, tipped out into the stretch and lacked a rally.
BIG BUZZ reserved along the inside early, tipped to the two path on the clubhouse turn, moved out four wide for the last turn, came three wide into the
stretch and had little left for the drive. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT LATE IN THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH FLY
THE SKY SHIFTED IN AND MADE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH BEE CATCHER WHICH IN TURN PUT DOMINANT SOUL IN TIGHT NEARING THE WIRE,
IT DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE TOP THREE PLACINGS AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

VALIANCY stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail early then moved up to apply pressure from outside, dueled around the far turn and into the
stretch, kicked clear when asked right-handed and flagged with the whip and drew off under steady handling. ANGEL NADESHIKO cleared and angled in
around the clubhouse turn, got pressured up the backstretch, dueled around the second turn and into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, could not
kick on with the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. KURA hit the gate to come away a step slow, settled in the two path then between on
the backstretch, chased the top pair two wide to the stretch and bested the rest. ACT OF SERENDIPITY steadied briefly along the inside behind the leader
on the first turn, put in a mild bid from inside at the nine-sixteenths pole but quickly lost touch again, lost ground through the far turn and tired in the lane.
KEEPURSELF ALIVE broke a step slow, chased three to four wide on the first turn, traveled outside rivals into the second bend, moved down to the two
path and came up empty.

AIR FORCE RED broke out and bumped rival then sprinted clear, showed the way along the inside then two wide into the stretch, responded when
challenged by IRIDEO (ARG) with a furlong left to run and held gamely. IRIDEO (ARG) stalked along the inside, launched a bid inside AIR FORCE RED at
the eighth pole but failed to find the needed late kick to get by. RED FLAG dropped back early, went four then five wide around the turn and gained the
show. WHISPER NOT (GB) got bumped leaving the gate then pulled early, chased three deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. SAFFA'S DAY was closest to the pacesetter early on, rounded the turn two then three wide and weakened. BOCHOMBO brushed with inner rival
leaving the gate, settled early, traveled between runners then two to three wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ADMIRAL tracked two to three wide early, moved out on the backstretch, crept closer four then three wide on the second bend, drew alongside
HOLDEN THE LUTE and wore down that rival in deep stretch to get up near the wire. HOLDEN THE LUTE stalked off the rail and applied a bit of pressure
on the backstretch, dueled outside and took a short lead on the far turn, cleared into the stretch, received the challenge from AMERICAN ADMIRAL in the
final furlong, resisted to the closing moments and got nailed near the wire. DARK VADER stalked along the inside, tipped off the rail in the lane and gained
late inside the top pair. TROUBADOUR sped to the front, showed the way to the far turn, dueled with HOLDEN THE LUTE around the bend, lost touch into
the stretch and flattened to fourth. AJAAWEED was off slow to begin, trailed four wide around the first turn, remained wide to the stretch and lacked a rally.
ONCOMING tracked off the rail, three deep up the backstretch, went two wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
COUNTESS ROSINA (IRE) pulled a bit early while outside the leader into the turn, closest in the two path through the early going, bid outside nearing the
stretch, kicked clear and drifted inward in upper stretch and held off the late charge from GEM MINE. GEM MINE bumped with inner rival at the start, rated
on the inside, roused along the fence at the top of the lane, got put in tight quarters in upper stretch, got through then tipped to the outside of the leader and
surged but was too late. HELENS WELL (IRE) sat off the pace outside a rival, angled out into the stretch, got bumped from inside midstretch and kept on to
earn the show honors. SHE'S GOT A WAY bumped leaving the gate, pulled and became rank entering the first turn, settled inside, tipped out in upper
stretch, got forced out and bumped rival in midstretch and missed the show. SIXTEEN ARCHES (IRE) pulled early, tucked inside at the back, angled out
into the stretch and failed to threaten. BABY STEPS set the pace on the inside, roused with a quarter mile left to run, lost command entering the stretch, got
bothered by the leader then drifted out midstretch and weakened. DOLLY MAY (IRE) reserved in the early going, three to four wide on the first turn, came
three wide into the stretch, then angled out and lacked further response. SWEET TALKED stalked the lone leader outside a rival and weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
UNDER THE STARS away quickly then relinquished the lead to GANADORA, closest in pursuit from the two path, bid outside at the seven-sixteenths pole,
took over at the five-sixteenths, disposed of inner rival past the quarter pole then fought with LADY T into the stretch, cleared that rival in upper stretch and
remained strong under a drive to the line. LADY T stalked off the inside early, bid outside the top pair on the far turn, pressured UNDER THE STARS into
the stretch, lost touch with that rival nearing the eighth pole and stayed on to prove second best. DESERT DAWN stumbled badly leaving the gate,
recovered and trailed off the rail around the first turn, moved into range up the backstretch, went two then three wide around the far turn, flattened in the
stretch run but bested the rest. GANADORA went up to take control from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, got pressured at the seven-sixteenths
pole, lost command at the five-sixteenths, chased the top pair past the quarter pole and gave way down the lane. KIRSTENBOSCH was off slow to begin,
moved to the inside, steered out on the second bend and came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EMPIRE GAL pulled behind the leader on
the first turn, chased along the rail then two wide on the second bend and faded. BICAMERAL hit the gate in the beginning, chased on the inside into the
first turn, moved out a bit while a bit rank around the bend, moved out widest on the backstretch, dropped back under a drive on the second turn, tired and
eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LIKE THE WIND sped clear and crossed over, saved ground through the turn, drew away in upper stretch, continued well clear into the final sixteenth and
lasted over the flying MY SUMMER DREAM in the final strides. MY SUMMER DREAM got bumped from outside at the start, sat off the pace early, went two
then three wide around the turn, taken out widest at the top of the stretch, drifted inward while closing fast but was too late. UNCLE WILBUR chased the
leader inside a pair of rivals, bumped with rival entering the turn, continued along the rail to the stretch, lacked a serious bid and bested the rest. WEDDING
GROOM chased between rivals, bumped with UNCLE WILBUR entering the turn, chased two wide into the lane and lacked further response. MAJESTIC
WIND bumped with inner rival at the start, waited for room behind a trio of rivals on the turn, found room and tipped out entering the stretch but lacked a
serious bid. DRAW THE FOUL chased three deep into the turn, stayed three wide to the stretch, moved out at the top of the lane and could not rally. LITTLE
MISCHIEF bumped leaving the gate, tracked from inside through the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch but never threatened. SIERRA PASS bobbled
slightly at the start, saved ground through the turn and was never a factor. MR. MERCEDES broke in and bumped rival, raced outside a rival at the back,
went two wide around the bend and failed to make an impact.
