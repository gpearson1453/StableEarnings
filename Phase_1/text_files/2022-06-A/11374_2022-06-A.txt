Footnotes
MY LITTLE TIPSY shared the lead outside IRISH LIGHTED ROAD, moved ahead when asked near the quarter pole, lengthened command under a drive
upper stretch then maintained control under steady handling. FUTURE VISION prominent outside MY LITTLE TIPSY, was three wide taking the bend, took
over second upper stretch then gradually angled in the last furlong while pulling away for the place. CLEVER BOY jostled with RIP IT RYAN while trying to
keep a clear path shortly after leaving the chute, angled to the outside with five furlongs left, lost ground widest through the turn, gained third with a sixteenth
to go then could only hold his position late. ASTOROTH was hustled along in the early going and soon had the inside, gradually angled out taking the turn,
altered out to path four upper stretch for racing room and lacked a significant response. RIP IT RYAN caught in tight quarters shortly after leaving the chute,
jostled with CLEVER BOY through the early going, continued along the inside and failed to have a stretch bid. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD displayed early
speed from inside but began to yield before finishing four furlongs.

HER GOLD MINE shared the lead outside MARYS LAST SONG, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was under steady urging in the stretch and held
the latter at bay. MARYS LAST SONG was hustled along to contest the early pace from inside, did not keep up while along the rail on the turn, swung out to
path three entering the lane, was all out, drifted out some under left-handed pressure in the waning yards, came up short but was clearly second best.
DUSTY MILLER advanced widest through the turn, came five wide into the lane and found best stride too late. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE bumped with MISS
LEARJET at the start, was boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch and turn, gained a clear path two wide nearing the furlong marker but had no late
bid. MISS LEARJET bumped with ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE at the break, prompted the pace outside that one, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out
further for the stretch run and gradually yielded from between horses. KIANA'S LOVE moved to the inside midway on the backstretch and steadily yielded
after three furlongs. The rider of MARYS LAS SONG lodged an objection alleging interference from HER GOLD MINE leaving the turn. After their review,
the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SUCCESS was bumped and shuffled back just after the break, settled well back and off the inside, was roused after a half mile, steadily closed
the gap, was widest under urging taking the second turn, under a steady drive in the lane and edged ahead of ANTRIM'S GIANT inside the final sixteenth
under a well-judged ride. ANTRIM'S GIANT rated off the early speed, commenced his bid three wide on the second bend, edged ahead from between rivals
inside the last furlong, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure, held a straight path in the waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort.
CHERNYAHOVSKIY helped prompt the pace three wide, went for the lead outside KAY'S GRAY on the second turn, fought in the lane but gradually wore
down inside the final eighth. DRAW THE LINE prominent along the rail from the beginning, was boxed in taking the second bend, gained a clear path just off
the inside with a furlong left, lacked a significant response but was clearly best of the others. SHOBIZ STAR was sent to race in the second flight between
foes, was also boxed in while just off the inside through the second turn, altered out four wide for racing room upper stretch but flattened out the final
furlong. MR. LUV MAKER was settled at the back and inside the first half mile, picked up his pace after that, angled to the outside upper stretch but failed to
have a significant response. KAY'S GRAY soon had a clear lead but began to wear down from inside with three furlongs left.

Footnotes
I DON'T WANT TO GO boke outward, bumping U CAN DO IT, vied for the lead outside JOLIE RULER after a furlong and a half, battled that one through
the lane and edged ahead in the waning yards. JOLIE RULER broke alertly and soon had a clear lead just off the inside, was challenged approaching the
end of two furlongs, had the rail on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, fought gamely between horses but did not have enough left. IMAGINE
GOLD rated from inside, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, continued her bid in the stretch and was steadied the final forty yards when her path
narrowed. SIMPLY FAST prominent from outside, threatened three wide on the bend, was bumped and forced out some leaving the quarter pole then
leveled off for the drive. U CAN DO IT bumped at the break, moved to the inside near the half mile pole, was boxed in on the turn, altered out leaving the
quarter pole trying to gain a clear path, bumped SIMPLY FAST, gained racing room four wide at the head of the lane but gradually yielded. WARM BEAUTY
failed to menace racing along or just off the rail throughout.

LASTFORTINOFAMILY rated on the front end just outside DANG IT CASSIE, was roused two wide with two furlongs to go, battled inside JOEY B in the
lane, slowly drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the last eighth and narrowly held on. JOEY B gradually progressed from outside to vie for the lead
three wide leaving the second turn, fought on even terms the final furlong, was crowded and forced out some in the waning yards, did not have the needed
late kick but was clearly second best. DANG IT CASSIE brushed with JACK N JOHN at the break, moved ahead from inside on the first bend, was
challenged on the backstretch and gradually wore down for the stretch run. CAMPAIGN SPY prominent between rivals, did not keep up from path three on
the second turn, swung outside JOEY B entering the lane and continued to yield. JACK N JOHN brushed with DANG IT CASSIE at the start then shied
inward, chased from close to the inside and was never a factor. TOCCETIVE JAC showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
WALKER'S WIN was in tight between rivals approaching the end of the first eighth, gained the inside after two furlongs, had the rail through the bend, rallied
under a drive to gain a narrow advantage inside the final eighth and slowly edged ahead. TONYS MORNING LINE gradually angled in trying to keep a clear
path leaving the chute, moved to the outside before finishing the first furlong, took the bend three wide, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure
inside the eighth pole, held a straight path the final sixty yards, came up short but caught MAC PANDOWDY for second at the wire. MAC PANDOWDY was
hustled from the gate to gain a slight lead, gradually angled in leaving the chute, set a pressured pace just off the inside, was challenged inside the last
eighth and slowly yielded in a game effort. CARNAVAL CONQUEST in contention early while toward the outside began to fade after three furlongs.
CYCLONE ATTACK caught in crowding inside rivals shortly after entering the main track, was steadied midway on the backstretch, angled out with a half
mile left and also began to yield after three furlongs. SAFE forwardly placed from inside on the backstretch, failed to respond to urging on the bend and
steadily gave way.

Footnotes
MIZ CLIPPER urged along from midpack while toward the outside on the backstretch, reached contention three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the
stretch run, rallied under a drive, took over with a sixteenth left and was drawing away in the waning yards. BOBBIE TOO TOO stumbled inward as she
broke on top, bumping DEAUVILLE MIST, quickly recovered to sprint clear, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from outside on the turn,
battled inside MY WIFE IS BOSS through the lane, was no match for MIZ CLIPPER deep stretch but kept MY WIFE IS BOSS at bay for the place. MY WIFE
IS BOSS hesitated then broke inward, quickly advanced from outside to vie for the lead on the turn, fought through the stretch but did not have the needed
late kick. DEAUVILLE MIST was bumped, forced inward and solidly checked at the break, moved to the outside, was four wide on the bend, drifted out past
the middle of the track for the drive and was closing in the final furlong. REJOICE AN BE GLAD forwardly placed from inside, angled out on the turn, came
four wide into the lane, gradually angled in and could not make up ground in the late going. QUIET DRAMA also hesitated at the start, moved up to
contention from between rivals, began to yield along the rail on the turn, lacked a stretch bid and gradually altered out for a clear path the final seventy
yards. HERO ALEXANDRA failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. HALO COUTURE chased from inside, angled out on the turn, came into the lane from
path five and had little to offer. RUBY ROUND HERE forced in briefly at the start, raced in the second flight from between horses, began to yield before
finishing four furlongs and gave way rapidly in the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry into BOBBIE TOO TOO'S and DEAUVILLE MIST'S interaction at
the start but no action was taken after their review.
