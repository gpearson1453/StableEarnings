Footnotes
LONESOME DREAM was checked briefly when crowded by the injured GHAALEB'S BIG WIN midway on the backstretch, went for the lead outside
CINDY'S G MAN on the bend, drew clear inside the last furlong and held off BABA'S BOY under late urging. BABA'S BOY without early speed, was
steadied as he passed inside the injured GHAALEB'S BIG WIN midway on the backstretch, swung out approaching the end of the first four furlongs, came
widest into the lane and found best stride too late. MARESONOFAGUN was checked solidly when the injured GHAALEB'S BIG WIN floated out into his path
midway on the backstretch, was soon well back, picked up his pace as he gradually angled in on the turn and rallied belatedly along the rail in the stretch.
CINDY'S G MAN broke alertly and soon had the inside, was challenged on the bend, floated out some entering the lane and gave way before finishing five
furlongs. GHAALEB'S BIG WIN sustained a serious injury after the first furlong, was pulled up, euthanized and taken off the track.

Footnotes
YOU'RE IN COREY rated from outside on the backstretch, swiftly took over three wide when allowed on the turn, floated out some upper stretch, was
straightened before reaching the eighth pole and steadily opened up under mostly hand urging. A BOLD RYDE bumped with MAJESTIC ATTACK after the
break, made his bid widest on the bend, altered out some as YOU'RE IN COREY came out upper stretch, was no match for the latter the last furlong but
clearly best of the others. A MERRY HEART was hustled to contest the pace from inside, moved out some when MAJESTIC ATTACK drew ahead nearing
the turn, was two wide taking the turn, took over third inside the last eighth then could only hold his position. JOHNNY LONGBOAT well back early, picked
up his pace along the rail on the turn, continued closing the gap in the stretch, altered out for a clear path nearing the sixteenth marker and was gaining on A
MERRY HEART late. MAJESTIC ATTACK bumped with A BOLD RYDE shortly after the start, displayed early speed outside A MERRY HEART, drew clear
after two furlongs, took the rail but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
AFTER MY BROTHER broke on top, was allowed to relax off SNOOZER'S early speed, was let out two wide on the bend, took over into the lane then
steadily opened up while kept to task to the wire. TRUIST in midpack early, saved ground taking the turn, angled out three wide for a clear path upper
stretch and gained second inside the final sixteenth. SNOOZER soon took the lead from outside, had the rail on the turn, could not stay with AFTER MY
BROTHER when set down for the drive and began to wear down inside the last eighth. THACKER FROMM chased from outside, took the turn three wide,
fanned out further for the stretch run and showed late interest. GALLI ATTACK prominent early, dropped back some between rivals on the turn, swung out
to path four entering the lane and failed to have a significant bid. DARREN'S LEGACY was a step slow at the break, chased from just off the inside and
never a factor. DEXTER'S HARD TIME chased from outside and failed to menace. WILLIE ATTACK fractious in the gate, showed little once the race began.

Footnotes
WATCHIN THE WHEELS settled at the back, was roused two wide on the bend, began to angle out leaving the turn, was forced out to the middle of the
track into the lane, swiftly took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and began drawing off. HIDENSEEK SALLY disputed the pace inside rivals from the
beginning, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but pulled clear for second late. MENDING prominent early, advanced four wide on the bend, drifted out
toward the middle of the track entering the lane, lacked a rally but caught MEETMEINSTLOUIE for third. MEETMEINSTLOUIE vied for the lead outside
horses from the start, was three wide taking the bend, fought in the stretch but wore down the last sixteenth. TIZ HOPPIN displayed early speed between
foes, also began to gradually wear down deep stretch, was steadied when her path was taken inside the final sixteenth and altered in. LOUIE P was well
placed from inside, did not keep up on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and continued to yield.

Footnotes
MARIA'S GIFT rated off the inside on the backstretch, progressed three wide on the bend, angled out to path five for racing room upper stretch, drifted out
badly each time she was put to left-handed urging but got up in time. G MONEY LIV broke on top, sprinted clear of the rest, gradually angled in, had the rail
on the turn, floated out to path three entering the stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth, was put to urging at that point but did not have enough
left. PELLETIER in contention early, moved to the inside with four furlongs to go, advanced along the rail on the bend and found best stride too late the final
furlong. WITCHING exchanged bumps with BEING CREATIVE at the start, was prominent from outside on the backstretch, threatened just off the inside on
the turn, fanned out as G MONEY LIV came out into the lane and slowly wore down the final eighth. BEING CREATIVE bumped with WITCHING at the
start, bobbled then bumped with the latter again, was hustled along from well off the inside, three wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane,
angled in some upper stretch then steadily progressed between horses without threatening. CAIRO SUMMER chased from off the inside, was between foes
on the turn, swung out widest for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. FRIEND chased from inside, gradually came off the rail taking the bend
and only passed a couple tired rivals the last furlong. SUCH A LADY helped prompt the pace from between horses on the backstretch but faded on the turn.
COMMISSION was well placed inside but gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
RIDE INTO THE SKY bumped with MARYS LAST SONG shortly after the break, pressed the early speed, bid for the lead in tight quarters between rivals on
the bend, fought through the lane, floated out slightly inside the last eighth, edged ahead nearing the final sixteenth and held on under steady handling.
TALIS PARK GRAD hesitated at the break, was soon in contention, progressed four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning out entering the stretch,
lugged in a bit as he engaged the leaders approaching the sixteenth marker, was all out in the late going but had to settle for second best. TALE OF THE
NILE prominent from outside, vied for the lead three wide on the bend, floated out some into the lane, fought between rivals, yielded a bit inside the eighth
pole, was steadied when TALIS PARK GRAD came close with a sixteenth left and continued to gradually retreat. MARYS LAST SONG broke a bit inward,
bumped with ONE PUTT RICHIE then was squeezed briefly between that one and RIDE INTO THE SKY, prompted the pace in close quarters between
rivals, jostled with ONE PUTT RICHIE midway on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the turn, swung widest for the stretch run and ran evenly
the final furlong. ONE PUTT RICHIE was bumped then leaned on MARYS LAST SONG at the break, jostled with the latter while in close quarters midway
on the backstretch, failed to keep up from along the rail on the turn, fanned out entering the lane, altered inside for a clear path nearing the sixteenth pole
but only made up minor ground. PITAMAN was sent to get the early lead, was challenged from outside on the turn and gave way the last two furlongs.
