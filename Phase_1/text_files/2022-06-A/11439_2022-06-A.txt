ground from the two path around the turn and made a three wide late rally to be second best. JUSTIN SPEIGHT tracked the leader from the three path and
was empty in the drive. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE raced near the back from the three path but was never a threat. TEXAS STORM chased the leaders from
the two path in the middle of the pack but never made a bid.

OH MY ACHING ARCH navigated the first turn from the four path then tracked the leader from the two path down the backstretch was asked on the final
turn and drew off. RUN ROCKET raced near the back around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a bid from the three to four path around the
final turn and rallied from the five path closing fast on the leader but ran out of room. LIKE MIKE raced in the middle of the pack from the three path made a
mild bid going into the final turn, ran out of room had to rebid in mid stretch but was able to rally for the show. GOBLER was unhurried early around the first
turn then steadily gained up the backstretch made a middle move on the final turn and finished even late. INCA WARRIOR was in the four path around the
first turn then settled in the middle of the pack but was never a threat. SOURNOIS saved ground but was through early. GUILTY LOVER pressed the pace
from the two path through the final turn and weakened. FAST VERDICT tracked the leaders from just off the rail and gave way after three quarters.
SYDSTER led for a half from the inside under pressure and retreated.
