Footnotes
SHE'LL BE A STAR set a pressured pace for the opening quarter while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off as a
handy winner. JAZZ MAN DO chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. INDIAN
NIGHTS came in to impede rivals nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CORA BELLE steadied
nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. D C GUN RUNNER pressed the pace
from the inside for three furlongs and gave way. SUPER HUNK steadied nearing the nine-sixteens pole then was allowed to settle, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid. MAGNUS WHO was forwardly placed from off the rail and gradually weakened. RIGGED RIGHT showed brief speed and
weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING CORA BELLE AND SUPER HUNK STEADYING SOON AFTER THE START
AND AFTER REVIEWNG THE FILMS CONCLUDED INDIAN NIGHTS HAD CAME INWARD AND CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
NO REGRETS N LOVE was away in good order to press the pace of RIGLET while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and
quickly drew off. RIGLET set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner into the stretch but could not match
strides through the final furlong. ANNIE GET UR GUNS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late.
PRECIOUS PRIDE settled off the leader from the inside, moved up for a contending position and failed to gain late. EVIL TEMPTATION showed brief
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and gave way. IZZY GIRL showed no early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STELLA
WHEAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
