Footnotes
CEILING CRUSHER broke a bit slow then drifted in and bumped rival shortly after the start, went up to vie between rivals then got put in tight and checked
back near the seven-sixteenths pole, moved outside and came again on the turn, took over in upper stretch and moved clear entering the furlong grounds
and widened in the final sixteenth. COCKTAIL PRINCESS away quickly in the beginning, vied three deep early then dueled two wide into and around the
turn, lost command in upper stretch, could not kick on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. ONE SMOKIN' RITA broke slow and
veered out, went three deep into the turn, rounded the bend four wide and kept on to earn the show honors. IT'S SAUL RIGHT chased between rivals into
the turn, two then three wide around the bend and never threatened. SMOKIN AMELIA stumbled badly leaving the gate and dropped far back early, exited
the bend three wide and made no impact. SMOKEM FOR YOU chased along the rail to the stretch and weakened. ROSE GIRL broke a bit slow and
bumped shortly after the start, went up to vie with a pair of rivals then dueled into and around the turn, lost touch with the top pair into the stretch, moved off
the inside and tired.

Footnotes
CODE DUELLO stalked the speed up the backstretch, lacked room when boxed in entering the turn, swung out leaving the bend, rallied to the front in
midstretch and held on over COSMO at the line. COSMO settled outside a rival, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch, surged
late but missed. EXPLOSIVE hustled to the front and moved clear approaching the half-mile pole, led along the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch,
continued clear into the final furlong, then lost command in midstretch and yielded late. DONCIC broke a step slow, chased outside a rival early, gained
three deep on the turn, got crowded and forced to check at the eighth pole and was ridden out for a minor award. COMMANDER KHAI broke well, dueled
briefly then stalked the leader, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, tipped out then moved back inside and lacked a late bid. COMRADERY
(IRE) broke a step slow, raced at the back, saved ground through the turn, drifted off the inside in the lane and could not rally. MEET THE SHERIFF was off
a bit slow but recovered quickly, took an awkward step and bobbled crossing over the dirt, forwardly placed in the two path entering the turn, bid between at
the quarter pole, got put in tight and checked between at the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
MAXIM MOMENT prompted the pace in the two path outside the leader through the early going, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared leaving the bend
and remained strong to the wire under mild urging. CANDY FOR CARMEL set the pace along the inside while pressured by MAXIM MOMENT, showed the
way up the backstretch and to the far turn, headed midway around the far turn, lost touch past the quarter pole and chased the winner through the stretch
while well clear of next rival. AMADMADWORLD chased three wide early, lost ground three then four wide while asked on the second bend and churned on
for a clear third. TORAJIRO got fanned four wide into the first turn, dropped back while remaining wide on the far turn, entered the lane five wide and had
little left. ROYAL ORB fanned five wide into the first turn, started to weaken five on the far turn, trailed six wide into the stretch, eased to the wire and walked
off.

MISSED CALL broke a step slow, settled in mid-pack, closed in three wide around the turn, drew alongside the top pair, took over at the eighth pole and
edged away. CURLY ESA broke in, pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn in the two path, held a short lead in upper stretch, overtaken by
the winner at the eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. MAYNARD was off slow and lost his path leaving the gate, raced outside a rival then tipped
three wide around the turn and was along for the show. PEPPERMAN was off slow from outside, angled down to the rail and saved ground at the back,
moved out in the stretch and improved position between rivals late. PASS INTERFERENCE bobbled slightly after crossing the dirt, chased along the inside
to the stretch, altered from behind a rival and went between foes late but failed to threaten. SAI CON (FR) broke out, set the pace under pressure, dueled on
the inside around the turn, fought to midstretch and weakened late. HIDING THE BRICK away well, stalked off the rail, drifted out a bit while dropping back
on the turn and tired.

ROSES R BLUE bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival then three wide around the turn, drew alongside past the eighth pole and won going away.
LIBERALISM away well from outside, dueled for command from outside, cleared past the quarter pole, overtaken midstretch and stayed on for a clear
second. RED PANTY NIGHT chased off the rail then became hard to ride early, continued to fight the rider through the turn and into the stretch, then settled
into stride and rallied belatedly for the show. SUEZAAANA stumbled badly and bumped leaving the gate, recovered quickly and went up to duel from inside,
lost touch with the leader past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. ROSES FOR SUZZETT hustled to a forward position on the inside, saved ground
through the turn then faded in the drive. PRINCESS ALEXIS broke a step slow, sat off the pace early on, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to
rally.

Footnotes
FLINT STROLL away quickly in the beginning, pressed from outside then moved up to duel on the backstretch, vied between rivals with a quarter mile left to
run, lost command into the stretch, fought back through the lane and dug in late to draw clear. NINEELEVENTURBO rated along the inside early then began
to pull, was taken off the rail on the clubhouse turn, tugged the rider up alongside the top pair, vied three deep late on the far turn, led into the stretch, drifted
out from the left-hand at the eight pole and was bested by FLINT STROLL in deep stretch. SPIRIT MAKER sped to the front from inside, showed the way
through the clubhouse turn, took pressure on the backstretch then dueled for command to the far turn, vied with a pair of rivals with a quarter mile left to run,
fought back from inside in the drive, could not find the needed late kick in the final sixteenth but stayed on for the show. HALFBARBERBINGIE was off a bit
slow from outside, went two wide into the first turn then moved out around the bend, traveled three deep up the backstretch, moved closer on the far turn
and came three wide into the stretch but failed to find more in the final furlong. SETTECENTO got bumped from inside at the start, settled off the pace, went
between on the backstretch, got put in tight and checked entering the far turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to threaten. SHORTMAN broke slow and
bumped leaving the gate, steadied briefly into the backstretch, trailed along the inside then two wide into the stretch and was not a factor. NEVER SEEN
BEFORE (IRE) broke out, got crowded and shuffled back early, raced along the rail then two wide on both turns and tired.

NO HANG CHARLIE sped to the front and took control of the rail early, led clear into the stretch, put to right-handed urging and strong handling, switched to
the left-hand in the final sixteenth and held safely. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY went two to three wide and between rivals on the first turn, had to steady off
heels early on the far turn, continued two wide to the stretch, steered to the inside and rallied for the place. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU bit fractious in the
gate, pulled and steadied on the inside around the first turn, tipped out entering the stretch, lacked the needed late punch and got edged for the place.
REDLINE stalked in the two path early, ridden along through the far turn then asked two to three wide into the stretch and flattened. WILLY THE COBBLER
angled out around the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, remained three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CLADDAGH CURE stalked off the inside, three then two wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, took a short lead in upper stretch and held gamely
under a drive to the line. SENSIBLE MOVE dueled into the first turn then cleared around the bend, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from the
winner on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch but stayed on well from inside to prove second best. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL broke a bit slow, settled
near the back, swung five wide leaving the far turn, rallied and edged TIZ MY PRINCESS for the show. TIZ MY PRINCESS broke a step slow, traveled in
mid-pack on the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch then moved out further and got outfinished for the show. SHEZ OUR ARCH unhurried in the
beginning in the two path, saved ground along the rail on the far turn and improved posiiton. BIG ATTRACTION settled in mid-pack outside a rival, tipped
out at the quarter pole and exited the bend three to four wide and could not rally. MENSA ON TAP tracked the pace on the inside to the stretch and
weakened. CATALON broke slow, checked off heels nearing the first turn, chased from inside then moved out some in the stretch and weakened. LADY
SASSAFRAS had early speed, dueled outside a rival but was pulling the rider along while tossing her head into the first turn, continued to fight while chasing
the leader around that bend, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, dropped back while urged along on the far turn, went two to three wide into the
stretch and tired.
