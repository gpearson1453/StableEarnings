Footnotes
MOON SECRET raced three wide early, moved up four wide on the backside, made a three wide run into contention on the turn, rallied outside of BENNY'S
FIDDLE entering the stretch, dug in gamely through the final furlong and was just up at the wire. BENNY'S FIDDLE bobbled at the break, set the pace in the
two path, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely inside of MOON SECRET, dueled to the wire and just
missed. ICE BAR raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and closed belatedly on the rail. TOUCH OF A BUZZ stalked between rivals,
chased three wide on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. ALMOND CIDER tracked close up early on the inside, chased inside on the far
turn and faded. OUTSTANDING ISLAND stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn and faded. REGAL EMPIRE raced two wide off the pace and did
not factor.

when asked, drew off in the lane and was ridden out. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, was
no match for the winner and well clear for place honors. HOT AND HEAVY raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened in
the stretch. COX'S LEDGE raced three wide off the pace, dropped back on the backside and did not factor. MATTY'S EXPRESS hopped at the start, raced

Footnotes
CALIENTE RUM pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid on the turn, led into the stretch, responded, drew clear and widened under energetic
handling. GET GROOVY chased outside a rival, bid three wide on the turn, rallied outside and finished well for second. POSTINO'S CHAMPION raced
three wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and earned the show spot. POMTINI set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner
on the turn and weakened. RACHEL CAROLINE broke a step slow, was outrun early, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and closed belatedly outside.
CANOOCHEE raced off the pace between rivals, lacked a rally and tired. WICKED JANE raced off the pace inside, rode the rail into the stretch and failed to
threaten. YOUR PAL chased close up inside, chased on the turn and faded.
