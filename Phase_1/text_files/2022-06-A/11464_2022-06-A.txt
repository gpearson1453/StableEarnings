Footnotes
ANGELAS PARTY GIRL was slow to start and trailed early, still trailed when roused from the three path rounding the far turn, floated into the six path for a
clear run in the stretch, and rallied down the center to win. NEXT EPISODE missed the break but stalked in the three path, made a sweeping bid three wide
around the turn, took a slight lead at the top of the stretch, drifted in around the eight pole, and was rundown in closing stages to place. JESSICA'S RACE
led inside, was roused while maintaining an inside position rounding the turn, steadied slightly at the eighth pole, but held show. LUCKY FREEDOM tracked
from two path, raced in the two path around the turn, tipped into the five path for the stretch, but finished evenly. PARISIAN SUMMER pressed while two
wide, was driven between foes around the turn, but was empty. THE RIDER OF Jessica's Race CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF Next Episode
FOR INTERFERNCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

MOON BIZ led throughout, was coaxed midway around the turn, and held gamely. WHAT'S COOKIN prompted the pace three wide, raced two wide around
the turn, and held place. BELLSWILLBERINGING tracked from the two path, was hustled in the three path coming into the stretch, and ran on between to
show. SUZY Q THE QUEEN chased in the four path, was driven three wide around the turn, tipped four wide into the stretch, but finished evenly.
CHEROKEE PARTY stalked inside, was cued inside around the turn, but flattened. MS BOOMBASTIC trailed in the three path, was in the six path around
the turn, and was no threat. SUNDAY SWAGGER was well back and inside but was no factor. LADY TIZMO pressed between foes but was done rounding
the turn.

stretch, but yielded. AWARD NOMINATED prompted the pace two wide, was coaxed two wide around the far turn, but faded. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT

TWITTY CITY chased in the two path, made progress between rounding the far turn, took the lead and opened up into the stretch, and just held.

inside, was hustled in the four path rounding the far turn, floated into the five path entering the stretch, and ran on. TITAN'S WILL prompted the pace
between foes, took the lead two wide rounding the far turn, but faded in the stretch. HAYNE'S FEVER tracked in the three path, was ridden from the four
path around the far turn, but was no factor. PRIVATE NETWORK was sent to the lead in the two path, but yielded around the turn. ACOSTA vied for the
lead inside but backed out coming into the far turn.

MY FLICKER stalked in the three path, made a sweeping bid three wide rounding the turn, took the lead and opened up down the stretch. ILLUSION OF
HOPE tracked inside, was hustled inside around the turn, and ran on for place. MI YAYIS prompted the pace from inside, was steadied while moving
outwards around the five sixteenths pole, drifted into the five path into the stretch, and held show. ANOTHER FLIRT was slow into stride, was hustled inside
around the turn, and improved position. ONE PAIR OF HANDS chased while two wide, was driven two wide around the turn, but finished evenly.
MAJESTIC'S GIRL raced off the pace in the three path, drifted in to the seven path into the stretch, and was empty. KARATS AND GOLD set the pace but
yielded at the top of the lane. MISS STREET rated in the four path but was done early.
