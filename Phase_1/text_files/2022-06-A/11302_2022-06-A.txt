EXTREME FORCE engaged in a heated duel outside, shook loose from that challenge then edged away through the final furlong. SOPHOS ducked out at
the break then angled inside and closed well late. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD raced outside in the second flight and flattened out in the stretch. CRAFTY JACK
vied with the winner outside then proved empty in the final furlong. POLITICAL dwelt at the start and raced far behind throughout. S MAN dropped far
behind after the start and was never in contention. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

Footnotes
MY TRAIN quickly sprinted clear, had his advantage narrowed near midstretch then drew away again driving. TACTICAL PLAN rated outside, advanced
wide on the final turn and was up for place. SUPER DUDE moved between rivals on the final turn then flattened out. HOORAY FOR HARVEY raced three
wide in striking range and continued willingly. THE ANGRY MAN saved ground then faded after five furlongs. IN EQUALITY saved ground far behind and
was never a factor. OPEN LENGTHS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and faded. KOAN chased very wide and trailed throughout.

DATA DEAL pursued the loose pacesetter, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drew off under moderate coaxing. D BLACK MAMBA raced very wide
and continued well to just gain the place. STASH MY CASH saved ground early, moved out in the stretch and was edged for the place. WORLD REGARD
raced in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. ISSUING JUSTICE quickly moved clear, was collared midway on the turn and gave way. SWEET
PARI dropped far behind near the inside and had no response. ALIGNMENT trailed much of the trip then caught a fading rival. CALLMETHEBREEZE
lacked speed along the inside and gave way.

STRAIGHT SHOT dueled outside, shook off rival at the quarter pole, moved clear, was challenged again but held on gamely. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS
between rivals early, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. RACK GIN dropped back outside, advanced very wide on
the turn and finished willingly. CANT STOP THIS MAN vied inside the winner for half a mile and weakened. FIVE DREAMS chased close up outside then
faded after half a mile. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. SUPER JOHN was coaxed close up early then stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR rated close up outside, bid into the stretch then prevailed following a long drive in a blanket finish. GREAT IDEA firmly restrained
inside early, was blocked near midstretch then split foes rallying too late. KENNER dueled outside, led before three quarters, was collared again and
continued willingly to the finish. KID BOURBON broke a step slowly, settled inside, made a menacing wide bid then flattened out. SAINT MARCO rated
within range in the two path then went evenly late. BEACH BANDIT angled inside trailing the field and never menaced. NORTHERN EXPRESS dropped far
behind and was never in contention. GOGEES set a pressured pace inside to the quarter pole and faltered through the stretch.

stretch but was outfinished late. MAGICAL ANNA vied along the inside and continued willingly to the finish. KENAI COOL dueled outside to midstretch then
weakened slightly. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE broke slowly, chased near the inside and lacked a solid response. HOLA PRINCESS lacked speed and was never
in contention. CREEDIBILITY raced far behind throughout. WEST HORIZEN dropped back early and was always outrun. PER RULING FROM THE
PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, KENAI COOL WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
