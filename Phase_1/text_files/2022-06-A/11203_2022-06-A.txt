Footnotes
ROYAL TO BE was off to an awkward start and trailed early, moved off the inside and into the five path, was behind a wall approaching the half-mile pole,
moved to the two path for room, gained momentum into the turn, guided from the two to the four path through the turn while moving up, continued with
momentum into the lane while in the four path, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and drew clear while patiently handled throughout. SISTER
JUSTICE chased the pace along the inside through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, got nearest the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, could not gain
on that one and settled for second best. PRIME N PROPER was in the three to the two path through the turn when close up, continued in the two path into
the lane and gained the show spot. STORMY'S HERO was away alertly to gain the lead at once, raced on a clear pace into the lane, was caught by the
winner just inside the eighth pole and lost the show spot late. SHARP JUSTICE raced in the six to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the
five path and lacked a closing response. JUSTA DOLL raced in the two path through the turn when not far back, angled into the six path for the drive and
tired. SHES MY TREASURE raced in the two path through the turn, guided to the seven path for the drive and never was a menace. EMBROILED was
outrun while in the two path. FLASHY BELLE steadily faded while in the three path.
