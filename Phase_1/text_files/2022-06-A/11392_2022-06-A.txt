Footnotes
VEGAS MAGIC pressed three deep early, lost a bit of ground on the turn while remaining close, re-bid outside the top pair past the quarter pole, gained the
upper-hand nearing the sixteenth pole and edged away to prove best. SMOKIN CHEENA broke out then sped to the front, led early between rivals then vied
for command around the turn and into the stretch, held a short lead into the final furlong, overtaken with a sixteenth to go and stayed on to the wire. HALF
NELSON broke a step slow in the beginning, went up to challenge from inside, held a narrow advantage over outside pair through the turn, relinquished the
lead in upper stretch and flattened late. LT'S CHOICE chased along the inside to the turn, dropped back and steered five wide around the bend and lacked
a rally. CAHUILLA was off a bit slow from outside, tracked three deep into the turn, went four wide around the bend and weakened. SHE'S SO FANCY
broke slow and lost her path at the start, went between runners while moving into range, traveled a bit off the rail on the turn and weakened.

WITH THIS VOW stumbled slightly leaving the gate, set the pace on the inside, felt a bit of pressure on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew
away under right-handed urging and strong handling late. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT shifted out leaving the gate, stalked the lone leader from inside,
saved ground and was under a ride on the far turn, stayed along the fence in the lane and bested the rest. MIA AT MIDNIGHT rated early then stalked
outside a rival in the two path, moved out a bit and rounded the far turn three wide, summoned a mild response and got up for the show. SKY ON ICE
closest in the early going from the two path, asked two then three wide on the far turn applying a bit of pressure past the quarter pole, failed to kick on with
the winner in upper stretch and flattened late. KEEP DANCING was off a bit slow from outside, lagged behind early while moving to the inside, trailed to the
stretch and never got involved.

PRIANO away quickly from outside, took hold briefly early while moving down to the two path and lost command, regained the lead nearing the
nine-sixteenths pole, cleared RIVER TIBER around the turn, put to right-handed urging in upper stretch and held CONUNDRUM at bay. CONUNDRUM
broke a step slow, stalked the pace outside a rival, went between foes nearing the quarter pole, entered the stretch three wide, drifted inward in the lane and
could not get by the winner. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER stalked along the rail, coaxed around the turn and two wide into the stretch, got floated in a bit in the
lane and flattened in deep stretch. RIVER TIBER had his path taken by PRIANO early, moved out to a clear path and was sent to take the lead briefly, lost
command approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, kept the pressure on to the turn, lost touch around the bend and got fanned four wide into the stretch, then
tired in the lane.

STORMING LADY bobbled then got bumped from outside at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground along the inside through the turn, tipped outside
with a furlong remaining, drew alongside DANCING CRANE at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. DANCING CRANE sped to the front from inside, cleared
rival at the five-sixteenths pole, led into deep stretch and could not offer any resistance to the winner late. MISS CAROUSEL broke a step slow, stalked from
inside then angled three wide leaving the turn, failed to find the needed late kick in the final furlong but held the show. READY JET GO chased outside a
rival then two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the late stages. LA V. got knocked into inner rival
leaving the gate, sat off the pace early on, went three then two wide on the turn and lacked a rally. ANGELCENTS shifted in and bumped LA V. at the start,
went up to press the pace from outside, lost touch midway through the turn, chased two wide into the stretch, got crowded between rivals at the eighth pole
and weakened.

Footnotes
GOOD VIBES ONLY raced up close early, pressed the leader from outside then took over midway around the turn, cleared nearing the quarter pole and
held safely under a drive. GERLACH'S was off a bit slow to begin, tracked from inside then tipped two wide around the turn, found the rail in the stretch and
rallied to gain the place. ROOKIE MISTAKE was off a bit slow to begin, chased off the pace, rounded the turn four wide, came out a bit further at the top of
the stretch and got outkicked for the place. GOLD RUSH CANDY broke a step slow, moved into range, took the turn three wide and flattened to fourth. BIG
HAND sat off the pace early on, traveled outside a rival then two wide into the turn, got put in a bit tight between rivals past the quarter pole, exited the bend
three wide and lacked a rally. SQUALOTORO was off a bit slow, trailed up the backstretch, navigated the turn five wide and failed to menace. STIR THE
POT sped to the front from the rail, got pressured leaving the backstretch, relinquished command near the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up late on the
turn, tired in the stretch and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CONNIE SWINGLE sent from the gate and quickly took control, got pressured briefly then cleared and moved to the two path, showed the way three wide
into the stretch, drifted inward and widened in the final furlong. ROSE DAWSON was off slow to begin, reserved in the early going while moving to the inside
for the turn, came out crossing the dirt, drifted inward in upper stretch and was quickly corrected, then continued to drifted in more while closing for second.
LEXINGTON HUMOR broke a bit slow, showed brief speed then dropped to a stalking position, entered the turn between rivals, roused while shifted out
crossing the turn, was closest to the leader entering the final furlong, could not make any headway late and got edged for the place. TAPIT DOUX dropped
back early, went three wide into the turn, drifted out crossing the dirt, gained a minor award but failed to threaten. BLUSHING (FR) was off a bit slow,
reserved in the early stages, traveled two then three wide around the turn and failed to respond in the drive. HALF PAST TWELVE pressed the winner
briefly from inside early then chased that rival along the rail into the turn, exited the bend two wide and faded. UNBRIDLED MARY stalked three deep into
the turn, got floated out crossing over the dirt and weakened.

Footnotes
HOPPER sped to the front from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, put to right-handed urging approaching the eighth pole and drew off under strong
handling. HIGH CONNECTION stalked four then three wide around the first turn, asked three wide on the second bend, could not threaten the winner in the
stretch run but edged DOPPELGANGER for the place honors. DOPPELGANGER raced up close outside HOPPER early, chased under urging two wide on
the far turn, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was overtaken for second in the final sixteenth. PIONEERING PAPA came out at the start,
trailed five then four wide on the clubhouse turn, remained wide through the middle stages, rounded the far turn four then three wide, eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
PARNELLI stalked a bit off the rail around the first turn, traveled along the inside into the far turn, steered out to the four path with a quarter mile left to run,
rallied to the front at the top of the stretch, kicked clear from inner trio and drew away. EXTRA HOPE broke the gate open, was backed out then reloaded,
went up to duel from inside early, vied with a pair rivals past the half-mile pole, fought from the rail through the second bend and kept on through the final
furlong to best the rest. ARKAAN sped to the front then dueled outside EXTRA HOPE early on, vied between rivals into and around the second bend,
flattened in the final furlong but churned on for the show. AFFABLE stalked three wide early, drew alongside the top pair on the backstretch, vied three while
taking a short lead around the far turn, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened late. HUDSON RIDGE stumbled leaving the gate, chased four
wide on the clubhouse turn, went three wide into the second bend, tired approaching the quarter pole and came five wide into the stretch and was not
persevered with. BOLD ENDEAVOR went four then five wide on the first turn, trailed four wide into the second bend, exited seven wide and had little left for
the drive.

BUSKER ALLIE was off a bit slow to begin, lacked room at the three-eighths pole, angled out on the turn then swung six wide into the stretch, drifted inward
while closing fast and proved best in the end. TRUE PATRIOT chased off the rail, drifted in and bumped rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, raced between
rivals then tipped four wide around the turn, rallied down the lane but outclosed by the winner. I'LL TAKE THE SOUP stalked the pace from inside, waited
for room around the turn, continued behind rivals in upper stretch, found an opening at the eighth pole, split foes but got bumped between late but still rallied
to gain the show. IT'S GREEK TO ME dueled for the lead early then cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the stretch, resisted to the
sixteenth pole, then yielded while getting bumped late. GRAZEN TOUCH dueled for command early then chased leaving the backstretch, driven two wide
into the lane, re-bid outside the leader in upper stretch, drifted in and bumped late and could not find the needed late kick. MAGIC GAME stalked the pace
outside a rival then between foes, got shuffled back a bit entering the turn, lacked room around the bend and upper stretch, then kept on once finding a
clear path but was unable to threaten. AIRKITA was off a bit slow and brushed rival at the start, had to steadied early then got bumped at the
seven-sixteenths pole, angled four wide around the turn, moved out further in the stretch and lacked a bid. ROUBAIX forwardly placed in the early going,
stalked outside rivals to the turn, chased three deep around the bend, put in a bid in upper stretch but weakened late. DIALING SCOTTY broke a step slow,
jumped crossing the dirt, got bumped at the seven-sixteenths pole, lacked room into and around the turn and upper stretch and could not rally after gaining
a clear path. KOKO'S MOM settled early well off the rail, took the turn four then five wide and weakened. TRULY A MESS had her head turned as the gate
opened and came away slow, traveled along the inside then had to check hard at the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and never made an impact.
GALARINA hit the gate then brushed with rival at the start, raced three deep at back early on, went four wide around the turn, came up empty and was not
persevered with late. HAND-TIMED.
