GODDESS OF WONDER broke alertly and trekked the two path around the bend while closely in pursuit of leader, was asked for run at upper stretch and
rallied in final furlong for the score. SAVE A PENNY rushed away at the start and set the pace from between rivals, tucked to rail around the bend, had the
slightest of advantages at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the rallying rival in final sixteenth. DA DYNASTY DIVA hustled from outset to press the
pace as the inner most rival of three abreast, then broke stride at the quarter pole and was eased.

WIREWIREWIRE rushed form outset and gained early command, set the pace in concert with HIGH CLASS EURO while travelling along the inside, then
drew off in final furlong for a clear victory. HIGH CLASS EURO hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem while trekking the two path around all bends
and held off the rallying rivals in final furlong to secure the place honors. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN trekked the three path early on while settling into the
second flight, swung to three wide at upper stretch, and produced a mild rally to be photoed out of the place. TAKE CHARGE GAL settled along the inside,
gave chase to pacesetters from the second flight, and finished willingly to be gaining at the finish. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL was unhurried in the early going
and trailed the field through all calls before gaining mildly in the final strides.

TOMMYHAWK stalked the early pacesetter from a three path stance, advanced along the backstretch by circling the leaders three wide, then finished under
a stiff drive for the score. SHIPMAN'S SONG rushed from outset to gain first command, led the field through the half, but couldnt fend off the late charge of
eventual winner inside the quarter pole. MEGA BOND loomed boldly and led the second flight through the first turn while saving ground, advanced on
pacesetter and made a bold bid at the quarter pole from between foes, and was outfinished in the final furlong. REMEMBER ME TONY settled in behind
front runners along the inside, saved ground throughout and finished evenly. MEAN CANNON lacked a needed rally after trailing the field from outset.

Footnotes
POKER PLAY rushed from outset and led every call without relishing command while kicking clear for a gate to wire score. SWAY BACK WHEN tucked
behind the early pacesetter to save ground, closed the gap on leader along the backstretch, and finished a clear second, but was no match in for winner.
PARABELLUM was reserved in the opening half while travelling wide and rallied mid track for the show. BONES BRUIN was unhurried through the opening
half and trailed the field before closing with a rush to improve placing. GOLDEN ZIP pushed the pace from a three wide stance then faded in the final
quarter of a mile. ROWDY GALE lacked a serious bid after giving chase from mid pack and saving ground in the late stages. SEEK FIRST retreated rapidly
in final furlong after pressing the early pace from a two path pose. KICK IT AGAIN BOB failed to threaten while travelling a wide journey from a back rated
stance.

Footnotes
CHARING CROSS settled into second flight and trekked the inside shortly after the start, angled out along the backstretch and reeled in the front runners
with a rally, then gained command in the homestretch and drifted inward in the final sixteenth. SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN hustled away from outset to share
early lead, trekked the two path between rivals around the first bend, assumed an inside pose through the final turn, led the field at the tp of the stretch and
checked near the wire to avoid rallying foe. VISONARY STAR came up empty in the final furlong after trekking three wide early and rating within striking
distance at upper stretch. GRUFFANDTOUGH showed reserve in the early going while travelling a wide route before improving position in crucial stages
with a mild rally. BEAR DEN settled between rivals through the first turn, angled in to save ground around the final bend, and finished willingly. JUST
BECAUSEWAY trailed the field from outset and passed a tiring foe in late strides to end a ground saving trip. LEDOUX WHAT IT DO tired and faded rapidly
after flashing early speed and sharing early command as the inner most rival of three abreast.

Footnotes
CRAZY LOVER gained command at first stride, established a ground saving stance and held off all rivals for a gate to wire score. BLUEGRASS BREEZE
pressed the pace three wide around the opening bend, rated close up along the backstretch but was unable to catch leader in final furlong. OCTAGON
finished with a strong late kick to secure the show after stalking the front runner from a ground saving pose. NORTHERN ORBIT settled in between rivals
while giving chase to pacesetter from the second flight, swung wide at upper stretch and finished with best stride late to be gaining at the finish. LANGMEAD
lacked a closing bid and faded in crucial stages to end a four wide journey. WEST COAST CHROME was unhurried in the early stages and lost ground to
front runners with a wide trip. CASTLEBERRY failed to menace from a back rated stance. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY trekked the three path and posed no
threat.
