Footnotes
MOMENT TO DREAM moved up to take control after an even break, showed the way into the turn closest to the inside, dueled, shook clear when
straightened for home, held that same foe safe late under continued steady handling. CITIZENS REWARD pressed early off the inside, dueled outside the
winner in the two path through the turn, fell back off the winner in losing some ground to that one into the lane, chased to the wire, second best. MEAN
AMERICAN broke well, fell back off the pacesetters early, remained in the second flight while saving ground through the turn, modest late gain on the top
two late up the rail while finishing on equal terms for the show. BETISON back off the pace and the inside, raced in the second flight through the turn, also
managed some modest gain on the top pair late. BOSTON LUCILLE fell back to trail, raced widest through the stretch, went evenly late in lacking a closing
punch. TRICKY MOM forwardly placed while racing in the two path, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR LOKI pressed early inside, remained closest to the leader after moving to that one's outside, continued to apply pressure into the lane,
engaged that same foe and wore him down under steady handling. THATSAFACTJACK broke on top, showed the way early off the inside, cleared midway
up the backstretch, showed the way through the turn, responded when the winner came alongside upper straight, gave ground grudgingly to that rival,
remained well clear for the place,. X CLOWN in the second flight off the inside, three wide exiting the turn, proved no match for the top two the final furlong,
proved determined for the show. HOORAY AUSTIN well back off the early pace, two path turn, between rivals into the lane, outkicked for the show spot
while also not a threat to the top pair. SPANKHURST fell back to trail after the start, came four wide for the drive, some modest late interest while widest,
not enough for the show. CLASSY JOHN forwardly placed early along the inside, continued to save ground in the turn, weakened steadily through the
stretch.

the final turn, extended drive, fully extended to prove best. MY REBEL GIRL lacked speed, raced four wide onto the backstretch, also remained well wide in
the run up the backstretch, moved closer to the front outside the winner in the second bend, vied with that one late, outkicked. HUSHED COURT ROOM
dueled early off the inside, edged clear just before a half, showed the way into and through the final turn, responded when confronted by the top two with a
furlong remaining closest to the inside, faltered late. SHOP AROUND prompted the issue early just off the inside, challenged between rivals second bend,
faltered through the stretch. PARTY WITH KASSIDY last away, five wide through the first turn when trailing well back, continued to lag and was once again
five wide through the second turn, came up empty when asked for the drive. MISSGREELEY'SSONG dueled early along the inside, began a steady fade

Footnotes
CHANNEL WON moved up to take command along the inside after the start, continued to show the way along the rail turn, shook clear in upper straight,
maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under a steady right handed crop. CHIMNEY ROCK broke sharp and outward to bother SMARTY GRIMES a
bit, vied four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, could do little with the winner through the stretch, clear for the place. LOUISIANA HERO lacked early foot,
rail trip through the turn, angled out in upper straight, rallied steadily to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. HALF OURS N STORMY pressured the
winner while outside that one for three furlongs and then had little left for the stretch run. SMARTY GRIMES bothered a bit at the start to be last away, raced
back, never menaced. WHENTHEDOVESCRY pressed the issue early in the three path, gave way midway on the turn. TAPPIN FORA DANCE fell back to
trail after the start, pulled up turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
SABER CUT broke on top, cleared to the inside, set a soft set of fractions, continued to show the way into the lane narrowly, headed a furlong out, found
more late to battle back, dug in late to narrowly prevail. TECATE TIME settled behind the pace, tipped out three wide turning for home when called on for
some run, challenged outside the winner nearing the furlong grounds, put a head in front, dueled to the wire, outkicked. SAVVY SHIPMAN unhurried off the
inside, swung out five wide into the lane when beginning a modest rally, continued to show limited interest and was clear for the show while not a threat to
the top two. SMOK'N RITA last away, moved outside onto the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, improved position while not a serious threat.
CRIMSON FELINE in mid pack off the rail, advanced and lodged a brief bid while four wide and outside the runner up entering the stretch, flattened out.
EXPLOSIVELY HOT closest to the leader in the two path, dueled into and through the final turn, caved in readily down the lane.

Footnotes
BINDING AGREEMENT outrun early in the three path after being the last to leave, dropped inside when advancing late in the turn under clever handling,
steered back out when straightened for home, set down, kicked down the leader to prove best. ROCKY BAR SIX broke alertly, soon got clear, set the pace
along the inside, remained clear past the furlong marker, caught in the late going while remaining well clear for the second spot. TACTICAL PRIORITY in
the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, lost considerable ground to the top two as those were saving ground into the lane, staged a mild rally to
annex the show. PAPA BRO chased the runner up while racing off the inside, had little left for the final furlong, outkicked for the show. RUNAWAY TRACY
broke back, trailed early while in hand and three wide, improved position through the lane while not a serious threat. BUNKIE'S SONG made little impact
while saving ground. DESIARD forwardly placed while racing between foes, began a steady fade before three furlongs. CHASIN GRACIE a bit rank at the
start, remained back while racing four wide.

Footnotes
INTIMIDATION unhurried early inside, moved closer into the far turn, covered up in traffic along the rail late in that bend, asked for run when clear upper
stretch, split foes to put a head in front past the furlong marker, strongly clear. GUNNER PAUL allowed the pace to go early while three wide, fell further
back off the two leaders early backstretch, advanced into contention while still three wide in the second turn, roused, late push to be up for the place in the
final strides. FLAT OUT AMERICAN away best of all, rated while showing the way up the backstretch inside, continued to lead into the lane, responded
when asked for more nearing midstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner then could not keep up, caught late for the runner up position. QUARTER
RAT four wide into the first turn, lacked speed, moved closer while once again four wide into the stretch, within striking distance while widest past the furlong
marker, went flat late. ALL MIKE NO MAE chased the leader while well out in the strip for six furlongs then faltered in the drive. THUNDER ROAD last away,
trailed throughout and never menaced.

Footnotes
KILLINGSWORTH broke well, raced forwardly while allowing the leader to go before quarter, took over from that one before a half, two path far turn, got out
to be four wide into the lane while leading by daylight, remained clear to the wire under steady handling. VERDUNVILLE lacked speed, moved closer while
in the two path turning for home, clearly second best while unable to make inroads on the winner. PA PI lacked speed, came well off the inside for the drive,
drifted out in upper stretch, late push for the show spot. KANNON WITH A K prompted the issue early, saved ground when moving a bit closer in the final
turn, flattened out in the drive then fell apart late along the inside, caught for the place. WILDCARD GOLD void of speed, moved slightly closer while saving
ground turning for home, flattened out in the drive. HUDSON HOP last away, lacked speed, four wide through the first turn, continued wide, four to five wide
second turn, nothing left, jogged in. YANKEE HAIL CAT used early on the outside to make the early advantage, headed before a half, stopped, also jogged
in. ALL STAR SPECIAL fell back to trail, far back, distanced, walked in.
