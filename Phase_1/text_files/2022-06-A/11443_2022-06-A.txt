to settle, rallied through the stretch five wide and got up for second. GRINS N' WINS never far back, moved up along the rail into the stretch then leveled off.
DANCIN' ROSIE chased the winner and was outfinished three wide. FRONT CIRCLE moved up four wide on the turn and into the stretch then failed to
sustain that bid. OPULENT reared and stumbled at the start, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. CONGRATS JENSEN chased the winner two then three

couldn't handle the winner. WARRIOR'S DREAM stalked the early pace, rallied four wide to make the lead into the far turn, set the pace to the top of the
stretch then was outfinished. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX was hustled along, pressed the pace along the rail around the first turn, made the lead briefly, had
speed into the stretch then weakened. ZITMAN failed to menace. SMASH set the early pace two wide and was through after a half. SILVER G T O was

Footnotes
RAGAZZO never far back, saved ground through the turn, shifted outside the leader, dug in determinedly in the six path late and got up in the final strides.
BABA LOOEY bumped at the start, pressed the pace along the rail, made the lead on the turn, edged clear and just missed hanging on. MARCH MAGIC
bumped at the start and had a mild late rally mid track. RUNAWAY RUSSELL had good early speed three wide, steadied nearing the turn then, faded.
BRILLIANTBENNY wouldn't load, was outrun early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. MY HOMBRE bumped at the start, set the early pace four then
three wide into the turn then weakened. BIG TIME FLIRT bumped at the start and was no threat. JOHNS BIG RED hopped at the start and was outrun.
VOLUMATTIC pressed the early pace two wide then stopped.
