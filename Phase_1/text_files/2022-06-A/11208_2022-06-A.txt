LIL'S TURN reserved inside, angled out on the final turn, split foes in the final furlong and edged clear late. CAPOEIRA prompted the pace outside, led
briefly into the stretch and continued gamely to the finish. CHEEKY PINT ducked out at the break, raced close up in the two path and finished willingly.
AMI'S LINK settled inside the pacesetters, was asked for run at the far turn but flattened out. FLAT OUT VIXEN steadied soon after the start and trailed then
offered some late energy outside. ANITA GRIGIO lunged at the break, set a clear pace in hand, was collared at the quarter pole and came up empty in the
stretch.

Footnotes
SASSY MARTINI chased the speed outside ,took command middle of the turn, and was game down the stretch to hold off challengers. ALPHA MIA sat
behind dueling pacesetters, roused three wide entering the stretch, was game but could not overtake the winner. VESPOLINA was near the rear early, three
path turn, in range turning for home and was outfinished for place. DEJAS TOO trailed in the early stages, rallied belatedly on the inside for a minor share.
KHOZZY VALINTINE showed early speed, collared around the turn, fought back briefly and lost position final sixteenth. KERICS BEAUTY was rated down
the backside, roused three wide on the turn, drifted in down the stretch while urged left handed. GORMLEY GIRL was rated mid field early, asked on the
turn and had no response.

Footnotes
FOREST DRIFT broke alertly then angled in controlling the pace in hand, widened in the final eighth under moderate urging. SPARKLE SAMMY pursued
inside early, angled out on the turn, rallied but was no match for the winner. DANCING DOLL raced close up outside, loomed a threat into the stretch but
flattened out. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD raced wide throughout, offered a mild rally into the stretch and faded. FIVE DAYS IN MAY trailed far behind then
caught a fading opponent late. GOLDEN GARTER was rated along the inside through the opening half mile then faltered.

BORN TO BE GOOD far back early, angled out and rallied four wide on the final turn and into the stretch, bid clear and lasted. ERASMO'S GIRL settled well
behind, angled out and followed the winner then made gradual gain too late. ADMONISH trailed early inside, continued on the rail, moved wide into the
stretch and was up for show. JOLENE JOLENE raced within range in the two path and lacked a rally. POOLSIDE MANNERS sluggish early, rushed wide to
contention, stalked the pacesetter then faded in the stretch. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA saved ground just off the leaders and weakened. ALLURING MEG
stalked inside, made a menacing rail bid on the final turn then stopped in the stretch. DICTATE set a clear pace under rating, was collared on the final turn
then gave way readily.

TOTAL BETTY led briefly then pursued the pacesetter, bid into the stretch, continued well in a game try. BLUE TWIRLIN took over after the quarter, moved
clear under rating, led to the stretch weakened. TARA LUNA chased three wide off the leaders, bid on the final turn then went evenly late. ROOKIE COURT
settled outside the pacesetters, was asked for run after the half then faded. SALADA lacked speed along the inside and was never in contention. BELLE
FEMME dropped back early and was always outrun. FACE OF INTEGRITY lagged far behind losing contact with her field and was eased in the stretch.

HUNT MASTER was rated early on, in range through the turn, angled outside through the stretch and got up in the final strides. UNCLE JOE set the pace
early, took command through the turn and fought hard but just could not hold off the winner. POSEIDON STEEL bobbled soon after the break ,trailed
backstretch, was roused on the turn rallying past horses but could not catch the front pair. Clear third. LUCYS CHILD was mid pack early on, roused and
passed tiring rivals through the stretch. KIDDIE HOLIDAY broke inwards at the start, was asked in the turn and never reached contention. ROMANTIC
GAMBLE stalked the early pacesetters, was in contention on the turn and early stretch and offered little down the lane. SOUPER PRONTO showed early
speed, pressed the pace while inside and gave way the final eighth.

Footnotes
ARRA GO WAN broke alertly and was eager to go on early, took over before half a mile, moved clear, widened in the stretch and just lasted. VENENOSA
pursued the pacesetter inside, bid in the two path on the final turn then made a gradual late gain. SMARTY ILLUSION moved closer between rivals into the
far turn then flattened out in the stretch. TENPENNY NAIL lacked speed, advanced wide on the final turn and into stretch and faded. MOON POOL wide on
the first turn, bid on the final turn, moved extremely wide into the lane. STOLE THE RING chased within striking range early then faltered. DAISY DANGLES
prompted the pace early, pursued the winner then gave way. SHE'S SO COLD dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.
