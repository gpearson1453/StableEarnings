Footnotes
ARTORIUS showed speed between horses then was taken under a snug hold and rated just off the pace, raced inside to the two path while in dead-aim of
the leaders around the turn, was roused while given room in the two path into the stretch, made a bid between foes at the three-sixteenths then took a short
lead, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong handling. GASOLINE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two
to three path around the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was put to a drive, lost the advantage to the winner outside eighth-pole, fought on well
outside that foe in the final furlong and missed while well clear for the place. WINIT was recalcitrant behind the gate and difficult to load, raced off the pace
under restraint, moved out around the five-eighths, was let out in the four to five path around the turn, gained to make a bid under strong urging at the
quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. EXACT ESTIMATE went to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside of the runner-up while along the rail on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and tired.
SHREVEPORT broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, moved out around the five-eighths then was forced
out more, dropped in near the nine-sixteenths, was roused while three then four wide around the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in some in
the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to threaten. COMMANDPERFORMANCE was urged early then settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two
path while hard ridden, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond. WARRIOR NATION was asked leaving the gate, tracked the pace on
the outside, chased three to four wide through the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFIA came away alertly and went straight to the front, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down at the
quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, continued on her inside lead to the wire and held off the
fast closing runner-up under strong urging. OBLIGATORY was away in good order then coaxed to establish position just off the pace, saved ground while
put to stronger encouragement around the turn, turned into the stretch under a right-handed crop, moved out in pursuit of the winner into the final furlong,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and finished fast but was too late while far clear for the place. GLASS CEILING was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, moved up to press the leader on the outside then dropped back off the pace with five furlongs to run, was guided around the
turn with extra left-rein pressure while three then two wide, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. EASY TO BLESS broke awkwardly and was off
slow, spotted the front runner a few lengths, moved up on the outside with five furlongs to run, was asked while vying four then three wide around the turn,
dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and had nothing left.

Footnotes
MESSIDOR (IRE) broke a step slow, angled in towards the rear of the field then settled comfortably while last but one, went around the turn in the two path,
was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into upper stretch then rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole
and held off the runner-up under strong urging. ZAINALARAB was reserved under stout restraint while tugging keenly at the bit, went around the turn in the
two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, moved out near the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and missed but was clear for the place.
READY TO VENTURE (GB) was rated just off the pace on the inside, shifted three wide late on the turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, gained to
take the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while able to get the show. MISS DRACARYS broke out at the start,
settled under some restraint, was roused while two to three wide around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and
lacked the needed kick. STOP WAR went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside to the two path around the turn, was asked
nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. TASS angled in towards the back then
settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two to three path around the turn and failed to threaten. SCREAMIN' BY stalked the pace on the outside,
was asked on the turn, chased two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. ATHWAAQ broke out at the start, was reserved on the outside, went four then
three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and was no factor. FOUZIA was rated on the outside while tugging at the bit, came under urging
late on the backstretch, chased three to four wide on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. INAJIFFY
was slowest into stride, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn and showed little.

YARROW lunged slightly at the break, settled in pursuit two then three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to offer up a good finish closing stoutly in tandem with FEATHERS ROAD to engulf the leader in the final strides and was just
up to prevail. FEATHERS ROAD just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
offered up a good finish to close in on the leader in concert with the aforementioned foe and just missed at the end. BUILT TO LAST showed the way in
hand three then two wide through swift splits, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under threat and was nailed in the final jumps by pair and forced to settle for the show honors. DREAMPOINT saved ground near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, closed well to finish to get up for the last major share on the wire.
HEYMACKIT'SJACK stumbled at the start and was bumped by FULL COMPLEMENT, who broke inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was out-finished. FUOCO just off the inside just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. BUSTIN UP chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FULL COMPLEMENT broke in at the start bumping
HEYMACKIT'SJACK, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
KINGSTOWN forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. DON BERNARDO broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS DIANE showed good speed, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole, extended the advantage in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop
outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under strong urging. JANE GREY was eased back then rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted
along the rail around the turn, was roused with clear room in the two path into the stretch, chased the winner under a strong drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while able to get the place. RUVIES IN TIME bumped with a foe at the start, was coaxed along just off the pace, raced in the two path
under a strong hold early on the turn, shifted four wide while asked with three furlongs to run, chased five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response but earned the show. BABA was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. AWILLAWAY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while four then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch and came up empty. FIGHT ON LUCY bumped the hindquarters of a foe at the start then was taken up with a tug of the left-rein, spotted the front a
few lengths, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
LOFT (GER) saved ground near the rear of the field along the hedge early on before tipping to the two path past the stands the initial time, remained
patiently handled until tipped out three to four wide near the three-eighths put to urging, offered up a strong move through the latter portion of the far turn
and went four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear to the finish to prevail. BRITISH ROYALTY struck the
near side stall at the start and ricocheted outwards bumping OUTBOX into STRONG TIDE, tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field early
on, came under coaxing at three furlongs from home and advanced to mid pack when swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
running on to just get up for the place honors in the very last jump to the wire. STRONG TIDE tracked along the inside from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to issue a challenge through the latter portion of the final turn and seized command before spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to the finish and was nailed for the place honors on the
line. CIBOLIAN saved ground in reserve in mid pack until called upon with five-sixteenths to run, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. ABAAN got away to a bit of a tangled start when breaking awkwardly outwards, showed the way rated along the inside under the watchful eye
of OUTBOX facing some pressure, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and shook off that escort and was confronted by STRONG TIDE, yielded the
front and cornered from the two path into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. BOX N SCORE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. OUTBOX (GB) got bumped between foes at the start and was
in behind rivals when coaxed along to be forwardly placed five wide in the early stages, went three wide through the first turn advancing to settle just off the
leader tucking to the two path past the stands the first time, got floated out briefly four wide five furlongs from home as ABAAN drifted briefly, came under
coaxing nearing the midway point on the final turn and was shaken off, swung three wide into upper stretch in retreat and faltered. NOVO SOL (BRZ) just off
the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, spun just off the inside for home, folded and was eased home to the finish.
Due to a teletimer malfunction the mile and one-quarter and mile and three-quarter splits were unavailable and the mile and one half split was hand timed.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S WARRIOR was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, moved up to dispute the pace on the outside, shook clear in the three path around the
turn, extended the advantage four wide into the stretch, powered away under mild hand-urging into the final furlong and was eased up in the final sixteenth
while much the best. SOUND MONEY tracked the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, was roused inside the three-eighths, chased
the winner five wide into the stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. WAR TOCSIN was away alertly, showed speed then was eased
back just off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened while just able to get the show. BABY YODA
bumped with a foe at the start then was pinched back between horses, settled near the back, was urged along while three then four wide around the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and just missed the show. MR PHIL disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped
back with three furlongs to run and tired. NIGHT TIME settled at the rear on the outside, was caught five wide early on the turn, dropped to the three path
later on that bend and had nothing left.

Footnotes
BLEECKER STREET settled unhurried just off the inside at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole,
angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close in stoutly outside rolling by the leader in the final forty yards to prevail under her own
momentum at the end. FAMILY WAY three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, remained on hold until set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, seized command straightened away for home, dug in under a drive under threat and was caught in the late stages while just preserving the place
honors. FLIGHTY LADY (IRE) coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along in the two path until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away, dug in under a drive fighting on inside to
the finish to preserve the show honors. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROUGIR (FR) three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled
three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was out-kicked to the finish. CORE VALUES saved ground in pursuit from mid pack early on,
advanced to be just off the pace with six furlongs to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and went just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on
under a drive to the finish but was out-kicked. LOVELY LUCKY pulled on the bit rank under restraint into the first turn before racing just off the inside
through that bend, pulled once more three wide into the backstretch and stargazed four wide with six furlongs to go before settling given some rein to work
with, tucked three wide into the far turn and came under brief coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch backing away and was
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CARAVEL angled in while going to the front, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch
and held under strong urging. STAR DEVINE (IRE) was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, chased the winner while against the rail and behind that foe in the stretch, had a sliver of room to come through along the inside while in
pursuit and finished with good courage to just get the place. JOUSTER moved in early, settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, came under a
drive in upper stretch, moved out into the final furlong, came further out around the sixteenth-pole and finished fast to just miss the place while up for the
show. LADY EDITH bumped with a foe at the start, was rated just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into upper stretch,
chased the winner under a drive to the wire and finished willingly but just missed the trifecta. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) tracked the pace on the outside then in
three path around the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished. ASSERTIVE
STYLE angled in towards the rear, went two then three wide around the turn, hesitated in traffic in upper stretch, altered course towards the inside around
the furlong marker and improved position with late energy. TOBYS HEART bumped with an opponent at the start then was taken up, settled at the rear,
went two then three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved further out inside the three-sixteenths and also improved position. MISS J
MCKAY brushed with a foe at the start, was hard held while tugging at the bit on the outside, went five wide around the turn, came under a drive into upper
stretch, was taken up some while out of contention around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. FLOWER POINT settled towards the back,
went three then four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, raced between foes under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed
kick. MISS MAJORETTE settled off the pace, went three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, hesitated briefly off heels around the
sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. NEVISIAN SUNRISE brushed with a rival at the start, was hard held while pulling keenly on the bit then dragged her way
forward, went four wide around the turn and came up empty.
