Footnotes
SURPRISE BOSS away in apparent good order, vied during the very initial stages for control before being allowed to assume a stalking role, sat forwardly
placed three wide keeping watch on the front runner, got let out a a notch in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, settled in upper stretch and was
turned loose, began the last eighth hooked up in battle with SWASHBUCKLE, wore that foe in a steadfast manner, getting the job done with three jumps or
so to spare before the wire. SWASHBUCKLE involved early for the lead, went on to prompt the pace from the two path, saw the leader offer no resistance
after confronting that opponent right around the three-sixteenths pole, gained a narrow advantage with the winner bearing down hard just to the outside, dug
in well only to get reeled in at the shadow of the finish line. KING ANGELO off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the bend, got
maneuvered one path farther off the rail in upper stretch, narrowed in on the ones to catch en route for the show award. ALPHALFA settled into the two path
by the conclusion of the backstretch, chased the pace from between rivals during the run around the bend, was about as wide during most of the stretch,
lacked a winning bid. RUNNINGWSCISSORS pinched at the start, after undergoing a series of light bumps with others, sat parked out four wide on the turn,
tipped into the five path after spinning into the stretch, ventured onward after having been virtually the widest of all to no avail. NOT PHAR NOW was briskly
hand ridden to assume control after bumping lightly with RUNNINGWSCISSORS at the start, glided over to the inside once sufficiently in the clear, felt an
uptick in pressure as the half was being completed, offered no resistance releasing lead a sixteenth later and steadily backed away. VALMONT tracked the
leader from the inside for the opening half after making some contact with that foe at the break, moved a path wider coming home, then was allowed to fade
away while mildly encouraged.

Footnotes
LISA'S VISION forwardly placed attending the leader in closest aim in the two path, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take
command near the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SHINFULL showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on willingly to be along for the place honors.
LOLLYGAG tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show
honors. VOLEUSE got steadied at the start when KAY TEE GAL broke inwards taking over her lane, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SKYWARD PRINCESS broke a beat slow at the start, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. SARAH'S SPLENDOR struck the near side stall at the
start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. KAY TEE GAL broke in
at the start taking over the lane of VOLEUSE forcing that rival to steady, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six wide
into upper stretch and tired. DATS A SUPERSTAR three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.
I'LL GO ALL IN broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and
tired. KITTY TIN TIN chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got pushed along midway, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and made no impact.

Footnotes
COUSTEAU shied inward slightly and away from its next stall neighbor as the field was sent off and running, was kept on hold tailing the pacesetter from the
two path for nearly three-quarters, was yet on hold taking over as the third fraction was being finalized, shifted onto the inside route when asked for a run a
sixteenth down the road, dug in well during the last eighth to preserve the decision. LUNI SIMA momentarily taken hold of at the start feeling some pressure
from the outside, settled into the two path shortly afterwards, stayed within striking distance of the front runners, sat poised to strike as six furlongs was
being rattled off, tipped one path farther off the rail at the head of the stretch and had the pilot go to work, displayed willingness but got staved off by an
opponent up to the task at hand. BLAKE B. four wide onto the turn and then exiting it, narrowly won the third place check. AIR SHOW towards the back of
the pack for the initial half, stepped onto the turn from the two path, swung out five wide spinning into the stretch, inched up, fell short of snagging third.
BOLD VICTORY off the inside throughout, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, fanned out into the six path for clearance during the opening stages of
the stretch run, becoming the widest of them all, gained but done without much impact. ONCE A GIANT came in slightly at the start, straightened course
and took up position in the three path, kept pace with the front runners before weakening. JAKE ROCKS briefly hustled to the top, showed the way from the
inside for three-quarters before giving way. INVISIBLE WAR saved ground until the vicinity of three-sixteenths pole, had no rally and fell back. ROYAL
TRYST sighted two wide at the top of the turn, went into the five path for entrance into the stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
EMMANUEL established the front and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits as the rider pleased, remained patiently handled as the
field got busy midway on the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch roused for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and
held well to prevail. NAPOLEONIC WAR broke out at the start taking over the lane of ELIZAR as that rival leapt up in the stall, tracked the front from just off
the inside near the rear of the field, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kicked on with good energy through to the
finish to be along for the place honors unable to reel in the leader to the wire. LIMITED LIABILITY saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) just off the
pace three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no headway through the final
furlong. DAUNT just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. ELIZAR (FR) leapt up at the start and got away last crossing to the inside soon after, saved ground near the rear of
the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home, then weakened in the
late going.

Footnotes
CADENCIA four wide in aim of the front early on, advanced to take over with five and a half furlongs remaining and opened up a safe and clear advantage,
tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat and
held on to prevail. HERINGTON ROCKET two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed
well to issue a challenge through the final furlong but missed at the end while clear of the rest and along second best. WHISKEY LULLABY led early on until
displaced from the front five and a half furlongs from home, tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and kept on to secure the show honors. RHOMBIQUE chased just off the
inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to the finish. BIRTHDAY TIME just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, offered up a bid but was out kicked. MISS BONNIE T coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. INVESTMENT INCOME got bumped at the start by DISINFORMATION, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HOPE OVER FEAR pulled early on forwardly placed
rank under restraint in the two path, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and weakened.
DISINFORMATION broke in at the start bumping INVESTMENT INCOME, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home and made no impact. UNION DOLLY coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid four
wide at the head of the stretch, then tired in the drive. MOLISE three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn and
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MARTINI'S AMICA chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four
to five wide for home and was never involved.
