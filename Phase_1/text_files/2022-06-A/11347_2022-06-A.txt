KINGDOM HEART set the pace in the two path, drew clear turning for home and drew off while ridden out. KEANU was reluctant to load, pressed the pace
three wide between foes, could not keep pace nearing the lane but churned on to regain the place. BORIS prompted the pace four wide and weakened in
the lane. MY EAGLE SOARS stalked the pace from the rail and faded through the stretch. SIR OUTLAW steadied into the turn, raced three wide and never
threatened. ALL ABOUT LUCKY hopped at the start and was in tight soon after, raced two wide and made little impact. ANAMNESTIC was fractious in the
post parade, hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact. ALWAYS DRAMA was outrun while racing three wide.

down the lane and gave way in the final strides. HANDSOME PRINCE tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside from there. LOYAL LOUIE chased the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn and made a mild improvement of position in the lane. SASSY BUT SMART dueled on the outside in the opening
stages, continued to battle between horses in the two path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SIXTY ONE trailed the field up the

Footnotes
FROSTY BREEZE stalked the pace three wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. CARROTS OR CARATS pressed the pace inside,
could not keep pace nearing the lane but churned on inside for the place. ASTRAL WEEKS chased the pace four wide, had the rider lose the whip leaving
the eighth pole and finished willingly to gain the show. SIR BITESALOT failed to menace while racing five wide. MANUKA BOBBY was bumped at the start,
raced three wide and lacked a closing bid. MINISTER QUINN bumped MANUKA BOBBY at the start, sped to the front drew clear in the two path around the
turn but tired in the lane. NOT A DANCE had his head turned at the start and raced well back while saving ground. CHEVAL DORE stumbled at the start
and never threatened while racing four wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FULTON MARKET led the field up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off a late closer to
the wire. ROCKETS SISTER tracked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, raced four wide around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch
and chased the winner home, gaining steadily to the finish. PARCHITA stalked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and gained from the rail late. TALKIN TIPSY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from
the two path and gained ground in late stretch. TEMERITY veered out leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
raced five wide around the turn and finished evenly from the middle of the track. BREEHAZEL raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early
going, came around the turn four wide and weakened late. IT'S NORA NOW chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the three path, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. GRISETTE veered out sharply leaving the gate, was straightened out
and trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
I SAID HEY tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained
ground outside, and drew off while drifting out in the final furlong. FELINE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn and gained ground in late stretch. BULLET ON TAP bumped with the horse to her
inside at the break, recovered to chase the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and finished evenly. MOULY
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, was bumped by SHAWNEE PRINCESS and forced
out in midstretch and made a mild improvement of position on the outside from there. MUY CHISTOSA dueled on the outside in the early going, led the field
while saving ground around the turn, and weakened in the final furlong. SHAWNEE PRINCESS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch,
dropped back to chase the pace setter while saving ground around the turn, raced into traffic near the eighth pole and switched to the outside, bumping with
MOULY in the process and faded from there. AVE FENIX raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the
three path, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. SEA LIONESS trailed the field the entire way around the oval and despite saving ground was
never a factor.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK set a clear pace along the rail and widened under a steady drive. PARKLAND prompted the winner two wide, could not quite keep
pace with that foe in the lane but finished willingly to hold the place. YAMATO saved ground in midpack, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker,
bid in upper stretch but was outfinished for the place. POPPY'S BOYS was wrangled back inside, edged closer under a drive around the far turn, tipped out
in the lane and improved position. FLY THE W chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. PERFORMING ARTS failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. MOTATAABEQ was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole
and maintained an extended drive down the lane to pull clear. KING CAIRO tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, pressed the pace while
saving ground into the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught late. POWER (BRZ) dropped back to trail well behind the field for the run up
the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. LADNEEDSAHANDLER raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly while never threatening. PROSPECT PROJECT hit the gate leaving
it, recovered to stalk the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the four path around the turn and continued to tire
from there. KHOCU led the field out of the chute and up the backstretch, began to fade while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.
SUPERPOSITION chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, was pulled up approaching the quarter pole
and vanned off.

RUNNING MEMORIES settled off the early duel outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off readily. MISS
AURAMET hit the starting gate then bumped with POSEIDON'S PASSION, raced outside off the pace down the backstretch, angled in to race two wide
around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on to be a clear second. HEADLINE HUNTER stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the
quarter pole, briefly led nearing the head of the lane but was no match for the top two in the drive. POSEIDON'S PASSION was bumped at the start, raced
off the pace four wide and never threatened. MON PETIT CHOU raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened.
PALOMITA dueled two wide and tired in the lane. FULMINATE dueled inside of foes and caved nearing the stretch.

PANTHER ISLAND chased the leader up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, cut to the rail and
drew off to the wire. YES I'M A BEAST led the field up the backstretch, battled while saving ground around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and
chased the winner home, just holding second. SARAWAT raced in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground
between horses in the final furlong. STARTING UP raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, improved position from the four
path while racing around the turn and was outkicked from there. UNIFIED CONQUEST trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the
turn and was empty in the lane. BARONE CESCO stumbled badly leaving the gate, settled at the pack of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a mild improvement of position in upper stretch and flattened out from there.
