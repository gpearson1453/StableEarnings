the eighth pole, kicked clear and won going away. GYPSY LYNN raced up close outside the leader, bid two wide into the turn, led briefly between rivals in
upper stretch but could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong. PICTURE OF A LADY off slow and steadied when losing her path at the start, went
two wide into the turn, angled four to five wide leaving the bend, lugged in and bumped rival at the eighth pole and rallied for the show. GRANDIOSELY
sped clear and crossed over to the inside, responded when challenged at the three-eighths, held a short lead into the lane, lost command in upper stretch,
fought to midstretch and weakened late. SPRING SPINNING settled near the back off the rail, went three then four wide on the turn, kept on through the
lane but needed to find more. POET LAUREATE broke a bit slow from inside, climbed early before setting into stride on the backstretch, chased in
mid-pack, saved ground to the stretch and failed to respond. CLEARANCE broke inward at the start, dropped back early, saved ground around the turn,
tipped out and passed tired rivals. FLAPS UP broke a step slow but recovered quickly, bobbled crossing back onto the turn, raced between runners then
lacked room and steadied behind a rival on the turn, s. DARLING DONNA settled outside rivals, rounded the bend three wide, got bumped and forced to
check by PICTURE OF A LADY at the eighth pole and weakened. KJOS KID tracked outside a rival then off the rail, weakened two wide and between rivals
on the turn and tired.

pair. GRAY MAGICIAN off slow from inside, settled along the rail then moved up close on the backstretch, tipped two wide entering the stretch then moved
further out and flattened. MONGOLIAN LEGEND went five wide into the first turn then moved into the four path, traveled at the back while remaining well off
the rail, angled to the three path around the far turn then got floated out and crowded entering the stretch and failed to menace. VERY IRISH broke out and

TALKLESSWORKMORE prominent early in the two path, bid outside around the far turn, dueled with OUBABE while drifting out from the left-hand in the
late stages and won the bob. OUBABE sped to the front, showed the way up the backstretch, urged when challenged around the far turn, battled through
the lane while drifting out late and lost the bob on the line. LIMITED HEATWAVE bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace along the inside, tipped two
wide around the far turn, chased the top pair through the lane but lacked the needed late kick. ATTENZIONE broke in and bumped at the start, stalked two
then three wide early, remained off the rail to the stretch and weakened. BLUE STAR dropped early and moved inside, went two wide around the far turn,
moved out in the stretch and never got involved. BIG FRANK DA TANK was a bit erratic leaving the gate then began to pull first time through the stretch,
steadied off heels entering the first turn, eased off the rail while continuing to tug the rider along, traveled along the inside then a two wide on the far turn
and failed to menace in the late stages.

Footnotes
MARIE fractious in the gate and unseated the rider, up close early then challenged from inside, vied for the lead through the turn, cleared nearing the eighth
pole and drew away. RIGHTEOUSLY away quickly in the beginning, took control early then was rated on the front end, allowed rivals to challenge from both
sides, vied between through the turn and into the stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to prove second best.
JAMMINJL fractious in the gate, up close between rivals early then got put in a bit tight past the half-mile pole, chased two then three wide around the turn,
moved inside in the stretch and rallied for the show. FLAT OUT JOY broke a bit slow, went up to vie four then three deep, battled three wide around the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. DONUT GIRL off slow to begin, went three then four wide on the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
ENCROACHMENT sped to the front from inside, urged along saving ground into the stretch, urged right-handed and remained clear under steady handling
late. CRASH CORRIGAN was off slow to start, raced at the back outside a rival, went three then two wide around the turn, tipped out in the lane, finished
with a belated rally and gained the place. I'M CORFU bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit early on, chased along the rail then two wide into the
stretch, lacked a bid in the final furlong and got edged for second. SOUTHERN KING dropped back early, lacked room from the seven-sixteenths pole to the
five-sixteenths, remained inside into the stretch, summoned a mild rally up the fence while getting put in tight in the final sixteenth and gained a minor
award. JOE DON LOONEY lost his path and checked early, angled down to the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, moved off the rail then drifted back in
a bit and could not rally. QUICK FINISH broke a step slow, jumped crossing the dirt early, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
lacked further response. HIGH HEATER chased off the rail, two to three wide on the turn and weakened. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) tossed his head and came
away a bit slow in the beginning, stalked three deep, three then two wide around the turn and weakened. VROYSKY stumbled then bumped outside rival
and got steadied when pinched back at the start, settled off the rail, came three wide into the lane and had little left.

CREATIVE PEAK vied between rivals to the stretch, dueled outside THORNE HOUSE in the final furlong and inched ahead closing moments. THORNE
HOUSE broke a step slow then went up to contest the pace from inside, battled with outside a pair around the turn, dueled inside CREATIVE PEAK in the
late stages and yielded grudgingly in the end. DUTCH BUS stalked the top trio four wide and ran on to earn the show. MAGNIFICENT RIDE pressed the top
pair from outside then vied three deep around the bend, fought to the eighth pole then flattened and lost the show. LEYAS CANDY broke a step slow,
chased the speedy trio two then three wide on the turn and failed to summon the needed response. CAROL'S COMIC chased three wide around the bend
and never made an impact. JOHNNY PAYCHECK off a step slow to begin, dropped back early, entered the turn along the inside then eased out and trailed
three wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
TEDDY'S BARINO closest in pursuit a bit off the rail then moved to the two path, bid outside on the far turn, headed rival past the quarter pole, led into the
stretch, lost the whip nearing the eighth pole then drifted to the inside and held gamely. BIG CLARE broke a step slow then steered down to the inside
trailing the field, went between rivals on the backstretch, two wide on the far turn, steered out in the lane, rallied four deep late and got up for second. HOT
ON THE TRAIL was off a step slow in the beginning, tracked two wide in range early, bid three deep into the stretch but lacked the need late punch.
ELEUTHERA settled on the inside, waited for room around the second bend, bid between rivals in upper stretch but got forced in and put in tight by the
winner past the eighth pole, found room along the fence and finished gamely to the wire. SONG OF FIRE pulled a bit early before settling in the two path,
steadied off heels entering the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not rally. NORAH'S PRINCESS pulled while trying to be reserved early
on, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane but failed to rally. GHOSTEM set the pace on the inside clear to the far turn, pressured around the
bend and headed past the quarter pole, got crowded and steadied along the fence past the eight pole and weakened. EXACTLY WENDY traveled two wide
early on then moved further off the rail, went three then four wide on the far turn and made no impact in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MEMORIES stumbled badly leaving the gate, got crowded between rival then angled out into the clear on the backstretch, ranged up four wide
on the turn, battled SMITTEN BY KITTEN in the final furlong and got up late. SMITTEN BY KITTEN set the pace under pressure on the inside, dueled past
the five-sixteenths pole, put away MONGOLIAN PANTHER in upper stretch, then fought with MIDNIGHT MEMORIES through the final furlong, finished
gamely to the wire but had to settle for second best. MY KENTUCKY GIRL chased in range but was hard to ride, tossing her head about and running up on
heels, steered out on the turn and entered the lane five wide, then closed willingly for the show while unable to threaten the top pair. MONGOLIAN
PANTHER pressed the pace from outside, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the stretch run. LADY ACES broke inward, chased the
leading duo from inside, lacked room and had to wait past the quarter pole, chased two wide in the stretch and weakened. ANNA VOLANTE chased three
wide into and around the turn, drifted to the inside in midstretch and faded.

Footnotes
NATIONAL ROAD settled two wide and went between runners on the first turn, moved off the rail and went three wide into the far turn, lacked room behind
a wall of rivals around the far turn, tipped four wide past the quarter pole, then flew late to inhale MO THEM DOWN at the sixteenth pole and powered away
late. MO THEM DOWN vied between then outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, took control and moved inside on the backstretch, cleared rival near the
five-sixteenths pole, drew away into the stretch, remained clear to the eighth pole, then got run down by the winner at the sixteenth pole and stayed on to
hold the place. THE KEY IS UNITY broke a step slow, angled in and tracked along the inside, went between runners leaving the backstretch, got bumped
and put in tight entering the far turn, remained two wide with runners on both sides into the stretch and kept on to earn the show honors. GOT CURLY vied
three deep into the first turn then lost touch briefly with the top pair around the bend, moved back up to apply pressure from outside on the backstretch,
could not keep up with MO THEM DOWN around the far turn and churned on for a minor award. CARSON'S LEGACY settled inside early, lacked room at
the quarter pole, tipped three wide leaving the bend, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. MITAD DEL MUNDO stalked between foes in the
two path on the first turn, outside a rival on the backstretch, three deep into the far turn, remained three wide to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane
and flattened. CHICKASAW off slow in the beginning, drifted out on the first turn, went two wide into the second turn, angled four wide around the bend,
steered out further in the stretch and improved position. HULK also came away slow, moved into range while four then three wide on the first turn, got
fanned five wide into the stretch and weakened. GEBO vied for the lead early then dueled into the backstretch, lost touch with the leader nearing the
half-mile pole, chased along the rail and bumped into the far turn, continued along the rail and tired. PRECEDENT broke a step slow, went three wide
around the first turn, entered the lane two wide and was not a factor. TRICKY RICKY broke slow, lagged behind and never got involved.
