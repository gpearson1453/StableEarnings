Footnotes
MATH MYSTERY mad the lead out of the gate, getting pressed mildly down the backstretch, then drew clear easily, from the field, and just held on for the
win at the wire, fighting off MALIBU MIDNIGHT, in the final strides. MALIBU MIDNIGHT was allowed to settle near the back and a bit off the rail in the early
goings, then closed fast, three wide and got up for a game second. TUDELA bore out and bumped a foe at the start, ran up into midfield down the
backstretch, then made a bid in the turn, five wide and grabbed show. LANDONS CONGO was mid pack early on, from the inside, then angled out at the
head of the stretch, making a mild bid, three wide down the lane. CATCH THE DEVIL stalked the pace, going two wide, made a bid into the turn, but
flattened out in the stretch drive. MISS B got bumped a bit at the break and raced up near the front, traveling three wide, then offered a mild rally down the
lane. CHEROKEE SUMMER was near the back, racing along the rail and failed to respond. BELLA BELLE was mid pack, two wide and had no late run.
WILD PROSPECT chased the pace early on, racing along the inside and dropped back in the turn.

LASTCHANCEFORLOVE pressed the pace down the backstretch, racing from the two path, made a bid coming out of the turn and gained command by the
head of the stretch, drawing off from the field and blowing them away for the win. MY FRIEND AMY was near the back, early on, then going into the turn,
made a bid, four wide and closed well down the lane, but could not catch the winner and was second best today. RACY JAYCEE was near the turn, getting
a bit boxed in and steadied slightly around the turn, then made a mild bid in the stretch drive to hold on to third. STORMIEIS BLUE was mid field early on,
racing three wide, then angled out coming off the turn, heading for the six path with a mild rally down the lane. KEWPIE DOLL chased the pace from the
three path early, and failed to respond in the stretch. CHEROKEE COWGIRL made the lead, running along the rail and faded in the stretch. DOHA got off
slow, trailing the field and showed little.

Footnotes
SHOW ME GRACE came out of the gates, eying the lead, raced easily on the front end, then headed out of the turn, drawing away from the field, to go wire
to wire and win easily. SALTAMONTES DIVA was mid pack in the early goings, running along the rail, then angled out at the head of the stretch and rallied,
three wide to get up for place. BLING ON THE LIGHT stalked the pace down the backstretch from the two path, made a bid on the turn, but flattened out in
the stretch and held on to show. MRS. KRINKLES was near the front early, three wide and never fired down the lane. ABIGAIL ALDEN got pinballed and
shuffled back a bit at the break, racing from the two path and had no late run. WOO HOO was mid field early, three wide and faded in the stretch drive.
ZOE'S GOLDLADY bore in at the break and bumped a foe, then trailed the field and passed a tiring rival late. JAN'S TAPIN GO bumped a foe at the break,
stayed near the back, three wide and showed little.

Footnotes
MANOR BORN chased the pace in the early goings, started a bid around the far turn and rallied down the lane to just get up for the win at the wire.
GOLDBRIDGE bore out at the break, bumping a foe, then stalked the pace down the backstretch and rallied two wide, down the lane to grab second. HE'S
A PRINCE got shuffled back at the start and allowed to settle in the rear, angled out around the far turn and closed fast to get up for show. SHARP DOUBLE
EDGE dueled for the lead, back and forth, down the backstretch, racing along the rail, but gave way in late stretch. BENISSIMO was near the back in the
early goings, then rallied, three wide, but not enough. IZEONDEC was mid field, three wide and offered a bid in late stretch. GOOD SWIMMER dueled for
the lead down the backstretch, two wide but flattened out down the lane. BLURT was in contention early, made a bid around the far turn, but faded in the
stretch drive. MISTER JALISCO was near the back along the rail and was through early.
