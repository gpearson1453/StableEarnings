MISS SURPRISE was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SUBZERO PLUS tracked
the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was in touch
and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. MUSICAL FLIGHT was off slow and had a mild gain on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. GIZMO'S PRINCESS was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the eight path at the top
of the stretch passed tired foes. BLONDE ATTITUDE had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no
impact. MARTINI SUE was in range and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. KRZ SOCIETY was hustled early and dueled on the turn but dropped
back through the stretch.
