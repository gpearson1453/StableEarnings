MORE THAN PLAY set the pace down the backstretch, dueled for the lead through the turn, getting headed briefly around the head of the stretch and then
came back on, drawing clear of the field for the win. VALDINA DREAMS pressed the pace following the two path, dueled for the lead around the turn,
getting a head in front briefly, but hung in late stretch, holding on for second. CAPTAINS COVE stalked the pace from about three wide, then rallied down
the lane, but ran out of racing room and got up for third. SHANGHAI GOLD was mid field, traveling five wide throughout and made a mild bid in the stretch
drive. CIBOLO ERL was mid pack early, then angled out in the turn, going four wide and had an even effort. DADA BOOM RIDGE got off slow, trailed the
field, running four wide and was no factor. MUSTBELIEVE bore in sharply around the half, hitting the rail, then proceeded to buck getting pulled up by the
rider and did not finish the race and was walked off. Following the running of the race, there was a Stewards Inquiry regarding the incident around the half
mile pole with MUSTBELIEVE. After reviewing the films, there was no change.

SUMMER CAT flew out of the gates to set the pace, clearing the field right away, never looking back and going wire to wire to win easily with a driving finish
at the wire. TWENTYTWENTYREDO chased the pace early, from the rail, angled out in the turn, made a bid, got headed briefly in late stretch and came
back on for second. ANGIE AT THEOFFICE was mid field early, then rallied around the turn, getting a head in front of TWENTYTWENTYREDO briefly, but
hung late and got up for show. CONTEMPO GRAY was mid pack early on, racing along the inside, then angled out in the stretch, four wide and had an
even effort. SISTER SIS trailed the field early, running along the rail and passed a tiring rival. SMOKEY ANN got off slow, running near the back and
showed little.

Footnotes
FRA MAURO was mid field early, racing three wide, then started a bid going into the turn, cleared the field in early stretch, and just held on for the win. BIG
POWER RED was near the front, racing along the rail, got boxed in and was looking for racing room mid stretch, but closed well to get up for second. HE'S
PRETTY LUCKY was mid field early on from the two path, then made a move down the lane, angling out, four wide to get up for show. IRISH
EXPECTATIONS was near the back early on, then made a mild rally, between horses, in late stretch. EUROEXIT bore in at the break, bumping a foe and
showed no early foot, while traveling four wide, then offered a mild bid down the lane. WILDCAT'S BLING was mid field early, going four wide and never
fired in the stretch drive. DREAMS OF VALOR chased the pace, three wide, made a bid on the turn, then flattened out in the stretch drive. EXCALIBUR
RIDGE got pinched back at the start, running along the rail and passed a tiring rival. ANALYZE THIS JET made the lead, then drew off from the field early
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
COLOSI got off slow, getting a bit boxed in going into the first turn, already full of run, then settled into a mid field spot, angling out and making a bid in the
far turn, just getting up for the win in a blanket finish. CAIRO WARRIOR pressed the pace from the three path, down the backstretch, then rallied coming out
of the far turn and was outfinished late at the wire. BROCK ON BY made the lead, running easily down the backstretch and then gave way grudgingly,
traveling three wide but was able to hold on to show. AQUIMINE stalked the pace, racing along the rail, then started a bid at the head of the stretch, looking
for racing room, and got steadied at the eighth pole. WHISKEY NOT WINE had no early speed, racing near the back, along the inside, then got boxed in
mid stretch, finally breaking free and had a mild rally. UNCLE ARTIE was mid field, going two wide and failed to respond. EVIE'S PRINCE was near the
back early on, three wide, made a bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. OLD SOT was mid pack, traveling four wide and had no late run. TRULY
DANZIG was mid field, running along the rail and then faded down the lane. GORDON ANTHONY had an erratic trip down the backstretch, then made a bid
on the turn, three wide and dropped back in the stretch drive. SWEET MEDICINE was near the back, running on the inside and never fired.
