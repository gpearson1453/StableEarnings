Footnotes
B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE was away alertly then tracked the leaders from the three path and closed willingly to be just up in final jump. PINK POSSE was
prompted to the lead from the two path, cleared in the middle of the turn then drifted slightly in late stretch and was caught at the wire. EMPTY NET hustled
to press the pace from the inside then floated out in the stretch but was empty in the drive. BLUEBIRD SING saved ground throughout but was never a
threat while racing evenly. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL raced just off the rail throughout and was never in contention.

OSCAR CHOICE tracked the leaders from just off the rail through the turn then dropped to rail in upper stretch to slip through and cleared in the final
sixteenth under medium urging. LOWER CRETACEOUS was prompted to the lead to duel with rival from the two path around the turn then floated out
slightly in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. CONFESS was close up down the backstretch in the two path made a mild bid into the turn
from the four path but couldn't gain on the leaders and chased them home. TOOCAN DANCE broke well and dueled for the lead from the three path to
upper stretch and faded in the lane. TAYLOR TOWN showed little.

GREAT IN RED was slightly unsettled in the gate, tracked the leader while saving ground through the final turn moved between horses around the eighth
pole and proved best. PLATINUM QUEEN broke well, was under a tight hold to vie for the lead from the three path around the first turn and down the
backstretch then took the lead after the quarter pole but was outkicked in the final furlong. MILA'S GOLD tracked the leaders from the two path around the
final turn moved to the three path in upper stretch but lacked a late kick. LONESHILOHSPECIAL led from the two path under pressure from the outside
through the second turn was headed in upper stretch, drifted in slightly but couldn't match strides in the drive. MO CLASSY broke out slightly shortly after
the break then raced back in the three path and was never a threat.

COHERE tracked the leaders from the three path around the turn then dropped in to make a rail bid about the quarter pole and took command at the eighth
pole and drew off. GTUONE BUCK sprinted to the lead and dueled from the two path but was no match for the winner and proved second best. BROOK IS
GOLDEN dueled for the lead from the inside and proved to be best of rest. HEARTTHROB HALO was close up early in the four path but failed to menace.
PRINCE LOKI broke inward at the start then saved ground throughout to no avail. GUILTY AS CHARGED raced near the back in the three path and was
never a threat.
