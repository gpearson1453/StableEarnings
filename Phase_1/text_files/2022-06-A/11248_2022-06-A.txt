Footnotes
JAMMIN JIMTOWN rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the early pace, moved to even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the
nod toward the three eighths, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. MR HOOVER rounded the first turn about the three
path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid leaving the nine sixteenths, came through the far turn about the three path and was along for
second later yards. FLAT CAT took the lead two deep midway on the opening turn and rated the pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled
from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. MAKE WAY settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid into
the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened into the lane. CHARGING LION came away awkwardly, settled off the rail early on and
showed little response through the backstretch. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF saved ground.

Footnotes
MEGALODON'SREVENGE took over nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the
quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. GOLDEN METTLE rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a
bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, though, had to settle for second best. SUGAR LIPS raced well back in the three
and four paths on the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and came along for third
later yards. DUKE OF CORK rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
then weakened. CHASE LIL ME bobbled at the break and raced well back inside on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran off the rail on
the far turn and showed little in the lane. QUIET JUSTICE raced off the pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn.
POSTED saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
JUBA'S HOUSE gave chase and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in through the final furlong and took the nod in late yards. WINDSOR'S PLAY set a
pressured pace leaving the chute, rounded the turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded late yards. TRIPLE GALA engaged in close chase
off the rail, checked behind a narrowing opening of the top two finishers leaving the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride in the three path of the turn and
ran evenly in the lane. HANDSOME JOANIE gave early chase outside, ran in the three path of the turn and passed rivals in the lane. WITNESS THE
ENERGY steadied on the chute, gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn, but proved empty in the stretch. STROLLING THROUGH gave chase
inside, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Juba's House for alleged interference
leaving the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Triple Gala, though, determined there was no infraction.

MY BOY CLYDE saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the nod past the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep while between
horses on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling to hold on. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the rail early, eased out into the backstretch and
started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and dug in to take second under the wire. BLUE N GOLD came
away awkwardly and out then ran in the four path of the opening turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn,
was outfinished in the duel through the stretch then nipped from second at the wire. OPERA NITE stalked two deep then challenged nearing the three
eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. CHARITABLE SPENNY rated the pace
inside, came under pressure at the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, was caught just inside the five sixteenths, checked from tight quarters at
the rail approaching the quarter then weakened on the turn. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS broke in then settled in the three path, gave chase toward the three
eighths pole but faded into the far turn. S S ALASKAN CRUZ was pinched back at the break and saved ground.

FULL MOON LOVER pressured the pace and raced close at the rail on the turn, took the nod into the stretch and dug in determinedly to hold off the game
effort of SNOWY JUBA CAT, who set a pressured pace and contested the edge two deep on the turn, was met into the lane but dug in gamely to the finish.
SLEWING gave early chase outside, ran in the three path of the turn then dueled for third mid-stretch. OFFICER CALLY was shuffled back and steadied on
the chute then gave chase from well back inside, angled out approaching the top of the lane and finished well outside. CHARITABLE ANY was bumped and
steadied leaving the chute, picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. DIXIE YODELER came in to
make contact with Charitable Any leaving the chute then gave chase, though, weakened at the rail on the turn. TRUE FLIRT saved ground. The Stewards
reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Full Moon Lover for alleged interference leaving the chute, lodged by the rider of Charitable Any.

Footnotes
MORTAL STORM rounded the first turn in the five path and left the turn outside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far
turn and dug in at the head of the lane to get up the final strides. TAKE ME HOME stalked two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole, took the nod
a stride from the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn, was steadily handled through the lane but gave up the lead in the final strides. MAE
SAI PRINCESS settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path
and dug in to take third the final yards. BARBSGRAY LION moved to the inside and rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of Take Me Home leaving the
three eighths pole, gave up the nod to that one at the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then flattened the final furlong.
FLOATING BY raced well back off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the
lane. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn.
CAROLINA BAMBINA rated just off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on
the far turn. FRENCH NOUGET rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. PREFER DIAMONDS
became anxious in the gate and mostly saved ground. UPSY DAISY DO raced well back.
