BELLAMY DOLCE settled comfortably to track the pacesetter, bid entering the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside in the final
furlong and wore down TEMPESTUOUS to prevail. TEMPESTUOUS set the pace, opened up a clear lead, responded when asked on the far turn, dug in
gamely inside in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. MELINA'S DREAM raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, made a mild bid on the rail
entering the stretch and then weakened. YAH HUH broke just a step slow, raced four wide entering the first turn, settled off the pace between rivals, raced
inside on the far turn and failed to respond. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL raced three wide off the pace, was asked on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LA COSTA vied inside for the early lead, then set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, responded when asked, kicked clear in upper stretch and held
well under urging. LULI'S DANCER tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, dug in gamely late and earned the place
spot. EMPIRES FIRST LADY raced off the pace inside, then two wide, rallied three wide into the stretch and was outfinished for second. I'M BUZZY raced
off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and rallied mildly inside. EVIDENCE BASED hesitated and was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace and
failed to threaten. MYSTIC DREAMS steadied in the chute, raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and weakened. SACRED UNION
vied two wide early, then pressed the pace, bid on the far turn and faded.
