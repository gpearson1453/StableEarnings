Footnotes
VIOLENZA D'ORO pressed from inside, waited for room through the bend, altered out when an opening appeared three wide midstretch, rallied between
horses and got up in time. SHANGHAI SILVER shared the early lead outside CHEEKERS, edged ahead in the lane, fought to hold on but was outfinished in
a game effort. JULIAISON in contention from the start, was boxed in behind the leaders on the turn, gained a clear path three wide entering the lane, floated
out slightly nearing the furlong marker and found best stride too late. CHEEKERS broke on top, shared the lead just off or along the rail for four furlongs
then slowly wore down. ALTMEISTER was settled well off the early speed, picked up his pace off the inside on the turn, lost ground widest into the stretch
but showed a willingness to run late. TURBINADO recovered from stumbling at the start to prompt the pace from outside, was three wide taking the bend
then wore down for the drive.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL MOMENT stalked the early speed from outside, swiftly took over when allowed into the second turn, was put to urging upper stretch and kept to
urging until the final seventy yards. READY REDDING rated from outside, commenced his bid after a half mile, took over second three wide leaving the
second bend then could only pull away for the place the last furlong. JOHNNY LONGBOAT settled early, gradually progressed from inside, advanced along
the rail through the second turn then pulled away for third in the stretch. CACHACO was sent to prompt the early pace from inside but began to wear down
from path two with three furlongs to go. PRINCE OF MAYHEM soon had a clear lead tired from inside after five furlongs. STOSH chased from just off the
inside, began to fade after a half mile, angled out on the second turn and continued to fade widest in the stretch.

TORIN set a pressured pace off the rail but inside WILDWOOD SICILIAN, was challenged on the bend, brushed with the latter as he floated out some
entering the lane, was bumped straightening for home, forced in some midstretch, fought on even terms, jostled with WILDWOOD SICILIAN nearing the
wire and got the nod at the finish. WILDWOOD SICILIAN pressed TORIN from just outside, went for the lead on the turn, was carried out some into the
stretch, bumped the latter at the top of the lane, was straightened, lugged in slightly as he battled for the lead midstretch, jostled with TORIN through the
final strides and had to settle for second best in a game effort. ROAD GAME progressed four wide on the bend and found best stride too late the last eighth.
LONESOME DREAM hesitated then was a bit awkward breaking from the gate, rushed up from inside, began to yield after four furlongs, angled out for a
clear path inside the last eighth but had to rally.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD POSSE away somewhat slowly, was allowed to gradually get into stride, progressed from outside, was three wide taking the bend, took the
lead with hand urging upper stretch then lengthened command under a drive inside the last eighth. SWEET FRAULEIN broke on top and was hustled to
gain a clear lead after a furlong and a half, challenged from outside on the bend, no match for WILDWOOD POSSE when set down for the drive, gradually
wore down but lasted for the place. MORNING LINE NEWS in contention from inside from the early going, altered to the outside for a clear path after
entering the final furlong, narrowly missed second but was easily best of the others. WHITE CASHEL prominent outside SWEET FRAUTEIN, went for the
lead on the bend, yielded between rivals upper stretch, angled out as MORNING LINE NEWS came out inside the furlong marker then lugged in through the
waning yards. MOON PIES IMAGE gradually retreated from inside on the backstretch, was two wide taking the turn, passed inside tired ones in the lane
and was altered out when her path was taken nearing the wire. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER advanced from inside on the turn, angled outside upper stretch
and had no late bid. PLATINUM VINE fractious in the gate prestart, showed little once the race began.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT stalked LATIN CASINO from just outside on the backstretch, took over when allowed on the turn, opened up some with little asking
upper stretch, was under a drive the final furlong and held sway. NAUGHTY ALFRED unruly in the gate, threw his head up just as the gate was opening, left
the gate several lengths behind the rest, gradually progressed from outside to reach contention three wide on the turn, drifted out upper stretch, held a
straight path the last eighth, came up short as he closed on the leader but caught LATIN CASINO for second. LATIN CASINO soon had the advantage, was
overtaken on the turn, never relented along the rail in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. TWO WORLDS moved to the inside early on, made up
ground from just off the rail on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch, altered in some when NAUGHTY ALFRED took his path nearing the eighth
pole then rallied belatedly.

Footnotes
TKOTCHKE rated on the front end outside TIZRIK, moved clear when allowed on the turn, floated out some as he was roused leaving the bend then
gradually drifted out the final furlong as he widened command under mostly hand urging. KARAYEL closest to the early pace, advanced behind TKOTCHKE
on the bend, swung outside that one leaving the turn, proved no match for the latter in the stretch but was clearly best of the others. TIZRIK displayed early
speed just off the inside, did not stay with the top pair on the turn and could only hold onto third late from along the rail. CHANGE DIRECTION chased from
inside, came off the rail for the stretch run and had no late bid. E Z TAPIT void of speed from between rivals, also had no adequate stretch response.
CROWNED LEADER ran just outside E Z TAPIT most of the way and had little to offer for the drive.
