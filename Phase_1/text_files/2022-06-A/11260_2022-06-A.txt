Footnotes
D'S SOUL set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then drew clear in the drive while being kept to left handed crop pressure. ONEZY'S
DREAM was allowed to settle early two wide, eased out nearing the quarter pole to be four wide into the lane, rallied well to gain the place award.
ORBALINE pressed the early pace from between rivals, then stalked the pace two wide mid way on the turn and was sent down, faded in the drive while
staying on for the show award. IMA DAREDEVIL tracked the pace and made a mild bid on the inside on the turn, but weakened. WAKE UP MAGGIE
prompted the pace three wide, then stalked the pace three wide on the turn and was sent down nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the drive.
GELATO AMORE bobbled at the start, then settled three to four wide and came four wide into the lane and had no rally. SARARENDA was reserved early
on the inside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BASKETBALL JONES dueled for the lead on the inside, gained a short advantage leaving the quarter pole, then kicked clear in the stretch under left
handed crop urging while racing a bit green through the stretch and being on the left lead late. JINXED (IRE) was bumped at the start, rated along two wide,
then was between rivals on the turn, then was on the inside into the land while advancing, angled out by the sixteenth marker and finished well to get the
bob for the place award. ALLEN DIGGS dueled for the lead two wide and to the outside of the winner, came three wide into the lane and fought on but
faded late to just miss the place award. NIKOLAOU was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. ICING tracked the
pace and was three wide on the turn and faded in the drive. HILARIOUS AFFAIR was settled back early, came wide into the lane and offered a belated rally.
MORNING THOUGHTS was settled back early and raced on the inside on the turn, then offered some late gain. WAR SAFE broke in at the start, then was
two wide by the three eighths and shifted out on the turn and had no rally. THRILL OF THE DAY was reserved early, then was three to four wide on the turn
and had no response. CROONER chased the pace on the in side and stopped.

Footnotes
JEGOS FIRE took command early, well reserved down the backstretch, repelled a brief challenge midway through the final turn and had plenty in reserve to
draw clear. SELF INFLICTED rated mid pack inside early, was roused on the final turn and closed willingly but the winner was too much. Clear second.
MESA SKYLINE chased the leader throughout, made a bid on the second turn and was repelled by the leader, was tiring late but held third. GUITAR
GEORGE was four wide on both turns, made a mild rally entering the stretch and levelled out. CERRADO trailed throughout while saving ground and was
never in contention. KING CAUSEWAY was five wide entering the first turn, asked on the second turn while three wide and emptied out down the lane.

ALLEGORICAL was rated along the inside, then was boxed on the turn and eased off the inside leaving the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane,
closed well to get up in time under a mild drive. BILL NEEDLE prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to take a short lead on the turn,
then kicked clear leaving the furlong marker, but was caught late in a game effort. BRINGER OF RAIN was sandwiched at the start, settled between horses
on the first turn, shifted to the outside on the backstretch, made a five to four wide move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole, but flattened out in
the furlong grounds, bested rest. STRONGER TOGETHER chased the pace four to three wide and lacked the needed rally. RALPHIE BOY was allowed to
settle from between horses, swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. UH OH IT'S MAGIC set the pace on the inside and was headed on the far turn
and weakened. MIDNIGHT ARKLE was reserved on the inside and had no rally. GIANT ONE tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane
and was empty. LARAQUE was settled back early, then shifted out to be four wide on the far turn and was not a threat. BROADWAY SKY was reserved
early while five to six wide on the backstretch and failed to menace. CITRUS BOY was off slowly and was not a factor. MR. DE broke in at the start, chased
the early pace and tired.

Footnotes
VELOCE was well in hand early on, waited on the turn and angled out in the stretch, took command at the eighth pole and prevailed narrowly over a
stubborn foe. GIANT CRITIC stalked outside, made a bid for the lead entering the stretch, fought gamely between horses to the wire and just missed. OVER
THE HILLS set the early fractions, was headed the final eighth and weakened to be third. BOKERMIN chased the speed in the beginning while inside,
weakened around the turn and was empty for the stretch run. GOLDMINE CAT was allowed to settle in the early stages, roused while going five wide on the
turn and made a mild rally. WHISKEY VICTOR was near the rear early and never got into contention. IVY'S STAR trailed throughout.

BLUE MAX was allowed to settle three wide early, made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole, hit the front approaching the furlong marker and then
drew away to prove best under a drive. RACING IN THE RAIN was allowed to settle early two wide, made a four wide move with the winner, could not go
with that rival in the furlong grounds while being clearly second best. SPRING MOUNTAIN was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn and
came six wide into the lane and was up for the show award late on the outside. WAR COURT chased the early pace on the inside and then was shuffled
back on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker, bumped with HARDWARE GAP, then improved position late between rivals. LAST CHANCE MUHA
chased the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim and made a bid, lugged in and then faded in
the drive. TOOK A WRONG TURN tracked the early pace from between rivals, then was on the inside nearing the quarter pole and weakened. BET N WIN
broke in at the start, then was settled back early, then was in traffic and angled out leaving the furlong marker and showed some late interest on the outside.
HARDWARE GAP was reserved early, was four to three wide on the turn, then was bumped nearing the furlong marker and had no rally. ASTAPOVO
dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. MISTER M V P lacked a rally. STRIBLING dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the turn
and folded in the drive.

Footnotes
MR CROWLEY was brushed on the break, showed speed and cleared down the backstretch, opened up turning for home and was keep to the task to be an
open length winner. DIXIE'S FLATTER stalked outside and chased the winner throughout the turn and stretch the but could not close. LOVE THE GAME
broke out, settled mid pack then made a four wide move on the turn and rallied mildly for the show. SUMMER SUNSET was restrained early, on the rail,
asked through the turn and ran on evenly for a minor award. WICKED CRAZY was near the rear and closed willingly for a minor placing. SHAMBO broke
out, then chased inside and weakened in the stretch. LILNMIGHTY was inside while mid pack early and offered little. DETERMINED FRIEND was void of
early speed and never challenged. CHOCOLATE RUN was never a factor. MR. COMMISH was squeezed at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOARDROOM tracked the early pace and was two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, wore down rivals with a sustained bid after
switching back to the left lead late and surged to get up in time to prove best under a drive. SOUPER SENSATIONAL dueled for the early lead three wide,
then continued the duel two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and made a bid to gain a short advantage by the sixteenth pole, continued on
but was denied late to just miss. LA LIBERTEE was reserved early two wide, came three wide into the drive, angled out in the stretch to the far outside,
offered a late rally to get the nod for the show award. GIDGETTA was rated along early, was three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, rallied
well but was outkicked, just lost show awardflate. JEANIE B (GB) dueled for the lead on the inside to nearing the furlong marker and then yielded grudgingly
in the furlong grounds. IN GOOD SPIRITS tracked the pace from the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had no kick in the drive. LADY WAR
MACHINE was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally while saving ground. AMALFI COAST was allowed to settle two wide, then was three wide by the
quarter pole and shifted out four wide leaving the turn but lacked room by the three sixteenths in traffic, then had no late rally while not being asked for his
best.

Footnotes
SOUPER MUNNINGS tracked the leaders while outside on the turn, moved into contention turning for home and finished strong to get up in the final strides.
MILLENNIUM FORCE broke sharp and was reined in on the backstretch so she could challenge the leader on the outside through the turn and stretch.
Took the lead at the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner in the late stages. AMALFI SKY was settled inside early entering the turn, waited for room
in the stretch then had to alter course down the lane and closed willingly for third. BILLYJANE was away alertly, cleared to take the lead along the rail
through the turn, was headed in early stretch and fought gamely but weakened the final sixteenth. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE was rated behind horses early,
waited for room on the turn and when she got clear had no finishing kick. ROMAN D'ORO trailed early on and never challenged throughout.
