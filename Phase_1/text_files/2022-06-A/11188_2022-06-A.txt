Footnotes
GUARD DUTY chased the pace from the four path through the turn, was asked for more into the lane while in the four path, steadily gained on the leader
inside the eighth pole, was on even terms inside of seventy yards then edged up. BABY VINCENT set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the
lane, continued to be clear with an eighth to go, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole then yielded late. CONCRETE CHARLIE unhurried while
trailing into the turn, moved through the three or four path on the turn, came into the lane with momentum then could not gain on the top two while finishing
well clear for the show spot. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened once
straightened into the lane. JUSTICE IN VEGAS saved ground through the turn and into the lane, shifted into the three path near the eighth pole and made
no headway. SUCCESSFULLY DONE raced on the inside through the turn then faded through the lane. HICKORY HIGH was done early while in the three
path through the turn.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S FEVER chased the pacesetter into the turn while in the three path, moved to press that one in late turn, gained a clear lead into the lane then
widened to the wire while being kept to the task. FOR MAMA was in the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five
path, was no match for the winner then dueled for the place spot through the final eighth. D'ORO'S WISH chased the pace while in the two path through the
turn, came into the lane from the four path on near even terms with the runner-up, dueled with that one for the place spot and yielded. ZOLO was unhurried
while along the inside through the turn, came off the rail inside the eighth pole and moved up while not a threat. WHERE'S MOE in the two or three path
through the turn and into the lane and passed a couple while not a factor. SPOKE set the early pace on a clear lead, vied with the winner into the lane then
faded. VORTEX RISING raced in the two path through the turn and tired. PARTY BOY FLOYD never a factor while in the four or five path. ROOKWOOD
was close up early, settled back through the turn and continued to fade through the lane.

Footnotes
MANUELITO was unhurried while in the two path, gained momentum after straightening in the lane, moved between rivals and three wide just inside the
eighth pole, bumped nearing the sixteenth pole when between, continued with good energy late and just got up. PICKLE FEET set the pace from the outset
while under early pressure, cleared in mid-turn, was challenged on the inside into the lane, dueled with that one to the eighth pole, was joined by two others
soon after, continued with a head in front until the final strides and could not hold sway in a very game effort. CIELO BLU pressed the pace two wide and in
the three path into the lane, lost some ground straightening into the lane, was three wide and in the four path just inside the eighth pole when joined by the
winner in the three path, bumped with that one nearing the sixteenth pole then stayed on to be inching up late. ME AND CHILI chased the pace from along
the inside through the turn, got through along the rail to cut the corner into the lane, dueled with the leader outside the eighth pole, continued on the inside
of a quartet nearing the sixteenth pole then weakened late. AMICABLE raced in the four path through the turn, moved up to be closer entering the lane, was
in the six path in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. WHAT NOW DARRELL never a factor while along the inside through the turn. ROYAL ICING
chased the early pace while in the four path into the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
DRIVEN ONE chased the pace from the four to the three path, bid in mid-turn, gained a short lead into the lane, quickly cleared outside the eighth pole then
was all out late to last. HEEDING was unhurried while along the inside, began gaining momentum into the far turn, was checked when losing path, lost
about three lengths, quickly regained momentum through mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane and was closing in to the wire in a good debut. GUNTON
ROE never far back while in the three to the four path through the far turn, came into the lane with aim on the leader, slowly gained on that one, was in tight
late though making no placing difference. RIBBON FALLS was in the two path through the far turn when never far back, bid into the lane and offered a mild
gain. BAILEYS RUN set the pace into the backstretch, continued close up along the rail while others moved past, rebid in late turn while along the rail then
weakened through the lane. MIRACLE ON ICE never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. CLASSIC KING raced well back into
the far turn, moved up along the inside and was never a menace. RUBINSTEIN was never a factor while racing in the three path through the turns.
LONGER VIEW outrun while in the two path through the turns. MASTER LEA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn and was done. POGOERIACH
vied for the lead from the two path into the far turn then was suddenly done, dropped far back and was eased to the wire and walked off. AN OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF #1 GUNTON ROE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #6 HEEDING FOR INTERFERNCE IN DEEP STRETCH ALONG WITH A STEWARD'S
INQUIRY DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE OF ORDER.
