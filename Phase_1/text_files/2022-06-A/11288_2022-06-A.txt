BUILDING HOME stalked the leader in the two path commenced bid turning for home steadily wore down the leader on the outside and was pulling away at
the end. ACTIVE GIRL was allowed to settle on the outside while racing at least four wide up the backstretch continued four to five wide on the turn and
through the stretch and was making up ground. GLITTER TIME was reluctant to load but popped from the gate to open a clear lead a few jumps out of the
gate extended the lead into the turn but shortened stride through the stretch. TUFFOLOGY was off a half step slow then hustled into contention three wide
into the turn raced evenly after that and could not make up the needed ground. LUCKY LINZ was mid pack along the inside going into the turn stayed along
the inside through the stretch but could not make up the needed ground. KICK N KISS was away in good order and went right to the back and was never a
serious factor.

NO PEDIGREE showed good early speed and had the rail into the turn was challenged by My Pal Mattie on the turn edged clear at the top of the stretch
and then was all out to hold off the late bid of Wild Bert in the final stages. WILD BERT was allowed to settle wide up the backstretch began his bid three to
four wide on the turn while circling the field was inching up on the winner but ran out of ground. MY PAL MATTIE had the lead in the two path going into the
turn held tough to the top of the stretch and then could not go with the top pair through the lane. SLITHER was away in good order and close to the lead
early settled in the two path on the turn and did not have the needed rally. MORRICONE was away from the gates well and forwardly placed along the
inside but began a steady fade as the field went into the turn and was not a factor. DOUBLE STAR was in the back of the back along the inside from the
outset was well back in the turn and could not make up ground while drifting out through the stretch.

SECRETARY AT WAR was away well and was caught wide up the backstretch was taken to the inside going into the turn and commenced a rally along the
rail through the stretch and edged clear in the final stages. POPULIST was battling for the lead while three deep on the turn took a clear lead turning for
home but could not hold off the winner on the inside. EXTIRPATOR was not the quickest away from the gates but was hustled to the lead on the inside took
a narrow lead into the turn came off the rail a bit and was outfinished through the drive. ARRIVAL was well off the pace along the rail in the early stages
came through along the inside to make a mild bid but was never a serious factor for a major share but just missed third. DR. BOEHRER showed good early
speed in the two path was in contention to the top of the stretch and then gave way quickly. HUG THE MUNNY was in the back of the pack while two to
three wide on the turn and gave way through the stretch.

MR. B CAUSE was off the rail the entire race came three wide into the stretch then weaved in and out a bit, took a clear lead at the stretch call but drifted
out under left hand urging and was all out to hold off the resurgence of Unified Assets. UNIFIED ASSETS was hustled to the lead along the rail held the
advantage to the stretch and then was passed by the eventual winner but came on again in the final fifty yards to make the finish very close. SERBIAN
SAILOR was away quickly but settled off the pace on the inside drifted out through the stretch and could not make up the needed ground. GOLD PRIZE was
away in good order took the first turn in the two path and then steadily faded up the backstretch then seemed to regain interest and was finishing with
interest along the rail. CURLIN EDGES made a sweeping wide move up the backstretch. DOVER STRAIT was in the back from the outset along the rail was
hustled up the backstretch and then quickly faded.

Footnotes
DECEMBER SEVEN took the lead from the outset was able to get to the rail quickly and made every pole a winning one while under mild urging through the
stretch to win as the rider please. THE ROCK SAYS chased the easy winner while always off the rail was never a threat to the winner but was clearly
second best. KNIGHTS KEY chased the pace in the two path while never a serious factor was clearly third best. WOMAN WITH A BOOK had a ground
saving trip the entire race but was never a serious contender for a major share. TUNE MY GUITAR drifted out and bumped Mosta Flyin into the first turn
dropped back and was not a factor while passing a few in the late stages. LUCKY STREAKER up close for the first quarter steadily faded along the inside.
FORT RIDGE raced five to six wide throughout moved into third up the backstretch and then had nothing left in the stretch. MOSTA FLYIN was carried wide
and bumped into the first turn and was never in serious contention. MEGANS LAD was jostled a bit at the break in tight quarters on the first turn and then
steadily faded.

Footnotes
AWE SHACKLE had a ground saving trip along the rail until mid stretch came out for the drive when Majestic Sign drifted in found another gear and finished
best between rivals for the win. TAPAGE was off a step slow raced three wide while not enjoying going into the first turn continued wide up the backstretch
and was in contention while drifting out a bit at the head of the stretch continued to inch closer through the stretch but could not fend off the winner.
MAJESTIC SIGN showed the best early speed while racing off the rail and took the field into mid stretch stretch with a clear went to the inside midstretch
and tired in the final yards. HALEYS SAILOR raced along the rail the entire race made a mild bid through the stretch and could not make up the needed
ground while appearing to be intimated a bit by the horses in front of him. CHANGI was mid pack in the two path then quickly faded into the second turn and
was not a factor.

REAL BRAVE was three to four wide on the turn then came five to six wide entering the stretch to get into contention took a narrow lead and was all out to
hold off Robtadi Storm through the stretch. ROBTADI STORM was able to get to the two path into the turn then fanned four to five wide entering the stretch
hooked up in a duel with Real Brave but could never go by that rival while second best. G'S STORM showed the best early speed in the charge for the lead
was well measured into the turn opened a good lead turning for home but gave way inside the eighth pole. DOUBLE PRIORITY was away well and was
closest to the leader in the two path on the turn but had no rally through the stretch. THISGUYCANFLY was well back along the inside trailing in the turn
angled out for the drive and made a mild bid for a minor share. OUR SEXY A. P. was away well then taken back to the rail to avoid a speed duel raced
along the inside but had no rally. BAYOU SARGE was up close in the three path into the turn and then gave way. RY DONT LIE was just off the pace along
the inside and then backed up quickly on the turn with no apparent excuse.
