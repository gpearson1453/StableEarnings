Footnotes
COPPER KING was unhurried while off the inside into the far turn, was asked for more after mid-turn, moved quickly on the leaders through late turn, came
four wide into the lane with momentum, caught the leaders outside the eighth pole, gained the lead and drew clear through the final eighth.
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER stalked the pace throughout while in the three path, bid three wide into the lane, gained a short lead when straightening into the
lane, could not keep up with the winner but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. ROMPED pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and into
the turn, continued in close proximity into the lane then slowly weakened in the final eighth. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER chased the pace into the far turn then
lacked a closing response. FULCO set the pace from the outset into the far turn, was still with a short lead in late turn then gave way turning into the lane.
EGOMANIAC was outrun throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
WARIS chased the pace from the four to the three path, bid into the lane three wide, caught the leader inside the eighth pole then edged clear. MOSE
DEFINITELY pressed the pace from along the inside through the turn and into the lane, was still a serious threat when straightening into the lane, ran evenly
along the rail when in the show spot but kept on to just get up for the place spot. BOO'S GAL set the pace while under pressure from the inside, continued
with a short lead into the lane, was challenged by the winner nearing the eighth pole, stayed with that one to inside the sixteenth pole then yielded and lost
the place spot on the final stride. KENZIE LOU pressed the early pace from between rivals, settled back approaching the turn, chased the pace through the
turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. WICKED KITTY was never a threat while in the two or three path through the turn. BUMPER GIRL
was near the rail throughout and made little impace. NEOQUEEN pressed the the pace four wide into the turn, bolted to the outside rail and was pulled up
after entering the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SWEET JUSTICE chased the three rival duel through mid-turn, bid four wide in late turn, gained the lead when straightening, opened a clear lead before the
eighth pole then was kept to the task to the end as the advantage was diminishing. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER settled off the early pace while along the inside,
moved to vie for the lead along the rail with two others, shook the two duelers off after straightening in the lane then kept on well to be inching up on the
winner to the end in a good effort. AMERICA RULES raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and showed late energy to well clear for the
show spot. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL vied for the lead while three wide through the turn then weakened after turning into the lane. RE ANTE was in the two path
through the turn when near the back, continued along the inside into the lane and never was a factor. LASHES vied for the lead from between rivals through
the turn then faded after entering the lane. WISHED trailed through the turn and into the lane and was never in it.

Footnotes
Z ZS RED was away alertly while breaking out a couple of paths, pressed the leader while two wide through the turn, cleared in late turn, remained clear
with an eighth to go then was under a strong drive to the end to hold sway. GIO'S BABY GIRL chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three
path, bid into the lane and was slowly but methodically gaining on the winner and settled for second best. VIVIJO was well back while in the three or four
path, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up for the minor share while not a threat. DARNELL broke in, put in
tight and lost her path at the start, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor while just missing the show spot.
IDAREYOUTODANCE set the pace while under pressure from the winner through late turn, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole then gave
way. HAPPYKIYAY was in the three to the two path through the turn and never was a factor. SIGNATURE STREET stumbled at the start, chased the pace
through mid-turn then was empty through the lane.

Footnotes
SCOTTY'S ON EDGE was unhurried while in the four path into the turn, continued with good energy into the lane, was three wide after straightening in the
lane, caught the leader nearing the eighth pole then edged clear through the final eighth while drifting to the rail. CIBOLO chased the pace through the turn
while along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, had aim on the top two while along the inside, could not go with the winner but stayed on well to be clear
for the place spot. REMEMBER HYMN set the pace on a clear lead through the turn, was in the two path through the lane when challenged by the winner,
stayed with that one for a sixteenth then could not keep up. OVERJOY was unhurried into the turn, was asked for more soon after mid-turn, ranged up from
the four path into the lane, looked to be a possible contender once straightened then flattened. TAPADERA chased the pace from the two path into the turn
and steadily faded. GUARD never a factor while along the inside. MALIBU CLASSIC was never a factor while in the three path through the turn and
straightening in the lane from the six path. AMAZING JUSTICE was outrun while in the two path through the turn. INDIGO RICH chased the pace into the
turn while in the three path, lost ground through the turn and was empty in the lane.

outside. MISS DIAMOND RICH stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid. ANOTHER ACCOUNT improved position late. FARM SAFETY was unrushed,
then had no late bid between foes. LIZZSAIDNO faded. TAP THE LINE stalked the pace in the four path, then had no late bid. CONTAGIOUS GIGGLE
raced inside, then faded in the stretch.
