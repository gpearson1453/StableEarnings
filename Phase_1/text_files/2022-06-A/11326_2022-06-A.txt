dug in under steady handling to hold on. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path, dug in leaving the turn to take second in
the final yards and was gaining on the winner. LEMONSONDESURPRISE set a pressured early pace, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole,
contested even terms two deep on the turn then flattened leaving the eighth pole. IT'S A REAL HONOR gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and
ran evenly in the lane. SILVER RULES gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. NEW AGE BAD GIRL was bumped and
steadied leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the five path of the turn and showed little in the lane. JUJU ON DA BEAT broke inward

BANNER MAN took over leaving the five eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, dueled clear at the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. LUFTY'S KISSES raced well back from early contention in the three and
four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the five and six paths of the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and finished well.
NAZCA MYSTERY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and came along for
third later yards. OFFICER APPEAL set the early pace inside, was caught leaving the five eighths pole and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far
turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. ROCK FILE showed little response through the backstretch. TWOBITSARIDE was not a factor. HENRY
STANDINGBEAR steadied early then saved ground. PLONDER stalked into the first turn, challenged at the three eighths pole but dropped back nearing the
five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
TRUE HEIRESS chased toward the inside, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in at the head of the lane to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and held on
under steady handling. MINNETONKA came out and made contact with Dealer's Girl on the chute then gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail, angled to
the five path leaving the turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT chased outside, ran in the six path of the turn
and finished well to take third under the wire. ARTEMIS RISING raced with the pace, rounded the turn in the three path, dueled close through the upper
stretch but reluctantly ceded later yards and was nipped from third at the wire. ONE SMART COOKIE was bumped on the chute, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and finished well. DEALER'S GIRL was bumped outward and exchanged contact with One Smart Cookie
on the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and weakened in the stretch. DARK TRICKS raced with the pace
and dueled at even terms off the rail on the turn, weakened nearing mid-stretch and was eased the final sixteenth. KAYLIE'S GIRL raced with the pace
inside, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and weakened.
