BABE'S GOT APPEAL away cleanly, vied inside with rival on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, inched away from rival and in the clear
entering the stretch, responded to urging in the lane and drew off. VIDALIA away cleanly, settled into a inside stalking position on the backstretch, continued
to save ground on the turn, launched rally in between rivals and finished well to get up for 2nd. MY SWEET MARY found a three wide stalking position on
the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, kept to task in the lane and earned show. LA CROIX stalked pace in
between rivals on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid along the inside in upper stretch and flattened out in final sixteenth.
SECRET OF WAR away well and vied for lead outside of rival on the backstretch, continued pressing the issue on the turn, could no match strides with rival
during the second half of the turn, entered the stretch in second and quickly tired before reaching midstretch. TIERNA came out at the start, apprentice rider
seemed to have a handful and stayed very wide, continued at least five wide on the turn and never threatened.

TIME FLYS first time gelding was away well, under strong right handed urging throughout, all out to the wire and it came just in time to hold on. BETTER
BEWARE broke in, dueled with outside rival throughout and lost bob at the wire under solid urging. CHICKITITAS CARTEL broke in a path, was under
steady right hand urging throughout in a respectable debut. BEDUINO first time gelding was a bit fidgety in the gate, came away a bit awkward while lugging
in two paths, hand ridden throughout, and lost bob for third in a blanket finish. FIRE STEL rubbed outside part of the gate, came away slow, asked right
handed past the gap and failed to respond.

MAMBA CARTEL came in two paths at the start, drifted out early, lugged out three lanes the final sixteenth and held on under no urging. IN DOUBT
fractious behind the gate and dropped rider, brushed by rival at the start, under steady left handed urging, gained on leader to the wire while drifting in a
path late to just miss. FIRE WALL scrambled and bumped solidly at the start, hand ridden to the wire in measured third place. FAR FETCHED broke in and
bumped rival at the start, asked right handed early, drifted in a touch, quickly corrected and hand ridden to the wire. ROSY CARTEL floated in by outside
rival at the start, under hand urging first half of race, asked right handed passing the sixteenth pole and showed a mild response. SASSANACH broke out
and solidly bumped rival at the start, shied a touch passing the gap, asked right handed and failed to respond and weakened final half of the race. KNOCK
YOUR FAVORITE broke out and brushed with rival at the start, urged right handed early and failed to quicken.
