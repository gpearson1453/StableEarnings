Footnotes
SURFING set the pace on the inside, dueled with CALYPSO BAND on the far turn, turned away that rival in midstretch and drew clear under urging.
POSTINO'S PROPHECY tracked on the inside, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and finished well to get up for second. CALYPSO BAND
stalked close up two wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with the winner into the stretch, could not stay with that rival and lost second late.
FOREVER CHOCOLATE stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and finished evenly. HER NAME IS LOLA hit the gate almost losing the rider at the start,
quickly recovered, then raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn and gained mildly on the rail. KAZ SWEET HEIST raced off the pace,
moved up four wide at the half mile marker, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. STEEL PIER pulled early on and steadied twice on the first turn,
raced off the pace, three wide on the backside, checked at the quarter pole and tired. HOT LITTLE NUMBER was outrun. A Jockey Objection by the rider of
CALYPSO BAND against the winner was dismissed.

LEADER OF THE BAND settled off the early pace, then stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied outside of BETH'S DREAM entering the
stretch, dug in gamely through a spirited stretch run and prevailed narrowly at the end. BETH'S DREAM stalked close up outside in the early stages, then
pressed the pace racing in hand, bid two wide entering the far turn, rallied to a short lead, edged away in upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside of the
winner and battled it out to the wire. BOSTON POST ROAD tracked on the inside, then two wide between rivals, chased the leaders on the far turn, raced
inside into the stretch, lacked a winning bid and earned the show spot. TAP DANCE FEVER raced off the pace inside, moved up inside at the half mile
marker, then dropped back on the far turn and closed belatedly inside. JOIN THE DOTS trailed the field, moved up four wide entering the far turn, then
weakened in the lane. MORAZ raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and faded. WHOLEBODEMEISTER set the pace on the
inside, dueled briefly and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
MY MAGGIE MOO raced four wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, bid four wide on the far turn, led into the stretch, kicked clear and was kept to the
task. PRIMA BALLERINA hopped and was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch and
came up second best. SONOMA COUNTY set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and stayed on well for the
show spot. GOLD WATCH tracked on the inside, advanced inside on the far turn and lacked a stretch rally. CURLIN'S COLEEN raced off the pace inside
and did not factor. HARD ROCK WARRIOR stalked between rivals, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled briefly and faded. OLD SCHOOL (GB)
pressed the pace racing close up outside, then chased two wide and faded. MISS MONTROSE stumbled badly at the start, raced three wide on the first turn
and was outrun.
