Footnotes
POMPOUS PRINCE broke alertly, quickly opened up, hugged the inner rail around the track and was ridden out. GENERAL J R saved ground around the
turn and gamely chased the winner. CALIFORNIA GHOST , in the three path between horses on the turn, was carried to the four path at the head of the
stretch and weakened. SMART AND FAST , in the two path on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way inside horses. MARYLAND MOON ,
four wide on the turn, was fanned five deep turning for home and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NO MORE MASK sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, responded to rousing past the quarter pole, came off the rail in upper stretch,
widened under right handed asking past mid stretch then continued to increase the advantage while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. SO
GRACIOUS flashed speed outside the winner then dropped back entering the turn, was under pressure off the rail in upper stretch, found more between
runners into the final sixteenth and just got up for the place. EL BOCHINCHE , bumped at the break, regrouped and edged up between foes and stalked,
was under a ride pursuing past the five sixteenths, raced three wide in upper stretch, drifted out late and gave way grudgingly. STRIKE MAGIC , bumped at
the start, dropped in around the turn, chased off the rail into the lane then had late interest to the inside of SO GRACIOUS. MISS OLD BAY , away alertly,
stalked three wide, was under asking four wide in upper stretch and faded. SAX , bumped at the break, dropped off the pace, angled in around the turn,
saved ground into lane and passed faders. HELLO GRACIE , four deep while off the pace past the three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked
a rally. SEA PINES , three wide between runners, was in a bit close mid turn and faded.

WATCH YOUR TONE bumped with PASS IT ON leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, stumbled bumped SOME IS NINE when placed
in tight quarters by SALTY SAUL leaving the turn, angled outside inside the sixteenth pole and was up at the wire. DIXIELAND DANCER set the pace in the
two path around the turn, remained in the two path through the stretch and weakened late. FLAVA'S DREAM hugged the inner rail throughout and closed
the gap late. SOME IS NINE , three deep on the turn, bumped with the winner and failed to rally. PASS IT ON bumped with the winner at the start, circled
foes three wide on the turn and was no factor. SALTY SAUL showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out in front of the winner leaving the turn and gave
way. MIZ THE BEST , outrun, was eased in the stretch. An objection by the rider of SOME IS NINE against the winner for alleged interference leaving the
turn was not allowed.

FOREVER THE BOSS into the lane, spurted clear under a drive past the three sixteenths then eagerly widened while kept to task. BIG DADDY D R stalked
two wide, shifted out under pressure past the three sixteenths and churned on willingly to be clear of the rest. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR , urged inside
chasing, eased out for the drive and rallied mildly. FOREVER THE BOSS sped clear early, set a rated pace two wide, was hooked mid turn, ceded to the
winner into the lane, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON , off the pace while saving ground, came off the inside past
mid stretch and had late interest between foes. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , three to four wide, moved up some past mid stretch then flattened out. MR.
MOSLEY , off the pace four wide, failed to respond. BOURBONONTHEROCKS , sluggish from the gate, was taken well off the rail, remained very wide and
was outrun. BODE LYNX rushed up between rivals soon after the break, pursued three wide between runners to the turn then faltered.

UNCLE JEROME set all the pace, saved ground around the turn, pulled away under encouragement and steadily drifted out the final furlong. NAUTILUS
stalked the pace, advanced three deep leaving the turn then futilely chased the winner through the stretch while well clear of the rest. CONTENTED NOW ,
taken three deep leaving the turn, passed tired foes in the stretch. LIGHTNING ROD bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, swung
outside in upper stretch and rallied mildly. POWER BACK , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch then gave way.
TEXAS TOWER , along the inner rail on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and was not a factor. IRISHMAN was no factor. UNORTHODOX , three wide
on the turn, was never a factor. CHAMPION BY DESIGN in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. VIRGINIA FULLA trailed after being
caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate.

MY MY GIRL , well handled disputing the pace inside a pair of rivals, put a head in front past the five sixteenths, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch,
kept on gamely from there and held firm. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , off a step slow after being a bit fidgety in the gate, recovered and edged up early, bid
three deep, dueled outside rivals into and around the turn, saw the winner get away some near mid stretch but came back on in gritty fashion through the
final seventy yards. I'M GITTIN THERE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, swung five wide for the drive and finished well to
gain. R AVERIE LYNN , away alertly, dueled between rivals while holding a slim early advantage, ceded the lead past the five sixteenths, stayed on to
contest the issue into the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. TRITONE GAL tracked the trio of duelers, swung four
wide into the lane, ranged up in mid stretch then hung. NOBLE BID checked when tough to settle between foes in the opening furlong, was taken up sharply
with a half mile to go, dropped back soon after while appearing to have issue with her hood, had her rider remove the hood entering the lane and was
eased.

KRUG , taken to the inner rail when sprinting clear entering the first turn, remained along the rail, opened up under urging entering the stretch then was
ridden out. O K GAME ON , briefly steadied behind the winner entering the first turn, raced outside that one and chased him through the stretch in a game
effort. ONE TWO KID stumbled leaving the starting gate and circled both turns three wide. TOE CURLIN' KISS broke a little awkwardly, raced along the
inner rail on the turns, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor.

AWAY TO RETURN vied three then two wide outside FORTES while under confident handling, drifted in after clearing near the quarter pole, opened up
under asking nearing mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden through the final furlong. FORTES vied inside the winner, shifted out for the drive, gave hard
chase and was headed by WICKED HOT near mid stretch, battled on gamely and out finished that rival to regain the place. WICKED HOT stumbled at the
break, regrouped then edged up behind rivals while under rating, angled out leaving the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane, advanced in mid
stretch, stayed on her left lead and hung. LONG DISTANCE LOVE , four wide between rivals heading to the turn, shifted in some around the turn but came
up empty. MISS MARLEY flashed speed between rivals, eased back off the leading pair and dropped in approaching the turn, failed to kick on past the five
sixteenths and faded. BELLADORA , five wide outside runners early on, failed to kick on three wide past the three eighths and faltered.
