LOST WISH took command with the early lead out of the gate, racing around the two path, then hit the head of the lane and drew off from the field to win
easily. HALF PAGE pressed the pace, racing along the rail, then rallied down the lane, unable to stay with the leader but clearly second best. ESSENTIAL
BELLA chased the pace, down the backstretch, traveling three wide, made a bid in the turn and got up for show money. BENDELENE hopped at the start,
getting a slow start coming out of the gate, then angled out on the turn and closed, five wide in the stretch. THINKITASADONATION was near the front early
on, racing four wide, and had no late run down the lane. SMART LASSIE was in contention early, racing in the five path and never fired. SIP was mid field
early, running five wide, made a bid in the turn but flattened out in the stretch drive. SOUL SET FREE was mid pack, three wide and failed to respond.
EMOTIONAL INTEL was near the back, three wide and showed little. LITESTER pressed the pace down the backstretch, three wide, and faded in the
stretch.

VEILAZIG tracked the pace from the inside, then continued to bid on the turn, came out three wide to rally between rivals down the stretch drive and was
just up for the win. A SONG FOR MICKEY stalked the pace while two wide, took the lead at the top of the stretch, then continued to dig in gamely but was
caught in the end and lost by a head bob. DOC'S DENITA broke slowly then chased the pace while five wide, was gaining on the turn to rally in the stretch
and closed well in the end. MISS YACHTY was unhurried early and no threat. SHE'S AN ANGEL set the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the
turn but weakened in the final furlongs.

REBEL POSSE stalked the pace in the early goings, from around the three path, made a bid in the turn and closed fast, drawing off in late stretch for an
easy win. TOUGH CHARLIE made the early lead, racing along the rail, but gave way in late stretch and held on to place. GIVE IT EVERYTHING showed no
early speed away from the gate, angled out down the lane and closed well to grab third. SIGN OF WAR was forwardly placed early on, running along the
rail, made a bid in the turn, but flattened out in the stretch drive. ADIOS CARLOS was mid field, running in the three path but failed to respond down the
lane. BELEWS GOLD was mid pack, three wide and failed to fire. QUARKY pressed the pace early on, two wide and faded in the stretch. NOT
NECESSARILY threw his head at the start, getting off slow from the gate and showed little.

Footnotes
ERNIE BANKER was near the back early on, racing along the inside, made a bid from the head of the stretch, looking for racing room, then finally pushed
though in early stretch to draw off from the field for the win. HORN OF PLENTY was mid field early on, racing three wide, then angled out a bit more at the
head of the stretch, closing well and took second. MISTER K was mid pack, about two wide, then offered a bid, down the lane, looking for a hole between
horses, gets though and takes third. WONDERS OF HISLOVE staked the pace, from the three path, then had a mild bid in the stretch drive. REPLETE
chased the pace, three wide and offered a mild rally down the lane. SAMURAI CAUSE had no early foot early on, racing three wide and passed tiring rivals.
FRESH ONE pressed the pace early, two wide and faded in the stretch. CAN HE STORM broke slow, then ran off to the lead early and dropped back in the
stretch.

Footnotes
FRED'STWIRLINCANDY made the lead out of the gate, racing along the rail, getting pressed down the backstretch by ENGLANDER, and went wire to wire,
for an easy win, drawing away from the field as he went. METROPOL was mid field early, then rallied between horses in mid stretch to get up for place.
ENGLANDER pressed the pace, early, going two wide, made a bid in the turn and hung a bit late, holding on to show. CONVICTION TRADE stalked the
pace, four wide and offered a mild bid down the lane. SEDUCTIVE U S A showed no early speed, angling out in the stretch, five wide and offered a mild
rally. VALENTINE STREET was mid field, three wide and had an even effort. MISHKO showed no early foot, running along the rail and passed tiring rivals.
BIZZY LEGS stalked the pace, from along the inside and faded in the stretch drive. COAL TRUTH was mid pack, three wide and dropped back in the
stretch.
