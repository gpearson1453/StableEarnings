Footnotes
MY COUSIN RICH was off a step slow, then settled early, shifted to the outside and made a four wide bid leaving the half mile marker, then shifted in to be
three wide on the far turn, tipped out four wide for the drive, dueled for command leaving the furlong marker, then prevailed late after a long drive.
KINSALER prompted the pace two to three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn, then vied for command between rivals by the furlong marker, then
dueled with the winner by the sixteenth pole and was outkicked late. THINKIN OUT LOUD set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened the final
furlong, bested rest. DOMINANT FACTOR was four wide into the first turn, then five wide on the backstretch, three wide on the far turn and had no rally
while besting the rest. GRAZELY was rank on the first turn towards the inside and tired. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT was off slowly and was not a factor.
LIGHTNING ROUND chased the pace three to four wide and stopped.

DEB'S GUNFIGHTER prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the far turn, dueled for command by the quarter pole, then kicked clear in the drive to
prove best under a drive. CHAIN REACTION was well rated early two wide, made a three wide move on the turn and dueled for command three wide by the
quarter pole, but flattened out in the drive, second best. MIDDLE EARTH set the pace on the inside and was headed at the five sixteenths and weakened,
bested rest. DREAMERS REWARD was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and tired. FREEDOM'S START was allowed to settle early, then
was five wide on the backstretch and tired. JOZANI R V F was void of early speed and showed little. MY MAN GEORGIO was unruly pre race, not a factor.

RELENTLESS RUBY set the pace on the inside while clear, then was pressured at the half mile marker, then drew out by the quarter pole, then was getting
tired late but held sway to prove best, driving. DANCE A LITTLE JIG tracked the early pace, then went up to prompt the pace three wide leaving the half
mile marker, then fell off the pace on the turn, came three wide into the lane and closed the gap late, second best. PRETTY SPECTACULAR threw head
early, then raced on the inside and had no rally while besting the rest. MEEMOO lacked a rally. BROOKLYN MOJO mad a four wide middle move and tired.
BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN chased the pace five wide and then was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
R TENDERONI was well rated early, split rivals at the five eighths marker, shifted out four wide leaving the quarter pole for racing room, made a bid leaving
the turn, hit the front while on the left lead, then switched over to the right lead at the sixteenth pole and edged clear to prove best under a drive. BETTER
YET was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, could not go with the winner late, second best.
POLISHED GEM set the pace on the inside and faded the final furlong, stayed on for the show award. BIRD TRAFFIC steadied and came out into the first
turn, then chased the pace three to four wide and lacked the needed rally. BEYOND A MILLION lacked a rally. SLEEPY N JOYFUL checked hard into the
first turn, then was with the pace on the inside on the backstretch and tired. There were two objections in the race, number one BIRD TRAFFIC versus
number two POLISHED GEM, that objection was not allowed, then number three SLEEPY N JOYFUL claimed foul against number one BIRD TRAFFIC for
interference into the first turn, that objection was allowed and BIRD TRAFFIC was placed sixth by the Stewards.
