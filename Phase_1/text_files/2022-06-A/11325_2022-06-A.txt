Footnotes
TAP GOLD broke through the starting gate prior to the start but never fully escaped the grasp of the assistant starter, set a clear pace a bit off the rail,
continued on to the left lead in the lane and widened under a drive. SOUTHERN BREEZE tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter
pole and stayed on to be clearly second best. DUNKLE saved ground in midpack early, advanced four wide around the far turn and was along for the show.
KING ALFREDO was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace two wide, made some progress in upper stretch but flattened out late. CHEF MENTEUR
prompted the winner two wide and tired in the drive. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH stalked the pace three wide, bid midway around the far turn and came up
empty in the lane. STARSHIP OLLIE played no factor while racing two wide. PRAKRITI was outrun while racing three wide. THIS WAS HAND-TIMED WITH
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GO LIL LADY led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off under a drive,
much the best. BEAUTIFUL ASTRAY tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and chased that rival home. RIPLEY veered out leaving the break, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three
path around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. DA JOURNEYGIRL raced off the pace on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly on the rail late. TIME PASSAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the far
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and finished evenly while never threatening. VAL'S
GAL chased the leader on the outside in the opening stages, raced three wide around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. QUICKER 'N YOU raced
off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was empty from there.

Footnotes
COUNTLESS DREAMS bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the
two path around the turn, launched a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and pulled clear in the final furlong while drifting out. TANK TOP led the field
up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, gave way in midstretch and chased the eventual winner home, the best
of the rest. OHTONQUI trailed the field on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground in late stretch. LOVE MY
JOB hit the gate leaving it, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a four wide bid headed into the turn and flattened out in
the lane. MILENITA raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three and four path, swung wider still into the stretch and was empty from there.
CURLIN'S DOVE tracked the frontrunner on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced between horses in the two path around the turn and
faded in the stretch. MI MARIA bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
CHITIENNE set a clear pace near the rail, angled into the three path turning for home, drew off under a drive then was geared down late. ADIOS BABE
stalked the winner two wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, was floated four wide turning for home, could not match strides in upper stretch and was clearly
second best. DEL REY DOLLY chased the pace two wide, lacked a rally and bested the rest. RESTLESS EYES was in range four wide and lacked a
closing bid. MORE GLORY was outrun inside. CHASING JOY bobbled at the start, chased the pace three wide between foes and retreated through the
lane. MABEE LUCKYNWILD played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
WICKED FINN raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to improve position
from the three path while racing around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. MERZAZ raced between horses in
the middle of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch.
CHAO raced off the pace in the three path in the early going, began a bid headed into the far turn, raced in the three and four path from there, dueled in
upper stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth of a mile. OSPREY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between
horses, came around the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. IN HONOR OF ARTIE trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half
mile, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses while drifting out down the lane. GINO TIME led
the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, battled from the rail around the far turn and tired in the final furlong.
NEVERSTOPDREAMING saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path
and offered no bid. ROYAL WAR pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground
around the far turn and tired further from there. BEINFUN saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued
to save ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. OCEAN RIDE raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the two path and was never a factor.

ABSOLUTE GRIT set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and drew off under a steady drive. REAL TALK pressed the winner from the
inside, angled out when that foe cleared in upper stretch, could not keep pace but stayed on for the place. PUDDING was in range four wide, lacked a rally
and held third. RESERVENOTATTAINED failed to menace while racing two wide. HIGH YIELD KITTEN was outrun inside. OLD TIME REVIVAL prompted
the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
STAR JUANCHO veered out and bumped hard with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two path around the turn, took over in midstretch and pulled clear. UNCAPTURED KING raced off the pace
between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground between horses in late stretch. UNPUBLISHED led the field up the
backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, gave way with a furlong to go and chased the winner to the wire. BAILEY
bumped extensively with the horses to either side and steadied at the break, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced four wide around the
turn and improved position mildly in the lane. AWESOME BEACH chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn
and was outkicked from there. LOUD N PROUD bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the
run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. LIVING VICARIOUSLY had extensive contact with the horses to
either side leaving the gate, took up and raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and tired
in the stretch.
