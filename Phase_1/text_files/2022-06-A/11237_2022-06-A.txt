Footnotes
UNADULTERATED led throughout, opened up while racing in the two path around the turn, and was much the best. STYLE broke a step slow and trailed,
was ridden two wide around the far turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, and ran on for place. OUR BELLA NICOLE chased along the two path, was
ridden three wide coming into the stretch, and held show. A REAL JEWEL tracked inside, was driven inside around the far turn, but faded in the stretch.
GWYNEDD stalked between foes but backed out around the turn. CAIRA prompted the pace three wide but was done after a half.

bid for the lead while two wide around the turn, was repelled but held on for place. WILLOW DRIVE tracked inside, was roused inside around the turn, and
ran on for show. SNEAKY CHEEKY was well back three wide, raced in the three path coming into the stretch, and improved late. SUNDAY SWAGGER
trailed into the stretch and was never a factor. CRYSTALOLOGY prompted the pace two wide, raced three wide into the stretch, but faded. ORBIT MARS
stalked from the three path but was tired around the turn.
