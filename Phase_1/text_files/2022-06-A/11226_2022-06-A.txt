MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained well reserved trailing the field up the backstretch, began to move up a bit
closer late on the far turn, then launched a five wide bid at the head of the lane, rallied along the outside under right handed pressure, closed gamely and
got up in final strides. SHWEET PERSUASION set the pace up the backstretch and held clear around the far turn, continued with a secure advantage a
furlong out then got caught in final strides. C H JAY tracked the pace up the backstretch, coaxed two to three wide midway around the far turn, sustained bid
into the lane and prevailed for a share. MINE MY TIME rated not too far off the early pace, hustled up three to four wide around the far turn and failed to kick
on. STAGE DOOR was reserved racing well back in early stages, hustled up two wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten. FEARLESS WILL was
forwardly placed up the backstretch and came up empty around the far turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
BLAME ELI was off a step slow at the start then settled near the inside, shifted out late on the turn, hustled up four to five wide at the head of the lane and
kicked clear mid-stretch. BUZZER raced off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and captured place. CHICAGO CHROME
dueled inside of MEGA CHARLIE in opening stages, battled on into the upper stretch, got collared by the winner leaving the furlong marker then got edged
for place. MEGA CHARLIE dueled outside of CHICAGO CHROME in opening stages and battled back into the upper stretch, got overtaken by the winner
past the furlong marker then ran on evenly late. JOE BILL chased the embattled duo around the turn then came three wide into the upper stretch and had
no late kick. R SERENGETI chased the top pair along the inside around the turn then weakened in the upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLAZE AWAY N HIDE stalked the top two leaders into the turn, angled out approaching the upper stretch, headed in pursuit of the leader, dug in under firm
handling and forged clear at the sixteenth pole. SHEMEANSBIZNESS set a pressured pace through early stages then picked up the pace and held clear
into the lane, continued with the advantage a furlong out then got overtaken in the final sixteenth. SIMMERING tracked the top trio near the inside then
angled out around the turn, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and gained a share. DEMIDANU applied pace pressure to
SHEMEANZBUISNESS in early stages and remained forwardly placed around the turn, then flattened out in the lane. SAMIRA raced off the pace, saved
ground into the lane and never threatened. RAINBOW SUREBET raced three to four wide and had no response.

OYL raced near midpack in early stages, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. PEGGY RULES was unhurried and
raced in the back, picked up the pace three to four wide heading into the lane and rallied for a share. ATHENAS SONG raced off the early pace, swung five
wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. GOLD MAKER sped to the lead soon after the start, held clear around the turn, continued with
response into the upper stretch then got overtaken by the winner and gave way. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO was ridden along the inside around the turn and
offered no late bid. DAMASCUS GATE was forwardly placed in early stages, sustained a bid along the rail through the turn then came up empty in the final
furlong. BAYLEYWICK was ridden along three to four wide near midpack into the turn then gave way in the upper stretch.
