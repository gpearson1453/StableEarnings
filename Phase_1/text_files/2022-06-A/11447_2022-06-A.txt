Footnotes
T BONES TRICK, a bit outpaced in early stages, tracked the leaders from well out of striking distance along the inside to the backstretch, swung out four
wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride in the final furlong to just edge TASHKENT in time under firm encouragement. The latter broke
readily, tracked off the first flight under rating in the opening half, steadily gained on the pacesetter three deep on the far turn to wrest the advantage racing
through upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner. PERFECT DUDE broke out bumping ROAMING UNION, was righted, then pulled his way to the lead
along the inside disputing the issue under rating into the backstretch, edged forward racing through the far turn but was collared nearing midstretch.
ROAMING UNION, bumped at the start, was urged pressing the pace outside a rival to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. UNITED PATRIOT
settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn but offered no rally.

Footnotes
FADED MEMORIES was rated off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted to the rail nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, came through
to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. SILLY NOTION was settled out of striking distance racing through the
backstretch, angled five wide entering upper stretch and produced a solid late response to prove best of the others. WILDLY DRAMATIC, off slowly, was
urged to terms with the first flight in the opening quarter prompting the pace, drifted out entering the lane and gave way. HONEY PARADE was hustled up
the rail pressing the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage entering the lane but gave way once headed by the winner leaving the furlong marker.
GRAND SLAM HOMERUN broke readily, vied for command between foes through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue into the lane and gave
way midstretch. JUST SPLENDID settled last in early stages and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders in that path nearing
the lane, but responded to stout pressure to close the gap and wrest the advantage in time. CANDY COVE broke awkwardly, was urged between foes to
gain a position just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, prompted that rival between foes racing into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing
upper stretch, maintained the advantage to late stages but just failed to contain the winner. CONQUEST COBRA tracked off the second flight along the
inside, saved ground on the far turn, then tipped off the inside in late to prevail narrowly for a share between rivals. JIMMY'S MARCO broke sharply,
sprinted to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn into upper stretch and gave way late.
BUXTERHOOTER settled into stride off the inside in the opening half, swung five wide racing into upper stretch but made no impact. SHOTGUN RIDER
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight in the opening half, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and steadily faded. LOVE MY BOSS proved
no factor.

HOLD THE SPICE, off slowly, was settled las to the backstretch, switched outside foes gaining position racing into the far turn, swung four wide entering
upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. LORING PARK was urged prompting the pace outside a rival
from the outset to the backstretch, edged forward of that foe on the far turn, was roused to resist a challenge from TRI SPOT racing past midstretch but
couldn't fend off the winner. GABRIEL'S LEGEND was reserved while angling to the rail racing to the first turn tracking behind the second flight, was caught
in tight quarters entering the far turn, continued inside foes gaining position into the lane, then shifted out four wide in the last furlong to prevail for a share.
TRI SPOT tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide nearing the far turn, shifted inwards entering
the second bend to loom three deep nearing upper stretch, challenged for command entering the lane but flattened out late. TALENT AND TRICKS was
urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. MYSTIFIER tracked off the first flight between
foes in the opening half, was held up in tight quarters racing into the far turn and soon gave way. DIRECT ACTION was prompted to a position inside foes in
second flight while racing in tight quarters along the rail into the first turn, continued in close quarters into the backstretch tracking off the first flight along the
inside to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. FEEDING FRENZY tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, was shuffled a bit
avoiding tight quarters entering the far turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BROTHER HAROLD was urged to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the far turn to upper
stretch but maintained the advantage to the end under firm encouragement. GUEST CHECK tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to gain striking distance between foes entering the far turn, continued to prompt the leader past midstretch but proved only
second best. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA was rated off the second flight racing four wide into the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide on the far
turn into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. UNCLE AL'S PAL angled to the inside tracking off the first flight in the opening half but steadily faded
racing into the far turn. FOUND JORDAN, off slowly, tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn.
WARBUCKS settled last and proved no factor. LANAKILA was urged pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way early. K C'S FIRST B M W
stumbled badly at the start dislodging his rider. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ARDANWOOD, forwardly placed along the rail attending a rival's pace, edged clear racing into the far turn, tipped a bit off the rail racing into the stretch and
held safe the challenge of RUNAWAY HARRY to the end under firm encouragement. The latter angled inwards racing to the backstretch tracking off the first
flight, tipped out racing into stretch while advancing on the leader to challenge but proved only second best. PORTSMOUTH was rated along the inside
tracking the leaders from out of striking distance in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn to the stretch and continued along the inside to gain
position to the end. SEEKING SPLENDOR was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside on the far turn and continued
evenly while proving no real threat. CALZONE ducked inwards at the start, was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. UNTOLD
STORY settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. P R CALL ME MAYBE was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner
and gave way racing into the far turn. SWAMPDRAINER tracked the leaders outside rivals just off the second flight, was prompted to advance outside foes
nearing the far turn, then clipped heels with the P R CALL ME MAYBE entering the far turn dislodging his rider.

BOLD MINISTER tracked off the first flight outside rivals in early stages, advanced three deep into the turn to press the pace, edged forward midstretch and
maintained a safe advantage under firm handling. MY DOMINATOR, off slowly, was settled last in the opening stages, commenced a steady advance four
wide into the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane but finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. WARRIOR BOSS angled to the inside
tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, switched out to race in the four path in upper stretch while being urged to advance but was outkicked
for second. ENOUGH NONSENSE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch and gave way
in late stages. MAGIC CARPET settled along the inside early, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly. HOLY MUCHACHO switched off the inside in
early stages to track off the first flight between foes but steadily faded racing into the turn. IMA SUNNY SONG was urged pressing the pace between foes
from the outset to the turn, gave way early.

Footnotes
KARALINKA was rated off the second flight along the inside through the backstretch, shifted outside foes gaining position nearing upper stretch, swung out
four wide entering the lane while being prompted to advance and wrested the advantage late under steady handling. HAMAZING LACE was urged four
wide, then three wide into the turn pursuing the pacesetter, moved to terms with the leaders dueling for command into the lane and prevailed for the place
honors late. AND ISLES, held up momentarily in close quarters at the break, switched outside foes to track the leaders in second flight, then tipped out five
wide in the final sixteenth to gain some position while earning a share. YELLOW DRESS angled inwards while being urged to terms prompting the
pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue between foes to midstretch but yielded late. MICKEY DOBBS broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the
pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside foes through the turn to midstretch but gave out in late stages. WHAT NOW MY LOVE was urged
along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN never proved a factor.
