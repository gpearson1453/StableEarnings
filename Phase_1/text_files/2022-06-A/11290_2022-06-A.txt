the turn then came again wide to gain the place. I'M BLAMING YOU dropped far behind then showed good late energy very wide. HOISTTHEMAINSAIL set
a clear pace inside, vied through the turn then proved empty in the final furlong. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN engaged the pacesetter on the turn, dueled to the
stretch and faded. DON'T RECALL lagged far behind then passed a stopping opponent. SAPONARA stumbled at the start, saved ground close up then
gave way readily.

TONAL VISION angled inside on the first turn, engaged the pacesetters, dueled throughout and battled gamely holding rival safe through the final furlong.
FLASHNDYNAMITE lunged at the start, was well placed behind the dueling leaders, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. SHERO vied three
then two wide and weakened in the final furlong. BUCKS SOME allowed to settle outside, moved wide on the final turn and lacked a bid. LIKE A PRO
dropped far behind near the inside and was never in contention. BILLIEANNE alternated for the lead between rivals to the quarter pole and tired.
