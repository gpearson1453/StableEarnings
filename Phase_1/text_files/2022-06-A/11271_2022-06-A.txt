Footnotes
SUNGOLD BEAUTY broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the rail
entering the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive, and finished determinedly to get up in the final strides. SHARPZAN tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled for the lead from the outside of A TREE OF LIFE entering the final turn, took the narrowest of leads
into the stretch and just failed to last. TEXAS LEGACY away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing in the middle of the track,
continued with a wide trip while rallying seven wide through the final turn, and finished willingly six wide in the drive. A TREE OF LIFE away alertly and
rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, held an uncontested lead in the run down the backside, battled from the inside of SHARPZAN
through the final turn, struggled to keep pace with that rival entering the lane, and faded late. SOLANDER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was
always well back and failed to make his presence felt.

Footnotes
MR. QUALITY settled well off a contested early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final
turn, shifted three wide for the drive, overhauled the leader in mid stretch and drew clear late. YOUNG VIGILANTE tracked the dueling leaders in the run
down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, but
was no match when tackled by MR. QUALITY in mid stretch, but proved clearly second best. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and dueled for the lead into the
backstretch from the outside of CALAMAZEUS, took control one out from the rail entering the final turn but was quickly taken on by YOUNG VIGILANTE,
was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and faded in the stretch drive. DEBATABLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering
the backstretch, commenced his bid three out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive but failed to mount a serious late bid.
CALAMAZEUS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of FOOT SOLDIER in the
run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong.

ROCKCLIFFE rushed up from along the rail to take a narrow advantage into the turn, opened a clear lead through the turn and continued to widened his
advantage late under confident handling. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND away alertly and chased the leader three wide into the turn, angled towards the rail
entering the lane, and finished willingly to prove clearly second best. LILSISTERLEE broke sharply and chased the leader into the turn while racing one out
from the rail, was no match for the winner through the final furlong and was outfinished in the drive while holding on for a share. MATSQUI lacked the
needed early speed to contend for the lead in the run to the turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. INSIDE
CONNECTION was off a step slow, and trailed the field throughout, but found her best stride late, while never a threat.

THE ALL BUTTON tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering
the final turn, tipped three wide leaving the turn to engage the leaders, took command in deep stretch and held off a late surge from OUREVELADY to
prevailed. OUREVELADY unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final
turn, and altered course four wide in deep stretch and closed with a rush to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME broke sharply and pressed the pace from the
outside of LITTLE GROOT in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn from the outside of that rival, and
closed determinedly one out from the rail in the drive, but was unable to match strides with the top pair in the closing strides. LITTLE GROOT away alertly
and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, and battled gamely to mid stretch before giving was grudgingly late.

BAKKEN OVERDRIVE tracked the leaders while under snug restraint from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, bumped repeatedly with DON W
entering the final turn and quickly assumed command, held a clear advantage into the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. DON W away well and
pressed the pace one out from the rail entering he backstretch, was bumped repeatedly by BAKKEN OVERDRIVE entering the final turn, chased that rival
through the turn while racing three wide, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. WISELY PLAYED settled well off the
early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied four wide into the final turn, and closed steadily seven wide in the drive to get up for a share.
GREYTOGO away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn and finished
one out from the rail in the drive. RIMFIRE unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the backstretch, began to launch his bid from along
the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride three wide in the drive while improving his position. ALL LIQUORD UP raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of DON W in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides
when overtaken by BAKKEN OVERDRIVE entering the final turn, and faded in the late going. JOSE JOSE stalked the leaders in the run down the backside
while being carried four out from the rail, checked briefly approaching the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon. HE'S A SAINT stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, began to drop back approaching the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong.
Following the running of this race there were two jockey claims of foul. The rider's of both JOSE JOSE and DON W lodged claims of foul against the rider of
BAKKEN OVERDRIVE for alleged interference entering the final turn. After review the one claim of foul was upheld, and BAKKEN OVERDRIVE was
disqualified from first and placed second for causing interference to DON W entering the final turn

SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while saving ground through the stretch the first time, pulled himself into a tracking trip from along the rail in the
run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail through the final turn, assumed command soon after entering the lane, and held off a late run
by ARCH PRINCE to prove best. ARCH PRINCE away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first
time, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, angled five wide in mid stretch and finished with a rush. MY COLLEGE FUND stalked
the leaders through the stretch while racing three out from the rail, began to advance upon entering the backside and took a narrow advantage into the final
turn, but was unable to fend off the top pair late while finishing two wide in the drive. COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
launched his bid three wide entering the final urn, but was unable to sustain that bid in deep stretch. MCMURPHY broke sharply and vied for the lead from
along the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, was overtaken entering
the final turn, and outfinished over the final furlong. FREE FOR SURE settled off the early pace while racing four wide through the stretch the first time,
continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied six wide through the final turn, and was unable to make a serious late impact while
finishing seven wide in the drive. KNOPFLER stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide
approaching the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. GUNS N AMMO away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of MCMURPHY through
the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of PRETTY ARIA entering the backstretch, continued to battle with that
rival through the final turn, and prevailed in the final strides over a very stubborn foe. PRETTY ARIA away well and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the final turn, and down the lane, and just failed to fend off her pace rival in the
closing strides. BELLAROO tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing between rivals, rallied two wide through the final turn,
was no match late for the top pair, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. IRISH LUNA away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run
down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but had little to offer late. DON'T TESS ME tracked the
dueling leaders in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, continued three wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
