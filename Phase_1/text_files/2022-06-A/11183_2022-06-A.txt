Footnotes
MARK OF VALOR was quick to take the lead, dictated terms racing off the rail in about the two path, asked for run in upper stretch, extended the advantage
then held safe under moderate late urging. OPTION broke well but was soon outpaced, chased the winner from outside going three wide on the turn, proved
no match but was second best. SLIM CHANCE shifted in about the half-mile marker, saved ground on the turn, switched outside a rival near the furlong
marker, ran on to secure show honors. SIR BARNABUS switched out heading to the half, raced in the two path through the turn well back of the leader,
drifted in a bit in upper stretch and had no late kick. FLY WITH CLASS broke just a bit awkwardly, raced mostly two to three wide and failed to rally.
BLAZEN BLUFF chased the leading pair racing outside, pulled up through the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BOOTLEGGIN POSSE exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward inside to press the early pace, took command at the half, edged clear soon
after, drew away in the stretch under stout urging. STILLWATER BROWN contended between runners early, chased the winner two to three wide on the
turn and was asked for more outside the quarter pole but was no match. UNCLE AL'S PAL exchanged a light bump at the start, settled off the leaders
outside going two to four wide through much of the turn, swung six deep turning for home, gained mildly but missed the place. WARBUCKS switched off the
inside early, went three to four wide on the turn moving five deep out of that bend, passed a tired rival in the lane. WILDCAT HAGRID was forwardly-placed
outside contending for the early lead three to four wide, came up empty. FOUND JORDAN was off slowly and shut off at the start, raced off the inside early,
shifted in later up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE MOXY stalked the leaders from outside going four to five wide, took aim in the stretch and under steady handling drove past late. FLASH
FLOOD moved forwardly inside to take the lead at the half, was soon pressured by an outside rival, dueled with that one through the turn to mid- to
late-stretch, put that rival away with a narrow lead but was outkicked by another. STONE ARCH BRIDGE settled in to stalk the leaders, made a swift move
between foes about the seven-sixteenths to force the issue, dueled two to three wide to mid-stretch then faltered and faded. MADISONIAN shifted in
heading into the turn, saved ground but failed to rally. MINKOTA JOY settled off the leaders, went two wide on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch
but made no bids. HOT HABANERO set the early pace racing well off the inside, began to drop back heading to the turn going three to four wide on that
bend and appeared to be corrected to keep course about the five-sixteenths, came up empty thereafter.

Footnotes
LET'S SKEDADDLE lightly bumped the outside foe at the break, switched outside that one early heading to the first turn, stalked three wide, edged closer
and took command by the quarter pole still racing three wide, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. IF YOU WANT IT tracked in behind the
leaders two then three wide early, continued toward the rear three deep on the far turn, came out leaving that bend for room, rallied to get up for second
while no threat to the winner. GOOD MONGOLIA was forwardly-placed four wide into the first turn, shifted in early up the backstretch, tracked in behind the
pace near the rail, came out three wide coming past the quarter pole, moved into second nearing the sixteenth pole but lost that position late. FALL MOON
shifted in heading to the first turn then moved out from two to four wide on that bend, made a swift advance outside rivals to take closer order on the
pacesetter heading up the backstretch but could not sustain such an effort and weakened thereafter. HOITY TOITY saved ground through both turns but
failed to rally. BRUCE'S GIRL shifted to the rail soon after the break, saved ground bringing up the rear, moved out on the far turn fanning five wide into the
stretch, failed to menace. COST A FORTUNE was bumped ever so lightly at the start, quickly moved clear to set the pace racing of the rail, gave way in the
stretch.

Footnotes
THRILL RIDE switched outside the leading trio stalking those up the backstretch, took closer order four wide on the turn, dueled in upper- to mid-stretch
then edged clear under steady urging. MAGIC CASTLE was forced out at the start, stalked just off the pace three wide, moved to the lead about the
five-sixteenths, dueled with the winner and was overtaken in the vicinity of the furlong marker while clearly second best. MARQUEE RIDE exchanged minor
light brushes in the early going, saved ground inside rivals at the back through much of the turn, angled out five wide leaving that bend, ran on to secure
show honors. MR. COUGAR exchanged light brushes early, raced between foes into the turn two wide, moved out a path to advance past a rival on that
bend then was carried six wide into upper stretch, ran on. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM raced outside foes at the rear, moved out from three to four wide on the turn,
was carried seven wide into upper stretch, moved inward a bit later and failed to rally. MISAWA broke outwardly and was strongly urged thereafter, forced
the pace two wide into the turn, was overtaken about midway on that bend, came out just a bit turning for home then angled back in and turned up empty.
UNEMBELLISHED had brief speed inside, faltered and faded.

ROLLIN BLACKOUT bumped the outside rival at the start, settled three wide early, edged closer on the far turn moving out from three to five wide on that
bend, dueled in late stretch and just prevailed. XTREME GEM stalked the pace mostly three wide, engaged the leader to duel through upper and
mid-stretch then faced a new challenger in late stretch, was all out but just missed. FORTUNATA was bumped at the start, moved forward with mild coaxing
moving in from four to three wide on the first turn, tracked the pacesetter before moving to take over two wide about the seven-sixteenths, was challenged
turning for home, dueled gamely then yielded grudgingly late. WAR MUSIC , unhurried early racing three wide and well back, continued near the rear four
wide on the far turn, moved out seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. WINTER MUSIC was forced four wide on the first turn, moved nearer
the leader still four wide heading into the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. INNOVATE steadied after the start when in tight, settled well back near inside,
moved out to take closer order four wide on the far turn, evened out in the drive. BONES AND ROSES tracked close-up two to three wide in somewhat tight
quarters early on the first turn and again up the backstretch, came out a bit for the stretch run and failed to rally. TEMPORARILY veered in a bit after the
break, steadied slightly entering the first turn when in tight going two wide on that bend, moved to the rail before the far turn, had room inside turning for
home but could not threaten. WREXHAM was pulling against the rider's restraint and moved clear to set the pace in the two path, came up empty. NINE
CROWNS saved ground on the first turn, moved out and went two to three wide on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
MAJOR ATTRACTION stalked four wide, was carried six wide into the stretch, took over and kicked clear then was eased up late. MARVELOUS THUNDER
settled into stride, went four to five wide on the turn, moved out further in upper stretch and was lightly bumped twice in mid-stretch, put forth a solid late
effort to get up for place. YANKEE INDIAN pursued three wide into the turn, altered inside the drifting leader two deep on that bend, kept on and shared the
minor award. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY chased after the leaders lacking sufficient early speed, went three to four wide on the turn, came out in upper- to
mid-stretch and bumped a rival lightly several times, kept on to share show honors. RIDING THE TRAIN moved forward inside rivals but off the fence to set
the tempo into the turn, drifted five wide on that bend, had no extra in the drive to maintain a placing. AMERICAN UNION shifted in, steadied slightly when in
tight about the three-eighths, saved ground and failed to menace. SKY CONFIDENTIAL settled off the pace, shifted in from two wide to nearer the rail early
on the turn, made a bid inside coming to the top of the stretch but flattened out. ENOUGH NONSENSE was hard-ridden from the break chasing four wide
into the turn, bore out on that bend.
