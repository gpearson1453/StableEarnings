ABOUT THE MULTIPLE dueled along the inside, shook loose into the stretch then pulled away while kept to his task. TOUGH WORKOUT alternated for the
lead outside with the winner to the stretch then weakened. GO SKIPPY GO lagged far behind inside, continued along the rail and closed well while no
threat. SOCIAL JOE bumped early, chased far back then showed some energy outside. WORLD REGARD raced off the leaders inside and began fading on
the turn. STASH MY CASH hustled three wide off the pace and lacked a rally. DOWNTOWN CRUMLIN was urged just off the pace three wide, asked for
run into the far turn but stopped.

throughout and made a gradual gain in the stretch. BOSSMAN JONES prompted the pace outside throughout and continued willingly. JOHNNY SACK
trailed early inside, angled wide down the backstretch and made a mild bid. MY BROTHER NEIL was fanned wide on the first turn then weakened steadily.

VEDAREO quickly moved clear with a burst of speed, led in hand, repelled a stretch challenge under urging and stayed safe in the late stages. BET OF
THE CENTURY went after the winner into the stretch then raced an erratic course ducking in and out while racing very greenly. BOSS LIKE BETH broke
alertly and pursued the winner and continued willingly while no match for the top duo. WINGS OF A SONG was urged close up briefly then began fading on
the turn. ACCENDO lacked speed, chased wide and was never a factor. LA CHANCE dropped far behind and was always outrun. STORMIN' ELVIS
squeezed back at the start, made a brief bid on the turn then gave way. HAWAIIAN TALENT ducked out at the start crowding a rival then trailed.

HIGH OPINION steadied briefly early, stalked the dueling leaders outside, bid three wide into the stretch, collared the leaders and edged to the front in a
long drive. TIC TIC TIC BOOM well placed in the two path, dropped back on the final turn then came again wide late in a determined showing. WICKED
GROOVE rated just off the pacesetter, vied through the final turn, led in midstretch and continued gamely to the finish. DECIDING VOTE settled inside,
saved ground throughout but lacked a solid rally. TIGHTLY TWISTED moved clear inside, widened before the half, dueled through the turn, lost the
advantage and continued gamely. OUT OF SORTS wide on the first turn, angled inside then back out in the stretch and was no threat. GLADYS steadied
along racing into the first turn, crowded and impeded inside rival then raced wide and was no menace. B B'S BUSTED placed in tight entering the first turn,
struck the rail and bobbled causing her to lose her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry concerning the incident into the first turn.

Footnotes
GUNFYRE GAL quickly rushed to the front, repelled a challenge at the quarter pole then drew away again in a brisk hand ride. HIDDEN CACHE pressed
the winner outside, bid at the quarter pole, was no match but easily second best. HEAVENLY PRAISE raced close up wide throughout then flattened out in
the stretch. OUR JESSICA JOAN lacked speed, moved outside on the turn and was no threat. SPRINKLE THIS dropped back early, moved very wide on
the turn and faded. METANOIA trailed early, awaited room briefly on the turn and was no factor. SPARKLING WATER far back early, bid extremely wide on
the turn and gave way. WHY NOT BABE stumbled at the start, was taken up inside on the turn and outrun. TURBIE flashed speed for a quarter mile then
began stopping on the turn.

JUMP SHOT stalked wide, bid to the front on the turn, moved clear in the stretch, was collared from his inside then came again to get the nod. GET THE W
settled inside, advanced along the rail, held a brief lead but was nailed. WHAT'S TO BLAME lacked speed, moved closer on the turn, angled out and
closed. SILVER EDGE was urged close up between rivals, swung wide in the stretch with a mild rally. MR. ROUNDTREE raced just off the pace between
rivals and proved empty in the stretch. FOX RED dueled along the inside then was finished after half a mile. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE alternated for the lead
outside and faltered after half a mile. JAMMINWITHBRANDON dropped far behind racing very wide and was no factor. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE dropped
back early, moved wide on the turn and lacked a bid. FUTILE chased far behind and was never in contention. JUPI'S LIGHTNING broke slowly, was asked
for run inside and stopped abruptly.
