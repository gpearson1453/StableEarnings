Footnotes
HE'S NOT CURLY took the lead at the rail leaving the seven eighths pole and rated with a slim advantage, came under pressure and dueled at even terms
nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and dug in under steady encouragement to just last. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF rounded the
opening turn about the four path then saved ground into the second turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, eased to the three
path into the lane, dueled through the stretch for second and just missed the win. DARK AGES rounded the first turn about the three path then stalked from
the seven eighths pole, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths, ran in the three path of the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR had the early lead and raced with the pace two deep, dug in from the five sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at a close
disadvantage but dropped back leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride. THE IRON BANK saved ground, mostly.

ROCKET'S CASTLE was shut off at the break then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in leaving the eighth
pole and got up the final yards. FIGAROS FORTUNE pressured the pace at even terms, took the nod past the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear leaving the
quarter, ran at the rail on the turn, was steadily handled, but gave up the lead in the final yards. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN set a pressured pace between
horses, ceded the advantage leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. GANGHIS KHAN chased,
rounded the turn about the four path then flattened the final sixteenth. READY FOR CLASS gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and passed
rivals outside. GHOST MINE pressured the early pace at near even terms, steadied from tight quarters at the rail nearing the quarter pole and weakened.
IRISH FIRE gave chase through the backstretch then faded on the turn. COOL DUDE ducked in at the break, gave chase through the backstretch, though,
never factored. COMEONTURNMELOOSE broke a stp slow then saved ground. This race was hand timed.

steady stretch handling. CHANGE THE WORLD moved to the inside and rated the early pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that
point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and had to settle for second best. CHEROKEE CASTLE rated close toward the inside, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the lane but showed little further in the lane. BAYS CASTLE
raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn then angled to the outside leaving the turn, bid past the three eighths pole, ran in the six path of the far
turn and passed rivals outside. WHALE OF A TIME became a bit fractious behind, and in the gate, rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths,

Footnotes
CHARLIE POTATOES saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and circled rivals in the five path of the far turn, took the lead into
the lane and dug in determinedly to edge out the stretch effort of HAPPY CHAMP, who settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BIG HAMBONE
rated close off the rail then closed to the front at the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. AWESOME BUZZ ronded the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through
the far turn four and five wide and ran evenly in the lane. MOSS BOSS ran in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but showed little response. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) rated close about the three path then challenged toward the three eighths pole, continued close two
deep on the far turn but steadied between horses at the head of the lane and weakened. SCOTTSDALE closed to the lead two deep into the first turn and
raced clear midway through the turn, was caught at the three eighths pole, steadied at the five sixteenths and faded readily on the far turn.
