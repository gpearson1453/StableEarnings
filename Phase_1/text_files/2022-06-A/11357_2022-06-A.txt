Footnotes
SHARP AZA TACK hustled from the gate, vied three deep to the five-sixteenths pole, fought with KID AZTECA to the quarter pole then shook free shortly
after and inched away under a drive. PARK CITY chased outside a rival out of range, went two then three wide on the turn, put in a mild late bid and ran on
to gain second. ZOOKEEPER vied between rivals to the five-sixteenths, could not keep up late on the turn, chased two wide into the stretch and kept on to
regain the show. KID AZTECA vied for command from inside, fought with the winner to the quarter pole, chased that rival into the stretch, flattened late and
was edged for the show. MAJOR NYQUIST showed brief speed between rivals then chased the top trio leaving the backstretch, entered the turn along the
inside then shifted to the two path, tipped out with a sixteenth remaining but lacked the needed late punch. PRESIDENT Z brushed the gate and came away
slow, saved ground near the back around the turn, came off the rail then shifted in at the eighth pole and failed to threaten. MENDEZ MILE chased off the
rail, ran up on heels and had to pause at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and could not rally. BEAR
MOUNTAIN broke a step slow, raced between early then dropped to the back, went two to three wide around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
STARSHIP DEFIANT sprinted clear quickly, controlled the pace to the far turn, ridden along a bit off the rail leaving the turn, put to right then left-handed
urging in the lane and drew away. BOSSY SOUL broke a step slow, stalked in the two path around the first turn, moved further off the rail on the
backstretch, coaxed three then two wide on the far turn, finished willingly down the lane but had to settle for second best. ZAHRA broke a step slow, stalked
three deep around the first turn, rounded the second bend four then three wide and failed to respond in the stretch. BEST OF SHOW broke a step slow from
outside, forwardly placed four deep on the clubhouse turn, remained wide up the backstretch, traveled four wide into the second bend then angled down to
the two path while losing ground and had little left for the drive. DISCRETE STEVIE B was off slow to begin, moved down to the inside, dropped back on the
backstretch, faded on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
SELL THE DREAM broke inward then went up to take control from inside, set the pace with company to the outside, kicked clear past the three-eighths
pole, held a comfortable lead into the final sixteenth and held safely under urging. QUARANTELLA brushed from outside at the start, chased off the rail then
moved inside, raced greenly past the three-eighths pole, lacked room behind a wall of runners past the quarter pole, steered to the rail at the top of the lane,
moved off the rail and ran on late but could not get to the winner. GREEN EYED LADY broke in and brushed rival at the start, settled off the pace, angled
four wide leaving the turn, finished willingly but needed to find more in the late stages. COURT SNORT hustled from the gate then steadied briefly early,
chased the top pair along the rail into the turn, checked inside of CHERRY CHAOS past the five-sixteenths pole, moved off the rail in the stretch and lacked
a serious bid. DADDY CLASSY DILL bobbled leaving the gate, forwardly placed outside a rival up the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and
weakened. BUBBLES FOR MIA dropped back under coaxing early, raced a bit off the rail through the turn and showed mild late interest in the stretch but
failed to make an impact. IDA NEEDA DRINK broke slow and spotted the field several lengths, trailed up the backstretch, went three then two wide around
the bend and was never a factor. CHERRY CHAOS pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader past the three-eighths pole, raced a big green
near the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
SO IT WOULD SEEM stumbled leaving the gate but still came away quickest, set the pace under pressure then cleared entering the turn, drew away when
roused in upper stretch, widened in the final furlong and coasted in late. SWEET HEIDELBERG broke out, stalked off the rail then three wide around the
turn, failed to make any headway on the winner in the stretch but was clearly second best. PRINCESS CATERINA broke awkwardly, tracked from inside up
the backstretch, lost ground through the turn, kept to task in the lane and passed tired rivals to gain the show. PAULINA'S STAR was off slow and bothered
from inside at the start, chased three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened. HAUTE LADY pressed the pace from outside up the
backstretch, could not keep pace with the leader into the turn, chased two wide around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
BUD KNIGHT dueled outside a rival into the first turn, cleared three then two wide around that bend, controlled the pace to the stretch, put to right-handed
urging and drew away in the final furlong. HOOP DREAM settled inside, tipped to the two path on the far turn and raced a bit off the rail into the stretch,
moved out in the lane, rallied between rivals and gained the place. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) dueled for command into the first turn then chased the
leader leaving the bend, coaxed along the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane then steered out further in upper stretch and got outkicked
for second. GOLDINI forwardly placed three wide early then outside a rival on the backstretch, took aim at the winner two wide on the second bend, gave
chase through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick and got edged for the place and show. EGOMANIA raced in tight and steadied entering the first
turn, asked three to four wide on the second bend and failed to rally. KIMMER pulled a bit nearing the first turn, stalked in the two path then got floated out
briefly to the three path on the far turn, shifted to the rail at the top of the stretch and lacked further response. ROSENQUIST got crowded soon after the
start, went three wide around the first turn at the back, moved inside and saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and was not a factor.

ANNIE GRAHAM came out leaving the gate but was quickly corrected and hustled to a forward position, pressed the pace past the half-mile pole, took over
past the five-sixteenths pole, shook free into the stretch, kept to task through the final furlong and held safely. VELLA stumbled a bit leaving the gate, trailed
along the inside into the turn, remained inside to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and finished with a late rally to earn the place. INCREASE STAKES
stalked along the inside, eased off the rail and entered the lane two to three wide, angled out further in the stretch and could not find more in the late stages.
TIZZY TWISTER hopped leaving the gate, chased three wide around the turn and could not rally. DRIZELLA took control early then showed the way up the
backstretch while pressure by the winner to the outside, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up into the stretch and gave way.

GILLIAN ELIZABETH chased on the inside, lacked room behind AVENTAPP and altered outside that rival at the eighth pole, rallied between and drove past
late. M IS FOR MAGIC stalked outside a rival, went two then three wide around the turn, bid four deep in the stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole but got
outkicked by the winner in the closing moments. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) raced up close to the outside of the leader early on, bid two wide leaving the bend,
took a short lead in upper stretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and fought on to the wire. AVENTAPP sped clear and crossed over to the inside,
challenged leaving the turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened late. FOUNDER'S DAY hopped at the start, trailed early then passed a few rivals
into and around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. ROSES AND CANDY got bumped from outside leaving the gate, brushed crossing surfaces early,
pulled early on, chased three wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch and could not respond when called upon. NEVER SWAY broke in and bumped
rival leaving the gate, raced three deep then outside a rival, trailed two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) got pinballed leaving

Footnotes
LISETTE angled off the inside on the first turn and chased three wide into the backstretch, drew alongside the top pair, bid three on the far turn, reached the
front approaching the eighth pole and inched ahead in the final sixteenth to prove best. TAYET took control early and moved inside, set the pace with both
rivals alongside up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path into the stretch, lost command approaching the eighth pole where the rider lost the whip
and stayed on from inside the winner to the wire. SUNNY LANE pressed the pace from outside in the early going, coaxed between rivals at the
seven-sixteenths pole, could not go on with the top pair around the far turn, trailed four wide into the lane, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BOURBON sat off the pace in the two path, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, roused while tipping three wide on the far turn, angled out
at the top of the lane, rallied five wide in the stretch, took over past the eighth pole and gamely prevailed. IN YOUR FACE sat off the pace outside a rival,
moved inside for the far turn, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, split foes then moved down to the inside,
surged late and missed. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) broke a step slow in the beginning, became rank entering the first turn, swung four wide into the
stretch and angled out widest at the top of the stretch, closed well but lacked the needed late kick while earning the show. TIZ A MACHO GIRL stalked from
inside early, moved closer up the backstretch, tipped two wide and bid between rivals leaving the far turn, bumped with TEAM CONCEPT in upper stretch,
fought into deep stretch but got outkicked by the top pair and was edged for the show. TEAM CONCEPT away well in the beginning, ceded control and
rated in the two path, bid two then three wide on the far turn, vied three deep into the lane, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, held a short lead into the
final furlong, was overtaken soon after and flattened late. WETHERLY sped clear and pulled the rider along early, showed the way to the far turn, vied with a
pair of rivals into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, got pinched along the rail and checked midstretch and weakened. NANG SINGHA checked in
tight early, tucked inside on the first turn, raced near the back then trailed on the far turn, came out in the stretch and was not a factor. LADY BLACKBIRD
checked in tight early, stalked outside a rival then moved closer in the middle stages, urged two wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and came up
empty. ADELE DARLING off slow to begin, hard to ride early on, eased on the backstretch, pulled up on the far turn and walked off.
