Footnotes
VANQUISHER dueled briefly, easily moved clear after quarter mile, widened in the stretch and proved much the best while ridden out. LADY BREXIT
pursued the winner in the two path and continued gamely for the place. WONDER CITY settled off the pace three wide, advanced on the final turn and
finished willingly. STUY TOWN BABY forced the pace briefly then faded after half a mile. BLUNT FORCE chased off the leaders inside and lacked a rally.
NATOMA dwelt at the start losing any chance then raced far back throughout. GLOWING STAR dropped back after the start and was never in contention.

WORLD PARTY trailed early, bid into the stretch, angled inside rivals through the stretch and surged off. DECISIVE CAUSE chased outside, continued wide
on the turn then closed well outside. TOURING MARYANNE lacked speed near the inside then finished nicely along the rail. SEA FRET dueled along the
inside then faltered through the stretch. SEVEN YEARS LATER alternated for the lead inside then collapsed after the finish. ARUMA lacked speed outside,
continued very wide with mild bid. GONE DREAMING saved ground off the pace, was asked for run on the turn then faded. NANA'S BOOPA rated behind
the dueling leaders, bid three wide to the front on the turn then proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS DILLINGHAM set a measured pace inside, moved clear on the final turn then drew off under moderate urging. GOLDEN GRANT settled outside, bid
into the far turn then continued gamely while no match for the winner. OBSTINATE fractious in the gate, dropped back, chased wide on the final turn and
was no factor. ASSUME CONTROL was reserved close up inside then flattened out in the stretch. TOMARIE prompted the winner for five furlongs and
weakened. MISS LOYALTY raced wide throughout and lacked a rally. CHARITY STRIPE trailed far behind early andwas never in contention. FED POLICY
firmly rated inside, faltered after half a mile.
