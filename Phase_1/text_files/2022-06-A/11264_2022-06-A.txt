Footnotes
BIG ANDY, off last, switched outside rivals midway through the backstretch gathering momentum, steadily gained on the leaders four wide racing into the
turn, moved to wrest command in the three path nearing upper stretch, went well clear under mild hand urging and was ridden out. SAILSINTHESUNSET
broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing into the turn, proved no match when confronted by the winner but was best of the
others. SWEET HONOR tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, raced in hand momentarily midway through the turn when caught in
tight quarters, angled out entering the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. DISTINCT APPROVAL, urged inside rivals disputing the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. PURPLE SCOOTER switched out three wide in early stages while being prompted
to advance, made a brief bid in that path entering the turn and emptied out early.

TOP DOG settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm
handling. MAGIC REVOLUTION switched off the inside early tracking the pacesetter between foes to the far turn, was urged to bid for command between
foes entering upper stretch, contested the issue inside the winner to late stages but was just outkicked. JACKS WILLIE sprinted to the lead while angling to
the inside racing to the first turn, held sway on a narrow advantage to upper stretch but was collared late. VIVO tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing to the far turn but had no closing bid. TANTIMA tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the
far turn.

winner but couldn't gain terms with that rival. HEART ON THE RUN set the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing to to the bend, angled inside
nearing the lane and gave way. MORGS WORLD stumbled badly at at the start and made no impression thereafter. OLIVIAN, forwardly placed along the
inside in early stages, continued evenly into the turn and faded into upper stretch.

NOTE PAD was settled last racing to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, gained on the leaders in tandem with a rival on the far
turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch while advancing to challenge, exchanged brushes with LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT nearing the sixteenth marker
but prevailed under firm handling. SHEZONEZESTREET tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders
three deep to press the issue on the far turn, moved to strike the front in that path racing into upper stretch, ducked out leaving the furlong marker
momentarily crossing into the path of LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT, but was quickly righted and narrowly prevailed for the place honors. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT,
delayed in arriving to the paddock, was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out gaining position between foes after a half,
was prompted to advance in tandem with the winner nearing upper stretch, shifted out to bid four wide between foes midstretch, was momentarily caught in
tight quarters while exchanging light contact midstretch, then was taken in hand nearing the wire while earning a share. ELEGANCE N TONIC sped to the
lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way late. ANNIE M tracked just off
the leaders inside rivals racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. CHAPLAIN was urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing to
the backstretch, dueled for command just off the inside racing into upper stretch but gave out late. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF LUCY'S
LOOKIN LEFT LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE TOP TWO FINISHERS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CHRISTMAS POEM broke sharply, sped clear dictating the pace on a comfortable margin near the inside racing to the turn, held sway into upper stretch
and was kept to her task. BOMBARRA GOLD tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes leading the second flight on a narrow margin into the turn,
shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors. TAKING CHARGE DESI tracked off the second flight near the inside on
the backstretch, tipped out splitting foes gaining position on the turn, switched out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest but was outkicked
for second. MAY DISCO, off a step slowly, raced four wide just off the second flight into the turn and faded entering upper stretch. GAME OF INCHES,
urged outside foes in brief pursuit of the eventual winner, dropped out early. MISS DUTTON was outpaced in early stages. CHAMA tracked the pacesetter
inside rivals in second flight but gave way after the opening quarter.

CUPIDS LOVE broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, was challenged racing through the
far turn but continued gamely along the inside to the end to narrowly prevail under firm handling. SCARRAZANO angled inwards while being urged between
foes to prompt the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, continued with a steady bid on the far turn to force the issue into upper stretch but proved only
second best. DELUSIONAL DREAM angled to the rail in early stages stalking just off the pacesetter under light rating to the backstretch, was prompted to
lodge a brief bid along the rail racing into upper stretch, altered course avoiding tight quarters midstretch but continued willingly three deep nearing the wire
to close the gap. MAKEMEBELIEVE was rated off the second flight near the inside, then between foes racing into the backstretch and continued evenly
three deep to late stages. DESERT GLOW, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch while in touch with the leaders, was eased back
to last after a half, then continued with a solid second effort four wide to the lane but failed to make a serious impression. SLEW SOUTH, reserved last
along the inside racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. GOLDIE'S DELIGHT, urged to a forward placing three deep between foes racing to the
backstretch, gave way after a half.

AUTISM PRISM was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, came through to press the issue midway through the turn,
edged forward nearing upper stretch and kicked clear in late stages under firm encouragement. PEARLE DE VEENE tracked the leaders four wide through
the backstretch, then continued willingly in the three path racing into the stretch to prove best of the others. BEYOND BROWN, under pressure in early
stages while a bit outpaced, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. NAVARONES SPARKLE settled
inside a rival in the opening stages, switched out three wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE broke readily, forced
the pace outside the eventual winner on a narrow advantage racing into the turn and gave way into the lane. HOT AUGUST STORM was rated three wide
