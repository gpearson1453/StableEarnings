heels, angled out for racing room and edged up in the final strides. JARETH allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into
the turn, made a steady gain, edged ahead inside the furlong marker and was outfinished. STEVIS MAN well placed and three wide, moved up and angled
in through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. PROPOSITION set a pressured pace on the inside, stayed on

Footnotes
SHOSHANAH sprinted to a clear lead pulling soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. MORE
RANSOM tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the winner and held the
place. ONE THAT GOT AWAY well placed and between, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not gain
and held the show. GEARED UP allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share.
HIDDEN SPRINGS ran evenly. TUNED UP well placed and inside, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside the stretch and faded.
ECLIPTICALS SHORTY had an awkward start from the gate and was never involved. SOPHIA LAUREN was a brief factor.
