AXIS made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won as much the best while drifting out past the middle of the racetrack late. AT
THE BEACH chased the winner near the inside and went evenly. JACK'S DREAM allowed to settle, saved ground through the far turn and improved
position in the three path while no real threat. FLYING GUILLOTINE failed to menace. GOTIGER SPECIAL offered a mild bid three wide before a half then
came up empty. FRANKIE Z was no factor. BUBBA was through after a half.

PAT DADDY never far back, circled rivals on the turn and through the stretch under left handed urging and was along in time in the middle of the racetrack.
VENETIAN DREAM pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner while racing
in the five path. KEYED ON TOP dueled for the lead two wide into the turn and faded late. AMIGO'S AFFAIR battled for the lead along the inside into the
stretch then weakened. LEOMBRUNO was shut off leaving the chute, checked and failed to reach contention. TRAMORE BAY steadied leaving the chute
and was no factor.

going away. SEEKING THE MONEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch after drifting out to the five path then was no
match for the winner. ANIMO STAR offered a mild bid into the stretch then leveled off. SASSY POWER stalked the pace into the stretch then faded.
HAUGHTY PRAISE stumbled badly at the start and was no factor. I'M JAC'D had brief speed. GOLOSA was no threat.
