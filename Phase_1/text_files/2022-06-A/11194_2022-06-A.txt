Footnotes
CAPONE broke in and bumped lightly with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, took the lead while set down at the
quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. JESTER'S SONG was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the
pace on the inside, shifted to the two path while asked late on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch under the crop, pursued the winner in the drive
and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the place. SIDEKICK broke in at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three then two wide
around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with late energy to just miss the place while clear for the show. FOR GOOD broke a bit
slow then was taken in hand at the rear, settled towards the back, started the turn in the two path, angled four wide while roused with three furlongs to run,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. ACTUALIZE settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the
turn then spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. FLASH KISS broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide around the
turn and failed to rally. TOWN BRANCH was bumped lightly at the start then hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the
rail on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole and gave way.

Footnotes
UNLOCK shied out at the start and was corrected, raced forwardly placed four paths off the inside before advancing tucked to the two path to take over
command inside nine-sixteenths to go, showed the way through the turn and swung three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task. LADY
YELLEN broke out at the start and was corrected, led early on before being displaced from command by the aforementioned foe, tucked inside and gave
chase, then tipped out three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running
on to just hold for the place honors. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE got bumped five furlongs from home, when MY LITTLE LULU shied inwards in reaction to LADY
YELLEN tucking to the two path in front, chased along the inside until tipped three wide through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LADY OF LOURDES chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. OVER THE SAND chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. BOO BA LA chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung five wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. DINI'S DESTINY lunged at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, made no impact, then got vanned off after the finish. MY LITTLE LULU shied in five furlongs from home from the two path to bump BIG BEAN
CHRISTINE in reaction to LADY YELLEN tucking over from the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and tired.

SUPER DESIGN was away alertly, contested the pace on the outside of KHAFRE, vied in the three path around the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, dueled with the aforementioned foe in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. KHAFRE was hustled from the gate, disputed
the pace on the inside of SUPER DESIGN, vied in the two path around the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the aforementioned
rival under a left-handed crop in the stretch and just missed while clear for the place. HOLD THE SALSA was urged along on the outside, went five wide
around the turn, moved in while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. QUIET OUT EAST was
urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. PIRATE LIFE was last to commence, chased the pace from third, went
four wide around the turn and faltered.

SHALIMAR GARDENS broke out at the start pinching back EPONA'S DREAM against THAT IS KEY, knocked heads in hand four paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn with A BIT O'IRISH SASS to her inside, took over command inside the five-sixteenths and swing four
then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. EPONA'S DREAM got
pinched at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for
home, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. IFIHADACHANCE chased inside briefly before tipping two to three
wide, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths and angled out four wide through the latter portion of the turn and into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. OK HONEY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. A BIT
O'IRISH SASS coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with SHALIMAR GARDENS to her outside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and
yielded the front inside that station, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. THAT IS KEY four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and folded.

MOON OVER MIAMI settled at the rear early, moved up with seven furlongs to run to be just off the pace, squeezed through while hustled up the rail to
make a bid at the three-eighths, passed the quarter-pole under a strong hand-ride, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under
strong urging. PRICE TALK showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path at the seven-sixteenths, dropped to the two
path outside the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and missed while well clear for the place. IT'S A GAMBLE moved out early
then tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. GLYNN COUNTY was hustled from
the gate, showed speed then took the lead coming to the seven-eighths, vied in the two path under urging early on the turn, lost the lead at the
seven-sixteenths, floated five wide into the stretch and stopped.
