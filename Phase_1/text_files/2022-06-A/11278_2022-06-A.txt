responded when roused, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. LATE CALL stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn,
rallied three wide into the stretch, bid and was outfinished. CALIFORNIA FLIRT raced off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.
