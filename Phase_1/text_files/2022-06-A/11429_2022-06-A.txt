Footnotes
RECORDER was well rated sitting off the embattled trio up the backstretch, made a quick move along the rail then tipped out two wide late on the far turn,
took over the lead from FLEETRIDGE and edged away under a driving finish. FLEETRIDGE got caught up in a quick three way pace duel in early stages
and battled up the backstretch, shook free and led the way around the far turn, continued on top entering the upper stretch then got collared by the winner
but fought on gamely. MAKABIM was allowed to settle off the early pace, picked up the tempo two wide around the far turn, sustained response along the
inside through the lane and prevailed for a share. SACRED OATH raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to rally. HUNKA BURNING
LOVE dueled between rivals up the backstretch and came up empty at the quarter pole. EL VALE battled for command racing between rivals up the
backstretch then came up empty near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
JOHN R rated off the pace through early stages, came under a ride mid-way around the far turn, dug in four wide a furlong out, rallied gamely and got a
nose up on the wire. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was allowed to settle off the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch, rallied gamely along the
outside and just missed. TIN BADGE cleared on top strides out of the gate and angled inside, set a pressured pace in early stages, shook free and widened
to a commanding margin around the far turn, continued clear a furlong out then came up empty in deep stretch. MAHOMES pressed the pace in early
stages then chased after the leader around the far turn, sustained a three wide bid into the upper stretch and gave way. YOU TALKIN TO ME rated off the
early pace, hustled along two wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was well reserved in the back and failed to
move into close contention. HEZA WILD RIDE raced off the clear top pair up the backstretch then faded into the lane.

Footnotes
CODETOWIN rated near midpack in early stages, launched a four wide bid heading into the upper stretch, responded willingly under pressure and kicked
clear. HAVE A PLAN vied three wide for the early lead, continued to duel for command into the final furlong then got overtaken by the winner. WYOMING
CONQUEST dueled inside a duo around the turn, battled for command to the furlong marker then gave way. KNOCKS BIG THIRST saved ground through
early stages, shifted out late on the turn, came four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. TURFY raced in the back then passed
tiring rivals along the outside. HIS GIANT dueled between foes around the turn then faded in the lane. SACRED KIKI BIRD tracked the pace near midpack
then retreated in the lane. SAILOR CHOW raced off the early pace, urged two wide around the turn and failed to move into contention.
