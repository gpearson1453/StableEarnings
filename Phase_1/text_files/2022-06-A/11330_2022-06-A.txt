drove clear. SUMMER HELPER well placed, moved up two and three wide through the turn, was carried out to the four path into the stretch, then was no
match for the winner in the late going and held the place. BIG LIZ allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and closed for the show. SHES A THREAT allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong.

ROSES FOR DEBRA eased to the lead in the early going, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. MYSTIC
TWIST tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no match for that one, while clearly
best of the rest. ALATION led before the first call, stalked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, then weakened in the lane and held the
show. WINGS OF LOVE improved position. SLENDER BETSY broke sharply from the gate and steadily lost ground.

SWEET SOUPER SWEET tracked the pace rating, held position while boxed through the turn, waited, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. I RECALL allowed to settle, raced boxed inside through the turn, waited, came through inside, angled out and
split foes, edged ahead late and was outfinished. CARAMEL MARTINI stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch and lacked
the needed late kick. TACTICAL PAJAMAS set the pace on the inside and weakened the final furlong. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD improved position, inside.
BOURBON GAL well placed and outside, faded into the stretch.
