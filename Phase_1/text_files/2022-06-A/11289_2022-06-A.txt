Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FROST advanced into the far turn looming there wresting the lead in the four path upper stretch drawing clear mid stretch holding firm to wire.
KULTHUM unhurried early rallied on the far turn losing ground to upper stretch rallying seven wide there to be second best. POLYESTER BRIDE set a
pressured pace through the far turn ceding to outside pressure in upper stretch weakening late in the three path. PERFECT LIMIT saved ground finishing
evenly along the rail. AIR FORCE PINK hustled along pursued to the far turn then faded in the four path upper stretch. LADY ITCH played no factor.
MYRRH pressured the pace through the backside then gave way on the far turn. BAY OF ANGELS taken up at the start would trail throughout.

Footnotes
KIMALLOSA'S HALO hustled clear set a modest pace through the backside drawing out on the far turn holding a solid edge in the three path upper stretch
withstanding an inside challenge late. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES saved ground maneuvering between horses while advancing on the far turn vying from the
rail down the lane giving a strong finish. SUGAR HAPPY tracked the pace to the far turn emerging off a loose leader there vying in the three and four paths
down the lane hanging late. WIZ VILLAGE KAREN stalked the pace while saving ground being shuffled back on the far turn staying after it in upper stretch
moving up some in the two path. FAVORITE IMPULSE stalked the pace traveling evenly through the far turn angling six wide in upper stretch lacking surge
there. NOT SHY raced evenly lacking more. NELL'S BELLS wide early played no factor. TETHERED was always outrun. KNOCKOUT KISSES showed
little. SHEER ALICE (GB) hustled up early chased to the far turn weakening there folding in upper stretch being put away late.

BROTHER SKYE stalked the pace pressing in bid on the turn dueling three deep down the lane extending up at the wire. MUNTIJ pressed the pace dueling
between horses through the turn then down the stretch battling to the end. I'M A COOL MAN away alertly dueled along the inside through the turn then
down the stretch staying on gamely to the end. CLICKJAB was squeezed back at the break lagging to upper stretch finishing evenly. PALMY SUNDAE
faded on the turn racing inside down the lane. SIDE CAR veered out at the break, raced evenly through the turn fading in upper stretch. GRAN CITY was
always a step slow. LOVELY HEIR hustled along through the turn would wilt to upper stretch.
