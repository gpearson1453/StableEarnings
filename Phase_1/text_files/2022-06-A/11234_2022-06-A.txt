took closer order nearing the quarter pole and launched an all out bid getting by for place. OUT FRONT vied inside of CONVINCE, was unable to match
strides into the stretch and weakened late. EXACTLY last away, advanced quickly through the final turn, but failed to threaten in the drive. CARRIE'S

PUMP THE BRAKES vied for the early lead, opened up to good margins, and was kept to task under encouragement. BRADYDABOSS saved ground
inside, lodged bid into the stretch but was no match for the winner. JAKE THE RAKE raced four wide leaving the backstretch and rallied late for show.
COSMIC MARINE showed interest late. RUN ROSSCO RUN stalked the pacesetter, went in pursuit and faded. SAMMY'S CHARM was not a factor.

the final turn and wilted. EMERALD CANYON passed tiring rivals. MARYAM showed little. REDS LITTLE STAR contested the lead leaving the backstretch
and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. ENTITLED STAR broke in air and closed gap. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the start of the race involving ENTITLED STAR, after review ENTITLED STAR was deemed to have had a fair start and made no change.

SLAATS rated well off the pace, advanced outside quickly, dueled outside of ASYOUBELIEVE into the stretch and won the bob. ASYOUBELIEVE chased
outside then rider lost stirrups leaving the backstretch, sped through the final turn, battled inside of SLAATS, and was narrowly denied. ANKARA trailed the
field, improved along the rail and finished with good energy. SPOT ON DUDE contested the early pace, drew clear into the lane, was overtaken into the
stretch and yielded. PHANTOM MAC contended the early pace, was unable to move on with rivals and faded. FLASHFORDANI chased to no avail.

FIONA BAY unhurried early, waited briefly nearing the quarter pole, overtook the leader and drew away under a confident hand ride. SHE'S EXPENSIVE
stalked MUSICAL RELOAD, dropped back in the far turn, and closed gradually securing place. AMBER PRINCESS went wide through the backstretch,
angled to the rail into the far turn, shifted out into the stretch and rallied belatedly. MUSICAL RELOAD set the early pace, was overtaken nearing the stretch
and gave way in the drive with little resistance. WICKED WOMAN pressed the pace leaving the backstretch, drifted out entering the lane and yielded.
ABERDEEN ANNIE drifted out in the backstretch and never produced a bid. SCARLETTE ROSE never reached contention.

Footnotes
LONE PIONEER saved ground early, gained closer order in the final turn then shifted out to the five path, and surged late getting up just in time.
BACKSTREET BOBBY attended the pace from the two path, gained the lead at the quarter pole, moved clear and was nipped at the wire. PRESS GANG
chased outside, closed determinedly and got by deep stretch for show. WHERE'S THE GOLD trailed the field, advanced quickly along the rail nearing three
sixteenth pole, and was outkicked for third. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER saved ground early, swung wide into the lane, and bid belatedly. IRISH TRICK
pressed inside then held a short advantage through the final turn and came up empty in the drive. SPORTSCARR saved ground and was unable to improve
late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE broke alertly, chased from the three path, and lacked a closing response. BAR NO Q stalked the early pacesetters and failed
to threaten in the drive. WEDGE POND attended the pace from the four path and was done early.

Footnotes
VIATURE saved from the rail, moved up into striking position nearing the final turn, gained the lead into the stretch and stayed clear. BUCK WEST vied
inside from the two path, dueled through the final turn inside of MR. ARTISTIC, and finished under a determined drive. MR. ARTISTIC set a pressured pace
from the four path, dueled into the final turn outside of BUCK WEST and lacked the closing response needed. SEA SPLENDOR settled outside early and
kept on gradually through the stretch. WILDCAT WILLY late mild bid. SNAP COUNT sat mid pack, was all out into the stretch and weakened. JULIUS THE
GREAT raced in second flight under a strong hold early, rallied mildly and gave way. ALL THAT GOLD attended the pace while five wide and tired with two
furlongs remaining. MARIA'S SONG stalked outside and was done early.
