pressured pace, lost the lead in upper stretch and faded in the drive. EMPHASIZE lacked speed, circled foes entering the stretch, bumped with STRAIGHT
UP GUY in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GOLD FELLOW prompted the pace outside FIVE STAR PHIL to the stretch then steadily weakened.
STRAIGHT UP GUY lacked speed, eased off the inner rail leaving the turn, bumped with EMPHASIZE while between horses in upper stretch then came up

Footnotes
AMPLIO ESQUEMA settled off the early pace, worked her way forward between rivals into the far turn, continued progress past the five sixteenths, angled
out five wide, closed nicely under left handed asking, took over outside runners with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. MARY JANE CHROME broke a bit
slowly then relaxed off the pace while about three wide, edged up leaving the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, ranged up and bid between foes
near the sixteenth marker, failed to match strides with the winner but churned on with effort to gain the place. POUNDING MUSIC , three wide to contention,
prompted the pace outside a rival, bid to engage the leader with a little more than a half mile remaining, sparred around the final turn, shook clear under a
drive in upper stretch, drifted in towards the rail, failed to contain the winner a sixteenth out then gave way grudgingly. STARTWITHABANG , unhurried early
while saving ground, worked outward for the drive and finished with good energy. EVANGELINE ALLONS tracked inside, eased out under a ride near the
quarter pole, gave hard chase past mid stretch but came up empty. A REAL HERO , in range while off the inside, took closer order between runners leaving
the far turn, steadied when in close soon after, regrouped to pursue but failed to kick on in the final furlong. CUENCA saved ground while not too far back,
was under asking leaving the three eighths, angled out in upper stretch but lacked a bid. MUSICAL CAT lost ground three to four wide and failed to menace.
SHE'SRUNNINGHAPPY cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined after a half mile, fought on to the head of the lane then gave way.

LOOKS DON'T LIE rated inside, eased out and came three wide for the drive, worked through between runners inside the eighth pole, shifted in and surged
under strong handling to the inside EMERALD LACE to get up. EMERALD LACE , fractious behind the gate, had speed then rated off the leaders, stalked
around the turn, bid outside FOUL BALLS soon into the lane, shook clear under asking in mid stretch, kept on valiantly but just failed to hold off the winner.
PRINCESS PALMER steadied leaving the far turn, moved up four wide into the lane, threatened between foes nearing mid stretch and kept on trying.
TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK , shuffled soon after the break, saved ground leaving the three eighths, angled out and rallied between foes. ASHARA had speed
and vied inside FOUL BALLS heading to the turn, rated off that one and stalked mid turn, eased out, edged up in close quarters nearing mid stretch,
steadied briefly then kept on with effort. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS , three to four wide while off the pace, angled out in the lane and belated interest
between foes. IN VAIN , four wide early, dropped in around the turn, came back out leaving the quarter pole and had some late life. GALS GAL , off the
pace, raced seven wide in upper stretch, drifted in briefly near mid stretch, corrected but failed to seriously kick on. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR was lightly
steadied after the break, carried out some leaving the far turn, ranged up five wide outside rivals nearing the eighth pole then faded. FOUL BALLS , fractious
and a bit difficult to load, hustled up after the break and joined ASHARA, moved clear around the turn, was hooked soon into the lane, stayed on to mid
stretch then weakened. The trainer of ASHARA lodged a claim of foul against EMERALD LACE for alleged interference in mid stretch. No action was taken

the eighth pole then drew off under steady handling. CHARMING WAY rushed up leaving the chute, gained the lead mid way down the backstretch, set the
pace near the inner rail around the turn, lost the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. HONOR YOUR MOTHER , never far back, raced in the two path on
the turn, remained on her left lead in the stretch and gradually weakened. CHAMPAGNE TOAST lightly bumped with LADY FOX leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn three wide while chasing the pace, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and weakened. LADY FOX lightly bumped with CHAMPAGNE
TOAST at the start, trailed to the stretch and passed tired rivals. MY SUPER SALLY , fanned five deep turning for home, weakened.
SHINELIKEADIAMOND raced along the inner rail on the turn, was done before six furlongs.

Footnotes
DETERMINED KINGDOM flashed speed and edged up to contention inside rivals near the half mile marker, was patiently rated around the turn, worked
outward past the quarter pole then further out past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run under right handed asking and wore down OLDIES BUT
GOODIES in the final yards. OLDIES BUT GOODIES , tucked up inside and under rating just off the leaders, eased out entering the stretch, bid between
foes, wrested command inside the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted by the winner and kept on gamely. RADICAL RIGHT bumped with EMBOLDEN
soon after the break, pulled his way forward between rivals then had to steady in close quarters into the turn, regrouped to advance four wide nearing the
lane, was floated out by the winner past the three sixteenths and churned on. ALOTTAHOPE sped clear then dropped in to set the pace, was joined in
upper stretch by a pair of rivals to his outside, fought on past mid stretch then gave way stubbornly. EMBOLDEN bumped with RADICAL RIGHT early on,
was shuffled back heading to the turn, raced two wide in upper stretch and closed. TOMMY SHELBY , off the early pace, dropped in, saved ground into the
lane and had a mild run. AMERICAN D'ORO , off slowly, angled very wide for the drive and had belated interest. RAILMASTER rated between foes mid
turn, angled out but lacked a serious kick. GLORY SONG lost ground and failed to rally. BLESSED ARION had speed, stalked three wide past the three
eighths, ranged up in upper stretch, failed to kick on with a furlong to go and gave way. ALL THREES , in close nearing the turn, gave way.

UNCLE IRISH stalked the pace, advanced in the two path on the turn, secured command entering the stretch then drew away while kept to his business.
MAJESTIC FRONTIER saved ground around the turn, advanced entering the stretch, remained along the rail and was best of the others. SMARTEN UP
lacked speed, raced between horses on the turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch, weakened and raced on his left lead in the drive. ROD TWO
ROD , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, floated to the four path turning for home and gave way. ICY MINISTER was outrun. HAMPDEN LANE ,
wide on the turn, was fanned six deep turning for home and retreated. ROYAL SPY , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, rushed to the early
lead, set the pace to the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
SAMUI SUNSET , confidently handled in range while about four wide past the five eighths, dropped in a bit and rated behind rivals leaving the far turn,
swung out for room in upper stretch, responded when given a bit of coaxing, forged past the leader leaving mid stretch and eagerly drew out in handy
fashion. FAVORITE IMAGE was urged from the gate, dropped in clearing into the first turn, took pressure from GREYLOVER leaving the final turn, spurted
back clear in upper stretch, dug in when taking heat from both sides nearing mid stretch, could not contain the winner but kept on with effort to save the
place. GOLDIE'S BOY , off the pace, raced three wide leaving the far turn, was maneuvered outward for the final sixteenth and closed steadily. ON THE
ENGINE checked when rank early, settled through the backstretch, raced in the clear mid way on the final turn, eased out to make progress in the lane then
needed more late between foes. GLORIOUS WEEKEND , forward early to the inside, eased out and stalked, ranged up four wide outside foes nearing mid
stretch, failed to kick on inside the sixteenth pole and faded. BOSS IS A PAL rated inside, edged up nearing the far turn, bid inside foes nearing mid stretch
then faded. TITRATE broke slowly, settled well back, saved ground into the lane, eased out but lacked a solid finish. HONOR MY WORLD checked
repeatedly and was rank in the opening furlong, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled five wide making a bit of a run into the lane but failed to sustain.
GREYLOVER prompted the pace, bid outside the leader into the far turn, pressed to upper stretch then gave way. ILLUSTRIOUS , off the pace, saved
ground into the lane but failed to kick on.
