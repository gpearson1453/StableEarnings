HARD TO COME HOME brushed leaving, pressured the pace outside of TRIPLE POWER, drifted out leaving the final turn, dueled under right handed
urging through the stretch, dug in and just held. ZICATELA chased outside, dueled outside of DUNE D'ORO in the turn, made a late outside run and took
second in a multi-horse scramble to the finish. TRIPLE POWER hustled away, took pressure inside of HARD TO COME HOME, dueled gamely into the
stretch and was out finished. DREADNAUGHT advanced quickly inside in the final turn, closed steadily from the rail but flattened in the later yards. DUNE
D'ORO broke outward brushing HARD TO COME HOME, stalked the pacesetters early, lacked running room into the stretch and flattened. QUINTO SOL
failed to threaten.

LITTLE HARPER saved ground inside, went in pursuit of the leader after the quarter pole, angled out in the final furlong sweeping the lead and won going
away. BEAUTIFUL CALL hurried away, came under encouragement into the lane and finished second best. WITHIN REASON sent for speed, showed the
way through the backstretch under a snug hold, held good margins through the far turn but saw those quickly diminish nearing the eighth pole and wilted
abruptly. STEVIE WONDER GIRL reserved of the early pace and passed tiring rival deep stretch. FRAN FROM PERU chased four to five wide through the
backstretch, lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole and had nothing left in reserve late, and faded. BLANCA was unable improve position. LULABELLE
trailed throughout.

SHIP'S CREEK raced wide through the backstretch while sitting in striking distance, asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole and won driving. QUEEN
RHONDA sat in range, lost ground leaving the backstretch from the rail, trailed into the stretch and closed steadily getting up in the later yards for place.
CARAT'S SONG vied six wide for the early lead, dueled to the through the stretch outside of ADDYDIDIT, inched clear of the fore mentioned but was edged
out late for place. ADDYDIDIT contested the early pace inside of CARAT'S SONG, dueled determinedly into the stretch and gave way grudgingly late.
DIPLOMATICA was under a strong hold early, sat in striking range in the far turn, lodged a rail bid but was unable to improve position late stretch.

LETS GO ALL THEWAY brushed leaving, advanced quickly through the final turn, closed determinedly outside and got by with time. JODEAN unhurried
early, took closer order approaching the quarter pole, rallied outside to earn place. SUGAR MOON sat just off the pace inside, chased inside from the rail
into the stretch drive and was edged out late. JAGEN broke out into HUMBOLDTSTRONG, contended the pace from the three path, showed the way
through the final turn, was under attack into the stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. HUMBOLDTSTRONG squeezed out leaving, gained closer order
along the rail, came under urging into the stretch and lacked the kick required. BEAR WARNING settled in range, hustled five wide at the head of the lane,
drifted in and out through the drive and flattened. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI rated off the pace and failed to threaten in drive. ALPINE ROAD flashed early
speed, was unable to move on with JAGEN leaving the backstretch and was eased.

UNUSUAL ACCOUNT hustled to the front, drew clear leaving the backstretch, showed signs of tiring into the stretch with good margins, and held on under a
late drive. REMAIN CALM trailed the field early, gained closer order into the final turn, closed the gap on the leader then was all out late and missed.
IMPERIAL DASH raced wide in second flight, roused near the quarter pole, bid gradually and flattened late. CITY WOLF'S GUY allowed to settle off the
early pacesetters, swung out into the lane, closed well and missed out for show. WIDE EYED WILEY saved ground early, raced wide into the lane then
lodged a bid into the final furlong and flattened late. GRADY'S SONG broke well, stalked four wide through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader and
faded. YNOTGIVEITAGO bid near the quarter pole and was unable to improve position through the drive. AMIGO QUERIDO offered little. NICKYGEORGE
stalked the pacesetter and was done early. SECRET TRAILS chased outside and tired early.

CATS TOUCH sat in striking position from the three path, overtook the leader at the eighth pole and won going away. SMART PLAY showed the way into
the backstretch, was quickly overtaken in the stretch, and finished second best. SHARP DRESSED BEAU rated off the pace from the four path, chased into
the lane, and rallied late to secure show. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART stalked from the rail, lodged a bid near the quarter pole, and lacked the rally needed.
WYE CROSS lodged a late bid. LANNY MAC lagged early and showed some interest late. NEVVARE angled to inside through the backstretch, bid nearing
the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. DAD'S LEGACY stalked outside, raced four wide in the far turn and dropped back. ROOKIE YEAR chased outside
and tired. BIG AL'S VISION never reached contention.
