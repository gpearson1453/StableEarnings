Footnotes
WHATA FLIRT was unhurried early, launched a four-wide bid on on the turn, took the lead nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gradually drew clear.
CURIOUS SENSATION dueled for the early lead while three-wide, responded when put to pressure, but could not stay with the winner late. NATIONAL
HEROINE saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved forward on the turn, steadied briefly looking for room nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, angled out for the drive and finished willingly. GUIDED BY ANGELS broke out to bump Onefineday at the start, then dueled for the lead from along the
inside to the stretch and weakened. ONEFINEDAY was bumped at the start, quickly recovered to dispute the early pace form between horses and gave way
after three furlongs.

CELINAS BLUE BIRD vied for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back slightly nearing the turn to angle out, quickly reengaged Coastal Queen,
dueled with her into deep stretch and proved best late. COASTAL QUEEN set the pressured pace while racing slightly off the rail but was unable to match
strides with the winner late. DANCE BALLERINA was unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch, finished well and then was vanned off
following the finish. ARE YOU FROM DIXIE was three-wide throughout and finished willingly. LONSDALEITE saved ground to little avail. STEEL NERVES
gave way after showing brief speed while racing five-wide.

HARBOR OUTLAW stalked the pace while racing in hand, caught Tig nearing the eighth pole to take command and gradually drew clear. TIG saved ground
setting the pace, responded when challenged, was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. JACANA was off a step slow, then was unhurried,
angled out for the drive and finished fairly well. COASTAL KING saved ground while being forwardly place, but lacked a response when asked. NORTHERN
BLEND was five-wide on the turn, ducked in slightly nearing the eighth pole and gave way.

MARQUE IT UP set the pace while racing slightly of the rail, responded when challenged and maintained a safe advantage. LICORICE DROP POPS never
far back while racing between horses, split rivals nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid, but was unable to get by the winner. IRISH TERRIER saved ground
while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through entering the stretch and was going well at the finish. EROTIC was unhurried early, steadied briefly
while in traffic nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear,. FORTY FATHOMS prompted the early pace while three-wide, came five-wide into
the stretch and weakened. DIECI forced the pace to the stretch while racing two-wide and tired.
