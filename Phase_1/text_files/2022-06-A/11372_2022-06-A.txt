Footnotes
AKHNAS narrowly showed the way out of the chute, relinquished the advantage soon after, chased that rival into the turn in the two path, advanced and
regained the advantage into the stretch, briefly clear inside the furlong marker then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. BODE'S LIGHT in
the second flight outside for a half, ranged up four wide to challenge exiting the turn, lost ground to the winner into the lane, getting back to that rival late. J
C'S IN TOWN with the early pace onto the main track, shook clear along the inside after a quarter, maintained daylight early turn, briefly responded when
challenged into the lane then yielded gradually in upper stretch, remained clear for the show. RITHMICALLEA bobbled at the break to be last away, back off
the pace inside, encountered a touch of traffic early in the turn, continued to save ground through the bend and went evenly to the wire. BOURBON SKY in
the second flight three wide and inside the runner up, came up empty when called on for the stretch run. NOW YOU RULES trailed throughout and was
never a threat.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE JUNIOR broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, garnered a larger advantage late in the turn, responded when challenged past the furlong
marker, drifted out a bit, found more late to hold off the runner up despite bobbling in the final strides in a game effort. SPRY CHARLIE in the second flight
three wide, continued on the outside into the straight, ranged up outside the winner to challenge just inside the furlong marker, could not get by. MALIBU
MONEY away well, raced closest to the winner off the inside, in some traffic with just less than a furlong remaining, angled in slightly into the gap, up for the
show while unable to get to the top pair late. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS in the second group early while between foes, dropped inside to save ground into the
stretch, long drive for the show, outkicked. BIG SESSY went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. DIRTY DAWG came in slightly at the start to
bother K R TARGET a bit, remained back in failing to rally. PERFECT STRIKE lacked speed, also failed to respond when called on for the drive. K R
TARGET bothered at the start to be last away, trailed throughout and was never involved.

Footnotes
F J'S GEM with the pace from the start along the inside, continued to vie closest to the rail the middle half, edged away entering the stretch, turned back the
runner up soon after then drew clear the final furlong in a determined effort. CHAIRMAN MOO with the lead pack while four wide into the first turn, fell back
before a quarter, continued to track that first flight far turn, ranged up to briefly try the winner in upper stretch, could not match that one to the wire, edged
clear for the second spot. FIFTYFIVE STRONG lacked speed, moved closer along the inside turning for home, lacked a further advance to finish up best of
the rest. CYBER GUN last to leave, remained devoid of any speed for five furlongs, also advanced into a contending position late in the final turn, altered
course out to four wide for room into the stretch, also was found lacking a closing kick. COUNTRY CUT set or forced the pace four six furlongs between
horses and gave way. SPIN TOWN with the pace for five furlongs three wide, gave way abruptly second turn, stopped stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
IRON BANNER away in good order, raced forwardly and four wide through the first turn, fell back the second quarter, advanced back into a striking position
three wide late in the final bend, took over past the furlong marker and edged clear. STOP SHOP N DROP last away and in some traffic, devoid of speed for
five furlongs, bobbled into the far turn, began an outside advance soon after, came five wide for the drive and rallied for the place, unable to reach the
winner. CUSTOM MAIDEN broke well, set or forced the pace off the inside, came in the two path for the drive, stayed on past the furlong marker, unable to
match the top two late, managed to save the show. STORM BREACH back off the early pace and the inside, remained in mid pack second turn while four
wide, improved position down the straight with some modest late interest well out in the course. CRAFTY PRINCESS broke back, lacked speed, saved
ground second turn, moved off the inside a bit for the drive and also improved slightly without making a major impact. T R'S FIRST void of speed for six
furlongs, continued well back into the lane, passed some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided well wide. DEVASTATING BEAUTY settled in the
second flight along the inside, had little for the stretch run. MISS MIRACLE GIRL set or forced the pace for almost six furlongs, faltered when headed in
upper straight. ALHAMBRA PALACE vied up front early along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
LIGHT AS A WHISPER broke back, was hustled up from between horses to duel through the first turn in the two path, continued to help set the pace up the
backstretch, disposed of the other speed in the final turn, clear into the lane, extended advantage. LAST DESTINY broke on top, alternated up front for over
five furlongs along the inside, fell back into the lane, then came again for the place in a determined effort. KAITLYN'S COURT broke near the rear, lacked
speed outside, tucked to the inside early in the first turn to save ground, continued inside into and through most of the second turn, angled back out to be
four wide into the stretch, rallied outside, not enough late for the place. LAKE RUNNER in mid pack off the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the
final turn, flattened out a bit the final furlong to lose the show. ARCTIC GUITAR raced closest to the dueling leader, advanced on the winner from between
horses late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. OVERLY SWEET hesitated at the break to spot most of the field a couple of lengths,
continued to trail, accelerated off the inside into the stretch, improved a bit without posing a serious threat. CRIDER CHASE settled in mid pack for six
furlongs, moved closer in the three path late in the final turn, had little for the stretch run. CUSTOM MADE broke with the leaders, fell back while four wide
through the first turn, continued back in the run up the backstretch, fanned six wide into the lane when moving forward then soon flattened out to come up
empty the final furlong. GRACE'S GAL forwardly placed early, remained within striking distance the middle half mile, was beginning to tire when floated five
wide into the lane, continued to weaken. SHE'S OUR STAR remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
SINGLE SHOT broke running from the outside to clear into the first turn, rated when setting a contested pace early backstretch, continued in hand far turn,
shook well clear into the straight, kept to task late to prove clearly best. FLASHBACK WIND shuffled back at the start to race back, continued to lack speed
the first five furlongs, began to pick way through some traffic second turn, continued to negotiate traffic willingly through the stretch to be up in time for the
place, not a threat to the winner. CHIEF KIMOSABI unhurried early, after being last away, was called on for run three wide far turn, advanced into the lane,
closest to the winner late while not a match, nipped in the final stride for the second position. THAT ONE GUITAR well back early outside, moved inside and
began to advance in the final turn, steered out three wide entering the stretch, continued to better himself through the straight without appearing a danger.
PERMANENTDETENTION in the main body while off the inside, moved closest to the winner while three wide in the second turn, failed to sustain that
advance the final furlong, weakened and lost several positions. DARK MATTER in the second flight inside, in tight along the rail far turn, steadied, briefly
recovered then faded in the drive. ROYAL SOLUTION raced in the main body along the inside early, raced two to three wide second turn, failed to respond
in the drive. CHECKULATER within striking distance for a half, gave way. FLIT N FLOT TIME fractious in the gate prior to the start, was finished early.
FIGHTING SOLDIER pressed the winner for a half and stopped while off the inside.

Footnotes
HIGH CRUISE closest to the leader while in the two path in the run up the backstretch, engaged that one early in the turn, clear into the lane, briskly roused,
strongly to the wire while being briskly kept to task. COMMON LAW CAT well back off the pace for a quarter in the two path, began to advance from
between rivals midway on the turn, split a second pair of rivals entering the stretch, finished willingly to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner.
CURTIN'S UP broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, set a lively opening quarter, briefly responded when the winner challenged turn then could not keep up,
remained closest to that one until late, caught for the place. OFF SIXES in the main body early three wide, dropped to the inside turn, saved ground into the
lane then went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch. SIR SMACK forwardly placed briefly after the start, fell back along the inside turn, lacked a
serious response through the stretch. MUCHO MARVIN last away, never menaced. COCO TIGER forwardly placed for a half while off the inside, backed up
steadily through the lane.

Footnotes
CHEAPSKATE DIVA pulled while forwardly placed past the wire the first time, remained under firm restraint onto the backstretch, early move to the front
between foes before a half, clear into the lane, larger lead a furlong out, held the runner up comfortably safe late. EXACTA broke out to bother BE A
BANDIT, was righted and pressed the issue into the first turn, took over off the inside onto the backstretch, relinquished the advantage to the winner before
four furlongs, chased that one into the stretch and could not get back to that same foe late, clearly second best. MIZZEN MONARCH settled off the pace
toward the inside, saved ground when beginning a minor rally in the second turn, closest to the top two a furlong out then held that position late. LUTIE MO
void of speed, remained back into the far turn in the two path, advanced into the lane, shifted out when straightened for home, displayed a mild amount of
interest late to be gaining for the show. CARLOS LOVES TEE within striking distance off the inside, three wide when within contact second turn, lacked a
response in the drive to finish up flat. BE A BANDIT bothered at the start, four wide through the first turn when off the pace, continued outside and was four
wide again through the second bend, had little left for the drive. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH broke on top, flashed brief speed inside the runner up early, fell
well back, trailed home.

Footnotes
AUNT JANA broke back, lacked speed, swept up five wide into contention exiting the turn, reached the front with just under a furlong remaining, kicked well
clear under steady handling. DAVE'S RONDA well back off the early pace, three wide when beginning to advance midway on the turn, kept coming through
the lane to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. SHEEZA PRIORITY in the second flight toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive,
finished up evenly to be clear of others. SOUVENIR CHANNEL in the second flight out of the chute between horses, advanced on the leader late in the turn,
put a head in front past the furlong marker then caved in soon after to lose several positions. ALLEN'S JUDY lacked speed while saving ground into and
through the first part of the turn, two path around a tiring foe late in the bend, improved position while not a serious threat. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA broke
well,pressed the leader out of the chute and up the backstretch, took over into the turn, clear through much of the bend, gave way in turn when headed for
the drive. SECRET MOMENT in the second flight early while inside, had nothing for the drive. TAP YOUR FRONT mid pack, steered out five wide into the
lane, failed to respond. SHOOTING STICK broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded, broke alertly, early pace, stopped. MY DEPOSIT dwelt at the
break, was sluggish throughout.
