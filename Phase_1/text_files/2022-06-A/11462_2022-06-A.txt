Footnotes
BOLD REY broke readily, was hustled to the lead a bit off the rail racing to the first turn, disputed the pace outside a rival into the backstretch, pressed the
issue into the far turn, shook clear nearing upper stretch while shifting off the inside and maintained a clear advantage under firm encouragement. EVEN
PANDURA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner into the stretch but
proved only second best. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY, reserved racing off the inside in early stages, gained position between foes after a half, was shuffled a bit
avoiding close quarters entering the second bend, swung out four wide midway through the far turn and continued well enough to earn a share. SHES GOT
THE POWER tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but came up empty in
the drive. IT'S INEVITABLE bobbled at the start, was quickly righted, then angled to the rail pressing the pace racing into the first turn, set the pace on a
narrow margin through the backstretch but was spent entering the far turn.

LOOKIN FOR EIGHT tracked off the first flight between foes, then outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced while shifting out four wide racing
through the far turn, was carried out avoiding traffic racing into upper stretch but continued with solid momentum to go clear under firm encouragement.
BIGFOOT CITY was urged prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn, was forced out by MRS. BEANS entering
upper stretch but continued to contest second through the closing stages, then narrowly prevailed for the place honors at the wire. MRS. BEANS was urged
along the inside setting the pace in the opening stages, dueled for command into the far turn, swerved out sharply racing past the three sixteenths marker
shifting into the path of BIGFOOT CITY, was righted to contest second but couldn't fend off that rival. DYNAMIC RULER tracked just off the first flight to the
far turn, shifted out to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing the lane but came up empty in the drive. ALLEN, off a step slowly, never gained contention. YOU
SPLIT TENS settled along the inside and proved no threat. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
IN UPPER STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

the pacesetter between foes, then outside a rival racing to the far turn, had no closing bid but prevailed for the place honors. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY settled
outside foes in early stages, angled to the rail on the far turn and improved position inside foes into the lane. BON DEUX tracked the pacesetter inside rivals

SEEK N JUSTICE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance to challenge the leader nearing
upper stretch, then continued with a grudging effort to prevail in the closing stages under firm handling. RUSTY CAGE was urged along the inside dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, tipped out entering the stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best.
MARDEN was rated off the second flight four wide in early stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn, then improved position inside foes in the stretch.
HERBIE was urged three wide through the backstretch pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. FENDER BENDER was settled
last early, swung out five wide entering the stretch but offered no rally. DOCTOR K hesitated at the start losing position to the field at the start, angled to the
inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane and faded in the drive. EL CENTENARIO, caught five wide tracking off the
second flight in the opening stages, steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GOPHER was rated stalking just off the pacesetter while switching outside that foe racing to the backstretch, advanced to press that rival racing
through the far turn, struck the front between calls in a prolonged drive and narrowly prevailed on the wire under strong handling. START SINGING broke
sharply, sprinted clear angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, grudgingly resisted the winner's
bid to the end and just lost the nod on the wire. MINNESOTA NICE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out three
wide entering upper stretch and finished evenly in late stages. WITHHERBOOTSON tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the far turn, then continued
evenly three wide between foes into the stretch. ICYWILBURNYEH was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide
into upper stretch and displayed some belated interest. THAT WOULD BE NICE tracked just off the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages to the far
turn and gave way nearing the lane. STYLIN N PROFILIN hopped at the start while getting away slowly and never proved a serious threat. NOTE PAD was
rated off the second flight inside rivals and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
KIERKEGAARD broke outwards bumping RUXIN, was righted to track off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail on the turn,
continued under patient handling through the bend, came through when presented an opening in upper stretch to bid for command inside the pacesetter
nearing the furlong marker and edged forward under firm right handed pressure. PERFECT WAGER tracked off the first flight racing four deep through the
backstretch into the turn, continued with a steady advance outside foes to challenge for command near midstretch but was outkicked. MAY WE ALL was
urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening quarter, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch and weakened late. AWESOME
EMMIT was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command through the turn to upper stretch shifting a bit
off the rail, then gave out once headed by the winner. BIG LEAGUE BENNY tracked off the second flight inside rivals in the opening stages but offered no
rally. RUXIN, bumped, then shuffled out of close quarters at the start, switched out to briefly contend three deep between foes in second flight but emptied
out nearing the lane. LEO DEL REO was settled five wide racing through the backstretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
KING OF THE KIDS was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, switched outside foes gathering momentum on the far turn, swung
five wide in upper stretch, took charge leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. SOUPER FORTUNE tracked off the first flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors inside foes in late stages.
COASTAL WATERS settled well off the leaders racing to the far turn, was fanned six wide entering the stretch but continued with steady late momentum to
gain position to the end. JOKER MATT tracked the leaders outside rivals in the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards nearing upper stretch
to split rivals just off the inside but lacked the needed final kick. JUSTICE WARRIOR was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for
command into upper stretch, edged forward entering the lane and gave out leaving midstretch. LAPIS LAZULI led the second flight between foes tracking
the leaders from just out of striking distance to the far turn, shifted out nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid three wide between foes but lacked the needed
late kick. XTREME V. I. P., forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders, bore out racing through the far turn and gave way. SAMYAZA, urged
between foes pressing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. LAST MARTINI, off slowly, settled last, came under pressure on
the backstretch but lacked a response.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin between foes through the backstretch, angled inside entering the turn, met the
challenge of several rivals to regain the advantage racing into upper stretch, kicked away under pressure and was taken in hand in late stages.
RAOFTHESUN was urged four deep, then three wide pursuing the pacesetter in second flight racing into the turn, gained terms with that foe nearing upper
stretch but proved no match in the drive while edging a rival for second. OUTRUN THE POSSE, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pace,
pressed the issue between foes on the turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive and was outkicked for second. FAYETTE WARRIOR tracked off the first
flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued evenly late. AMERICAN UNION, a bit slow into stride, was
caught five wide racing into the turn, then to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. ROCKTIZWAY, off a bit slowly, never gained
contention. GIANT GAMBLE was urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, then faded into upper stretch.
ASTONISHING TWEET, off slowly, then shut off at the start, trailed the field to the stretch. SMOOTH PAPA was held up off the second flight along the
inside in the opening stages and retreated early.
