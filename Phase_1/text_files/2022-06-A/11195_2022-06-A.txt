EYES OF GLORY unhurried to the turn, rallied around field with a swift turn of foot past the quarter pole to go well clear late. THE JUDGE AND JURY
dueled between horses early on, stayed on for place while best of the best. ALWAYS GET REVENGE saved ground to the stretch, no match for top two in
the lane. ELEGGUA brief speed inside faded back turn, came back stretch run. TRUST FUND ROBBER broke awkward far back to the stretch, passed a
couple late. UNCLE DICK never menaced. FLY HOME dueled three wide to turn, gave way readily. SERPENTINE good position to the turn, bled through
the stretch, walked off.
