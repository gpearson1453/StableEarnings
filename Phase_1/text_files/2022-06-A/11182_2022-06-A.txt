Footnotes
CREATIVE CREDIT dueled to the quarter pole, shook free in the stretch and held sway to the wire. JUXTAPOSE inside trip to stretch, angled out for clear
run and rallied for the place spot gamely. VINTAGE READY raced evenly while chasing leaders, floated out in the stretch and missed the place spot.
LUBNA (GB) broke tardy, no speed to the stretch unhurried, closed gap inside in the final furlong. QUEEN OF SHADES inside speed to deep stretch,
swallowed up in the final furlong. SASSY CAT never a real menace. SUITE MADAM BLUE off rail trip throughout, never close.
