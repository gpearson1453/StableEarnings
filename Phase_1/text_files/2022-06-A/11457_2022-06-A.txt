RIO ABAJO sprinted to clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and lasted under steady pressure. LIKE A
SALTSHAKER well placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick.
VALENTINE BUG hopped at the start, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and flattened, gaining the
show. SAMEDI NIGHT never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened. CAPTAIN MAD JACK
chased the pace in the early going, moved up to stalk that one outside, then faded through the turn.

Footnotes
HEAT OF THE NIGHT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off and was kept to the task. CHIC N WILBUR well
placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one and held the place.
CEDUNA rated back inside in the early going, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and edged up for the
show. ST. PADDY'S DADDY well placed outside, angled in and raced boxed on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the
stretch and evened out. STRIKE THE TOP tracked the pace, lost some ground two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch
and weakened. ZERO GRAVITY moved up into the second turn, looped three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. RONALD R (IRE) was no
factor.

Footnotes
WROTE IN STONE sent from the gate, sprinted clear quickly, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. STUDYLONGSTDYWRONG well placed,
held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then could not threaten and held the place. CHOCOLATE PHILLING well
placed, saved ground through the turn, angled to the two path avoiding a tiring rival, was blocked, angled out and closed well for the show. OLD FORTY
FIVE mid pack, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path, then drifted in and flattened out. ROGERS GINGER mid pack, gained position
four wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and weakened. SEA CAPTAIN tracked the pace and faded through the turn. GAISGEACH improved
his position, inside. TWELVE YEAR MAC showed little. GOVERNOR ATWOOD was never involved.
