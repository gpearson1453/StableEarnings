Footnotes
RECONFIGURE settled inside the pacesetters, advanced on the turn, angled out into the stretch, wore down the two leaders and edged clear in a long
drive. CORDUROY ROAD quickly moved to the front, vied in two path on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. ANALYZER slipped through inside to
engage the leader on the turn and continued well while tiring. DECIMATOR dropped back early, moved inside on the turn and offered only a mild rally
outside in the lane. OUR ZUMA broke slowly, chased outside and lacked a response. FORESTER'S TURN raced just off the pace outside and proved
empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MITZI showed speed early, repelled a challenge on the turn, drifted in at the eighth pole and impeded a rival while inching away late. FEDALIA settled inside
behind horses early, waited on turn, engaged the leader on the inside approaching the eighth pole, was forced to steady and came off the rail to be a clear
second. TAQUANYAH was rated while outside on the turn, loomed into contention early stretch and held for a minor share. SYSTEMATIC trailed early on
then was asked entering the lane and had traffic issues throughout the stretch and made a belated run. SHES THE NORTH stalked four wide on the turn,
was in contention in the stretch and had nothing left for the final eighth. CLEOMENES pressured the leader through turn and flattened out in the drive. THE
RIDER OF FEDALIA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST MITZI FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE .AFTER REVIEW, MITZI WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SEGUIMI rated inside the pacesetters, angled out advancing at the quarter pole, rallied into the stretch and drew clear to the finish. HYPERFOCUS lagged
far behind early, moved very wide in the stretch, and closed strongly to get up for the place. ROCKET JOE COPPER stalked the leaders outside, moved
with the winner into the lane but was outfinished. COURTLY MANNER prompted the pace outside, vied through the final turn, led at the top of the stretch
and tired. SELFMADE chased off the leaders in the two path and lacked a rally. SOUPER COHIBA dropped well behind inside then passed fading rivals.
TAOS (FR) settled off the pace and was never a factor. ENDORPHIN RUSH set a pressured pace inside to the quarter pole and weakened. SOLAR saved
ground, stopped abruptly near the three eighths pole and was eased in the stretch.

CRUDEN BAY outrun early, saved ground bulk of trip, bid inside in the stretch and was up in the final yards under strong handling. GALVASTON settled
behind the dueling leaders, awaited room on the turn, slipped through into the stretch, led to the final yards but was nailed at the wire. JACKIE'S PRIDE
firmly rated three wide close up, moved wider in the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. EXCEED dropped back early, bid very wide into the stretch
and flattened out. DOCTOR WU alternated for the lead outside and weakened through the stretch. WOOD BE WILD rushed to the front inside, vied to the
stretch and gave way.

advanced from far back, drifted in badly in the lane and was outfinished inside. MIGHTY PELE ducked in sharply at the start, vied inside to the stretch and
yielded. BAYTOWN ELVIS saved ground, angled wide in the stretch and lacked a rally. INNUENDO was fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and
was outrun. LITHUANIAN KING dropped far behind and was never in contention. BODIE settled off the pace in the two path and came up empty.

Footnotes
LAC MACAZA settled on the rail in the early stages, waited for room on the turn and then angled outside for the stretch run, took the lead with a sixteenth to
go and drew away. RELIABILITY was four wide on both turns, loomed outside to take command through the stretch but could not hold off the eventual
winner. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY stalked inside and engaged the leaders entering the second turn, fought gamely while on the rail in the stretch but could not
hold off the top two finishers. UPSTART GENTLEMAN pressured the leader through the backstretch, took a brief lead in early stretch and levelled out final
eighth. ARGENTIUM trailed while saving ground in the early stages, angled out turning for home and passed tiring rivals. MEYER was well in hand mid pack
through the backstretch and was asked on the final turn and emptied out. DERZKII set the pace, was challenged early on the final turn and faltered turning
for home.
