Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PEAK moved to the fore to dictate terms racing off the inside after the opening sixteenth, went in the two path on the turn, edged clear in upper
stretch while drifting in then out a bit, just lasted under strong urging. MY LOVELY CHARLIE stalked the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn,
came out a bit in late stretch while gaining steadily. ABBEY LANE broke awkwardly and about three lengths slowly, settled at the rear, went two to three
wide on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, was gaining late but placed in tight quarters and carried out a bit nearing the wire. ALYS EPISODE had
the early lead then pressed from inside, lost ground on the leader in upper stretch and was outkicked. FEDERAL COURT tracked from the inside, failed to
rally. TAY TAY'S BABY chased four wide through the turn, failed to menace. LIFE OF SATURDAYS chased two wide, came out in the stretch while
weakening. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ABBEY LANE AGAINST MY LOVELY CHARLIE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CAP ROCK MINER quickly moved clear to set the pace racing off the rail, took a breather coming to the five-eighths then opened up again heading into the
turn, went in the three then four path on that bend drifting out a bit further turning for home, fended off an outside challenger then drifted in a bit, held while
being kept to the task. THE GRAY BLUR tracked the pace from outside a rival going two wide into the turn, moved to the rail past the five-sixteenths, kept
on in the stretch. BAJAN CASH bumped the outside rival lightly at the start then was bumped by the inside foe, made a steady advance three wide on the
turn being forced out five deep later on that bend, was in contention in upper- to mid-stretch then flattened out. DREAM HALO was lightly bumped at the
start, tracked from inside, switched outside a rival nearing the quarter pole, failed to rally thereafter. FREDONIAN was hard to load, a little fractious in the
gate, came out and bumped a rival after the start, raced inside early, swung four wide into the stretch and made no bid. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF DREAM HALO AGAINST THE GRAY BLUR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE PAST THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
CALAJA set the pace inside, dueled through the far turn, turned back that rival and edged clear. VITA settled last but one early then content to trail racing
near but just off the rail, came out in the stretch and ran on to get up for place. CAGED BEAR was a bit rank inside into the first turn, tipped out and made a
swift move to force the issue about the half, dueled outside through the turn then weakened in the stretch. MOORAC stalked two to three wide early,
weakened. KODIAK SKY trailed into the first turn in about the three path, made an early advance outside up the backstretch but just as quickly dropped
back and faded.

Footnotes
VISIONOFWILDTIMES faced some early pressure setting the pace inside on or just off the rail, edged clear in the stretch then held under steady
hand-urging. THE MISSING PIECE switched out early heading to the first turn, stalked in behind two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into upper
stretch, was second best. LADY BE GONE fought the rider's restraint early racing along the inside, tracked while saving ground, ran on evenly. LIMITLESS
MAZIE pressed the eventual winner two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. HANGING LAKE was forced five wide into the first turn, raced just off the
leaders outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, failed to rally. CHATAIN'S FLYER was caught four wide into the first turn, moved nearer the inside
racing into the far turn, moved back out five to six wide late on that bend, failed to rally.

CHARLIECANDO settled off the leaders in behind shifting in, went two to three wide through most of the turn, angled out coming to the quarter pole and
was seven deep past that marker, took aim and drove past late. SCRAPPY ARTIE attended the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn, retook the
lead in upper stretch, was outkicked. CAMEO DANCER broke in just a bit, shifted in up the backstretch, tracked from inside on the turn, kept on. GOLDEN
PASSAGE broke out a bit, moved back to the rail tracking up the backstretch, switched outside a rival coming to the half, went two wide on the turn, came
out a bit further in the stretch and ran on. OUR BLUE JAY stalked five wide, failed to rally. SILVER RATIO broke a step slowly and lost the path at the break,
moved forward between rivals to take command after the opening quarter, moved clear in the two path on the turn, weakened in the stretch. TIZ
MCNAMARA was bumped and bobbled at the start, trailed in the two to three path through the turn, failed to menace. DONNIE BOY was hard to load,
bumped a rival at the start, chased four wide, came up empty.

ROOSTER RUN stalked the pace, went three wide on the turn, took command at the top of the stretch and moved clear. ORBITAL STARR settled off the
leaders racing in the two to three path on the turn, advanced between runners near the furlong marker, kept on to get up for second in the shadow of the
wire. SPEEDY G pressed from inside, took a narrow and brief lead leaving the turn, was no match and lost the place late. LOU'S ARROW chased, went four
wide on the turn and ran on evenly. GOBLIN settled inside, came out in the stretch and improved. LANDRY AND LUCAS tracked inside, came out two wide
nearing the quarter pole, failed to rally. GOOD BYE CHARLIE set the pace racing off the rail, came up empty. MAPACHE MAN chased briefly, dropped
back and faded. KISSMEISTER switched out, went three to four wide on the turn, was never a threat.
