DREAM BABY DREAM was on the pace outside DEJA CREW, continued with that one to edge clear in the far turn and held safe under steady handling in
the lane. DEJA CREW forced the pace inside the winner, held well in the lane but could not go with that one late. RINESHAFT saved ground while never far
back, moved out in the lane to make a mild bid at second but came up short. TIFF'S DREAM tracked the top pair from four wide and weakened in the drive.
SEELEY failed to mount a rally three wide.

ZYXYZ chased the early leader three wide, inherited the lead as that one bolted nearing the lane then held safe under steady handling. OUR PETUNIA
moved to a clear lead about the two path and held the margin to midway of the far turn, bolted turning for home and rallied back to gain the place.
SHIVERHERTIMBERS followed the pace racing just off the inside, bid inside the winner turning for home but could not make the needed late run.
BLUEBIRD DAY was in reach four wide but lacked a final closing run. ASDRUBAL trailed throughout and lost contact nearing the stretch.
