SHOTTHRUTHEHEART trailed early, advanced outside leaving the final turn, rallied determinedly through the stretch and narrowly prevailed. KEEP YOUR
COOL chased from just off the rail, came under encouragement nearing the eighth marker, battled inside of SHOTTHRUTHEHEART and lost the nod. EXHI
KID rated off the pacesetters from the four path, lodged a bid just after the quarter pole but lacked running room, angled out but lacked the kick that was
needed. HERE COMES BARNEY vied for the lead, was unable to move on with FAST EH at the quarter pole, and passed tiring. FAST EH set a pressured
pace, was overtaken at the eighth pole, and gave way. PAULIE WALNUTS chased outside and tired.

RAVINA LANE hurried away, stalked the pacesetters through the backstretch, drove three wide off the final turn, and kicked clear. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS
settled outside, chased through the stretch but was no match for the winner. MEAN STREAK saved ground just off the rail, dropped back leaving the
backstretch and bid belatedly. MISYA GIRL sat just off the pace while four wide, and faded with two furlongs remaining. HUNGARIAN JOE set the early
pace, was overtaken at the quarter pole, and gave way. SPIRIT RACER was not a factor. STREAKIN AGAIN failed to reach contention.

Footnotes
ETU BABOU sat in striking position along the rail, swung out into the lane, rallied through the stretch and edged away. PULL THE PIN led the way through
through the backstretch, was challenged into the stretch and was wore down deep stretch. ABEEN unhurried early, sat in range while four to five wide
through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader near the three eighths marker, and flattened in the stretch. HE'S CRIMSON CODE raced at the back of
the pack, lodged a rail bid and was unable to improve his position through the stretch. FULL VELOCITY stalked outside and lacked a bid. DARK STORM
COMING reluctant to load, away well then chased the pacesetters from the two path and was done early. FIRST PRINCE rated off the pace and tired.

GO MAMA sat in striking distance, roused at the quarter pole, rallied between and edged clear. TALA stalked the pacesetter from the three path, rallied
three wide into the stretch and improve position late for place. CHATTY GAL hustled to the front, led the field into the stretch, and gave grudgingly inside.
DAME DEVIL reserved early, lodged a bid into the stretch and finished evenly. BEAUTIFUL BABE chased wide and passed tiring. AWESOME GIGI sat just
off the pace, fanned three wide into the far turn, and faded steadily. FLASHY SISTER offered little. LIL OL FLATTER reared leaving and never reached
contention. STEWARD'S INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving LIL OL FLATTER, after review LIL OL
FLATTER was deemed to have had a fair start.

Footnotes
BUCKYS PICK stalked from the rail, moved up alongside EVER TRUE to challenge the lead nearing the eighth pole and kicked clear. EVER TRUE set the
pace from the two path, was challenged into the stretch and finished second best. OUR DANDY'S BOY allowed to settle in the three path, drove four wide
leaving the final turn, and just held on for show. LONESOME CAT unhurried early, was roused at the quarter pole, and rallied belatedly just missing out for
show. ITS ALL ON SLEW raced three wide into the opening turn and advanced outside gradually into stretch. ROWDYROOSTER went four wide through
the first turn, and lacked a serious bid. FROBISHER BAY dropped back through traffic in the first turn, and showed a mild interest late. ACE OF DIAMONDS
showed little. NO MORE GAMES was under a snug hold leaving the opening turn, and tired early.
