Footnotes
CALL ME G Q pressed the pace outside and between foes, bid to the front midstretch then held outside rival safe through the final furlong. CURRENT
HOPE advanced three wide on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. KIKKERLAND hustled to the front inside, was collared at the
quarter pole and weakened. LAST INVESTMENT broke slowly, was in tight between rivals into the far turn and lacked a further response. I SAW IT ALL
saved ground close up and faltered on the turn. E T'S DEUCES WILD underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, stumbled at the start and stopped.

CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY moved inside into the far turn, vied through the turn and edged away under steady handling. PETULANT DELIGHT forced the pace
outside, dueled through the turn and continued willingly to the finish. BOAT OVER THE HILL dropped back early, advanced inside and closed well without
threatening. DAYTIME LOVER prompted the leaders three wide for half a mile and faded. ECLIPSED MOON lacked speed along the inside and was never
in contention. ANZIO BEACH flashed speed along the inside then was finished by the three eighths pole. KOWBOY KARMA lost contact with his field in the
opening half mile and trailed throughout.

SHEWEARSTHEPANTS took control inside, moved clear on the turn then quickly widened under a brisk hand ride. SNAPPY RIDE chased wide off the
pace, bid on the turn, was no threat to the winner but proved easily second best. SANTAFE EXPRESS saved ground off the pace and continued well for the
show. POP THE CLUTCH faded on the turn wide then came again while no factor. SUPER SURGE lacked speed inside, angled out in the stretch with a
mild bid. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY prompted the pace three wide then proved empty in the stretch. BITTERSWT SYMPHONY pressed the winner outside to
midway on the turn and gave way.

JACKS AMERICAN PIE quickly took control, widened before half mile, maintained a big advantage and lasted while tiring late. CHARLIES SAFARI saved
ground early, angled out on the final turn and closed well to gain place. GREYZER rated off the leaders outside, bid into the stretch with a gradual gain.
DOUGIE raced off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. FEARLESS FLY dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. WARRANT OFFICER fanned
wide on the first turn, raced in closest pursuit then gave way. COMMISSIONER DAVE trailed far behind and was never in contention. SLEW TANG CLAN
suffered a catastrophic injury to his left front leg near the far turn and was subsequently euthanized.

INDOCTRINATE controlled the pace inside, widened after half a mile, remained with a big advantage but was kept to a drive. LT. COLUMBO pursued the
winner all the way, continued well, proved no match but was second best. CATTY'S UNCLE saved ground, vied briefly then weakened steadily. MARGIN
OF AIR settled three wide off the leaders and lacked a rally. AUSTIN WHYLIE was void of speed along the inside and always outrun. A GRAY FOR
CAROLYN lagged far behind throughout.

EASY DAY prompted the pace four wide, gained a narrow lead at the half then came again to wear down the two leaders in the final furlong. APPEALING
FUTURE dueled between rivals, steadied midway on the turn then continued gamely to the finish. BIG CITY BOB stalked the pace inside, angled out on the
turn then dueled along the inside to the wire. GEEBERT dueled between rivals for the lead, was in tight midway on the turn then faded. LITTLE HARBOUR
forced the pace outside, was taken up sharply losing all chance on the turn. AWE MUN lagged far behind throughout. THOUSAND PERCENT set the pace
along the inside, suffered an injury to his left front leg midway on the turn, was eased and vanned off afterward. Objections by the third and fourth finishers
against the second finisher for interference on the turn were dismissed.

Footnotes
SHE'S GOT GAME close up between rivals, bid three wide on the turn, rallied clear and held the advantage driving. HALLIGIRL moved closer wide, was
blocked at the top of the stretch, angled out and closed well. PRINCESS KAIRA dropped far behind inside then gained wide through the stretch. HIT A
HOMER HONEY prompted the pace three wide, bid on the turn then weakened in the stretch. BROAD JUMPER alternated for the lead in the two path then
inside and faltered. BALBOA'S SMILE bid into the far turn then was in tight briefly and faded. YOURINDENIAL broke slowest and was never in contention.
ANGELSFOUR MICHELE prompted the pace inside to the far turn and retreated. MISBEHAVING LADY forced the pace wide briefly then gave way. FALL
CAMPAIGN dropped back early and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
