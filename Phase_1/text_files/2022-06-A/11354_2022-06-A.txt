KILGORE was well placed stalking the top pair into the turn, launched a three wide bid turning for home, seized command approaching the furlong marker
and finished going away. MAX'S HEART tracked the pace along the inside around the turn, shifted four wide heading approaching the upper stretch and got
up late for place. HANDSOME HUNTER vied inside of CLEARLY MAD for the early lead, continued to match strides around the turn, got overtaken by the
winner approaching the eighth pole then got edged late for place. CLEARLY MAD vied outside of HANDSOME HINTER around the turn then flattened in the
final furlong. BRASSY FIRE raced off the early pace, came four to five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. TROMPO raced in the back
throughout.

TAPTHATLUCK rated three to four wide under slight restraint just off the early pace, let out a notch four wide late on the far turn then hustled up into the
lane, roused forward to challenge REBEL RISING for the lead, dug in under left handed pressure and edged away. REBEL RISING stumbled at the start
and recovered quickly to be forwardly placed around the first turn, vied three deep midway around the final turn, held a slim lead into the upper stretch then
failed to hold off the winner and had to settle for second best. GAME TO PLAY led the way around the first turn then conceded position and tracked the
leader into the far turn, launched a rail bid and dueled midway around the far turn then gave way in the upper stretch. PAPA'S SECRET was well reserved
in the back, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. KASA pressed the pace around the first turn then took over the lead in the early
backstretch, vied between rivals midway around the far turn then came empty.

Footnotes
OIL MONEY broke readily, sped to the lead at the start and widened advantage around the turn, saved ground into the lane, pulled away from the field and
kept to task under a mild drive. CHICKS DIG SCARS broke last and raced in the rear up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside around the turn, cut
the corner into the lane and finished clearly second best. NO SHIRT NO SHOES tracked the pace along the outside, coaxed three to four wide around the
turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and gained show. SHANNON C was forwardly placed soon after the start, chased after eventual winner around
the turn then weakened. JOE FRAZIER was not too far back early on, chased three wide around the turn then gave way. UPSTRIKER tracked the top two
leaders in the opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn then faded.

KELA'S TURN broke on top then conceded position and tracked the pace into the turn, hustled up three wide into the upper stretch, dug in determinedly
under left handed pressure, inched up closer on the top pair and got up in final strides. ELLE'S TOWN set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around
the turn, took on the challenge from BLINKERS in the upper stretch, battled on gamely two wide and got edged in final strides. BLINKERS stalked the early
pace, saved ground then launched a rail bid turning for home, dueled inside of ELLE's TOWN in upper stretch, battled back gamely from the rail in final
stages and narrowly missed. BOSSY MOMENT raced off the top trio in early stages, coaxed three wide heading into the lane and failed to rally. MY FIRST
PEARL hesitated then hopped out of the gate and spotted the field several lengths, continued in or near the back, chased three wide around the turn and
never threatened. TOPLESS raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response.

OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT bobbled slightly and got bumped at the start then settled off the early pace, continued unhurried up the backstretch then began to
pick up the tempo four wide near the quarter pole, hustled up four to five wide at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and cleared late. ALL GOOD
TIMES pressed the pace up the backstretch, took command around the far turn, dueled with CLAYS MOON STONE past the furlong marker, shook free
then got outfinsihed. JILTED BRIDE stalked the clear top pair up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid into
the lane and ran on for a share. CLAY'S MOON STONE bobbled then hopped at the start and rated off the early pace, saved ground then tipped out a path
late on the far turn, angled back inside and roused forward along the rail, dueled at the furlong marker then weakened in the final sixteenth. A GIRL LIKE
ME raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide late on the turn and improved position without threatening. BOBBIN TAIL rated off the clear top pair
up the backstretch and faded mid-way around the final turn. STONECOLD STUNNER saved ground and failed to move into contention. BLESSED AGAIN
set a pressured pace up the backstretch, came up empty late on the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.
