Footnotes
BE THE BOSS set the pace just off the rail, angled in and shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. STRAIGHT
TIME tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path, then ran evenly the final furlong and held the place. LIGHTNING
CHARLIE mid pack, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. BENEDICTUS mid pack, looped three and four
wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. AMBUSHED allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals and could not gain. OLD FORTY FIVE passed a tiring rival. DUN RIGHT stalked the pace on the inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
MATCHA well placed, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong
marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. LOOKING FOR LOVE stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the
turn, bid outside of that one, gaining the lead into the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place. BROKEN LOVE allowed to settle, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, closed willingly and missed the place. STORMY STELLA well placed, looped up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, flattened and held a share. FLOR DE PLATA allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid
on that path into the lane, drifted in and weakened. DETAILED set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final
furlong. GO G G GO ran evenly, inside. HELENS SPIRIT ran evenly.
