Footnotes
SURELY A LEGEND, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, conceded some ground entering the bend while switching out three wide, continued with a
steady bid to challenge for command in that path midstretch and edged clear under pressure. EXODUS AND HOPE, urged between foes disputing the pace
in the opening stages, dueled inside a rival racing through the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. DIGGS WON broke readily, tracked off the first flight
inside a rival in the opening quarter, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch and finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. TIMBER LADY tracked
off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn and faded nearing upper stretch. INDYD'ORO settled last along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch
but failed to seriously menace. MOXY'S GAL ducked out at the start getting away a step slowly, was hustled outside foes to dispute the pace three wide into
the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
MONGOL ALTAI, off a step slowly, was settled last while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide
racing into the far turn, shifted inwards contesting the issue outside a rival in a prolonged drive racing into upper stretch but prevailed late under firm
encouragement. HIGHTAIL COWBOY broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, continued to dispute the issue between foes,
then inside the eventual winner, resisting that foe to late stages, but came up second best. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER prompted the pace inside a rival
from the outset to the seven sixteenths marker, was eased off the pace while switching out four wide racing into the lane but continued to regain some
position with a second effort. GOT SWAGGER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid three wide
between foes on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. DAREABIGDREAM settled off the leaders while angling nearer the inside on the first turn,
switched out racing into the backstretch but never proved a serious threat. RISKY SITUATION tracked off the first flight inside rivals to the backstretch but
gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TIZ WONDERFULLY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing off the inside to the far turn, widened the margin on the far turn, shifted
inwards under right handed pressure nearing midstretch while being urged to fend off the challenge of STREAMER and just lasted under brisk handling.
PIPER ROSE stumbled at the start, was settled along the inside for five furlongs, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and found her best stride in
the closing stages to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. STREAMER tracked off the second flight under rating along the inside in the
opening half, tipped three wide on the far turn steadily gaining position, angled inside the pacesetter advancing on that rival in upper stretch but lost some
momentum when caught in tight quarters through the last furlong. CRIMINAL RECORD, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the
far turn, gave way between foes racing into upper stretch. NOCTURNAL MISSION angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second
flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn. INDAWIN stumbled, then was steadied while correcting her course at the start,
switched outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch but failed to gain striking distance. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF STREAMER
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIZ WONDERFULLY. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED
TIZ WONDERFULLY FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER THIRD.

COLLEGE PARTY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a rival racing into the turn, shook clear in
upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. MIAMI CROCKETT broke sharply, then raced between rivals in the first
flight in the opening furlong, was rated just off those foes nearing the bend, then held up momentarily avoiding close quarters entering the turn, shifted out
three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. RICKEY B tracked off the first flight along the inside in the
opening stages, steadied out of tight quarters momentarily entering the turn, then continued with interest inside foes to improve position in the closing
stages. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was settled last in early stages, angled inside racing past the half mile marker, saved ground to the stretch and made an
effort to gain some position inside rivals late. FREUDIAN FATE tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages and steadily faded into upper
stretch. BIBLEMAN was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, switched outside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch
and abruptly emptied out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MIAMI CROCKETT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE RACING INTO THE TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
I KICKN, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward while shifting a bit off the rail entering the stretch and held
gamely to the end under firm handling. TEXAS LONG BOW tracked off the first flight three deep racing into the turn, advanced in that path to gain terms
with the winner nearing midstretch but failed to gain even terms with that foe. LIBERTARIAN tracked the leaders between foes in early stages, was eased
back ceding position entering the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. HI HO CHEERIO
tracked off the first flight between foes, angled to the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. MAY WE
ALL, urged prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, gave way between foes into upper stretch. PASSED BY PAUL, off a bit
slowly, was urged inside foes to gain a position tracking off the first flight racing to the turn but faded early. MY BOY LOLLIPOP was outpaced soon after the
break.

Footnotes
KING OF THE KIDS, reserved last to the backstretch, was prompted to advance gaining position three wide between foes on the far turn, shifted four wide
racing into upper stretch, rallied to the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and went clear under firm handling. NORTH ARM BAY tracked off the first flight
along the inside to the backstretch, advanced along the rail racing into upper stretch to challenge for command inside foes and prevailed narrowly for the
place honors late. THAT'S NOT FUNNY prompted the pace inside a rival in the opening three furlongs, conceded the lead midway through the backstretch,
switched outside the leader racing into the far turn while moving to close the gap on that foe, wrested the advantage in the three path racing past midstretch
but couldn't contain the winner's bid and was outfinished for the place honors. ANGEL'S MAGIC was urged pressing the pace outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, edged forward to dictate the pace a bit off the inside after a half, dueled for command into upper stretch and yielded between rivals late. MR.
D'S LEGEND tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide racing into the far turn and
emptied out into the lane. MINNESOTA RED tracked off the second flight three wide to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing through the far turn but
offered no rally. HUNTER JUMPER, caught in tight quarters, then clipped in the opening furlong, settled along the inside to the backstretch and failed to
menace thereafter. SILENT SAILOR settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SAFETY broke readily, vied with the leaders four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the turn while edging forward to
a narrow advantage, dictated the pace into the stretch and held SHADOWLESS safe to the end under brisk handling. The latter, prominent five wide in the
opening stages, angled inwards pressing the issue outside the eventual winner through the turn into the lane, continued willingly to the end but proved only
second best. LAPIS LAZULI tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening stages, was eased back from that position nearing the turn, angled out three
wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share. SAHM TEQUILA contested the opening furlong three wide
between foes, was eased off the leaders racing into the turn, angled inside nearing the lane and continued evenly late. COACH HAPPY broke inwards while
dropping back at the start, was held up between foes on the backstretch, shifted out three deep to make some brief progress racing into the turn but
flattened out in upper stretch. BIT COINER, a bit slow into stride, continued evenly between foes while proving no threat. ELUSIVE FREUD flashed brief
pace between foes in the opening furlong but retreated early. MALINTENT, urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening furlong, gave way early.

Footnotes
BABY BEE MERRY tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing into the turn, tipped outside the pacesetter in upper stretch and continued with a sustained
three deep bid to late stages to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. MISS GLORIOUS, urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage, edged forward to a clear advantage while shifting off the inside in upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to the end but just failed to contain that
foe. SKYKAT broke awkwardly, angled to the inside early, then found a seam along the rail in the closing stages to find her best stride while closing the gap
inside the top pair. VISUAL MAGIC settled into stride off the inside racing to the turn, was fanned six wide entering the lane and continued with interest to
improve position. TAILORBESWIFT tracked off the second flight in early stages, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and continued with late
interest. ELSIE'S KID vied with the leaders three wide between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside entering the turn but had no closing bid.
SILVER COIN urged four wide through the backstretch into the bend pursuing the leaders, emptied out into upper stretch. TRIPLE BOLD BABY was urged
pressing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT, pulling against restraint along the inside in the opening stages, stalked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the far turn, tipped
out racing into upper stretch while being urged to terms with the pacesetter, was carried out in the closing stages by that rival but prevailed in time under
firm handling. CENTRAL PARK, urged dictating the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, then to the far turn, shifted out racing
through the stretch resisting the winner's bid but failed to contain that foe. ASTRONOMICAL, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace to the far turn,
was fanned to the four path in upper stretch but weakened late. FLATOUT WINNER was rated tracking off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far turn
and improved position between foes in the closing stages. ZOE'S DELIGHT switched outside foes tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch,
lodged a brief, four wide bid racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. HUNKA BURNING LOVE, urged between foes prompting the pace
from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.
