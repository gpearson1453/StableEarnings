Footnotes
IRREFUTABLE was hustled leaving the start, edged to a narrow lead into the turn, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter pole, opened the lead in
upper stretch and kicked clear in the late going. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly and stalked the pace through the turn, could not match strides with the
winner in the stretch run and was outkicked in the final stages while holding safely for second. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT chased the pace to the turn, came
two wide between rivals nearing the quarter marker, was outfinished by the top pair in the drive but did offer a mild late rally to secure third. ITALIANO
chased the early pace, advanced on the turn while three wide, ran evenly to the stretch and did not offer a late rally. FRANKLIN ONE STAR was under a
snug hold into the turn while close to the pace, lost ground while along the rail on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.
CHIEF JACKSON bobbled at the start and was away slowly, chased the pace from the rear, swung widest into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
OPENING BUZZ broke in at the start and crowded BACKSTREET AFFAIR, showed good early speed while in hand and set the pace to the turn, extended
the lead nearing the quarter marker, drew off in the stretch run and was geared down in the end in an impressive debut. ASCENDANCY tracked the pace
from a ground saving path, was outkicked in upper stretch, was no match in the end for the winner but was best of the rest. BACKSTREET AFFAIR was
crowded by OPENING BUZZ at the start and ducked in sharply leaving the break, lacked speed through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no
match for the top pair but stayed on to secure the show. HARBOR'S ROSE settled off of the early pace, came two wide along the turn, lacked room in upper
stretch and did not mount a late rally. SALLY GOT STYLE tracked the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the drive.
TAMANTARI hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, lost ground while outside of rivals on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

SAY IT WITH ROSES was sent while in hand to the front and set the pace into the first turn, was well handled while carving out reasonable fractions
through the backstretch run, repelled MOMMY ROSE in midstretch and held sway in the end to prevail in a drive. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) settled off of the
pace while racing in midpack early on, maintained position into the second turn, came three wide into the drive and could not reel in the winner in the final
stages but closed well late to secure the place. MOMMY ROSE was hustled leaving the break, took back to track the pace through the backstretch run,
advanced on the pacesetter along the second turn, could not make headway on the winner in the drive and was outfinished in the final stages while holding
safely for third. BLUSHING BAY was forwardly placed into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground while three wide nearing
the quarter marker, swung four wide into the drive, Pena lost his crop inside of the furlong marker, and did not mount a late rally. MALIBU JEWEL settled in
midpack while just off of the early pace, improved position along the backstretch run, stalked the pace into the second turn while saving all of the ground,
stayed in contention to midstretch but gave way in the final stages. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was allowed to settle, maintained position through the
backstretch run, came two then three wide on the far turn and offered a mile late rally to challenge for the minor awards. SASSY EINSTEIN was unhurried in
the opening stages, steadied off of heels while in tight entering the first turn, settled at the rear into the second turn and rallied through traffic in the stretch
run to show good late interest. MANGOTANGO settled off of the early pace, slipped to the inside entering the first turn causing SASSY EINSTEIN to steady
off of heels, saved all of the ground into the second turn and made a mild late gain in the final stages.

Footnotes
ARISTEIA stalked the early pace from the midflight, ranged up three wide nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, confronted BACALAR
inside of the sixteenth marker and made a late push to prevail. BIG FAME was shuffled at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace to the turn,
slipped to the inside nearing the head of the stretch, ran evenly to midstretch but offered a good late bid and got the nod for second. SEENEVA THE CAT
broke in the air and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, came outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker, made a four wide rally through the stretch
run and just missed for second while getting the nod for third. BACALAR was sent to the front leaving the break, extended the lead nearing the quarter
marker, was clear into the final furlong, was tiring in the late stages and drifted out a path and gave way in the end. MISTICAL SURPRISE chased the early
pace from the rail, lost position on the turn and mounted a mild late rally but was not a threat. ROSARITA CARMELITA showed early speed and pressed the
pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, attempted to split rivals nearing the sixteenth-marker and took up when that space was closed by
the drifting BACALAR and did not offer a late rally. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AND IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION RULED THAT BACALAR DRIFTED INTO THE PATH OF ROSARITA CARMELITA NEARING THE SIXTEENTH-MARKER AND COST
ROSARITA CARMELITA THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. AS A RESULT, BACALAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED
SIXTH.

advanced on the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, boldly dove inside in the final sixteenth and surged in the final yards to prevail. STARSHIP
ENDEAVOR was sent leaving the break and was engaged by AWESOME AGENDA to duel through quick fractions into the backstretch run, continued to
battle that rival in upper stretch, came under heavy pressure in the final sixteenth and was just nailed on the wire for the win, while holding for second in a
blanket finish. LORETTA settled off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn while two wide, continued to gain in upper stretch
and just missed in the end for the win and place, while getting the nod for the show. AWESOME AMANDA was sent leaving the break and engaged with
STARSHIP ENDEAVOR to duel for pace duties, maintained position into the second turn while carving out quick fractions, came under pressure inside of
the furlong marker and was just edged out for the minor awards in a blanket finish. BANDEENA stalked the pace from midpack on the first turn, lost position
on the second turn while two wide, gained ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. DR WYSONG stalked the quick early pace, came
three wide along the second turn, ran evenly to the stretch and did not mount a late rally in the drive. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was rank along the first turn
while traveling toward the rear, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside on the second turn, made a late rally in the drive but did not
threaten in the end.

Footnotes
DULCE EMMA was forwardly placed to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker to confront the pacesetter, overtook SWEET CALIFORNIA
in upper stretch and held safely in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. MISS UNION broke alertly then took back off of the early pace, settled off of the
pace through the turn, was roused two wide into the drive, closed well in the final stages and could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest.
CODE RIBBON was shuffled back leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, gained ground while chasing the pace from a three wide path on the turn, was
outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on to be clear for third. VRONSKY FEINT took back off of the early pace, improved position on the turn, came four
wide nearing the quarter marker and finished evenly in the drive. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT was hustled out of the gate to show early speed, was in tight
while racing in a pocket leaving the three furlong marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SWEET CALIFORNIA was sent
leaving the break and set pressured fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE LUTE broke alertly and contested the early pace to the turn, opened the lead nearing the quarter marker while setting fast fractions, was
confronted by CAROLINA MIA in upper stretch and determinedly held the runner-up at bay through the lane to prevail. CAROLINA MIA tracked the early
pace to the turn, mounted a three wide move into the stretch run, confronted GIVE ME THE LUTE in upper stretch, could not get by the determined winner
in the drive and was gamely bested in the end, while holding safely for second. PSYCHO DAR chased the quick early pace from midpack, improved position
outside of rivals on the turn, rallied four wide into the drive and could not reel in the top pair in the end but was clear for third. AWAY FROM THE SUN
contested the fast early pace with GIVE ME THE LUTE, gave ground to that foe along the turn, shifted out inside of the furlong marker and was outrun in the
drive. ULTIMATE BANGO chased the fast early pace from the inside through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, could not make an impact on the top
three in the end but was gaining in the final sixteenth. WAR GAMES chased the quick early pace, came three wide through the turn and found his best
stride in the late stages. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was a bit slow into stride early on, trailed into the turn, improved position on the turn while three wide
and showed good late interest but was not able to threaten in the end. HEY MATE was forwardly placed into the turn, lost position while on the rail nearing
the quarter marker and was outrun in the drive. BIG DUKE lacked early speed and was not a factor.

OFFSHORE AFFAIR first away, sped to a comfortable lead, responded to challengers approaching the half, drew off when asked, much the best.
STALKING SHADOW broke alertly, was content to let the leading trio set the early pace, let those get a way from him passing the half-mile marker but was
put into a long, determined drive and got there in time for the place. VANTAGE POINT was hustled to attend the early pace, was hard held through the turn,
was in striking position to he far turn, made a bid for the lead passing the quarter pole and tired in the late stages. GOVENOR'S PARTY hustled from the
outside to challenge the early pace, settled three-wide and just off OFFSHORE AFFAIR down the backstretch, was split by VANTAGE POINT approaching
the half, those two continued to duel behind the leader, was outfinished but stayed on to just miss a minor placing. ROCKS AND SALT last into stride,
angled to the rail into the first turn, made steady forward progress under persistent handling from the half and finished evenly in the drive. GALLANT
WARREN off a step slow, was part of trio at the rear of the field to the far turn, attempted to launch a bit from there but never got untracked in a dull effort.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP allowed to settle near the rear early, took a three-wide path through the first turn, was unable to keep up with the field passing the
half and finished evenly behind the field.
