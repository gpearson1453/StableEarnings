Footnotes
JUSTA BUSTER closest to the leader, inherited the advantage in the two path when that one appeared to hit the rail late in the turn, held a narrow
advantage over that one and a second rival past the furlong marker, fully extended to narrowly prevail while between those same two foes at the wire.
BRYKEN N MITCHELL broke well, showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the way through some soft fractions up the backstretch and into the
turn, appeared to hit the rail under a right handed crop turning for home, briefly lost action, headed, continued gamely to the wire after recovering, narrowly
gained the place while continuing along the inside in a promising debut. PROUDTOWN within striking position outside exiting the chute, fell back the second
quarter, crept back into contention in the three path turning for home, lodged a mild bid outside the top two past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late
going to settle for the third spot. ORPHAN CREEK in the main body between horses and in the two path for a half, continued off the inside into the lane,
went evenly to the wire. BUBBA SMACK lacked speed while racing along the inside, saved that ground to no avail to never menace. MORO PHAROAH
trailed early, made a tepid middle move outside, faltered when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL with the early pace three wide, dueled into the turn, clear midway on that bend, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the
furlong marker, maintained daylight to the wire under a firm right handed crop. PRAYERS SAVED in the second flight early, early move to duel outside the
winner into the turn, fell back off that one past the furlong marker, coming again late on the winner while narrowly holding the place. BLUE RIDGE HEAT
lacked early foot outside, shuffled slightly in some traffic off the inside into the turn, three wide through much of the rest of the bend, set down, finished
willingly to be getting to the runner up in the waning strides, too late. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH settled off the pace, raced in the two path turn, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a closing response. BOSSY'S TROUBLE away in good order, raced forwardly early along the inside, continued to save ground
turn, had little left for the stretch run. APHRODITES REVENGE broke back, raced outside and came four wide out of the turn when still able to see them all,
lacked a significant closing response. C C CROWN'S CHOICE prompted the winner early to that one's outside, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
MS. CAJUN QUEEN broke with the leaders, raced in the second three wide onto and up the backstretch, moved closer while being asked along turning for
home, challenged when widest past the furlong marker, kicked clear under steady handling. TURF DANCER dueled up front in the two path, alternated for
the lead early backstretch, fell back off the other speed into the far turn, rebid soon after, vied between rivals past the furlong marker, proved no match for
the winner late, held the place. TRINITY HOPE off a step slow, trailed in the three path through the first turn, continued back the middle half mile, rallied
through traffic down the straight, gained the nod for the show at the wire while getting to the runner up. SHE'S WAYNE'S away well, set or forced the pace
closest to the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage into the lane, faltered the final furlong, missed the show. CONNECT IT in the second flight while
between horses in the two path, saved ground through the final turn, had little for the drive. ANN'S STORM 2nd group inside, moved out, trailed home in
lacking a closing rally.

Footnotes
MASTERLY broke well, soon clear, set the pace under light restraint, clear in to the lane, maintained daylight under a brisk right handed crop, in hand final
strides. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR last away, settled in mid pack, four wide through most of the turn, rallied to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the
winner. SR. CLARKY in the second flight off the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the turn, chased the winner nearing the furlong marker, lacked
a closing punch in failing to contain the runner up, remained well clear of the others. MAKATI PHIL within striking distance, boxed in along the rail through
the turn then came up empty when clear for the stretch. SOUTHPINE GIFT fell back to trail after the start, remained back while three wide through the bend,
improved position through the lane while not a serious threat with some moderate late interest. ZENUCCI broke back, also lagged well back through the
turn, saved some ground into the lane, improved slightly by picking off a couple of tiring rivals. HALF A BITE back off the pace, had nothing for the drive.
ZENDELPHIAN chased the winner early after breaking alertly, began a steady retreat before a half.

HEI HEI CUSTIVITY broke sharp from the outside to clear immediately, set a lively pace toward the inside, not threatened through the stretch while kept to
task with a firm right handed crop. THAT'S MY MAMA settled well off the early pace, made a steady advance while saving ground turn, shifted out for the
drive, could do little with the winner, edged clear for the place. CHARLIE T away in good order, pressed the winner early from along the inside, chased that
same rival through the turn, also proved no match in the drive, could not contain the runner up, far clear of the others. RUN NATALIE RUN went one paced
while racing three wide throughout. GLADS LOVE CAT lacked speed off the inside, continued back in the two path through the turn, made little impact in
lacking a response through the stretch. BRIDLED UP checked up in tight at the break, raced well back inside, lacked clear room along the rail late in the
turn, also lacked a response in the drive. LIL ADEAU was finished after a half, trailed well back at the wire.

Footnotes
CHARLIE G in hand while racing off the pace and the inside into the first turn, moved inside of RICKY BOBBY to soundly bump that one onto the
backstretch, four wide into the far turn, good advance to be clear into the lane, repelled an inside bid from EYE DEE KAY with a sixteenth to run then held
the runner up safe late under steady handling. CANTILLATE lacked speed for five furlongs under firm restraint, three wide far turn, set down, coming late to
be getting to the winner in the waning strides. EYE DEE KAY moved up inside to vie inside midway on the first turn, continued to contest the issue up the
backstretch, shuffled back along the rail far turn, stayed inside, rebid past the furlong marker, flattened out in the late going, comfortably saved the show.
KING DOODLE rank, got out into the first turn when contesting the pace, continued to vie between horses up the backstretch, faltered through the stretch.
JIMMIE'S HALO set or forced pace three wide early, continued to vie into the far turn, gave way from between horses soon after. RICKY BOBBY floated out
four wide into the first turn when with leaders, bumped soundly by the winner onto the backstretch, stopped soon after, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
POST CLOSE last to leave, moved up in mid pack up the backstretch toward the inside, over took a tiring leader in the two path midway on the turn,
dropped to the rail, cut the corner to immediately challenge upper stretch, took over, enough left to last. KING OF THE TESTO back off the pace and the
inside, angled out five wide when beginning to advance turning for home to lose considerable ground to the winner, rallied down the middle of the strip and
was rapidly getting to that same foe late. CAVE RUN in the second flight off the inside, remained four wide through the turn to also lose some real estate to
the victor, late push inside the runner up, outkicked by that rival while narrowly best of the others. DRIED PEPPER broke well, dueled up front in the two
path, put the other speed away midway on the turn, allowed the winner the inside into the lane, dueled with that one pace the furlong marker, gave ground
grudgingly in the late going to narrowly lose a couple of position. BIRTHDAY PARTY closest to the dueling leaders, raced three wide when in contention
through the turn, bid between foes into late, even late when in some traffic at the wire. SWEEPING EDGE broke back, lacked speed in trailing for five
furlongs, swung five to six wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. GUITARZAN moved up inside to duel up front, stopped midway on the turn, fell far back
and jogged in.

Footnotes
SCORING DRIVE broke with leaders, settled while four wide into the first turn, three wide through the second turn when beginning to move closer, set down
on the outside for the drive, late surge to take over and edge clear at the wire. SY MICHAEL void of speed, began to advance through traffic far turn,
dropped to the inside to ride the rail into the lane, steady rally up the inside to be in time for the place. BATTLE OF WILL broke out a bit, was straightened to
race in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn steered out three wide and advanced on the leaders into the straight,
three wide bid past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the top two at the wire. LEROY JENKINS outrun early while well back toward the rail,
continued to save some ground second turn and into the stretch, altered course for room to the outside with a furlong remaining, finished up with a mild rally
to improve position. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL chased the leader just off the inside, collared that one from the outside turning for home to take over in upper
stretch, could not last. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY broke back, lacked early foot, came four wide out of the final turn when improving, failed to sustain that
advance in the run to the wire. MUCHO VELOCE devoid of any speed as well, two path final turn, passed some tiring rivals to better position without posing
a serious threat. FULL OF GLORY moved up to race in the second flight off the inside, continued to pursue the pace into the far turn while in the two path,
had little left for the drive. AND FIFTY broke on top, sprinted clear past the wire the first turn, continued to set a moderately pressured pace up the
backstretch, gave way when headed turning for home. NATE'S REVENGE last away, remained always back to be outrun. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE in mid
pack early, was finished after half. SEVEN FURLONG FRACTIONAL SPLIT UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MY MAN LOUIE broke out but alertly, briefly dueled closest to the inside, clear before a furlong, received a breather in the turn, drew off through the lane
under steady handling. MR. E EDWARDS in the main group early off the inside, rallied four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be far clear for the
place, no match for the winner. ISLE CALL U LATER forwardly placed from the start, asked along into the turn, chased winner into the lane, no match for
that one or the runner up. BIG TIME BANDIT went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. BULLETSREVENGE broke in good order, dueled
briefly outside the winner then could not keep up, gave way in the turn and continued to weaken through the lane. PAC THE PULPIT lacked early foot, came
three wide and between foes into the lane, improved bit. NVRFORGET URDREAMS floated out a bit at the break, raced in mid pack outside, four wide into
the lane, made little impact down the lane. BIG AL'S HONOUR devoid of speed, failed to menace in the two path. RUN TO BLADE in mid pack inside,
saved ground through the turn, backed up down the lane. FLASHY PREMO bothered, off slow, far back, never close. OLE BULLET dwelt at the start, also
raced far back early, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged across.
