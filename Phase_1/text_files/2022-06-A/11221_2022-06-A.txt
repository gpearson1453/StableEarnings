rail then flattened the final furlong. MOJO MATTERS gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride.
BELLA FEMMINA chased the early pace inside, drifted to the six path leaving the turn and showed little further. LADY TIZMO gave chase through the
backstretch but weakened into the turn. U S FUNDS broke out and made contact with Lunar Prayer, pressured the pace inside but dropped back
approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened leaving the three sixteenths pole. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE saved ground.

Footnotes
ROCKING TO HOME gave chase through the backstretch, took the lead two deep midway on the turn, cleared JUBA JUNIOR leaving the turn, was steadily
handled to widen then taken in hand late, while the latter angled to the inside and set the pace, was pressured into the turn, gave up the lead at the rail
midway through the turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and just lasted for second. BOUGHT BY DIVA gave chase, rounded the turn about the three
path, finished well and just missed second. IHEARTRAINACOMN chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane.
JUBA'S YANKEE ONE chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened. LIMEHOUSE NEWS was not a factor. GAVINS BOY steadied on the chute
and never factored. JU JU'S HEAT saved ground then angled outward leaving the turn.

ROOF TOP BAR settled close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear midway on the
far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. SUSPIROS was firmly rated off the pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three
eighths pole, steadily improved in the four path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch to take second the final yards. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rated
a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail past the five sixteenths, steadied midway on the far turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. GHOST ON A MISSION broke in and made contact with DUNLUCE CAISSLE then stalked from the three path,
challenged toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride leaving the turn. The latter was bumped at the break
and settled off the pace in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but weakened in the four path of the far turn. GOOFY BOY
settled off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. SUPER HOUDINI dropped back at the rail in to the first turn and raced well back. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Roof Top Bar, lodged by the rider of Chesapeake Charlie for alleged interference midway on the far
turn, though found no infraction.

JAYJAYDEE raced with the early pace inside, took the lead into the second turn and was rated from that point, came under pressure toward the quarter
pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. MARTIN MAN settled just off the early pace in the two and three paths then
saved ground into the second turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in through the lane and was
gaining steadily late. LOST MY VOWCHER rounded the opening turn about the four path then stalked into the second turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path then dueled in the lane for third. HOBE SOUND saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. PROTA rated a slim lead, was met into the second
turn and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN settled back off
the rail, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path.
