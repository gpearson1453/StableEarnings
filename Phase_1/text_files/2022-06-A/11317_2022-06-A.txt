Footnotes
YES AND YES tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, took the inside route into upper stretch and got roused straightened away with an open
rail in front, had the leader come inwards and was forced to steady off his heels just outside the eighth pole, tipped out inside that station re-engaged by the
rider and quickly rallied to split foes with seventy yards to the finish and got up in the final jumps to score. SOULMATE just off the inside in pursuit from the
tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth digging
in willingly but missed at the end. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat and came inwards forcing YES AND YES to steady off his heels near the eighth pole, dug in under
threat from a pair to the finish and was caught in the final seventy yards by both while clear of the rest for the show honors. FAUCI broke in at the start and
was corrected, tracked just off the inside from just off the pace coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. SUMMER TO REMEMBER broke in at the start filling the space left vacated by FAUCI, who
broke inwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late going. REUX (GB) broke out at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear of the compact field, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, was never extended and backed away to the finish in hand.

Footnotes
SPIKED showed speed then stalked the pace on the outside, inched closer in the three path around the turn, was asked late on that bend, took the lead at
the quarter-pole, battled outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. AUNT NAUGHTY bumped with a foe at the start,
set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole,
fought on gamely inside that opponent to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. PRECURSORY was taken under a light hold early then settled
off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, gained outside coming to the quarter-pole, loomed a threat behind the
top two into the final furlong but flattened out and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. VERONICA GREENE broke out at the start, settled off the
pace, moved in with six furlongs to run, went two then three wide around the turn, was given her cue at the three-eighths pole, swung five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. MILAN'S GIRL stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe and was off a bit slow, raced a bit green while taken
under a tight hold behind horses early then was rated off the pace, leveled out while let out before the five-eighths, was asked while three to four wide
around the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT settled well back on the outside, went three wide around the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. MEMENTO MI settled off the pace, was urged along while shifting from the rail to the three path around
the turn and failed to respond. DOLCE SERA pressed the pace between foes, dropped back under urging with three furlongs to run and retreated.

CONSUMER SPENDING brushed at the start by SWEET SENSATION, who broke inwards a step, tracked the front just off the inside through the first turn
and then two to three wide down the backstretch under a light hold, went just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing just past the
three-eighths, tipped three wide through the latter portion of the turn and swung three to four wide into upper stretch taking over the front straightened away
for home, edged away under a drive getting geared down in the final seventy yards to the finish to prevail comfortably on the line. MYRISKYAFFAIR tracked
the pace along the inside, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining and tipped out three wide at the head of the stretch, ran on to chase the
winner home getting up for the place honors in the final strides. SKIMS (GB) three then two wide through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside
under a firm hold and patiently handled until just outside the quarter pole, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch getting mildly bumped
by VERGARA before straightened away, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish but was bested in the final jumps for the place honors while clear of
the rest. VERGARA lightly coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way under a light rating hold along the inside through sensible splits
under close watch from SKIMS but facing no pressure from that rival, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole when facing pressure for the initial time
through the latter portion of the far turn, took the inside route into upper stretch bumping SKIMS mildly before straightened away, yielded the front at that
juncture and weakened to the finish. SWEET SENSATION broke in at the start bumping CONSUMER SPENDING, saved ground at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing half a mile from home and made little headway, cut the corner into upper stretch, drifted out eased home to the finish when trailing
throughout.

Footnotes
ASYMMETRIC broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside of many foes, vied five then four wide around the turn, rallied to the lead into upper
stretch, was challenged by the runner-up near the furlong marker, drifted out under a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole, took a straight course
from that point while battling with the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed. OCEAN'S RESERVE brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along
early then taken in hand, went four wide on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker, fought on even
terms with the winner into the final sixteenth, battled with that foe to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. DEVIL BOY broke in and was off
slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was reserved under tight restraint while tugging at the bit, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn,
gained six wide into the stretch, loomed a threat in the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. OUSTER was hard held while tugging keenly
at the bit, moved out around the five-eighths pole, drafted in the two path while between horses around the turn, lacked room behind foes under coaxing into
upper stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. SINFUL DANCER was rated just off the pace on
the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, moved off the rail while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. COMPROMISER was
off slow then dropped further back, raced inside to the three path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, lugged in some during the drive and
improved position. TOMMY GUN was hustled to the front, showed the way with company to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into
upper stretch and gave way. CATCHING CUPID pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path while between foes on the turn, dropped back
into upper stretch and weakened. CONQUIST was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace between foes, went three wide around the turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch and came up empty. THE OTHER CHAD broke a step slow, moved in while urged along off the pace, went two to three wide for most
of the turn, dropped to the rail late on that bend and was no factor. FLOWING RIVER brushed with a rival at the start, pressed the pace down the
backstretch, vied four then three wide while between foes on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MORETHANREADYEDDIE broke in at the start under hustling and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole
and took the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive getting geared down through the final sixteenth. POWER ATTACK coaxed from the gate,
raced three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, proved no match for the top one
while running on to secure the place honors. ALCAZABA (IRE) broke in at the start bumping with I LIKE BOSTON, chased four to five wide from the tail of
the field under his own power, angled in to swing just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused by the rider nearing the eighth pole and closed well with
late interest to procure the show honors, then galloped out well in front. I LIKE BOSTON traded a bump at the start with ALCAZABA and came under
coaxing, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and was outrun. CARA'S PRINCE shied in
at the start and came under coaxing, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened.

DEVIOUS DAME was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the five path, gained four wide into the stretch then advanced to make a bid
outside of the pacesetter under a strong hand-ride, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, kicked clear under brisk hand-urging outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while eased up late. ALEXIS'S STORM was hustled to the front, went around the turn in the two path, extended
the advantage with three furlongs to run, was roused for more coming to the quarter-pole then put to a drive into upper stretch, led into the final furlong then
was overtaken by the winner and proved no match but was well clear for the place. GIRL BYE lost her footing at the start, chased the pace from third
position, rounded the turn in the four path, dropped back three wide into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. MAGIC BEAUTY bumped
with a foe just after the start then was hustled, chased the pace from second, raced in the three path around the turn, dropped to the two path near the
quarter-pole and tired. SHAYMYNAME bumped with an opponent just after the start, was urged along at the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
went two to three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

BABY BLYTHE just off the inside through the first turn, attended INVESTMENTSTRATEGY to the outside in the four path down the backstretch as her lone
rival settled three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path once more as the leader took to the rail, remained patiently handled coming under very light
nudges from the rider taking narrow command with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a light hand ride
receiving a sole tap to the right side with an un-cocked crop a furlong out and prevailed comfortably on the wire. INVESTMENTSTRATEGY (GB)
established the front and showed the way along the inside through the opening bend under a light rating hold before tipping to the three path down the
backstretch with the her lone aforementioned foe to her outside, settled into a comfortable rhythm showing the way through moderate splits, tucked back to
the inside half a mile from home and had BABY BLYTHE steadily advance and got placed to coaxing in response three furlongs from home, yielded
command with five-sixteenths to go and came under the crop before cutting the corner into upper stretch, got shaken off a furlong out and kept on under her
own power to the finish.

Footnotes
TWO OF A KIND came inward at the start then went to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well under pressure in upper
stretch, dispose of NO NAY HUDSON into the final furlong and held under strong urging. PUTTHEPASTBEHIND was away alertly, chased the pace inside
through the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. VALENZAN DAY bumped with a foe at the start, was taken back
under restraint early then dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, steadied into the kickback around the three-eighths, was driven
into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) bumped with a foe at the start while last to commence, was urged along at the
rear, angled from the two path to the four path early on the turn, gained to make a bid with five-sixteenths to run, battled outside the winner under a drive to
the furlong marker then weakened. ZELENSKYY STRONG chased the pace from the outside, went four then three wide around the turn, dropped back into
upper stretch and tired. BISPING broke in and bumped with a foe, was taken in hand some late on the backstretch, went five wide under urging around the
turn and capitulated. LITTLE J P was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path and
faltered.

Footnotes
DAME TIME broke out at the start taking over the lane of NOBLE AVIATE, vied from the five path down the backstretch inside a pair, tucked three then two
wide continuing to narrowly show the way and shook off QUEEN DE LA CREME with five-sixteenths to go emerging into head to head combat with DOOZY
BATZ, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive coming out under a left handed crop and bumped DOOZY BATZ furlong out, had that rival come in
under a right handed crop near the sixteenth pole and traded a bump once more while dueling to the finish and gamely got the nod on the wire. DOOZY
BATZ coaxed from the gate, vied from the seven path down the backstretch with a pair to her inside, tucked five then four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch now dueling for command, dug in under a drive and had DAME TIME come out
under a left handed stick and was bumped a furlong from home, came in under a right handed crop bumping DAME TIME a sixteenth out and continued to
knock heads to the finish in game fashion but ultimately lost the bob on the line while well clear of the rest. MISCREANT bobbled at the break, chased two
to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. U CANT HANDLE
THIS got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased five then four wide, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. QUEEN
DE LA CREME broke in at the start under coaxing and bumped and pinched back U CANT HANDLE THIS in tandem with NOBLE AVIATE, came under
coaxing an vied between foes from the six path down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, got
shaken off with five-sixteenths to run, swung seven wide into upper stretch and tired. NOBLE AVIATE (IRE) broke out at the start bumping U CANT
HANDLE THIS in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. CREEMORE coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide
into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
