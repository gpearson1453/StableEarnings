advantage outside then finished gamely to regain the place. WHERESTHEPASSION chased outside, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat but flattened
out. AGELESS ENDEAVOR dropped back after the start, raced wide and lacked a solid rally. THRILLS AND CHILLS trailed early racing wide then passed
fading rivals. REFUND RIGLER dueled along the rail to the stretch and gave way. POWER OF AQUARIUS flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly.

and made a slight gain in the stretch. ENRAGED saved ground throughout, raced close up and flattened out through the stretch. MACH TRIAL dropped
back outside and was never in contention. EL HERMANO trailed early, drifted out very wide on the turn and stretch while far behind.

OUTLINE controlled the pace inside then increased her margin while geared down and under wraps through the final furlong. SAY NO MORE chased wide
throughout, bid into the stretch and gained the place late. PINK VODKA was in tight along the rail into the far turn, angled out and finished willingly. SO
SWELL lacked speed inside, angled wide into the stretch and closed well. PAGE ELEVEN dropped back in the opening quarter and was never a factor.
GOVERNMENT GIRL trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. HOPS PETUNIA raced close up in the two path then proved empty in the stretch. LADY
SIMPATIA raced wide throughout and gave way on the turn. RELENTLESS CANDY flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly.
