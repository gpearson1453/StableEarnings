late for the win. PIRATE PARADE was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, cleared off to set the pace, showed the way on the far turn, dug in
gamely inside when challenge in the final furlong and battled to the end. DREAM LINER (BRZ) raced off the pace, had a ground saving trip throughout and
rallied mildly. EL PILLO hit the gate and was bumped at the start, had a three or four wide trip off the pace, raced evenly and lacked a winning bid.

three wide on the far turn and then flattened out. FAIR CATCH stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
OUR MAN LUKE stumbled in the early stages causing the rider to briefly lose the irons, settled off the pace two wide, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied
two wide into the stretch, closed inside of SPEAKING, dueled with that rival to the wire and gamely prevailed. SPEAKING was sent in the early stages, then
rated the pace between rivals on the first turn, dueled between horses, dueled on the far turn, led into the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and
battled to the end. ROYAL URN raced close up four wide on the first turn, stalked four wide, moved up four wide on the second turn, rallied outside, made a
bid in upper stretch, was outkicked then held third. IRISH MEADOW raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, came wide into the lane, rallied
mildly outside and missed for third. NOON TIME GEM raced three wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, then lacked a rally. OPTIC WAY dueled
inside for the lead on the first turn, dueled on the far turn, then steadied in tight at the three sixteenths pole while tiring. PRENDIMI dueled three wide for the
early lead, dueled on the backside and gave way.
