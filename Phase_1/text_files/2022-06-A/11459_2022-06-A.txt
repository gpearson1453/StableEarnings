Footnotes
LET HER INSPIRE U broke alertly from the outside post and went straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was challenged from the
outside while in the two path around the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the furlong marker and
drew off under steady urging. TRUANCY bumped with WICKED LADY at the start, bumped twice again with that foe while crowded from the outside early,
moved out while advancing with five furlongs to run, engaged the winner in the three path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
weakened but was well clear for the place. SWEET MYSTERY dropped to the rear early then angled out, was urged along on the outside, went four wide
around the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. WICKED LADY bumped with TRUANCY at the start, bumped with again with that
foe early, raced off heels passing the five-eighths then checked outside the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven five wide
into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and faltered. BOSS OF ALL settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went
three then two wide around the turn and retreated. MIKE'S LITTLE DIVA veered in at the start and bumped with a foe, crowded foes some while pressing
inside the leader early, dropped back off the pace with five-furlongs to run, saved ground around the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
BOLD VICTORY five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and advanced to take command inside that station, swung four
wide into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive kept to task. EAGLE IN LOVE veered in at the start bumping RED REVOLUTION solidly into TOP OF
THE MINT and squeezed back RED REVOLUTION forcing that rival to check out between foes before being corrected lightly, dueled from the three path
with EMPEROR'S CAUSE to the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and applied pressure to that rival coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. RED REVOLUTION got bumped solidly at the start by
EAGLE IN LOVE and in turn bumped TOP OF THE MINT before being squeezed and then forced to check out conceding four to five lengths to the front and
two to three lengths to EAGLE IN LOVE, chased three then two wide from the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide
into upper stretch, showed good courage to keep on to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. TOP OF THE MINT got bumped at the start by RED
REVOLUTION due to pressure from the veering in EAGLE IN LOVE, chased along the inside and began to advance on the leader when that rival came
over and got forced to be taken in hand seven and a half furlongs from home, continued along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. EMPEROR'S CAUSE bobbled at the break, crossed to the inside shortly after the start forcing TOP OF
THE MINT to steady seven and a half furlongs from home, dueled inside early on with EAGLE IN LOVE before showing sole command under pressure into
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
BRACIOLE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Claim
of Foul by the trainer of RED REVOLUTION alleging interference against EAGLE IN LOVE at the start which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the result
standing and the race being declared official.

HOLDTHEFLIGHT broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
fought on with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. SPECTATORLESS was coaxed to the the front then showed
the way, vied inside on the the turn, was headed under urging at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for
the show. FOREVER WICKED broke in at the start, settled at the rear on the outside, angled in leaving the backstretch, moved from three to five wide under
urging around the turn and failed to threaten. JUMPSTER was restless in the gate, came away in good order, settled on the inside, was urged along while
saving ground around the turn and came up empty. DONTBELATE broke in then was corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked
near the nine-sixteenths, chased three wide around the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and capitulated. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE was last to
commence, settled behind a foe under some restraint, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
IN MY WAKE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. INKBLOT four then three
wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one late while keeping
on for the place honors. QUIET TYPE just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went eight
wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. FALSE HOPE broke in at the start bumping DANCE FOR BOURBON in tandem with
UNKOALAFIED, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved
position to the wire. JUST A NYQUIST chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. VALENTIA ISLAND just off the inside early on, traded the front with UNKOALAFIED, down the backstretch before taking sole command tucked
inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the
sixteenth marker, weakened in the late going. DANCE FOR BOURBON got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased two to three
wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OAK LOVES A
FIGHT chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and came up empty. UNKOALAFIED broke
out at the start bumping DANCE FOR BOURBON in tandem with FALSE HOPE, traded the lead down the backstretch three wide before tucking to the two
path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cornered three wide into upper stretch and tired. MISS MALALA chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, shook clear at the five-sixteenths, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole, came under a drive under threat from the runner-up in upper stretch and held sway under strong handling. BAY STREET MONEY
was well placed just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted to the two path while roused at the quarter-pole, gained to make an outside bid
under a right-handed crop at the three-sixteenths, came out when switched to a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, fought with the winner to
the wire and missed while clear for the place. MICROPHONE (IRE) bumped with a foe while off a step slow, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the
two path, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved into third in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick late while able to get the show. GHOST GIANT
broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, raced inside to the two path around the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a
drive into the final furlong and also lacked the needed kick then missed the show. STANDUP was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced off the pace
under some restraint, leveled out late on the backstretch, was roused two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
SHIRAZ prompted the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three to four path around the turn and came up empty. BRYCE CANYON bobbled at
the start, was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and was no factor. BIZ BIZ BUZZ broke a bit slow then was hustled, tossed
his head when taken in hand behind horses at the three-quarter pole, moved up between foes to dispute the pace with five furlongs to run, was asked in the
two to three path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left.

Footnotes
PERCEIVED settled near the back of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch then came further out inside the
three-sixteenths, closed fast on the outside into the final furlong, gained the advantage into the final sixteenth and drew away under good handling. NO
BURN bumped with a foe at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, moved clear with a half-mile to run, dictated terms in the two
path around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
drifted out while clinging to the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while able to get the place. TIERGAN bumped with a rival at the start,
settled in a good position down the backstretch, saved ground under urging around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
kick while able to get the show. AMOUNT tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. HAMMERIN AAMER settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn and was
no factor. AMERICAN RULE bumped with an opponent at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn and tired.
KERSHAW bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, was urged three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. REGAL QUALITY was last to commence, moved up on the outside under urging then was taken under a hold, went five wide while back under
urging on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. NO SALT was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, dropped back four wide
on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) shied out at the start when both SPICER and BUILT DIFFERENT broke outwards along her inside, raced a bit sluggish early on
when being corrected not to enter the widener course and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride unhurried at the tail of the field
along the inside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a good
kick to roll by the entirety of the field inside the final furlong getting up in the late stages to prevail over a trio. CANISY settled just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down tipped three wide at the head of the stretch, rallied with good energy a bit belatedly to the finish
and missed at the end. LINDA'S GIFT got checked off the heels of CANISY when that rival tucked to the two path directly in front with one mile remaining,
tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue
a challenge through the final furlong overtaking the leader in tandem with SPICER near the sixteenth marker, was on near even terms for command with
that rival when overtaken in the final strides by a pair getting outfinished in the last jumps. SPICER broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three
wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth
in concert with the aforementioned foe, took narrowest of commands a sixteenth out, then got caught by a trio in the final strides. DIAMOND HANDS
showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
under threat from a host of challengers stacked across the track a furlong from home, got collared near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished through to
the line. BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive with an open seam inside,
was unable to get to it lacking the room late when outkicked to the wire. BUILT DIFFERENT broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three wide in
aim of the top pair coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late stages.
CAIRONI attended the leader to the outside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the
late going.
