COURTLY broke in a tangle, checked behind rivals in the two path at the seven sixteenths pole, lacked racing room into the turn, altered course sharply
three wide at the quarter pole, rallied to make the lead three wide before the furlong marker and drew clear under right handed urging. GOOD
ALTERNATIVE trailed for a half, loomed boldly four wide in upper stretch then was no match for the winner. JILLY FROM JERSEY pressed the early pace
two wide, dropped inside in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. MAVI away alertly, set the pace in the two path into the turn, battled to the top of the
stretch then weakened. EASY EYES pressed the early pace along the inside, set the tempo through the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
VELVET SAMI never far back, loomed boldly along the rail into the far turn, steadied a bit near the quarter pole, waited for room, got through and proved
best in a stretch long drive. PUBLICIST inherited the lead leaving the first turn, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
PALI'S REWARD trailed for six furlongs then closed determinedly three wide through the stretch. PRINCESS TIZNOW pressed the pace three then two
wide into the stretch, drifted to the seven path and weakened. MANHATTAN LADY well placed, lost ground in the stretch. CHARM OF THE CITY close up
along the inside from the start, altered course three wide midway down the backstretch then failed to respond. SUNDRENCHED set the pace along the rail
through the clubhouse turn, got out, was strongly righted then through after a half.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged, widened into the stretch and won as much the best while taken in
hand late. MISTER MOBIL unhurried early, closed determinedly through the stretch and finished clear for second. PRIVATE DRIVE chased the winner into
the stretch then faded. TIZ A RUSH trailed early, swung wide then went evenly. TWO EAGLES improved position on the turn then came up empty. FUNNY
BACHELOR was no threat. RIDGE WEST had brief speed inside. EL MARRO chased the winner along the inside to the top of the stretch then stopped.
