MAN IN BLACK set the pressure pace while racing slightly removed from the rail and proved best under strong handling. WHATSTHEDIFF saved ground
while being permitted to settle in stride, angled out slightly entering the stretch, then angled back in and finished strongly. BRANNIGAN was never far back,
rallied three-wide the final quarter and was gaining slightly late. AIN'T NO SISSY acted up during the loading, then forced the pace from along the outside,
but lacked tne needed late response. MYSTIC MAG raced four-wide on the turn and was not a serious factor. LUCKY SNAKE failed to menace while saving
ground.

SIR DEPUTY Sprinted clear early, set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail, responded when challenged on the turn by The Metal Man and
was drawing clear late. THE METAL MAN prompted the pace from along the outside, was unable to match strides with the winner late, but was clearly
second best. ZATTER raced bewteen horses on the turn and finished fairly well while being unable to reach the top two. CANDIED LUTE raced three wide
and lacked a response when called upon. BLUE BOY WHO was prominent early while racing along the inside and tired during the drive.
