the place. BUNNY PRINCESS void of speed, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and passed tiring rivals.

THE SINNER IS YOU well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path gaining a short lead into the stretch,
shook clear, then drew off and held. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a
steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. UNFLAPPABLE MAX stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on
