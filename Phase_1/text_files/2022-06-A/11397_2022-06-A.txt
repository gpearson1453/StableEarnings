BELARUS was bumped solidly at the start and forced into another rival, settled on the outside, went five then four wide around the turn, gained under a
right-handed crop into the stretch, pursued the runner-up while well outside that foe, switched to a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, went
back to a right-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. BUNTY WINDERMERE showed good speed, set the pace on the inside,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole, drifted out closer to the winner late and was caught while far clear for the place. DULCE GIGANTE settled towards the rear, saved ground
under urging on the turn, swung out into upper stretch and safely secured the show while no match for the top two. FULIGNI broke through the front of the
gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, stumbled badly at the start and spotted the front a few lengths, settled near the rear,
moved from three to five wide around the turn and failed to threaten in a tough debut. IMPAZIBLE DREAM bumped with a foe at the start, was coaxed along
off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn and came up empty. MADAME ROSE broke in and bumped solidly with a foe, pressed the
pace on the outside, vied four then three wide around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. TO THE TUNE was forwardly placed on the

HOT PEPPERS was hustled while breaking in front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch and drew off under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best. STAND UP COMIC chased the pace on the outside then in the
two path around the turn, drifted out some around the furlong marker and earned the place while no match for the winner. SWEET SOLARE was hustled
from the gate, showed speed on the inside of the winner then dropped back just off the pace, was taken in hand off heels near the seven-sixteenths, drafted
along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole and came up empty while able to get the show. GIMMICK dropped back early then moved out, was
urged three wide around the turn then driven five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. DIAMOND COLLECTOR dropped back early then raced at
the rear, was carried out late on the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and was no factor.

RUNAWAY ROCKETTE broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside coming under steadily increased
pressure from MAYBE LATER to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under
a drive, drifted out a sixteenth from home still clear and held safe to prevail. MAYBE LATER broke in at the start bumping MISS INVINCIBLE after the break,
prompted the pace from the outside in the four path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
angling out a sixteenth from home as the clear leader drifted and was ultimately rebuffed safely to the wire. VINTAGE GIRL chased two to three wide under

Footnotes
GIGGLE FACTORY prompted the pace on the outside of the leader in the two path, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper
stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, took the lead shortly thereafter and prevailed under strong urging. EVVIE JETS went straight to
the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled inside
of the winner under a drive into the final furlong, lost the advantage shortly thereafter, fought on gamely to the wire but missed while clear for the place.
PRINCESS FAWZIA became rank and tossed her head while rank under restraint early then was taken up some, raced off the pace under a tight hold,
saved ground around the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, pursued the top two while off the rail in the final furlong and finished willingly for the
show. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) was taken under a vigorous hold early, steadied twice around the opening turn while tugging hard at the bit, was
anchored at the back under stout restraint, went three wide for most of the far turn, was let out nearing the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, came under
a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. ANGEL PALM (GB) broke out then was corrected by the rider, was taken under a strong hold early
then rated off the pace on the outside, drafted behind the leaders in the two path for most of the far turn, shifted three wide while asked inside the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
BRATTLE HOUSE went to the front from the outside, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage in the two path around the turn,
responded well when asked at the quarter-pole and drew off while kept to the task. FIRST TO ACT bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, settled off the
pace, was urged along while inside to the two path around the turn then driven three wide into the stretch and secured the place while no match for the
winner. WASP moved out inside the three-quarter pole, dropped in late on the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide
late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. SWEET SURPRISE settled off the pace,
was roused while saving ground on the turn and failed to rally. VIENNA CODE settled at the rear, went two then three wide early on the turn, floated five
wide near the three-eighths then moved to six wide and showed little. MALIBU CURL was taken up briefly early then drifted to the outside, moved up on the
far outside, was asked four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker and faltered then was eased but walked
off. EQUAL PAY pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back then moved out behind that foe inside the three-quarter pole, came up empty
on the turn and also faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
I AM THE LAW settled on the far outside, was roused while six then five wide around the turn, rallied to get the lead at the quarter-pole then kicked clear in
upper stretch, drew off under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. FIERY HEART stalked
the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path around the turn, gained a short and brief lead outside the quarter-pole then was headed by the winner
and proved no match while able to get the place. SEBARAY veered in at the start and bumped hard with a foe, recovered to establish a good position just
off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, came out into upper stretch then dropped back in around the three-sixteenths and
missed the place while clear for the show. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, went four wide through the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. THE ICEMAN COMMETH was bumped hard between foes at the start then checked while
pinched back, spotted the front many lengths, went around most of the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SMART
JOKER broke out and bumped hard with an opponent, moved up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and stopped. QUESTION MY SANITY settled well back in the field, was urged along passing the three-quarter
pole, saved ground around the turn and never reached contention. ISLANDMAN was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, went around the
turn in the two path and capitulated. STRIKE PRICE broke awkwardly then was bumped hard on both sides and checked while pinched back between foes,
spotted the front many lengths, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. WICK LOVES A FIGHT settled on the outside while towards the rear,
moved from the four path to the six path around the turn, came out in upper stretch and faltered. SPLENDID SUMMER lost his footing at the start, settled on
the outside, was urged five wide around the turn and also faltered.
