Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BELLA settled in range inside, came through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, took over approaching the eighth pole, drifted out to the
center of the track and held firm. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set the pace in the two path, drifted out steadily through the stretch, yielded to the winner in midstretch
and fought on while continuing to drift. SHORT CIRCUIT tracked the pace while racing two wide and just outside of the winner, bid between foes nearing the
eighth pole but was outkicked. MADEIRA WINE prompted the pace three wide and weakened a bit in the lane. ROSE'S CAUSE steadied midway around
the first turn, saved ground off the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. KATIESDREAMGIRL steadied late on the first turn,
raced two and three wide and was no menace. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. ALPHA BABE
was outrun while racing two wide. THIS WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

the rail, led until deep stretch, was outfinished late but held place. BROOKLYN STRONG was never far back early, swung four wide in the stretch and rallied
late. BLACK BELT raced close up throughout and went evenly late. HERCULES pressed the pace until late stretch and weakened slightly . SASH (GB)
tracked the pace three wide and stopped on the far turn.

Footnotes
ANDIE ONE had early speed between foes, settled back inside entering the first turn, stalked inside down the backstretch and around most of the far turn,
angled four wide turning for home, closed outside and was up near the sixteenth pole. PRETTYKEEN lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced
strongly along the rail around the far turn, hit the hit while bulling through a narrow opening in upper stretch, bumped TIZ IMPRESSIVE in midstretch and
finished willingly. TIZ IMPRESSIVE set the pace along the rail to upper stretch, was bumped by PRETTYKEEN in midstretch and fought on between foes
while in tight through much of the final furlong. STARSHIP ELEGANCE pressed the pace two wide, vied between foes through much of the stretch and was
outfinished. TAMARINDO was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. L. E. GRAY saved
ground and failed to menace. USURPED chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. YOUR INHERITANCE stalked the pace three wide
and faltered nearing the lane. YANKEE CHRISTMAS was bumped soon after the start then appeared to clip heels a few strides later and played no further
factor while saving ground. CROSS FLEET came in and bumped TAMARINDO at the start, raced in range two wide, got out around the far turn and
retreated. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH AND DISQUALIFIED PRETTYKEEN AND PLACED HER THIRD FOR
INTERFERENCE WITH TIZ IMPRESSIVE IN THE STRETCH. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

mild bid while no threat. NACHO PAPA chased the winner and weakened in the lane. LUSITANO raced mid pack on the inside and was no threat. ROYAL

Footnotes
AMOR Y CONTROL set a pressured pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole and widened under
steady hand urging. PRETTY DEVIL tracked the pace two wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly to gain the place. TORA LORA
LORA raced off the pace three wide between foes and ran on for the show. OLYMPIC FENCER chased the pace four wide and was one-paced through the
lane. CENTSATIONAL GRACE advanced four wide around the turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded.
ARTIFICIAL INTELL failed to menace while racing two wide. RAIN OF BLESSING prompted the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the quarter
pole but tired in the drive. BLAME THE VETS raced off the pace outside, made a five wide move around the turn but failed to sustain the bid.
STELLARATOR played no factor while racing three wide. FLAT OUT COOL saved ground in range, steadied nearing the quarter pole and had no further
bids. ROUGH ENOUGH was outrun inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
