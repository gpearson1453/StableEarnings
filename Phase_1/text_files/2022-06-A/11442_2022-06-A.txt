CLAW rated close up and outside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the sretch, shook clear, then drew off
and was kept to the task. SPETTACOLI (ARG) allowed to settle, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
lacked the needed late kick. WHISTLE ME HOME allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, angled widest in the stretch and evened out.
C THE KING well placed and inside, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final
furlong. ENGLISH LAUGHTER well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and could not gain.
MARSAC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin down the backstretch, then stayed on when challenged into the stretch and
