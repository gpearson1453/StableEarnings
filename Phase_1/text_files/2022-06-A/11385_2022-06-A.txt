Footnotes
PAYNT YOUR WAGON broke alertly to go to a clear lead from the two path and was much the best. PUBLIC RECORD was forwardly placed off the pace in
the three path but was no match for the winner and was best of the rest. SPIRIT SOUL raced back early from the three path made his move on the turn from
the inside angled out in mid stretch brushed rival and was up for the show. SHACKLE THE GOLD broke outward slightly then tracked the leader from the
two path around the turn but was empty in the lane. SIDE BAR (IRE) raced from the three to four path in the middle of the pack was brushed by rival in mid
stretch while fading. MAX BET was forced in slightly at the break raced at the back down the backstretch while saving ground but was never a factor.

inside but couldn't match strides in the stretch but was second best. I'LL RAISE YOU dueled from between rivals but weakened in mid stretch and held the
show. G DON'T KNOW challenged to the three eighths pole from the six path and failed to menace. TRUMP MEDIA challenged to the three eighths pole
from the five path and was not a factor. SOUL SONG dueled from between rivals around the turn and dropped out at the quarter pole and tired.
