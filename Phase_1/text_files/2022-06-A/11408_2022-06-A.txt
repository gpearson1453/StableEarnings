BLACK METAL raced up to duel for the lead from the outside of BLUEGRASS ANGUS entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and was never threatened late. JUST MAKE

alertly and vied for the lead from along he rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn from the

Footnotes
COUNTRY COWBOY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and found
his best stride in mid stretch while finishing four out from the rail to get up in time. TEXAS HUMOR away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, battled for the lead two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive, but was unable to fend off
the late surge of COUNTRY COWBOY in the closing strides. VISENYA away alertly and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside through the final turn while awaiting room, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just
miss the place. GROOVY GIRL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of TEXAS HUMOR, but was outfinished in deep stretch. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while
dropping well behind the field entering the backside, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more of a closing response
when called on in the lane. FLAT OUT DONNA settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, drifted out leaving the turn, and failed to mount a closing bid in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
NORTHERN KID stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground through the second turn to
gain a tracking trip entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and
inched clear late while being kept to task. HARBOUR STORM away alertly and stalked the leader through the lane the first time while racing one out from
the rail, maintained her trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, battled with NORTHERN KID entering the lane,
and while unable to match strides with that rival late, finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. JACK DON'T DRINK unhurried
early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, launched his bid from
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. SOLANDER away well and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken midway
through the final turn, and faded in the late stages. ZULU POWER settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the lane the first time, continued
with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. B C
BISCUIT broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued from a tracking trip two wide into
the backstretch, struggled to maintain his position approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
VALUABLE COWBOY stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final
turn, assumed command leaving the turn and quickly drew clear under confident handling late. SLOOP JOHN B away well and stalked the leaders into the
backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to get the place. DR.
BENNY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished three
out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. SHOWMAN broke sharply and tracked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to
hold his position in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. MONTE away alertly
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backside, shook clear of his
pace rival entering the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and faded in the late stages. BARBERRY BANDIT raced erratic in the early going while
lagging well off the early pace, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing four wide in the stretch drive.
UNBROKEN pressed the leader two wide in the run down the backstretch, but weakened entering the final turn and had little to offer late. CAROLINA GENT
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, but faded over the final furlong. EH TEE EM unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SANAWAR settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, bided his time back of the leaders in the run
down the backside, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, angled in to save a bit of ground leaving the turn, and split rival three wide in deep
stretch to get up in time. PADDY D'ORO broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied
smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get the place. VON DOM pressed the pace from between rivals
through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled gamely one
out from the rail in the drive to just miss. AIRAFFAIR away well and raced to a narrow advantage one out from the rail through the lane the first time, set a
pressured pace from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. MUSTACHIO
away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive, but needed more. REPRIMAND pressed the leaders four wide through the stretch the first time and into the
second turn, began to drop back midway down the backside, and had nothing to offer late. TRUPON ONLINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
was always well back and never a factor.

LASTING LIGHT away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by HARLEN'S ANGEL in the closing strides to prevail. HARLAN'S ANGEL away alertly and tracked the
pacesetter one out from the rail entering the first turn, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed
determinedly three wide in deep stretch to just miss. RICHARDS COMMAND stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, shifted off the
rail to commence her bid three wide entering the final turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and closed well get get up for a share. ANIMA tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while
unable to mount a serious late bid. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, mounted her bid from along the rail from the back of the pack
entering the final turn, angled out to the middle of the track for the drive, and improved her position while finishing seven wide. TAKE CHARGE GWEN
tracked the leaders three wide in the run down the backstretch, continued two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response late when called upon. MAKIN IT UP settled off the early pace while racing four wide entering the backside, rallied three out from the rail entering
the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. GEM OF INCEPTION stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the
rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. FOURTOWIN broke sharply, but settled off the early pacesetters
while racing five wide in the run down the backstretch, raced wide throughout and showed little.

WALKINTHEWALK stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside through the
final turn while awaiting racing room, slipped through along the rail leaving the turn, tipped four wide into the lane, and closed with a rush to prove best. SKY
FACTOR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, was no match when tackled by WALKINTHEWALK in deep stretch, but battled gamely to prove clearly second best. DEVINE DANCING tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering he final turn, was no match late fort he top pair,
but finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. LIVING SKY broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, struggled to hold her position while racing three wide midway through the final turn, but finished evenly two wide in the drive.
SNOWSHOES unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced five wide in the run down the backstretch, angled in to save ground entering the final turn,
and improved her position over the final furlong while continuing to save ground but was unable to mount a serious late bid. LIZZIES GIRL stalked the
leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to threaten late while finishing four
out from the rail in the drive. COUNTESS CAT stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final
turn, but wasn't a factor over the final furlong.
