Footnotes
PULL MY CHAIN sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, came under a ride two wide into the upper
stretch, had plenty left in reserve and kicked clear. LITTLE TOE raced in close contention stalking the pacesetter into the turn, hustled along three wide into
the upper stretch, sustained response and finished second best. CARPE VICTORIAM pressed the pace in early stages then chased after the leader around
the turn, saved ground into the lane and churned on for a share. ONOMATOPOEIA raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the turn and
lacked a needed rally. JAZZY JUSTIN raced in range in the early going, hustled along three to four wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane.
KILLEEN had no response.

TROPINKA prompted the pace along the inside in opening stages then tipped out and tracked the leader around the turn, given cue two to three wide a
furlong out, responded gamely and kicked clear. TAPIT FOR SURE sped to the lead soon after the start and held a clear advantage around the turn,
sustained response into the lane but could not hold off the winner in the final furlong. FIREY EMBLEM raced near midpack entering the turn, hustled along
three to four wide into the lane and gained a share. SNAP AWAY saved ground around the turn, shifted out three to four wide in the upper stretch and failed
to move on. ARKANSAS INVASION lacked speed and raced in the back, was ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to rally. OH NIKI was hustled
up out of the gate, chased in contention along the inside through the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then came up empty.

Footnotes
SECRET BLARNEY dueled inside a duo up the backstretch and continued to battle around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, roused for more,
responded willingly and drew off under a mild drive. ITSALLABOUTYOU tracked the embattled trio in early stages and raced three wide around the turn,
tipped wider for the drive, sustained steady response and captured place. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE was allowed to settle through early stages and sat off
the second flight entering the turn, launched a three wide bid at the furlong marker and got up for show. LARCH dueled between rivals for the early lead,
continued to battle between foes around the turn, could not move on with the winner at the head of the lane and got edged out late for runner up spots.
CAESARTHERULER tracked the top flight into the turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, gained closer contention then gave way in late stages.
KING DEUCE dueled three deep for the early lead, continued to match strides around the turn then weakened in the lane.

ORNERY ANGEL rated up close into the turn, launched a three wide bid into the lane, steadily edged up closer and drew clear approaching the sixteenth
pole. HOPING FOR A RING raced up close then challenged ITSALLINTHENOTES around the turn, continued to battle for command into the lane and got
overtaken by the winner approaching the sixteenth pole. ITSALLINTHENOTES dueled for the early lead with VOODAYO, began to edged away from foe
then took on the challenge from HOPING FOR A RING, battled for command into the lane then yielded in the final sixteenth. EUTYCHIA raced in the back in
early stages, hustled along four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. HARLONS COMMISION chased in range along the inside,
shifted out three wide near the quarter pole and faded in the upper stretch. BLUSHING SCARLETT saved ground and failed to move into contention.
VOODAYO dueled for the lead through the backstretch and came up empty late on the turn.

Footnotes
COOL CAT CHARLIE vied outside of WIN IN THE CITY around the first turn, continued to match strides up the backstretch and into the far turn, shook free
turning for home, roused for more, had more left in reserve, widened advantage and kept clear under steady pressure. ALLEN'S ROCKET stalked the top
flight through the backstretch, came under a ride three wide at the quarter pole, remained game in pursuit for the winner through the lane but had to settle
for second best. SPALDING STROLL tracked the top flight through early stages, sat four wide in good position around the far turn, came under a drive
turning for home, sustained a steady outside bid and secured a share. GINGER RULES rated off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the far
turn, urged two wide a furlong out and lacked the needed response for impact. WIN IN THE CITY dueled inside of the winner around the first turn, continued
to battle around the far turn then came up empty at the head of the lane. TOUGH AINT ENOUGH was a bit awkward and steadied racing in the back
heading into the backstretch, raced in the last flight through early stages, had no response when called and retreated.

edged away in final stages. KAYLA dueled inside of MISS PEACH for the early lead, battled back along the rail into the lane then failed to match strides in

contention up the backstretch, sustained bid around the turn then flattened in the lane. FIREBAUGH got bumped hard and steadied at the start, dropped
back, chased two to three wide around the turn and failed to rally. FREEIA TAP was not too far back in early stages, failed to progress near the inside
around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and had no late response. GOTTA HAVE FAITH steadied just after the start and dropped to last, remained off
the pace and failed to move into contention. RUTHIE RULES saved ground around the turn and failed to move on. JUST LIKE TRISTA raced off the pace
