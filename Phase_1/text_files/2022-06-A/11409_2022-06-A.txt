WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER stalked the three way pace battle, eased out four deep mid way on the turn, swept to command in upper stretch then steadily drew
off while kept under pressure. AWFULLY FOXY , well off the early duel, saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside
rivals. SENSON , three deep around the turn disputing the pace, weakened the final furlong. FLIRTATIOUS LASS stumbled leaving the starting gate, sped
to the early lead, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and faltered in upper stretch. TIZ SUSAN ANN , unhurried down the backstretch, raced four to five
wide around the turn and showed some late interest. DEFY EXPECTATIONS disputed the pace between horses to the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
MY MAMBA stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up behind rivals to track, steadied off heels mid turn, swung out four to five wide into the lane,
closed determinedly outside rivals, took over inside the sixteenth marker and drew clear. COUNTRY CHARLIE had speed and disputed the issue outside
DAGDA, fought on between runners past mid stretch and kept on gamely to regain second. DREAMS DELIVERED , off a bit slow, regrouped and advanced
four under a light hold leaving the three eighths, engaged the leaders past the five sixteenths, gained the advantage in upper stretch, dueled past mid
stretch then hung late between rivals. DAGDA broke a step slow, was sent up between runners soon after and grabbed the lead, dueled towards the rail
around the turn, appeared to not be comfortable inside rivals past the three sixteenths, steadied briefly and faded. ROSCO bobbled at the break, lagged
back while saving ground, angled out for the drive, had belated action and kept on willingly through the gallop out.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R , along the rail stalking the pace in hand for six furlongs, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, took command outside CARIBBEAN
in mid stretch then drew out under urging. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , two wide both turns while prompting the pace, weakened late. CARIBBEAN (AUS) set a
pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. MIDNIGHT ACT lacked speed, raced along the inner rail to the stretch, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. THE POSER stumbled badly a few strides after the break then failed to be a factor. CROUCHELLI , outrun, drifted
six deep entering the stretch. BOSS LOGIC chased the pace outside foes, was fanned four wide leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
GREEN EYES accelerated inside rivals soon after the start and went clear, was nicely rated setting the pace towards the rail, turned away challenges
leaving the three eighths, moved away entering the lane, opened up under solid right handed asking past mid stretch then cruised home through the final
yards. DEEMED ESSENTIAL , away alertly, stalked the winner two wide, briefly threatened between runners leaving the far turn, gave hard chase from the
top of the lane and kept on willingly to be clear for the place. ICY REPLY , three wide stalking the pace, bid three deep near the three eighths, failed to
match strides soon after, pursued into and through the lane then faded late. MICK'SBESTBETYET steadied at the break, dropped well off the early pace,
came three to four wide for the drive and had belated action. MARKET OF STOCKS saved some ground early, angled out for the run around the turn,
circled five wide into the stretch and faded. ORBIT MARS , off the pace, saved ground into the lane but failed to respond.

BANDITS WARRIOR stumbled leaving the starting gate, moved off the rail to the two path entering the turn, bid for the lead outside NOBLE BID entering
the stretch, brushed with that one in upper stretch and determinedly prevailed in an extended drive. NOBLE BID sprinted clear and was taken to the inner
rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, brushed with the winner in upper stretch and gamely battled inside that one to just miss. SHE IS
WISKY , swung to the five path in upper stretch, offered a mild rally. FUHGEDDABOUDIT , well placed in the three path between horses around the turn,
failed to rally in an even effort. LA CASA D'ORO lacked speed, was four deep around the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VODKATINI stalked off the inside, moved up between runners in mid stretch, eased out and continued progression under a drive, was floated out by
HOLLYWOOD WALK in deep stretch and got up between foes. LUMINIST , unhurried early while off the inside, moved up outside rivals in mid stretch, was
carried out late and kept on gamely to gain. HOLLYWOOD WALK , confidently handled while prompting the pace outside GOLDEN EFFECT, moved
alongside leaving the far turn, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, floated out foes when drifting out under left handed asking in deep stretch and
failed to last. GOLDEN EFFECT fought some restraint while going clear leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail, was joined around the far turn,
sparred to the five sixteenths, stayed on a furlong more then gave way. SULLIVAN STREET stalked the early pace while saving ground, dropped back mid
turn then lost her rider when travelling a bit awkwardly entering the lane. There was a stewards' inquiry regarding SULLIVAN STREET but no action was
taken. Also, an objection by the rider of LUMINIST against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

MR THRIFTY , well placed in the two path on the turn, moved out turning for home, worked between horses, bumped with THE ADDISON POUR near the

RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY prompted the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead inside horses turning for home and dug in tenaciously through the
stretch to just miss. WELLING , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, drifted to the four path when challenging for the lead in upper stretch, drifted in
in front of the winner near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. THE ADDISON POUR lacked speed, raced four wide on the turn, bumped with the
winner and flattened out. ROYAL NUMBER raced in the three path on the turn and failed to rally. ALIFEROUS raced inside horses throughout and lacked a
rally. VINNY set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. STONE COURAGEOUS , always inside horses, gave way.

Footnotes
LADY CAGE FIGHTER , bumped at the break, straightened and went clear in the opening sixteenth, set a rated pace towards the rail, opened up after
being set down in upper stretch then held sway under a stout drive. SPOTAKE broke a step slow then was taken back soon after and taken wide, circled the
turn four wide, gathered steam past the five sixteenths and closed steadily to gain. AT THE GATE bobbled at the break, regrouped and chased three wide,
gained past the five sixteenths then failed to follow through in the final furlong. TIPSY TOURIST stalked two wide, was under pressure into the lane, shifted
in some and gave way grudgingly. MADE MY WISH , three wide early, raced between runners past the five sixteenths, angled out and faded. NINE MAST
came in at the break and soundly bumped a rival, edged up and saved ground stalking the pace, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. BOAT
MONEY , three wide, was outrun. MISSAWLET , two wide into the turn, gave way. IMINCHARGENOW , bumped and pinched back at the break, saved
ground off the pace and dropped back mid turn.
