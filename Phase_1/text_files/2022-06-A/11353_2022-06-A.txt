TELLER was well placed on the inside, made a inside move on the far turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best
while being ridden out. BOSSY CAT tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn, proved to be no match for the winner while
staying on to to be second best. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace five to six wide on the backstretch, made a mild bid
five wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and was up for the show award. ROYAL'S INVASION set the pace while racing off the inside, was
headed by the five sixteenths and weakened. WHERE'S THE BEN'S was bumped and then checked after the start, settled back, saved ground on the far
turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had no rally. BIFF stalked the pace four wide and tired.
