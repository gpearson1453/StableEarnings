Footnotes
KLAATU broke in front, set the pace in the two path into the stretch, drifted out bumping VALEROSO at the top of the stretch, was headed near the furlong
marker, fought back gamely and got back up in time. ISTILLGOTIT moved up along the rail after a half, checked repeatedly while lacking room from three
eighths pole past the five sixteenths pole, angled out also bumping VALEROSO midway on the second turn, came through along the inside when the leader
drifted out, gained a slight lead before the furlong marker then finished second best. VALEROSO chased the pace from the start, was bumped midway on
the far turn and the top of the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead before the eighth pole then was outfinished. PALTARREVENGE was restless in
the gate, hopped out and went evenly. LOVE TREE had speed into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CONDUCIVE trailed. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED ISTILLGOTIT FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE SECOND TURN AND PLACED HIM
THIRD.

battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained the advantage then was no match for the winner. TALK DIRTY dueled for the lead three wide into the
stretch, drifted out to mid track and was outfinished. DREAM TO WIN trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed some ground late past the middle of
the racetrack. NATALIA'S TEMPLE failed to menace. JULIE BIRD (IRE) broke in front and dropped inside, set a pressured pace along the rail into the turn
then was used up.

Footnotes
ANGEL WINGS sprinted to the lead two wide leaving the clubhouse turn, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the
best. COSTUME JEWELRY unhurried early, rallied in the four path into the stretch and finished clear for second. PENNIESANDDIMES was bumped at the
start, trailed along the rail into the far turn, shifted out to the four path causing MY PIE to clip her heels before the five sixteenths pole, then improved
position through the stretch. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT failed to menace. LUCKY PENNY ROSE moved up three wide on the far turn then came up empty.
TRULY INCLUSIVE stalked the pace near the inside then two wide into the stretch and gave way. WAR MOON led through the first turn, kept pressure
along the rail for six furlongs then folded. MY PIE bore out at the start bumping PENNIESANDDIMES, was unhurried while racing in the five then four paths
down the backstretch, clipped heels entering the far turn when PENNIESANDDIMES angled out in front of her then dropped out of it. THE RIDER OF MY
PIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PENNIESANDDIMES FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE SECOND TURN, AFTER REVIEW
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PENNIESANDDIMES AND PLACED HER LAST.

MOBIL LADY led along the rail through the first turn, gave up a narrow lead, kept pressure, regained command after a half, shook clear on the second turn
and proved best while nicely rated under mild urging. SPECIAL BEACH pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, dropped inside and gamely gained
second. AUNT BEE never far back, offered a bid three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. ESTILO ELEGANTE failed to menace. CATABOUT close
up along the inside, failed to respond. CAUSE OF LOVE stalked the pace from between horses and faded in the stretch. MOTHERWELL gained a narrow
lead leaving the first turn, set a pressured pace for nearly a quarter mile then was used up.

Footnotes
LAZARUS PROJECT never far back, rallied determinedly three wide through the stretch and was along in time. MONTAUK COVE stalked the pace two
wide, dropped inside entering the stretch, loomed boldly along the rail and just missed. THE DRAKE unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in
the six path. THE COOKIE MAN pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch, made the lead in the three path then was outfinished. MASAI MAN went
evenly. LADY'S BOY away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. TOUCHDOWN JESUS failed to menace. RULING
EMPIRE trailed.
