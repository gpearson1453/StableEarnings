Footnotes
HALF TRICK tracked a loose lead early closing in on the turn drawing even abreast foe upper stretch putting that rival away to win clear. WINK AND A NOD
broke sharply hustled to a solid early lead, felt pressure leaving the turn being collared from the outside in upper stretch proving no match late while saving
place. BOLD PROPHET chased the pace gaining on the turn looming in upper stretch coming up short late. ACED raced evenly through the turn into upper
stretch lacking a contending move there. BURKIE slow early lost ground to upper stretch posing no menace there. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE gave a mild
move on the turn then leveled off near mid track in upper stretch. GAULTIER (FR) dropped back early.
