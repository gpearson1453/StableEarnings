Footnotes
PRINCESS CONSUELA was restless in the gate, broke a half-step slowly then settled into stride, bid inside coming into the stretch taking the lead at the
three-sixtenths, kicked clear and held sway while given vigorous hand-urging late. MUD HUT was just a bit restless in the gate, stalked the pacesetter going
two to three wide on the turn, proved no match for the winner but was clearly second best. TAP N TWINE exchanged a light brush after the break, settled
mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn, showed late interest. BELLS OF JOY wasn't far off the leaders going two wide on the turn, ran on evenly in
the drive. CERTAIN HEARTS sprinted clear soon after the start, dictated terms in the two path, gave way. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY brushed after the break,
was in tight between rivals early, switched out heading into the turn then moved out further from three to five wide on that bend, was tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ART HEIST got away alertly, faced mild early pressure from an inside rival then from an outside foe, went two wide on the turn, drew off and was taken in
hand the final sixteenth. LARK stalked the winner then moved nearer to press from outside three wide into the turn, came out four to five deep leaving that
bend, was no match but second best. TEA AFTER BALLET dropped back between rivals heading into the turn, went two to three wide on that bend, ran on
to improve position. TRIPLE CHROME was urged forward to press the pace from inside but soon dropped back to track off the leader, failed to rally. DELTA
LADY saved ground, failed to threaten. KING ZION raced outside the trailing group three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

FIT TO FLY quickly moved clear to dictate terms from just off the rail, was much the best and not urged late. RIVZONAROLL chased the winner two to three
wide, was no match but second best. READY RUMOR broke a bit awkwardly and a step slowly while being forced out a bit as well, moved forward past
rivals, went four wide on the turn, came in a bit in the stretch, was no match for the top pair. EL RAYO was urged along early inside but never near enough
to threaten. MAMAS HOME COOKING raced outside going five wide on the turn, came in a bit in the stretch and was not a threat. NORMANDY ANGEL
switched outside a rival to go two wide into the turn, failed to menace. INDIO GUAPO veered out at the break, raced off the inside at the rear and was not a
threat.

HEY MA was urged from the break, set the pace inside, held sway under steady handling. AMARI S. pursued the winner three wide, was no match but
secured the place. LALUCHADORA edged forward outside heading up the backstretch, went four deep on the turn, kept on for show honors. NEW CHINA
broke outwardly, tracked inside, moved out a path coming to the quarter pole, advanced inside rivals in upper stretch but could not sustain the effort.
IRINA'S HERO failed to threaten after going four to five wide on the turn. VICTORIA'S DOLL steadied at the start, was hard to control while getting out
entering the turn near the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on that bend, failed to menace.

Footnotes
UPBEAT MELODY quickly moved clear to set the pace, raced just off the fence through the turn, turned back a mild challenger in upper stretch and kicked
away under vigorous hand urging to set a new track record. REMEMBER THE MAINE settled inside, came out a path midway on the turn, was four wide in
upper stretch, had room between at the furlong marker, gained mildly to be clearly second best. RED HOT DEVIL tracked inside, came out a bit just off the
fence, made a mild bid near the eighth pole but flattened out thereafter. WINGING WAYS shifted in heading up the backstretch entering the turn two wide,
came out four deep later on that bend, kept on evenly in the stretch. KING TITO chased the eventual winner while shifting in three wide, lugged in once in
upper stretch and weakened. GREELEYS ICE saved ground inside and failed to rally. OMAR ATTACK raced outside at the rear going two then three wide
on the turn, came out further in upper stretch, failed to rally. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND raced mid-pack three to four wide through the turn and was not a
threat.

Footnotes
UNDECODED settled outside racing mostly four to five wide, took aim in upper stretch, dueled late and just got up over WHITE LIES, who was floated five
wide into the first turn but quickly moved in four then three deep stalking the pace, edged to challenge heading to the far turn going two wide on that bend
and taking the lead just outside the quarter pole, was clear in mid-stretch, dueled late and was outfinished. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE drifted three wide into the
first turn then eased back and shifted in two deep tracking the leaders, saved ground into the second turn moving out a path later on that bend, was within
striking distance in upper stretch then evened out. MAYSTART floated four wide into the first turn then took back from between runners and moved in a path
to track in behind, continued close up three to four wide on the far turn, ran on evenly. WILDWOOD MAGGIE broke a step slowly, shifted in entering the first
turn racing near but just off the fence off the leading group, saved ground into the far turn before moving out three wide, ran on. KIMBERLY FRANCES
shifted in from five to three wide early on the first turn, raced well back off the inside, moved nearer the rail into the far turn, failed to threaten. SUPERTRIX
set the pace inside, gave way.

Footnotes
LAND MARK DEAL tucked in two wide early, raced mid-pack into the far turn, moved out three wide entering that bend, continued four then back in three
wide, struck the lead about the quarter pole and kicked clear. JIMMY D shifted in early to save ground on the first turn tracking the leaders, edged closer to
the leaders but had to tap on the brakes just slightly about the seven-sixteenths, moved out a bit at the three-eighths, steadied about the five-sixteenths as a
rival came in, kept on in the lane to secure the place. TAP THE MOJO shifted in two wide settling well back, raced on or just off the rail on the far turn
running into traffic and lacking room nearing the quarter pole, came out in upper stretch and ran on well. FORT LOWELL vied between then outside a rival
two wide, began to weaken late up the backstretch, was in a bit tight and appeared to exchange minor contact about the five-sixteenths, came out in upper
stretch and kept on. CLARESTOWN stalked three wide, took the lead into the far turn before being collared leaving that bend, had no extra for the drive.
PATH TO SUCCESS shifted in heading to the first turn going three wide on that bend racing well back, continued three to four wide on the far turn still off
the leaders coming out further once in upper stretch before angling back in. BRAVO BRAVO vied inside, began to weaken into the far turn, brushed lightly
about the five-sixteenths and came up empty. HONEST TO GOODNESS settled at the rear off the inside, made a swift move outside rivals four to five wide
heading to the far turn to challenge for the lead but could not sustain the effort. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF JIMMY D AGAINST
LAND MARK DEAL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

ISOLATE moved to the fore not long after the start to set the pace, was engaged later up the backstretch, dueled outside two wide through the turn, edged
away in the stretch. KNEEDEEPINSNOW moved forward inside heading up the backstretch to force the issue, dueled inside, began to weaken in upper
stretch and switched out, could not match strides with the winner but was clear for the place. NAVY SEAL settled at the rear, went two to three wide on the
turn moving between rivals, swung out five wide turning for home, ran on to get up for show honors. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK was forced out a bit in the
early stages up the backstretch, raced three then four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. AGGRESSIVITY settled off the leaders, raced outside five to six wide
on the turn, passed tired rivals. PATS PROPERTY raced off the leaders, saved ground on the turn, ran evenly. KADRI got away well, shifted in early, moved
out heading up the backstretch stalking the leading pair three wide, weakened. MOJO MAN failed to rally after going four to five wide on the turn.
