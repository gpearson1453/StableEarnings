SNOW JOB rated outside the pacesetter, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the
task. NATHANIEL'S HOPE sent from the gate, set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then could not threaten in the lane
and easily held the place. MULETRAIN mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, flattened and held the show. RED
DUBONNET well placed, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. TRAPPED N PARADISE broke a step
slowly and had an inside trip and improved position. WANNA WOW YOU broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
the stretch and passed a tiring rival. BUDDYBOYSGOTSENSE steadily lost ground.
