one to the line while under pressure for the win. DRAW OFF Tracked four wide into the turn, three path out of it, quickly found the front, was soon collared
by the winner, drifted out leaving the sixteenths pole carrying the latter out and then missed. MISSING FORTUNE Broke in the air spotting the field two
lengths, eased out a path into the lane and closed well. CALL ME PENNY Set the pace along the two path, was collared in upper stretch and faded.
JACKIEGIRL Fractious loading in the gate, four wide early, three path on the turn with one beat and failed to threaten. DONTPOKETHEBEAR Ducked in

Footnotes
ONE NIGHT STAND Sprinted clear, showed the way along the two path, took the rail midway around the final turn, opened up a lengthy lead and was
ridden out. MELISSA'S SMILE Broke slow, lagged back, gained along the three path on the last turn, four wide into the lane and rallied. DARE TO BE
GREAT In hand along the three path, took the rail on the last turn, eased out a path and finished with interest. BECKY'S MISSION In hand along the two
path, gained inside on the last turn and flattened out. IOVA Hopped at the start, tracked along the three path, two path on the last turn and weakened.
QUIET HORIZON Saved ground to no avail. STARSHIP BELMONT Tracked along the two path, took the rail on the last turn and tired. AZOGAR Unhurried
along the three path, two path on the last turn, was not a factor. ROAD TO THE CROWN Four wide into the first turn, five wide out of the last one and tired.
