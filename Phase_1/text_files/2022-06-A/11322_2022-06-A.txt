ONE NINER TANGO stalked while two wide, made progress while driven three wide around the turn, and drew away down the stretch. BUTTONED UP set
the pace, was coaxed inside around the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch which invited an opening for Runandhide Wind up the inside to duel for minor
rewards, but fought off that challenge and held place. RUNANDHIDE WIND chased from the rail, was roused inside around the turn, accelerated thru an
opening inside coming into the stretch, and ran on. RAMIRIN broke slow, trailed and was not a factor. MY FREEDOM raced well back and was never
competitive. GOLDEN AVIEATOR pressed two wide, was hustled between foes around the turn, but faded.

path, was hustled three wide around the turn, but finished evenly. SQUARE PEG set the pace from the two path, but yielded around the far turn. CROWN

Footnotes
LA FLECHA stalked in the three path, made a three wide move rounding the far turn, hooked up with Liveforthesong to duel down the stretch, and just got
up to win. LIVEFORTHESONG set the pace two wide, was driven inside around the far turn, lost duel stretch to end up placing. ROCKY DICE raced well
back inside, was hustled along inside coming into the stretch, and improved for show. CHIEF ALPHA pressed from three wide early, was ridden between
coming into the stretch, but faded. BOLD TREK prompted the pace inside but was done after a half. NOBLE EL SID trailed throughout.
