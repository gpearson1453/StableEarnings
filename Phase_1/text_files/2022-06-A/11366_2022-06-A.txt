CHARED tracked the leaders four wide never far back, bid through the far turn to gain the edge turning for home and held DEJA CREW at bay in the drive.

was just off the leaders two wide, moved four wide into the lane but lacked the needed final rally. PENCE weakened while five wide into the lane. BLUE
TWISTED STEEL gained the early lead along the inside, made the pace to the far turn and weakened.

REMARKABLE CHARM was in reach of the leaders outside to move closer going to the far turn, rallied clear into the lane and held a comfortable margin
under a hand ride. MOONFIELD contested the pace three wide outside QUEENS GIFT then could not go with the winner in the lane. QUEENS GIFT
contested the lead about the two path inside a rival and came up empty in the lane. DONNAS FINAL WORD followed the pace two and three wide, angled
out into the lane but had no solid closing run. ALWAYS A TIZ lunged at the break to come away last, briefly followed the pace inside and gave way.

PERVASIVE stalked the pace two and three wide never far back, angled four wide into the lane and rallied outside RUN FOR MATTY to run that one down
late. RUN FOR MATTY moved four wide to bid through the far turn and gain the lead into the lane, led to deep stretch but could not hold the winner safe
late. R DEJA VOO contested the pace three wide outside PURE CRYSTAL then lacked the needed closing rally. BOLD IMPACT stumbled at the break,
followed the pace two wide, angled out and was fanned five wide into the lane and made a mild gain. PURE CRYSTAL was on a contested lead about the
two path inside a rival and weakened in the lane. DADDY JACK failed to rally and was fanned six wide into the lane.

JUDGE ON THE RUN dropped back from the early pace four wide, commenced her rally leaving the first turn to reach the leaders going to the far turn,
swept by to move clear turning for home and held the margin under steady handling. JOY FOREVER followed the pace two wide, angled four wide into the
lane rallied to gain the place. SING CHARMER SING moved outside INEWAGALLIKETHAT to contest the lead three wide then came up empty in the drive.
ZIBBY TOO rallied four and five wide in the far turn but could not mount the needed late rally. INEWAGALLIKETHAT showed the most early speed to gain
