TUCKERTON BAY hesitated at the start, then went up to tracked pace four wide on the first turn, made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front nearing the
sixteenth pole and then held off SOUL STORY later to prove best under a drive. SOUL STORY was well rated along the inside, shifted off the inside to be
three wide by the quarter pole, swung out five wide leaving the turn, rallied well but could not get to the winner. LTL BEAR SALOON stalked the early pace
three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over, then gave way grudgingly late, bested rest. ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT was rated two wide and
lacked a rally. SCARY LARRY set the pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and gave way.
