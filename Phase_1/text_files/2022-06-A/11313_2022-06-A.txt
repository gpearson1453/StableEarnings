Footnotes
MOON MISCHIEF set the pace on a clear lead through the far turn, came into the lane from the two path with a diminishing lead, was under a strong drive
through the last sixteenth to hold in a game effort. BIG PAPER tracked the pace from near the inside into the far turn, came off the rail when passing a tired
rival, cut the corner into the lane and had aim on the winner while along the rail, continued under a stout drive through the final sixteenth and was inching up
to the end while clear for the place spot. FIERCE ASSAULT raced four wide throughout, bid in late turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane from
the four or five path with aim on the top ones then finished evenly while lasting for the place spot. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was unhurried into the far turn, bid
four to six wide through late turn, came into the lane from the six path and finished with good energy to just miss the show spot. HEY BOSS was in the three
path through the turns when never far back, came into the lane from the two path and was gaining to the end. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD was in the two path
through the turn and into the lane, was gaining inside the eighth pole from the two path when angled to the seven path late to avoid a hosts of rivals.
WEATHER PRAYER was unhurried early while off the inside, bid five wide through mid-turn then flattened out. DOWN TO BIZZNESS was in the four or five
path through the turn and never was a factor. BRENTSPENCE chased the pace from the three path and was empty into the lane. LONGER VIEW chased
the pace from the inside the faded through the far turn. DANNY'S LIL DANA chased the pace from the three path through the far turn and was empty turning
into the lane.

Footnotes
CACTUS FLOWER stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, moved to press the leader through late turn, was asked for more entering the lane
and edged clear after the sixteenth pole. TRAFALGAR SHORE chased the top two through the turn while in the three path, lost some ground when swinging
into the lane, stayed on well and was steadily gaining at the end. MI ESTRELLA set the pace from the two path into the turn, was put under pressure in late
turn, dueled with the winner into the lane while near the inside then yielded and lost the place spot late. KISSES SO SWEET was bothered at the start and
steadied, raced in the two path while trailing through the turn, continued in the two path into the lane and was never a threat while passing a few.
CHELSEA'S STRENGTH was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from three path and passed a couple. SAVEDBESTFORLAST raced in
the two path through the turn and tired. IWANNABEPERFECT steadily faded while in the three or four path through the turn. LADY VANIER vied for the
early lead while along the inside then retreated.

MEMORY IN MOTION was unhurried while in the two path down the backstretch, was asked for more in mid-turn when moving from the three to the five
path, came into the lane from the six path with good momentum, angled in approaching the sixteenth pole to avoid drifting leader and was up in time. NO
PROOF chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead while straightening, opened a clear advantage while drifting
from the four to the seven path, drifted back in from the seven to the two path late and was caught. PALMER'S PASS was unhurried while off the inside,
moved with the winner through the turn while in the two to the four path, continued in the four or five path into the lane and was gaining to the end.
THUNDERBOLT ZEUS raced in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, continued as a contender into the lane then flattened out
inside the eighth pole. BRIGHT BRIAN hit the gate and lugged in at the start while spotting the field some four lengths, was far back down the backstretch,
moved through the three path in the far turn, continued with momentum into the lane then moved up while not a threat. CASPER JUSTICE set the pace
from the two path into the far turn then gave way into the lane. SHINEONBRAD chased the pace from the three or four path through the turns and tired after
entering the lane. HOT N SWEATY vied for the early lead, chased the pace into the far turn then was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole. WHITE SILVER
SANDS vied for the early lead while nearest the rail, then steadily gave ground. VERY BEST CAFE was outrun while along the inside. CORIMA was in the
two path through the far turn and was empty through the lane. JUSTICETHEBEAST was in the five to the four path throughout and steadily faded.

MCLAREN VALE stalked the pace outside of the leader, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of his rival and was clear late under mild urging.
FIRST GLIMPSE was off awkwardly, went clear early before being challenged on the far turn, dueled inside of the winner and gave way late grudgingly.
CAUSE TO CRUISE trailed, bid four wide at the quarter pole and gained the place late. DOWN COLD stalked the pace in the two path, stepped out at the
quarter pole, forcing a rival to clip heels and then faltered. MAJOR CONTENDER stalked the pace in the four path, was bumped and clipped heels at the
quarter pole and lost momentum. ALASDAIR was not a factor. DOWN COLD WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION
BY THE RIDER OF MAJOR CONTENDER AN A STEWARDS' INQUIRY CONCERNING INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE.

Footnotes
HUNGARIAN PRINCESS stalked the pace while five then four wide, bid into the lane, caught the leader nearing the eighth pole then edged clear late.
UNBRIDLED VICTORY set the pace while in the two path, remained clear in late turn, continued with a narrow advantage with an eighth to go then gave
ground grudgingly and settled for second best. PRETTY ASSETS trailed early while near the inside, gained momentum into the lane from the two path and
continued to be with good energy to the wire. HOLY JUSTICE was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path with
energy and continued to gain to the wire and just missed the show spot. SHY MONEY was off a bit slow at the start, hustled up along the inside to track the
dueling rivals, continued along the rail to mid-turn, got through along the inside into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole. LIL EVIE pressed the
pace into the turn, continued to chase the pace into the lane then faded. ACUTELY was brushed at the start then moved up in contention down the
backstretch, began losing ground entering the turn from the three path and was never in it thereafter. MISS DEPUTY STAR stalked the pace from the three
path through the turn and was empty into the lane. NOT A ROLE MODEL was done after traveling a half from the two path.
