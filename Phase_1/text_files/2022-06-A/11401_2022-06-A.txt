Footnotes
ENDLESS SUNSET chased the pace early, snuck up the rail into the lane, took over command, inched clear down the lane and widened in the final stages.
CARNIVORE was bumped and bothered at the start, stalked the pace early two wide, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive for place late in
the stretch and prevailed for that position at the wire. BLAME GEORGE was bothered and squeezed at the start, tracked the pace early from the inside,
shifted into the four path entering the lane, made a bid down the lane, was under a long drive for place late but just missed that position at the wire.
NOTABLE EXCEPTION raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a bid but flattened out late in the drive.
ROCKET HOTSHOT was bumped and bothered at the start, never a threat. MONEY MIKE broke out at the start, set the pace early, was in the two path into
the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. EVEN MONEY trailed the field throughout.

W W FITZY broke a bit awkward at the start, raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the early pace, was in the four path into the lane, rallied
down the lane, drove past the leaders and cleared the field in the final stages. MISTY VEIL set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, overtaken
once in the lane but came back from the inside and was no match for the winner late. THE MARY ROSE stalked the pace early, was in the three path into
the lane, took over command, edged clear near the three sixteenths pole but faltered late in the drive. MY BETS raced on the inside along the turns and was
never a threat. WILL'S SECRET was through after a half.

Footnotes
BAGBOSS tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid four wide in the upper stretch, edged past rivals near the eighth pole three
wide and drew away late under a steady drive. COLTONATOR raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was no match
for the winner and held place in the final stages. VERB was unhurried early on, raced in the four path entering the lane, altered out further in the stretch,
rallied and was rolling late but missed place in the final stages. MUCH BETTER stalked the pace early on three wide, took over and led two wide nearing the
lane, was in the three path entering the lane, raced three wide near the three sixteenths pole and faltered late in the stretch run. THERIDEOFALIFETIME
tracked the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside entering the lane while making a bid, continued the bid down the lane but weakened late in the
drive. FLAMINGO HAWK raced in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. VIOLENT CITY was never a threat. TEQUILAS
RANGER was done early. FORE LEFT had early speed then folded up. ESCAPE ROUTE was a bit slow at the break and never a factor. EDGEMONT
ROAD was steadied back at the start and never a threat. WITH VERVE was never involved.
