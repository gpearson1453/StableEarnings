GYPSY REWARD was rated last tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance through the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide
entering the turn, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage nearing the wire under firm left handed encouragement. IT'S HER
TIME was prompted between foes, then inside a rival in the opening stages, switched outside the pacesetter entering the turn conceding some, continued
with a steady bid to gain the advantage between calls leaving midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. DUSTY FORD was urged forcing the pace
outside a rival in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn once gaining a clear advantage, held sway past midstretch but yielded to the top
pair late. KNIGHT'S HONOR broke sharply, tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but offered no closing bid. CELTICS WILDCAT flashed
brief pace inside foes but emptied out early.

ACCORDING TO ASPEN was rated between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, eased back from that position while switching outside foes after
a half, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to just edge LEATHER AND LACE
in time under firm handling. The latter tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight in the opening half, conceded some position nearing
the far turn, saved ground through the second bend, tipped out entering the stretch to advance on the pacesetter between foes, gained the advantage
between calls late but couldn't quite contain the winner. CRIMINAL RECORD sprinted clear while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, met several
challenges nearing upper stretch to maintain the advantage racing past the furlong marker but yielded to the top pair late. STARS OF BLUEGRASS tracked
the pacesetter three wide between foes in the opening half, shifted inwards entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but
flattened out late. Y NOT SIZZLE tracked the pacesetter four deep as part of the second flight from the outset to the backstretch, was urged three deep
racing into the far turn to make a brief bid nearing upper stretch but emptied out entering the lane.

margin to the second bend, held sway into upper stretch, drifted out making some light contain with GOPHER GOLD leaving midstretch and continued with
a game effort while continuing to exchange brushes to the wire to narrowly prevail under brisk right handed encouragement. The latter angled to the rail to
track the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, saved ground on the far turn, tipped off the inside in upper stretch while being urged to challenge outside
the pacesetter, exchanged brushes with that foe to late stages and was just outfinished. KNIEVEL, off a step slowly, was righted to track the pacesetter
three wide in second flight to the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing into the lane but continued with interest outside foes to prevail for a share. CLUB

late. BREXTON, reserved last, saved ground throughout but offered no closing bid. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST, forwardly placed tracking just outside the

Footnotes
SAINT SARENA broke readily, was urged to gain a narrow advantage between foes racing in the three path through the backstretch, dictated the pace on
that margin off the inside racing into the turn, then edged clear through the stretch under firm encouragement. POCKETFULLOFPOSIES tipped out to race
four wide between foes in second flight tracking the pacesetter, continued with a steady effort while shifting ground racing into upper stretch but couldn't
gain terms with the winner. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS broke readily, tracked the pacesetter five wide in second flight racing into the turn, faded entering the lane
but continued well enough to prevail for a share. SUNSHINE FEVER, a bit restless in the gate prior to the start, switched out early to track off the second
flight three wide between foes racing into the turn, then continued evenly between foes into the stretch. SENSE OF FLURRY angled to the inside tracking
off the second flight on the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing upper stretch to race four wide in the stretch but continued with an effort to gain some
position. I CINC EYE LUV U flashed brief pace between foes racing to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. BAILOUT KELA angled inwards to track
the pacesetter between foes in second flight just off the inside racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. MY DIAMOND RUNS, a step slow into
stride, settled between foes and failed to mount a serious challenge. SWEET SECRET broke slowly, tracked off the second flight along the rail racing into
the turn but offered no rally. CLAIRE SAILING stumbled at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the bend, edged forward nearing midstretch and went clear late
under firm left handed encouragement. BLAME J D was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, steadily advanced on the leaders
nearing upper stretch to split foes three wide approaching the furlong marker but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others. BRING
ME A CHECK was urged pressing the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and
gave way leaving the furlong marker. BUGLER tracked off the first flight outside foes in early stages, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn
to briefly gain striking distance nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. SIR WELLINGTON lost his footing at the start, breaking very awkwardly
losing position to the field, settled into stride a bit off the inside racing into the bend, angled inside entering the stretch but made no real impression. PRINCE
RAMA, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages racing just off the first flight, was urged to press the issue between foes into the bend and gave
way after a half. EUROMANTIC angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance but retreated early.

Footnotes
BADGER KITTEN, bumped at the start, was righted to stalk just off the leaders inside a rival racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped
out three wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just edge DAIGLE at the wire under firm handling. The latter, in touch with
the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage, edged clear entering the
stretch, continued grudgingly but just failed to contain the winner. LINDSEY LUCK broke inwards bumping BADGER KITTEN, was collected to race off the
second flight along the inside under rating to the far turn, then came around a tiring foe entering the stretch to gain position inside foes in the closing stages
while prevailing for a share. ALL NATIVE settled last racing to the far turn, swung out five wide entering the stretch and made some late progress while
being outkicked for a share. PLUMA tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
faded in the drive. REINA DEL SUR, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival
into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. HURRICAIN HUNTER, off slowly, was settled outside foes to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS MO was rated off the second flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling conceding
some position nearing the far turn, was urged to split foes just off the inside when presented an opening midway through the far turn, moved to dispute the
issue inside a rival racing through the stretch in a protracted skirmish through the stretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm encouragement.
HERECOMESTHEHAMMER broke sharply, was prompted to a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter inside a rival into
the backstretch, switched outside that foe while being urged to challenge for command entering the far turn, was carried out four wide between foes leaving
the far turn, but continued willingly outside the winner contesting the issue to the end to just miss. SHATTERED DREAMS settled last racing well off the
leaders to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the stretch and made some belated progress to gain a share. GOLDEN STAR ROCK, forwardly
placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced in tandem with that foe to challenge for command entering the far turn,
was carried out five wide nearing upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. BEHAVIN MYSELF was hustled to a clear advantage outside foes racing
into the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch racing well off the inside, drifted out racing through the far turn while briefly contesting the lead and
gave way into upper stretch. TURN THE SWITCH broke slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground racing into the far turn while
being prompted to advance but had no closing resonse.
