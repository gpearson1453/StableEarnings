PRICE TO PAY dropped back off the leaders early, commenced his rally through the far turn to come four wide into the lane and finished with a determined
late run to nail KNOWYOUROPTIONS at the wire. KNOWYOUROPTIONS moved to the front soon after a quarter and went well clear going up the
backstretch, carried the lead into the lane and was run down in the closing jump. SAMURAI MIKE sprinted to a clear lead in the opening sixteenth, was soon
overtaken by KNOWYOUROPTIONS after the first turn and had nothing left in the final turn.

Footnotes
MILLI STARR dueled on the early pace outside J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY while about the three or four path, continued out in the track to come four wide into
the lane while drawing clear and drew off under steady handling. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY dueled inside the winner to the far turn and could not match
strides nearing the lane while saving the place late. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN dropped back off the early pace, rallied four wide in the far turn and continued
to just miss the place. DIVA'S DIVA was three wide, moved up but could not threaten late. STREETTALKINHOTTIE stalked the leaders four then three wide
and weakened. LIL MISS DE BUY failed to mount a rally inside. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL showed speed between foes early and tired.
