Footnotes
HEY BELLA was reluctant to load, raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside
and was up and clear late. OUR TEN ANGELS was in range three wide, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, continued on
the left lead in the lane, led to deep stretch and lasted for a share of the place. LET FREEDOM REIN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three
wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed widest and was up for a share of the place on the wire.
ARTEMUS SWEETHEART saved ground in midpack, tipped out and was one-paced through the lane. MAGNOLIA ROAD saved ground off the pace, tipped
two wide nearing the quarter pole, bid between foes in midstretch and flattened out. BE THE ONE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. RIDE
ON BEAUTY broke in and bumped TOUCH OF LOVE into LET FREEDOM REIN at the start, stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the
quarter pole, briefly led then caved in upper stretch. THE CUBAN MISSILE set the pace along the rail, drew well clear down the backstretch and tired
nearing the quarter pole. TOUCH OF LOVE was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide around both turns and made little impact. PANTHER
COMMAND chased the pace inside and faltered around the far turn. EUTERPE trailed inside.

Footnotes
OCTOBER TIME saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the
far turn, took command in the stretch and held that margin to the wire under a drive. FORTY FLASH led the field from the two path through the opening half
mile, dueled while saving ground around the far turn, relinquished the lead entering the stretch and chased the winner home, the best of the rest.
TAPATERM raced at the back of the pack in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and
improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening the top two. VOLTE FACE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. JUST SO YA KNOW saved ground around the first
turn, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the second bend and passed tiring horses in the lane. VALHALLA AIR BASE chased the leader while
saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back from the rail racing around the second turn and continued to fade from there.
LINGUINI raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the second turn and made no bid.

KEY BISCAYNE was away from the gate quickly, angled in to save ground around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and around the far
bend, dueled in the lane and prevailed while drifting out in the final furlong. STARSHIP NTERPRISE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the
leader up the backstretch on the outside, moved up to challenge from the two path coming around the far turn and dueled down the stretch, getting denied
late and having to settle for second. DANCE WARRIOR tracked the leader while saving ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch and around the far turn and finished evenly. ONYX raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed close behind the field up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. INFLUENCING raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the lane.

SOUPSTER broke inwardly and bumped ULTIMATE BREEZE into UNCAPTURED FAITH, advanced three wide around the turn, took over nearing the
quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. SONG OF THE HEART set the pace along the rail, could not resist the winner near
the quarter pole but kept on to be clearly second best. MUDSHAFT hit the starting gate, chased the pace inside, angled three wide turning for home,
continued on the left lead in the lane and bested the rest. LATTE LOVER was off a step slow then in a bit tight soon after, advanced four wide between foes
around the turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. TRULY A DREAM raced off the pace inside behind a wall of horses and lacked a rally once clear.
UNCAPTURED FAITH was bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide, angled six wide leaving the three-eighths pole and never threatened. GIANT'S
QUEEN pressed the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. TAHAWEEL was shuffled back early, raced six wide around the turn and made little impact.
ULTIMATE BREEZE was bumped between foes at the start, advanced five wide around the turn and faltered in the lane. RAHTID was outrun while racing
two wide. SHOW ME LOVE had early speed between rivals, steadied near the half-mile pole and was through early.

ground on the outside in late stretch. PASSION PLUS saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN pressed the
pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second bend and weakened in the lane. PROMISE ME stalked the
leader on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path and flattened out from there. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY showed
the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ELLIEREESEASTON was off slow, raced off the pace three wide, closed strongly, swept the front near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. AWESOME
APEAL saved ground in range, tipped two wide and rallied between foes for the place. SHE'S CLASSY set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the
turn, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. PEARLINTHEROUGH was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, checked nearing the quarter pole,
swung five wide soon after and rallied belatedly. ADIOS DIXIE bumped at the start, raced three wide in midpack and lacked a rally. YEGUITA QUEEN
chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. THRILLING BABY was shut off at the start, raced five wide and made little impact. BAHAMIAN
BEAUTY played no factor while racing four wide. DOLCISIMA had the saddle slip forward at the start and made little impact while racing very wide. BELLA
SOFI was outrun inside. SCARLETT'S FLOWER had brief speed two wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF PEARLINTHEROUGH
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SENSEI LAWRENCE chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a three wide bid coming around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong to
go and drew off to the wire. SPAN OF CONTROL dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in
upper stretch, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home. FROLIC MAN tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening three
eighths of a mile, saved ground around the turn and gained ground in late stretch. GILLIGAN raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, navigated
the turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. CASH EXPRESS trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS dueled for the
lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way approaching the eighth pole and faded from there. VANCOUVER D'ORO raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
RACE CRAFT saved ground in range, angled three wide in midstretch, kicked in outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear.
HEZA KITTEN settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole,
battled outside of GEMONTEER to the sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner from there but inched ahead for the place. GEMONTEER set the pace in
the two path, battled to deep stretch, yielded and was vanned off after the finish. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) raced two wide in midpack, edged closer around the
far turn but was one-paced through the lane. OFFICER COUNTRY broke in and bumped at the start, was up close four and five wide and lacked the needed
rally. BENELUX was six wide early on the first turn, angled into the three path midway around that bend while racing in midpack, angled to the rail entering
the far turn, chased inside and had no closing bid. CATCHING FISH chased the pace three wide, angled in nearing the far turn, checked near the
three-eighths pole and dropped back inside. ROBINTAKINCHARGE was bumped at the start, advanced between foes to press the pace two wide and faded
in the lane. MR. SARCASTIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BORU was outrun inside.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S SON tracked the leaders on the outside for the run up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing three wide around the turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and held his margin to the wire. PROUD CONTENDER raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn,
began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground between horses late. MOMZA chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, launched a four wide
bid passing the three eighths pole and finished evenly while drifting out in the lane. QUICK INTRO dueled on the inside though the opening quarter of a
mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. DEMOCRACY hopped up leaving the gate, raced
off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, improved position mildly in upper stretch and was outkicked. GOLDEN
INDY hit the gate leaving it, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, swung wide into the
stretch and was empty from there. TUWAIM raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and made
no bid. DEAL GO DOWN dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole and tired further in the lane.
LOVE IN PARADISE raced in the middle of the pack in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field before a quarter of a mile had been run and was
not a factor.

ANOTHER DUKE was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace three wide, split rivals four wide in upper stretch, seized command leaving the
