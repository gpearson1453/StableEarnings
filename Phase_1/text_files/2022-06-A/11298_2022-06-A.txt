Footnotes
MINI DRESS in hand early, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, swiftly took over two wide when allowed on the bend, lengthened command
under mild urging leaving the bend and was kept to task until the final sixteenth. BURNING BUSH unruly in the gate, reared with an outward lunge just as
the gate opened, turned inward, bumping PRETTY LADY TOO, was urged along, two wide on the turn, swung widest for the stretch run and drew away
from the rest for the place inside the final eighth. CYBERTAP chased from inside then passed inside yielding rivals deep stretch. PRETTY LADY TOO was
bumped at the break helped prompt the early pace, did not keep up two wide on the turn, swung to path four entering the lane and began to wear down the
last eighth. CREAL SUGAR emerged with the early lead, was overtaken from outside on the bend and flattened out for the drive. RULER DAENERYS
showed little in a wide trip. There was a stewards' inquiry into BURNING BUSH'S start but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN broke on top, showed the way in hand from off the rail, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused nearing the quarter pole,
widened command under urging in the lane and was kept to a drive until the last sixteenth. W W RUSSIAN GOLD pressed the early pace outside RIPE
ATTACK, fought for second in the lane and edged ahead of the latter in the waning yards. RIPE ATTACK was steadied as his path narrowed at the five
furlong marker, did not keep up with LITTLE MIGHTY MAN on the bend, fanned outside that one for the stretch run, battled for second, did not have enough
left in the late going but was easily best of the others. BEL BIMBO in tight along the rail briefly in the early going, backed up some after the first eighth, came
off the rail leaving the turn and had no late bid. MIDNIGHT JOKER in contention on the backstretch, faded on the bend.

Footnotes
HEART OF REASON bumped at the start, advanced from outside, took over second four wide on the bend, angled in some nearing the quarter pole, drew
clear under a drive upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. TIME BREAK vied for the early lead between horses, did not keep up two wide on
the turn, took the rail for the stretch run, edged ahead for second then could only hold her position late. ABBMAR contested the pace from outside, was
three wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the bend, fought through the stretch, could not close the gap on the top pair but was unchallenged for third.
TOUCH BY FELICTY prominent from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up into the turn, swung out on the bend, came four wide into the lane, lacked a
significant bid and drifted out under left-handed pressure with a sixteenth left. CHRISTY ATTACK broke a bit outward, bumping HEART OF REASON, raced
in contention briefly outside TOUCH BY FELICTY, did not stay close two wide on the turn, fanned out behind the latter into the lane, altered to the outside
nearing the furlong marker and also failed to have a serious response. VIVA VIOLENCE displayed early speed from inside horses but began to yield after
three furlongs. APPLE VALLEY moved to the outside early on, stayed well off the inside taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TEMPLUNA in contention early, advanced three wide on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, engaged AIKEN TO BE TAKIN inside the final
eighth and slowly edged ahead the last sixteenth. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN stalked the early leader, took over leaving the quarter pole, moved clear upper
stretch, was challenged inside the last furlong, fought gamely but had to settle for being clearly second best. COOKIN ROSES broke on top, soon had a
clear lead, was challenged from outside on the bend, gradually yielded the last two furlongs but was unchallenged for third. MEXIA unruly in the gate,
bumped at the break, chased from between horses, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn and had no late bid. PRINCESS MANDII void of speed,
though hustled along, raced widest of all and only passed some tired ones late. SONG AND A KISS advanced two wide on the bend, lugged in some
approaching the furlong marker and began to fade. THEYCALLHERPINKY forwardly placed inside on the backstretch, yielded on the bend, was crowded by
SONG AND A KISS approaching the eighth pole, forced to steady from that point to inside the sixteenth marker, gained a free path at that time and altered
out.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE broke well then was settled off the early leaders, was roused three wide on the bend, drew clear under a drive upper stretch then
lengthened command while kept to urging until the final seventy yards. SOME DUDE settled well back early, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn,
fanned out some entering the lane, gradually altered to the outside for racing room once inside the last eighth and gained second late. TEARS ON A RIVER
in contention on the backstretch, failed to keep up from inside on the turn, came off the inside some for the stretch run, gained second inside the final
sixteenth, was outfinished but clearly best of the rest. TOWN CRIER shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead from path two on the bend, was no
match for WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE when set down for the drive and wore down inside the last furlong. HE'S A FINE MAN contested the pace from inside on
the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, angled outside WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE with two furlongs to go, steadily yielded and gradually drifted out
inside the final eighth. TAIGA HONEY void of speed, was just off the inside on the turn, fanned outside HE'S A FINE MAN entering the lane, had no rally
and was angled in for a clear path with a sixteenth to go. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS chased from just off the inside, floated out gradually taking the bend
and had little to offer for the drive. NAVJO ROAD hesitated at the break, raced greenly in the early going, was kept wide and did not respond to urging in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PACHI stalked the early leader from outside, took the advanced two wide leaving the quarter pole, was challenged from outside upper stretch, fought the
rest of the way on even terms but got the nod at the wire. ONE WAY HOME angled in some leaving the chute, progressed three wide on the turn, engaged
PACHI upper stretch, battled gamely to the wire, barely missed but proved easily second best. BABA LOU moved out widest with five furlongs to go,
advanced four wide on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, took over third from the middle of the track inside the last sixteenth and kept TRY TRY
AGAIN at bay for the show. TRY TRY AGAIN was steadied in traffic leaving the chute, chased from off the rail, came into the lane from path three, angled
out some for racing room upper stretch and passed a few tired rivals while closing in for third late. D'ARCHER broke on top, set a pressure pace from off the
inside, was challenged on the turn and steadily yielded the last two furlongs. PENALTY SHOT was bumped from the rear at the break, well placed inside on
the backstretch but gave way after three and a half furlongs. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP made a small leap inward from the gate, bumped PENALTY SHOT and
showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
CRAPS SHOOTER shared the early lead between horses, gained the rail on the turn, was roused approaching the quarter pole, floated out into the lane,
moved clear under urging upper stretch and held sway with steady handling. BLEEDING BLUE contested the pace from outside, was carried out to path
four entering the stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but was unchallenged for second. CALL ME DROSSEL in contention early while toward
the outside, gained third three wide on the turn, fanned widest for the drive and could only hold his position late. AWESOME SKIPPY fractious in the gate,
was taken out, examined by the veterinarian then reloaded, progressed between rivals once the race began, had a striking position two wide on the bend,
swung out behind BLEEDING BLUE for the drive and had no late bid. IMPERIAL TEMPLE retreated from between horses on the backstretch, saved ground
taking the turn and failed to have a significant stretch response. IN THE CLUB prominent from inside, was checked significantly when crowded by LAYTON
THE DAY into the turn, altered out three wide on the bend, brushed with the latter entering the stretch, was unresponsive to urging and allowed to coast the
last eighth. LAYTON THE DAY displayed early speed between rivals, angled in some into the turn, yielded from inside shortly after that, floated out leaving
the bend, brushed with IN THE CLUB, angled out upper stretch and also proved unresponsive to urging. The rider of IN THE CLUB lodged an objection
claiming interference from LAYTON THE DAY into the turn. After their review the stewards took no action to alter the official outcome of the race.
