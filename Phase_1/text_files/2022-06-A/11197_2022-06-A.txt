down in the final stages. LEAD ME was checked early on and raced back early on, was in the four path along the turns and rallied for place in the late
stages. COLD CALL stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, pulled away from the down the lane and lost place in the final stages.
LOTTA ROSES tracked the pace early on, raced on the inside along the far turn, shifted into the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. BLUE
OYSTER was in tight and hit rail early on, chased the pace, raced on the inside along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off down the
lane. LADY MERCEDES was never a threat. COLONEL ABY B was checked hard early on. MISS SUSIE R broke in at the start and was through after a
half. ONE FULL MOON was steadied hard early on. PRAY GLORIA was done early. DILMUNIA was steadied hard early on and eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
PISTOL took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, stalked just off of top pair two wide, engaged outside of them into the turn as OLD PHO pressed
her hand, drifted out a bit entering the lane before bidding in upper stretch as an outer BELIEVING rallied to do the same, gained a narrow advantage from
that rival entering the final furlong, dueled gamely while exchanging brushes with her outer counterpart, and held to the wire. BELIEVING got pinched back
between horses a few strides out of the gate, trailed the field into the turn, produced a five wide sweeping move turning for home, was floated six wide
entering the lane before, sustained a bid outside of PISTOL in upper stretch, vied while leaning in approaching midstretch, dueled with that rival while
exchanging brushes in the final furlong, but was denied. EPICUREAN stalked along the inside, was outmoved by outer foes turning for home to trail the field
entering the lane, chased while improving in upper stretch, shifted outwardly entering the final furlong, and stayed on for a minor share. FRACING NASTY
bumped an outer rival early on, set the pace, showed the way as outer foes inched closer turning for home, met a pair of bids in upper stretch, and gave
way to those foes at the furlong grounds. OLD PHO bumped an outer rival before bumping an inner foe soon after, backed out between prominent rivals
early on, tracked from midpack, ranged up four wide into the turn, pressed turning for home, but faded five wide and between horses passing the quarter
pole. GORMAN came in and bumped foes at the start, prompted the pace three to two wide into the turn, but faded between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
OPRY stalked the leader two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled through upper stretch, and drew off entering the final furlong. KOUFAX cleared early on,
showed the way via a loose margin down the backstretch, felt stern pressure from a pair of outer foes around the far turn, dueled with OPRY entering the
lane, but proved no match for that foe entering the final furlong, and safely held place. HIGHESTDISTINCTION tracked two wide, engaged outside of the
leading pair approaching the far turn, pressed around that bend, but failed to keep pace passing the five sixteenths pole, kept on to sustain his chase
through the lane, and held show. POLICY OPTION settled at the rear in the two path, took the far turn two wide, then stayed on between horses in
midstretch to miss reaching show late. KINGMEISTER stalked along the inside, but required urging to keep pace around the far turn, and lacked a bid
through the lane. LEBLON tracked from midpack along the inside, chased two wide around the far turn before shifting four wide entering the lane, but lacked
a rally and tired. ABSAM settled off of the pace two wide, but lacked a response to urging three wide around the far turn, got floated five wide entering the
lane, and lacked a rally on his left lead. ELI saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SAVVY trailed in the three path around both turns, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BE LIKE WATER stalked three wide, then two wide from the three path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied in pursuit of a clear
MINUTE WALTZ in the final furlong, reeled that foe in in the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage. MINUTE WALTZ prompted the pace two wide, vied
around the turn, drew off in upper stretch, met BE LIKE WATER's challenge in the final furlong, and was bested late. THANOZAPPER stalked along the
inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, shifted outside of the leading pair passing the quarter pole, but only managed to chase the clearing leader
in upper stretch, got outkicked for place in midstretch, and held show from an outer rival in the late stages. FLASHY CHARGE tracked two wide, then in the
three to four path around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick, vied for show in the closing stages, but was denied that
position. LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH took the turn in the four to five path while far back, fanned seven wide entering the lane, but made little impact.
PHAROAH'S HEART bobbled a bit before being taken in hand between horses at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but was stymied behind a tiring
rival in upper stretch, then lacked the needed rail kick once clear at the furlong grounds. ROC'S PRINCESS lagged behind the field around the turn, then
surpassed tiring ones. SOCIAL DILEMMA stalked four wide, pressed three wide while in the four path around the turn, but faded between horses entering
the lane. URSULINA set the pace, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the turn, then faded in upper stretch.
