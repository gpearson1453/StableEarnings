Footnotes
JUVEE TOO away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace one out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and was never threatened late while proving much the best. ATOMIC HAZE unhurried early
while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, swung four wide for the drive and
closed determinedly to get up for the place in the final strides. HARVEST DAY broke sharply and pressed the pacesetter three wide into the backstretch,
struggled to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished while racing one out from the rail in the drive, and was unable to hole the
place late. TUXEDO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response while finishing evenly from along the rail in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF ATTITUDE broke inwards and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched her bid from the back of the pack
while racing three wide into the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. MI REYNA stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, assumed command in mid stretch, and just failed to last.
FLORAL missed the break to get away poorly, moved up from just off the rail entering the first turn to gain a striking position while settling off the pacesetter,
quickly began to advance two wide in the run down the backstretch and continued two wide into the final turn, took the lead leaving the turn, but was unable
to sustain her bid, and faltered late. ARIKARA stalked the leader while being carried four wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn,
but failed to make a late impact. BAKZONE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, continued to save ground through
the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. DEFINITE PLEASURE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
sprinted to a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch, was overhauled midway through the final turn, and weakened badly in the late stages.

SOLARITY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the leader while racing three wide through
the final turn, assumed command into the lane, and held CHA CHING safely at bay late to prevail. CHA CHING unhurried early while dropping well behind
the field entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted off the rail in mid stretch and closed determinedly to get
up for the place. HEIDI away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, drifted out slightly leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. REA MEA pressed the leader in the run down the backside and through
the final turn while racing between rivals, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters leaving the turn, and had little to offer thereafter. BAYAKOAS IMAGE
hopped at the start, but raced into a tracking position from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, shifted four wide into
the lane, but failed to mount a late bid. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of REA MEA lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of SOLARITY for alleged interference leaving the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish. Note the three quarter split for this race was unavailable at this time.

place. PADDY D'ORO settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and
finished with late interest two wide in the drive to get up for a share. IT'S IN COMMAND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn from the inside of AVE'S IN COMMAND, was unable to match
strides with that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished in the late going. QUAGMIRE stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, rallied four wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. RING OF KERRY tracked the battling leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, maintained his position while rallying three wide into the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive while not being persevered with
late.

ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, advanced smartly three wide midway down the
backstretch, engaged the leaders three wide entering he final turn, quickly took control and was never seriously threatened late. THE CHANCES R broke
sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, tipped two wide to collar the pacesetter entering the final turn to battle
between rivals for the lead, was no match for the winner over the final furlong, but finished well to hold the place. SWORD FIGHTER settled off the early
pace while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to get up for
a share. MOUSSAKA CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and improved his
position late while passing tiring rivals in the drive. SIR BARCLAY away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, battled for
the lead from along the rail entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. RACING RIVER away well and stalked the leaders in the run down the
backside, struggled to maintain his position approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

UNCHARACTERISTIC lagged well back early while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid two wide from between rivals
entering the final turn, angled five wide entering he lane, and closed with a rush to be up in time. PORTER GENT away alertly and tracked the leaders in the
run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. SIR
BREGOVIC pressed the pace one out from the rail from the outside of BOLD ARCH entering the backstretch, assumed command from that rival while
racing two wide into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late in a gallant effort. CASCADE BILLY settled off the
contested early pace while racing three wide entering the backside, continued four wide through the final turn, and finished willingly three out from the rail in
the drive in a solid effort. SET TO SHINE away well, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing along the inside, rallied two wide into the final
turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive. STAY FANTASTIC settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact.
ANYPORTINASTORM tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the

DAPHNE away alertly and sprinted to the lead four wide entering the first turn, raced on an uncontested lead in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, and was never seriously threatened at any time. AMANDA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, was never a threat to the winner, but battled on gamely late to prove clearly second best. MISS THE HYPE
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the
rail in the drive to garner a share. VALUE DANCER settled well off the early leader while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing two wide in the drive. CHABI settled well back early while racing three wide into the
backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and failed to mount a serious late bid while finishing five wide in the drive. CATTITUDE settled well off the
early pacesetters while racing four wide entering the backstretch, continued wide throughout, and failed to make a serious impact. KLOEPATRA was
fractious prior to the start, and had to be backed out of the gate, settled well back early, and showed little. SAVER THE KISS stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, saved ground into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
