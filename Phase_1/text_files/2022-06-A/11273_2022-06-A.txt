ISLAND PHILO circled the turn three deep, was fanned to the six path approaching the eighth pole, took command near the furlong marker then drove clear.
CHARGINA saved ground on the turn in a striking position, eased out for the drive, angled to the five path approaching the eighth pole and flattened out
inside the winner. MADE TO HUSTLE , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. LOVE RAN
RED , along the inner rail around the turn, angled out, raced between horses in the stretch and had a mild gain. MISS FOXANN , near the inner rail on the
turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor. MUSICAL CAT raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun. LA FAMILIA sped to
the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. BELL THE CAT trailed and was eased late.

Footnotes
SWAYIN TO AND FRO got into a duel outside SPICY MARGARITA after about a sixteenth of a mile, wrested a short lead in upper stretch, separated a bit
while under left handed asking inside the sixteenth pole then was fully extended to get the bob over DATE NIGHT KISSES. DATE NIGHT KISSES settled
off the dueling leaders while three wide, moved up steadily mid turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, made a grinding to run to draw in even terms in the
final jumps but lost the bob. SPICY MARGARITA was sent up to the inside of rivals soon after the break and gained a short lead, battled with the winner
from the five eighths to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. CAMELIA ROD settled off the rail and off a contested pace, angled five wide with some run
into the lane, chased past mid stretch then flattened out. ROCKINHIPPIECHICK had speed then rated back off the leaders after about a furlong, sat a
perfect stalking trip towards the rail then failed to kick on when put to serious pressure. OVERANDOVERAGAIN broke slowly, saved ground while off the
pace, angled out under pressure in the drive and faded.

drive and drew clear late. STIMULUS MAKER stalked the pace, raced between horses in the stretch and rallied. GIANTSBANE , wide the far turn, sprinted
clear in mid stretch then lugged in and weakened. SOLOMON'S CHOICE , inside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, steadied in close
quarters leaving the turn then rallied mildly between foes. ORO GRIS , steadied in tight quarters between horses and inside the winner leaving the far turn,
angled very wide in upper stretch. STEADY EDDIE set the pace along the inner rail and tired the final furlong. RIP IT , three wide, chased the pace to upper

SILENT MALICE lagged well off the early pace, edged up under some asking mid turn, angled out and came about six wide for the drive, rolled up outside
rivals to poke a head in front in mid stretch, moved clear soon after, was roused once right handed then drew away. KNOWHOWIKNOW , warmed up
vigorously pre race, was hard sent from the gate and gained a clear early advantage, set the pace two wide, took pressure while ridden along past the three
eighths, maintained a tenuous lead past the three sixteenths then stayed on well to save the place. FROSTED INDIAN broke a bit slow, moved up to the
inside of foes near the five eighths, was under asking pursuing past the three eighths, remained in range to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. NO
MORE TALK stalked two wide, was under pressure mid turn, angled four wide and came up empty. RAPID RESPONSE edged up four wide outside rivals
leaving the pace, bid after a half, forced the issue between rivals leaving mid stretch then faded. CHARGE TO VICTORY , three wide stalking, bid between
foes into the turn, pressed the pace past the five sixteenths, faltered through the drive and was eased late.

CANDY CORNER bumped with SHE'S A TRIPP leaving the starting gate, checked in tight quarters near the three eighths pole found room along the inner
rail from the five sixteenths to the wire and took the lead late. SUPERIORITY showed speed along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, swung outside
approaching the stretch, gained command inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. HARPER'S DO , four deep leaving the turn, rallied mildly outside
rivals. HUDSON CANYON sprinted clear mid way on the turn, was well off the inner rail through the stretch and gave way. SHE'S A TRIPP bumped with the
winner at the start, saved ground around the turn and was outrun. KOBE'S GIRL chased the pace down the backstretch, failed to keep up on the turn, raced
in the three path entering the stretch and lacked a rally. TOUGH ONE , three wide stalking the pace on the turn, faltered in upper stretch.

clear run in mid stretch, closed under right handed asking, took command late and drew clear. CAN'T BUY LOVE chased the leader two wide, edged up
under pressure inside the sixteenth pole, kept on willingly and nabbed the place. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA had speed outside MATTITUDE then went
clear into the turn, dropped in and set the pace under some rating, spurted away under asking leaving the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted near the
sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. COCONUT CAKE , sluggish from the gate, settled off the early pace, saved ground into the lane, had a bit of
traffic, altered out for the final furlong and closed between rivals. MATTITUDE prompted the pace towards the rail, steadied back off the leader nearing the
turn, recovered and came back to the inside of a rival nearing mid stretch then flattened out late. DENDROBIA lagged off the early pace, raced four wide in
upper stretch and had a mild late kick. UNRULY JULIE , four wide outside rivals while pursuing the pace, faded. ADELAIDE MISS , three wide stalking the
pace, failed to kick on under asking past the quarter pole and gave way. HOPE HAS A NAME dropped off the early pace, raced three wide mid turn, angled

Footnotes
DIXIE DRAWL chased the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead mid way on the far turn then drew off through the stretch. HALITE lacked
speed, raced in the two path on the far turn, was taken to the inner rail turning for home and rallied nicely. THUNDERSHOOK , four wide both turns, chased
the pace to mid stretch then tired. FORTUNE'S FOOL , in the three path both turns, chased the pace to upper stretch and gave way. BUMPERDOO ,
outrun, swung very wide in upper stretch. UP AGAINST IT , in the two path on the far turn, swung to the five path turning for home and gave way. YES SIR
COLONEL broke sluggishly, was not a factor and faltered. HONOR THE FLEET set the pace along the inner rail, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
BELLE BELISA (IRE) was steadied when put in close soon after the break, was taken well in hand while travelling four wide through the backstretch run,
crept closer leaving the three eighths, angled out moved up five wide into the lane, responded when roused and forged clear heading to mid stretch, was
roused a few times then drew off emphatically while kept to steady hand encouragement. DANCING TIL DUSK , off the pace and under rating three wide
between foes, swung six wide for the drive, churned on willingly and nabbed the place. HELLUVA LADY steadied early while saving ground past the three
quarter pole, edged up inside, altered out and rallied between rivals. CENTER STAGE tracked inside, was shut off with run leaving the three sixteenths,
dropped back, swung out for the final furlong and came back on with good energy. GENNIE HIGHWAY rated three wide, moved up into the far turn, awaited
room around the turn, lacked room in mid stretch, angled in and finished with interest. VOLADOR , three wide stalking the pace, bid between foes nearing
the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. ZOOMED IN was steadied soon after the break, lost ground four wide, was a bit keen and pulled her way
forward, bid outside foes nearing the quarter pole, remained a presence past mid stretch then gave way. BECKON , in hand prompting outside the leader,
failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. TORRE BRANCA , between foes near the half mile pole, dropped back leaving the five sixteenths then
came up empty. CLICK TO CONFIRM moved up and cleared early, set a slow but pressured pace towards the rail, stayed on to the three sixteenths then
surrendered.
