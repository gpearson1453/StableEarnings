stretch, drifted out and was outfinished. DE BOLT LIGHT allowed to settle, swung wide and closed a gap late mid track. TILLY MANILLY vied for the lead
three wide into the stretch, drifted out before the furlong marker and came up empty. NORMAS HOPEFULGIRL veered out at the start bumping

Footnotes
QUIET AMIGO stumbled inward at the start, stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch, was put to a left
handed whip, drifted out to mid track before the eighth pole giving up the lead then came on again under right handed urging to win by the narrowest of
margins. OHIO MUNNY dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained the advantage well inside the winner, drifted out to the eight path late and just
failed. WILDCAT BILL stalked the pace two wide and went evenly. KONTAR was shut off at the start, trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally. C K'S
LUCKY DUCK had good early speed then faded. ACCURATE close up from the start along the rail, advanced through the turn, angled around the tiring
CADILLAC RIDE to the two path, checked entering the stretch then dropped out of it. CADILLAC RIDE dueled for the lead along the inside for a half then
stopped.
