PAYDAY TOO allowed the pace to go early while inside, continued to save ground the middle half, in traffic late final turn, shifted out a bit approaching the
furlong marker, late bid, just up. GOTTA GO closest to the leader, moved up to join that into the far turn, put a head in front soon after, extended that
advantage when straightened for home, continued to lead until late, proved stubborn at the end inside the winner, clear of the others. LOUISIANA MOON
settled off the pace and the inside, three wide first turn and up the backstretch, continued outside when roused late in the final turn, rallied widest through
the straight to be in time for the show, not a threat to the top two. IM A COWBOY TOO raced in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the
drive, closest in upper straight then flattened out late to miss the show. CALCULATE void of speed while four wide into the first turn, moved in to save some
ground, two path through most of the second bend, dropped to the inside for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. HOT STOVE
LEAGUE broke alertly, set a soft set of fractions inside, offered brief resistance to the runner up when confronted by that one into the final turn, gave way
through the straight.

ANOTHERINTHEFIRE last away, lagged for a half, angled out three wide and between foes into the lane, took over with a challenge past the furlong
marker, drew well clear under steady handling. TOOSIE shook clear soon after the start, set a modest set of fractions while pressured for a half, offered little
resistance to the winner the final furlong, fully extended to hold the place. SANDY'S WAGER lacked speed outside the winner, floated out four wide when
floated out by that one turning for home, remained widest through the stretch, not enough late for the second spot. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE underwent
shoe repair in the paddock, broke with the field, second flight along the inside, bit closer in some traffic exiting the turn, lacked a closing response when
clear. TIME TO SLEEP pressured the runner up from the two path for a half then had little left for the stretch run. BEAR TOOTH PASS was finished early,
trailed home.

REECE'S PRIORITY broke narrowly best, soon cleared, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn and into the lane, remained clear late, just lasted.
SUNNYONASTORMYDAY broke with the winner to that one's outside, raced in the second flight between rivals, came three wide out of the turn, roused,
steadily getting to the winner late while running out of time. FAZIO in the main body while racing outside for three furlongs, four wide into the lane between
horses, drifted out past the furlong marker under left handed pressure, switched to a right handed crop a sixteenth out and was going best of all at the end.
RATHER PRECOCIOUS in the second group closest to the inside, two path into the lane, lacked the necessary closing response. FRIENDOFTHECOURT
last away, saved ground into the stretch, went evenly the final furlong to also be found lacking. PRAY IDE SING back off the pace and the inside, was five
wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally.

BURNING DESIRE restless in the gate prior to the start, raced in the second flight in the two path past the wire the first time, continued within striking
distance, angled out three wide turning for home, roused, closed with good resolve to kick down the leader. CANDY'S PARADE broke out to brush with
ANNA CLAUSE, settled off the pace inside, in traffic along the rail and briefly lost action, early move to take over into the far turn, shook clear when
straightened for home, could not contain the winner. US SECOND CUTE PIE a bit slow to settle when showing the way into and through the first turn,
allowed the runner up the rail just after a half, chased that one through much of the stretch, comfortably saved the show. TAYLORS BABE pressed the issue
early in the three path, continued to force the pace while continuing in the three path and between foes second turn, had little left for the stretch run,. TABLE
ONE off a step slow, raced four wide, within striking distance into the final turn, lacked a closing response through the lane. CAJUN TWO STEP in the
second flight early inside the winner, fell back before a half, not a threat in the drive. ANNA CLAUSE brush, shuffled back at the break, moved up before a
half, four wide through the final turn, gave way for the stretch drive.

JAKE THE BAND MAN closest to the early leader, engaged that one from the outside late in the turn, put a head in front into the lane, continued to hold a
narrow advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides to prevail in game fashion. JONATHAN WHO
hesitated at the start, moved closer toward the inside turn, angled out a bit to be three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late. I'M LOOKING UP
sprinted clear after breaking with the leaders, set the pace, responded when confronted by the winner late in the turn, gave ground grudgingly to that rival
while continuing inside. MAINTAINANCE MATT fell back to trail after the start, raced four wide through the turn, remained widest in the drive, lacked the
needed closing punch. IMPACT PLAYER with the second flight early three wide, had little left for the stretch run. LEMNISCATE forwardly placed in the early
going, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
YOUNG TUSCAN broke in while a bit rank slightly bumping FISH N CHICK, worked way clear into the turn, extended that advantage into the straight, not
seriously threatened the final furlong under steady handling. GRAND PRADO broke with the winner, chased that one in the two path through the turn and
into the stretch, slowly gaining late, clearly second best. FISH N CHICK lightly bumped by the winner break, raced back off the early pace, three path
through the turn, widest in the drive while displaying some moderate interest, finished up best of the rest. SHAR'S TREASURE off the pace along the inside,
continued to save ground through the turn to no avail in finishing up evenly. BALKY within striking distance early off the inside, had little for the drive.
EGEAUXTISM broke slowly, trailed throughout in failing to threaten. PER RULING DATED 6/29/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUSIANA STATE RACING
COMMISSION (RULING #24943), YOUNG TUSCAN WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SABER RUN last away, remained unhurried up the backstretch, began to advance along the inside, angled out widest for the drive, late bid, won going
away midtrack. FOOLISH DREAMS closest to the two leaders, collared that pair from the outside past the furlong marker, led late, no match. FIESTY FIST
moved up to duel in the two path, continued on equal terms through the turn and into the stretch, gradually weakened from between rivals, saved the show.
G'WILDCAT broke on top, set or forced the pace for five furlongs along the inside, first to blink. GRUNT well off the pace outside, moved toward the inside
late in the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. GRAND PRIORITY broke back, moved out, was four wide late in the turn, had little
more for the stretch run. TOUCHDOWN JOE in the second group for a half three wide, tired through the lane.

Footnotes
RESPOSADO settled behind the two leaders in the three path, ranged up to challenge from the outside turning for home, took over, steadily clear, ridden
out. RESPECT ALL took command after the start, shook off nearest pursuer to be briefly clear late in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive
inside that one, clearly second est. SONGS DISCREET CAT went one paced throughout along the inside, no match for top two. ROSEISALWAYSRITE
pressed the runner up early off the inside, weakened through the lane. HAIRTRIGGER HEART remained back in failing to menace. UNION GRAD off a step
slow, trailed in showing little.
