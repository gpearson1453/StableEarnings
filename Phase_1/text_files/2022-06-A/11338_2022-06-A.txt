Footnotes
KING OF ANYTHING moved up four wide to bid into the lane, was joined by WAR EAGLE'S RETURN upper stretch, dueled that one to the wire and held
safe. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN dropped to the back while in reach of the leaders, rallied three and four wide through the far turn, came five wide into the
lane to bid outside the winner, dueled but could not get by. MACHO MADNESS was just off the leaders while in traffic in the first turn and steadied off heels
nearing the backstretch, rallied three wide to challenge in the far turn, continued well but was outfinished for position in the lane. LIGHT BOUND BID saved
ground in the tightly bunched field and lacked a final closing run. ALL SHACKED UP dueled on the pace about the two path inside FELON and weakened in
the far turn. FELON dueled on the lead outside ALL SHACKED UP and weakened in the far turn.

shifted out three wide going to the far turn and was challenged by the winner, continued willingly in the lane but could not run that one down. HOLIDAY

the pace, angled out through the far turn and moved up but could not threaten late. BIG BIZ contested the early pace along the inside and weakened.
BLABIMIR lunged at the break but soon recovered to challenge on the lead four wide, bid and led between calls going up the backstretch, moved in going to
the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MR. BIG SHOT was on the pace three wide outside a rival early, edged clear staying out from the rail and shook off a challenge from PRINCE B through the
far turn and edged away late. BIG BEND BUCKAROO rallied four wide to reach contention in the far turn, continued on to gain the place in the drive but
could not threaten the winner. PRINCE B angled out going up the backstretch to bid outside the winner in the far turn but came up empty in the drive. CHIEF
TY HE failed to mount a rally three wide. ALEX TO was not a threat four wide. P R WHY NOT tucked inside going to the first turn and weakened. P R
GIRLFRIEND contested the early lead about the two path inside the winner and tired.
