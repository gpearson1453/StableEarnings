Footnotes
ESTA CHUCK trailed early, was hustled while making steady progress inside around the far turn, tipped three wide into the far turn, and rallied to win.
BELLSWILLBERINGING set the pace while two wide, raced in the three path at the top of the stretch, and fought off a challenge from BRYCENS GOLD to
hold on for place. BRYCENS GOLD stalked in the three path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but hung. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL raced in mid
pack along the three path, was hustled inside around the far turn, but flattened. MALICEINTHEPALACE was unhurried two wide, and never a factor. SHO U
RIGHT prompted the pace inside, but was done after a half.

Footnotes
DUMI KNIFE pressed inside, took the lead into the turn, tipped into the two path in upper stretch, and kicked clear. SUPERSTITIEUX stalked from the three
path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, and ran on for place. PROUD CIVILIAN set the early pace two wide, was coaxed midway around the
turn, tired late, but held show. GHOST OF KHOZAN rated from the five path, raced inside rounding the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, but flattened.
LILTONYTWOPHONES raced in mid pack from the four path, was in the four path around the turn, drifted in at the top of the lane, but was empty. SIR
PEEL trailed throughout.
