Footnotes
KOALA broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, sprinted to a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch, held that
clear margin into the lane, but was all out to fend off a late charge by SOUTHERN LASS to prevail. SOUTHERN LASS away alertly and tracked the leader
into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, held a stalking trip behind an uncontested pacesetter two wide in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, rallied smartly through the turn, and closed with a rush one out from the rail in the drive to just miss. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stalked the leader
into the first turn, before settling well back of that rival in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. EASTERS MEMORY settled well off the early leader while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, began to lose touch with the field approaching the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon. The three quarter split was
unavailable at the current time

Footnotes
RACINO away well and stalked the leader one out from the rail from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn,
and battled determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the final strides. VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the inside
entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and continued gamely from along the rail in the stretch drive
only to be nipped in the final strides. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, commenced her bid one out
from the rail from between rivals entering the final turn, tipped four wide in mid stretch and closed with a rush to just miss. DO YOU WANNA GO stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued with a three wide trip while rallying into the final turn, was forced to take up when
PINEAPPLE TIDBITS angled off the rail taking her path soon after entering the lane, and finished four wide in deep stretch. HEART OF TEXAS was
fractious prior to the start, and settled off the early pace while racing five wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied four out from the rail into the final turn,
but needed more when called upon. HEREVERYWISH settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied four wide
entering the final trn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon late. GIFTED GREY stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, struggled to hold her position into the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. TIMELESS SHRUG away alertly, but was allowed to
settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, lost ground approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late. Following the running of this race
there was both a jockey's claim of foul and a stewards inquiry. The rider of DO YOU WANNA GO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of PINEAPPLE
TIDBITS, for alleged interference in the stretch drive. Following a review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of
finish. This race was hand times

KAY'S KITCHEN broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn
to assume command, and drew clear over the final furlong under a confident hand ride. QUALITY COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, was overtaken while continuing at the rail entering the final turn, and battled willingly through the lane to preserve the place. C
R SUNRISE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the
rail in the drive to get up for a share. DRILL BABY DRILL stalked the leader into the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, shifted two wide midway through the turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. REMARKABLE GIRL settled off the early pace
while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final trn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive.
HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, saved ground through the final turn, and
flashed some late interest, but was never a serious factor. LUNAR NEW YEAR lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch,
saved ground into the final turn, but failed to make an impact. ALWAYS IN CHARGE away well and stalked the leader two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. BEST ONE YET was slow into stride, while
dropping well behind the field in the run to the first turn, lost touch in the run down the backside, and wasn't persevered with in the late stages.
