NATIVE VALLEY dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, shook clear, drifted to the six path at the top of the stretch and drew off under brisk
handling. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS dueled with the winner two wide into the turn, swung wide and finished clear for second in the middle of the racetrack.
STREET OF JEWELS stalked the pace into the stretch, swung widest of all, angled back into the seven path then faded. YARMA D' BOSS had good early
speed three wide and lacked the needed response. POST CODE ENVY trailed.

ANGEL'S ENTRY stalked the pace four then three wide, took command on the far turn then widened the balance of the trip under a strong hand ride to win
as much the best. ROJO TORO pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, dropped back then came on again two wide through the stretch to
get up for second. PRACTICAL MAN got out on the first turn causing his saddle to slip, prompted the pace two wide into the far turn then faded.
INSACIABLE PRINCE failed to menace. KRAZY HAWK was no factor. DIAMOND MONEY broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the second turn
then was used up.

LITTLE BIRD FLASH saved ground into the second turn, shifted three wide, engage the leader before the furlong marker, matched stride the balance of the
trip and proved best by the narrowest of margins. BLAZING ZENNA stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage, battled to the
wire inside the winner and just failed in a game effort. ESTILO ELEGANTE pressed the pace two wide and was outfinished. FLAXEN trailed early, offered a
mild bid four wide nearing the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. MRS. ROBINSON away alertly, set the pace for nearly six furlongs then
flattened out. TWO DIAMONDS had brief speed, stopped and was eased to the wire.

TEAM HUCKY stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, drifted in bumping LUCKY STREAK at the top of the lane then drew clear
under brisk handling. RAVEN MOON allowed to settle, the rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch then rallied for second in the six path. LUCKY STREAK
battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, was bumped by the winner then outfinished. MANGA MAN found his best stride late outside. JUST TAPIT IN

Footnotes
SLICK SILVER allowed to settle, circled rivals four wide into the stretch, matched strides through the final furlong while drifting out to mid track under left
handed urging and proved best in a game effort. ADANO with the second flight three wide, made the lead at the top of the stretch, dueled with the winner in
the six path and finished second best. VALEROSO away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. YOU
ARE AWESOME vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, loomed boldly two wide past the quarter pole then leveled off. SAY HEY KID was no
factor. PRETTY STORMY pressed the pace two wide past the quarter pole then weakened. DOBBYS SOCK stalked the early pace three wide and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
THEDAYOFTHEGREY broke in front, set the pace under strong restraint through the turn, was shaken up a bit, drew clear and lasted under brisk handling.
U. S. STEEL chased the winner inside, shifted outside that one, drifted to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch giving up ground then came on
again late. REINVESTEDINTEREST stalked the pace three wide and finished with good courage. MAKING ME CRAZY found his best stride late in the eight
path. CUMBERLAND AVENUE went evenly. BISCUITS AND GRITS stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed response. WISE KHOZAN was no
factor. COUNTRY RUCKUS offered a mild bid into the stretch along the inside then came up empty.

through the stretch. FAST CALL away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn then weakened. BIKO failed to menace. SHACK THE LIFE pressed
