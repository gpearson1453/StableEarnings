the final stages. READY PURSUIT dueled early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane, came back for place near the sixteenths pole and held that
position in the final stages. AMERICAN HERO raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane,
altered around foe nearing the sixteenths pole and just missed place in the final stages. MALIBU TIME was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early on,
was in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. STOCKPILER was never a threat, avoided foe late in the stretch. MAXIMUM
IMPACT was a tad slow at the start and always outrun. GINGRICH chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane,

Footnotes
GULFPORT prompted the pace two wide, vied entering the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong under hand
urging. MATARO set the pace inside of a pressing GULFPORT, got headed by that foe passing the quarter pole, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and
remained well clear of show. EASY BIG BOY tracked from midpack along the inside, then sustained a rail chase through the lane to grab show from an
outer rival entering the final sixteenth. MACHO VILLA stalked from just off the top pair while in the two to three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace
with those rivals in upper stretch, and lost show to an inner foe a sixteenth from hom. ZAFIRO ANEJO laid at the rear two wide into the turn, and improved
along the rail through the lane. CAPACITY broke a step slowly, trailed the field along the inside, and got outrun. COACH ROGERS tracked in the four path
around the turn, but tired. REIQUIST raced far back in the five path under urging approaching the turn, and made little impact. DUPLANTIS laid off of the
pace two wide, and faded.

Footnotes
SEAU vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then only inside of ESPIONAGE turning for home, drifted out to the four path entering the lane before
an outer TRAPPE VALLEY joined the fray in upper stretch, dueled while drifted outwardly into those foes in midstretch, but held gamely through the final
furlong. TRAPPE VALLEY stalked two wide early on, then from the four path in pursuit of the leading trio into the turn, ranged up to the top pair while shifting
to the six path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel, battled with SEAU through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, but was
turned away. FIRERY TALE broke a beat slowly at the start, saved ground off of the pace tipped two wide entering the lane, chased the outer trio of leaders
into the final furlong, and surpassed a tiring rival for show entering the final sixteenth. ESPIONAGE vied for the lead three wide around the turn, got floated
to the five path entering the lane, sparred between horses in upper stretch as an outer TRAPPE VALLEY produced a bid, but yielded in tight quarters
between those foes leaving the furlong grounds. RYE HUMOR broke a step slowly, trailed along the inside around the turn, shifted three wide and between
horses in upper stretch, and stayed on. HIDDEN PROMISE laid off of the pace three wide, came into the lane in the five path, and tired. SUBDUED was
hustled for early position after breaking flat-footedly, chased the leading trio from the two path, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.
MASON A. P. took the turn in the three to four path while far back, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. DRENA'S STAR vied
for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SISTER ANNIE showed the way uncontested in the two path around the turn, got set down in upper stretch as an inner TILTINGATWINDMILLS pursued,
dueled gamely with that bidding foe through the final furlong, and held firm. TILTINGATWINDMILLS trailed, saved ground while advancing around the turn,
took aim inside of the clear leader in upper stretch, bid leaving the furlong grounds, dueled through the late stages, but was kept at bay. SARIAH SARIAH
stalked in the three path as the clear leader's closest pursuer around the turn, but faded on her left lead through the lane, but saved show late. KIMBERLEY
DREAM tracked in the two path, but was outmoved by an inner foe at the three furlong pole, and made little impact thereafter. GIANNA'S GIFT stalked while
forwardly placed outside of foes early on, chased the clear leader from the four path into the turn, but faded around the bend.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN DISTRICT lagged well behind the field into the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes with a good kick in the final
furlong, and drove past the clear leader in the closing stages. SUPREMACY dueled for the lead two wide, cleared off at the three furlong pole, maintained a
clear margin well into the final furlong, but was reeled in late. CANDY TYCOON stalked inside of foes while in the two path, moved between horses into the
turn, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, but was outkicked for place approaching the final sixteenth. DOUBLY BLESSED chased three wide
around the turn, but tired. WEYBURN stumbled at the start, tracked in the four path and outside of foes around the turn, but faded turning for home. BUCK
MOON vied for the lead along the inside, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole, and was eased entering the lane.
