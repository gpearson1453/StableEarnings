MUNNINGS was off slowly, then was hard to hold on the first turn and chased the pace four wide entering the backstretch, then weakened. HE CAME

NAIL POLISH was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead three wide by the half mile marker, made a bid in hand to shake clear leaving the turn and then
was given a left handed pop with the crop and drew off in the furlong grounds to prove much the best while being geared down late. SPUNKY ZOEY tracked
the early pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn, proved to be no match to the winner while clearly second best. AUTOMATED TELLER broke
outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, then advanced four wide on the turn and imp0roved position late while besting the rest. ASUE dueled for the lead
on the inside and weakened in the drive. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN tracked the pace and was on the inside on the turn and weakened. CEETA was
bumped and squeezed back at the start, not a factor.

hardly any urging and drew off easily to crush foes. SIMPLE JUSTICE was allowed to settle early, then raced three wide on the turn and came four wide into
the drive and proved to be no match to the winner, second best. SAW set the pace while clear and on the inside and was headed on the far turn and tired,
held show award. RIPPA was reserved on the inside, swung out four wide and had no rally. IVY was reserved early three wide and came five wide into the
