Footnotes
THE CHAMPS KID broke readily to race in touch with the first flight between foes, was rated just off those rivals after the opening furlong, tipped out three
wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance in tandem with a rival, angled to the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch, then edged
forward to a narrow advantage in time under firm encouragement. SUMMER FIREFLYS, reserved along the inside dropping off the second flight, saved
ground on the turn gradually drawing into contention, tipped out three wide splitting rivals racing through the stretch and continued willingly in that path to
challenge for command nearing the wire while only second best. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn, edged forward while shifting a bit off the inside racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but couldn't contain the top pair.
VOODOO FIRE settled last racing to the turn, swung outside foes to race five wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. CLARE CRESCENT
tracked off the first flight three wide in early stages, was prompted to advance on the turn while being fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and gave way.
CHARLIES MISSILE prompted the pace three deep in the opening furlong, shifted inwards racing into the turn to force the issue outside a rival but gave way
into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MILTONTOWN tracked the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, steadily advanced on that foe through the turn to challenge for command
nearing midstretch and edged forward late under brisk handling. TIME HEIST, off last, tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing four wide into
the turn, then continued willingly in that path in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors while just failing to match the winner's kick. EPIC DRAMA
angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival gaining a narrow advantage after the opening furlong, set the pace just off the inside racing into the bend,
dueled inside the eventual winner past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. HURTS SO GOOD broke sharply, was urged along the inside pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn and faded in the drive. FINDING SILVER settled last near the inside early and never gained contention. JILOTEPEC, unhurried in
the opening furlong, was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes racing into the turn and emptied out into upper stretch.

Footnotes
IMA HARLEY TOO, urged inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command through the far turn into upper
stretch, was headed midstretch but gamely prevailed under firm encouragement. ATOMIC CANDY ducked in at the start crossing the path of DANZ A
REBEL, was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage
late but was outfinished. GAINER angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight between foes, steadied momentarily in close quarters
entering the first turn, couldn't close the gap racing into the stretch but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. I WILL YEAH (IRE) angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but was outkicked for a share
while finishing evenly late. UNBROKEN SONG hopped at the start, was righted to gain a position tracking the leaders three deep in second flight racing to
the backstretch, was urged to make brief progress in that path on the backstretch but faded nearing the lane. WILLTOBELUCKY was settled off the second
flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. DANZ A REBEL, caught in tight quarters, then shuffled back at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NATURAL CHILL, away sharply, tipped off the rail in early stages dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, turned back foes nearing
upper stretch, then held the late challenge of RUBY'S RED DEVIL to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter, slow to gather stride, settled last
racing well off the leaders to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch steadily gathering momentum and was going well late to just miss.
HOLDENTIGHT, in touch with the leaders three wide early, shifted inwards nearing the stretch to press the pacesetter to midstretch but flattened out late.
PASSTHECAT tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly into the lane. OVERSEAS LETTER was urged between foes
prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch. REESE C tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages
but soon dropped out. SING N SPURS angled to the rail tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing to the turn and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT was rated outside foes from well out of striking distance in the opening half, commenced a steady advance in the three path racing
into the far turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm
encouragement. JEWEL AZUL angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling nearing
the far turn while tipping off the inside, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. FOXGLOVE
tracked just off the second flight along the inside under rating in the opening half, shifted out three wide entering the far turn to challenge for command
midway through the bend, dueled for command in that path past midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. PINK CHANNEL, reserved
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards to save ground on the far turn, then shifted out four wide in the stretch to improve
position between foes to the end. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT was settled along the inside racing to the far turn, angled outside foes to race five wide
midstretch but continued to gain position to the end. SWEETNESS TO tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally.
ROZEY CHEEKS, forwardly placed along the inside tracking the pacesetter, tipped out midway through the backstretch to press the issue between foes,
continued to resist a rival's challenge on the far turn into the stretch but gave out late. CREATING MEMORIES settled into stride near the inside racing to
the backstretch and continued evenly to late stages. MOM'S PASS proved no factor. FROST WARRIOR, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking the
pacesetter in the opening quarter, moved to make a brief bid three deep, then between foes racing through the far turn but came up empty in the drive.
TOUR FOR GOLD sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn and gave out abruptly after a half.

EXXEL attended the pace under light reserve racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, was urged to make a steady advance challenging the
pacesetter in that path nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. GIVE EM HECK BECK was urged
between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid
nearing midstretch but proved only second best. QUANTUM LEAP, reserved off the first flight off the inside racing to the turn, angled five wide in upper
stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. CITRUS BAY, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, faded
into upper stretch. BRASKA was settled outside foes racing last to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. CHICKEN TRUCK broke readily, prompted the
pacesetter three wide between foes racing to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
COTTONCANDYMARTINI, off a step behind the leaders, was prompted to contention along the rail, pulled a bit nearing the turn, tipped out midway through
the turn while being prompted in pursuit of the leader, then produced a stout rally racing through the stretch to edge CASEY'S LAW in time. The latter, off a
step behind the leaders, switched out three deep early while being urged in pursuit of the leaders, forged clear racing into the turn while shifting to the
inside, held sway on a commanding margin to the stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY, a bit outpaced in early stages, saved ground
to the stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. GLASSATO was urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside in the opening stages,
had no response when headed entering the turn and gave way nearing the lane. NEW DICE was urged prompting the pace outside a rival, was taken up
avoiding tight quarters entering the bend and had no further response. NACHO S switched out four wide in early stages while being prompted to brief
contention and emptied out racing into the turn.
