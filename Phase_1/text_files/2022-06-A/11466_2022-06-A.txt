Footnotes
WINDSOR ACADEMY broke with the leaders, settled behind the pace while saving ground onto and up the backstretch, called on for some run far turn
while moving out, steady gain on the leader into and through upper stretch, wore that foe down from the outside under steady handling. MONITOR MILLS
with the early pace between foes, shook clear before a quarter, extended that advantage second turn, responded when confronted by the winner nearing
the furlong grounds and gave ground grudgingly to that rival while far clear of the others. MARVINS GOLD vied three wide first turn, chased the runner up
while off the inside the middle half, had little left for the drive, remained clear for the third spot. PLAY MASTER saved ground to no avail. MORO PHAROAH
last away, trailed, never menaced. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
STANG IT away in good order, cleared before a quarter, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn, remained clear through the lane in holding
the runner up at bay. KASEN'S SISTER broke back, moved closer three wide into the turn, chased the winner into the lane still off the inside, slowly getting
to that one late. BLUE RIDGE HEAT in mid pack while three wide, stalled a bit in losing a position or two into the lane, roused when straightened for home,
late push to be up for the show in the final strides. QUICK HEAT forward early inside, fell back to race in the second flight through the turn, continued to
save ground and hold position into the lane, had little for the top two late, nipped in the final strides for the show. PRAYERS SAVED also in the second
group, between foes through the turn, also lacked a closing punch in the late going. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH behind traffic in trailing into the turn, continued to
race inside into the stretch, made little impact to the wire. BOSSY'S TROUBLE four wide when with the main body through the turn, tired while drifting in
nearing midstretch. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
PACIFICISLANDTIME stalked the early leader off the inside and in hand, pressed that rival from the outside up the backstretch, dueled through the second
turn and into upper stretch, pulled away late under firm handling. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN tucked in from the four path early first turn to save some ground
while advancing to a forward position, remained within striking distance the middle half mile just off the inside, could not get to the winner in the late going
while proving determined for the place. DOUBLE ON THE RED broke back, raced back and in hand along the inside early, moved out then back to the rail
before a half, improved position while along the rail second turn and into the stretch, encountered traffic along the rail past the furlong marker, altered course
to the outside for room, outkicked for the second spot. LUCK OF THE STARS broke on top, showed the way inside, responded when challenged by the
winner second turn, proved stubborn until late while remaining inside. RISKTAKER forwardly placed early, fell back after a half to trail, along the inside into
the lane to improve position slightly, went evenly the final furlong in lacking a closing punch. JAYS HOLIDAY off slowly, trailed early as a result, lodged a
mild middle move four to five wide second turn, flattened out and had little left late. R T'S IRON MAN void of speed, remained back while three wide, had
nothing for the stretch run.

Footnotes
POSEIDON WRATH five wide into the first turn, moved closer while remaining outside before a half, ranged up in the three path to challenge late in the final
turn, took over into the lane, showed the way past the furlong marker, drifted out slightly, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. SMOKY TOPAZ
with the early pace into the first turn, fell back before a quarter, raced reserved up the backstretch, advanced along the rail second turn, steadied behind a
tiring front runner when straightened for home, moved out then back to the inside to lodge a rail bid late, denied. BOURBON ST TAPPIN lacked early foot
inside, moved out, asked along far turn, came four wide into the lane, advanced closest to the winner a furlong out, could not sustain that advance, narrowly
lasted for the show spot. GETCHA forwardly placed early, remained within striking distance along the inside into the far turn, steadied when losing action in
tight quarters soon after, reground, steered out and was also four wide turning for home, late interest to be coming in the final strides. MY BOOK last away,
trailed early, continued back second turn off the inside, improved position through some traffic stretch without posing a serious threat. MONZZA broke up
front, spurted clear in the first turn before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch and into the final turn, headed late in that bend then steadily
weakened through the stretch inside. HENNING chased the pace four almost six furlongs and also faltered when the real running began at the head of the
lane. MY TY FU PEG was never involved in trailing home.

G'S SQUEEZE in the second flight outside, four wide turning for home, challenged well out in the strip nearing the furlong marker, edged clear under firm
handling. DIXIE LADY broke on top, dueled up front inside entering the turn, continued to alternate through the bend, held the advantage past midstretch,
gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, well clear for the second spot. DUEFORADATE forwardly placed early while between the two leaders, fell back
off that pair before a quarter, remained in the two path through the turn and into the stretch, no match for the top pair, comfortably clear of the others. LADY
HOPPER dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternated up front through the turn, first to blink, weakened down the lane. VELVET ISLE back off
the pace and the inside, lacked a closing response. ISOLATION fractious loading, fell back after the start and failed to menace along the inside.

Footnotes
SUFFRAGETTE unhurried early out of the chute, raced in the second flight between horses into the turn, called on for some run midway on the bend, came
four wide for the drive, engaged the leader past the furlong marker and wore that rival down under firm handling. ENOUGH HEART cleared out of the chute,
continued to show the way into and through the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner a furlong out then could not keep up while holding sway for the
place. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE void of speed, emerged from between horses late in the turn, rallied three wide and was getting to the runner up late. FLAT
ROSE in the second flight while in the two path, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing kick. MAC LEGACY broke out, fell back to trail and
made little impact while picking off a couple of tiring rivals. BABY MAYBE last away, raced back while well wide up the backstretch, four wide into the turn,
lacked a rally when called on for the drive. KIKI KAT bothered slightly at the start, moved up to chase the runner up for a half then gave way in the turn.
HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

SWEET TEMPERAMENT broke three wide with the leaders, dueled in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, disposed of that foe midway on the
bend, repelled a brief bid from the outside from a second foe into the lane, kicked well clear under intermittent urging. SPLENDA GAIL fell back to trail after
the start, moved out to be four wide through most of the turn, set down into the lane, rallied willingly down the middle of the strip to be clear for the place, no
threat to the winner. FLASHY MEG back off the early pace, came in the two path for the drive, improved upper stretch, closest to the winner inside the
furlong grounds, also was not match for that one, could not contain the runner up. LA TRESS GRAY in the flight outside, ranged up outside the winner to
lodge a brief bid three wide into the lane, began to weaken soon after. DEBBIES PASSAGE flashed brief speed along the inside, fell back to race in the
second flight turn and then came up empty for the drive. LILLIE DELL dueled inside the winner for just over a quarter and stopped. QUARTER MILE

Footnotes
LOCO LUCY broke alertly, set or forced the issue up the backstretch off the inside, dueled two path through the turn, extended that advantage past the
furlong marker then kicked strongly clear to the wire. SCRAPPY also away well, set or forced the pace four almost five furlongs inside the winner, proved no
match late, clear of the rest. CUSTOM GUITAR popped stall doors while loading, broke with the main body, raced outside up the backstretch, came five
wide out of the turn, finished clear of the others while not a threat to the top two. GRACE'S VISION in the second flight off the inside, lacked a closing
response in going evenly through the lane. CUPIE CUTIE went evenly while racing four wide throughout. LUCCA'S LILYBY lacked speed off the inside,
failed to menace. ST. MONICA broke back and was also never a threat. SABERFIGHT last to leave, trailed most of the way to be never close. SHEZA
SHERIF raced briefly forward, steady retreat before a half.
