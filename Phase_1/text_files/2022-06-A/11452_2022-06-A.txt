MY INSPIRATION tracked along the three path, stayed on that path on the last turn, collared the leader in gear at the top of the lane and widened to a
lengthy score while wrapping up late. V PATTERN in hand along the rail up the backstretch, began to gain on the last turn, eased out and finished well.
NAPOLEON COMPLEX Broke slow, unhurried along the three path up the backstretch, gained some on the last turn, lodged a bid outside, drifted in leaving
the furlong marker bothering MERCEDES JOE and then outran that one to the wire for a share. MERCEDES JOE well placed along the two path up the
backstretch, three path on the last turn, checked at the top of the lane, was bothered leaving the furlong marker, took up and then failed to gain. MONTEGO
BAY CIRCLE broke slow, four wide into the backstretch, three path on the last turn, was outrun. COSMIC COWBOY showed little. QUICK HIT set the pace
along the rail to the lane and then had nothing left. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in the disqualification of NAPOLEON
COMPLEX from third to fourth for bothering MERCEDES JOE at the furlong marker.
