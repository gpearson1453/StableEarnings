WORLD GONE WILD stalked from the three path, loomed tree wide rounding the turn, hooked up with Midtown Rose for top honors while floating into the
four path for the stretch run, and just got up in closing stages. MIDTOWN ROSE set the pace, was hustled when headed inside around the turn, tipped out
to the three path in upper stretch, and was game. ESCAPE FUND chased inside, was coaxed inside around the turn, and ran on for show. LADY JEAN
bobbled at the start, trailed and was never a factor. CARDI G pressed while two wide, but backed out around the turn.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) set the pace, was coaxed in the two path in upper stretch, and kicked away. TROUBLE COFFEE stalked from the inside, was three
wide upper coming into the stretch, drifted out to the nine path passing the eighth pole, and ran on. RATIFY bobbled at the start and trailed, saved ground
rounding the far turn, and improved for show. UNLEVERAGED rated while two wide, made progress while four wide around the far turn, tipped five wide into
the stretch but got floated into the ten path by TROUBLE COFFEE to miss minor rewards. OTHER THINGS EQUAL prompted the pace while two wide, was
cued while two wide around the far turn, but had no response. MASTER OF WAR tracked while three wide, was four wide into the stretch, but was empty.
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TROUBLE COFFEE FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM BEHIND Unleveraged, FOR CONTINUING TO DRIFT OUT
ON HIM IN THE STRETCH WHICH IMPEDED THE HORSE FROM A FAIR CHANCE.

NO SABE NADA set the pace inside, was driven along the three path coming into the stretch, and held on gamely. HERO TIGER pressed from the two
path, was coaxed while tipping out to the four path to challenge in upper stretch, but was repelled. CHIEF RON stalked inside, saved ground while ridden
inside around the far turn, but was even in the stretch. UNDER THE RADAR trailed and was far back early, was driven while two wide rounding the far turn,
floated into the five path at the top of the lane, but was no threat. SEANY P tracked while two wide, drifted out to the four path coming into the stretch, but
flattened. PAPA JIMMY was well back and never a factor.
