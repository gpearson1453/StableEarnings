Footnotes
PROOF OF REALITY was hustled leaving the break and was forwardly placed into the turn, advanced on the pacesetter approaching the quarter pole,
overtook THECHIEFHASTRICKS in upper stretch and drew clear in the end. LOUIE ZAMPERINI chased the pace from a three wide path through the turn,
was outkicked in the drive and held safely for second. RAY OF THE SEA bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit green into the turn, came
two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, continued to be a bit hard to place through the stretch but offered a mild late rally and was well clear for
third. LAGO DI BRACIANO lacked early speed, came outside of rivals on the turn, passed tiring rivals in the drive and finished evenly.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS was fractious in the starting gate, was hustled leaving the break, set the pace through the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and
faded. QUEEN'S MARQUE chased the pace from an inside path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER was unhurried in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run, made a rail rally on the second turn, confronted SACRED BEAUTY
nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that rival to the wire and won the nod to prevail. SACRED BEAUTY was hustled leaving the break and cleared the field
into the first turn, was well handled while setting moderate fractions to the second turn, was confronted by SKY MAKER nearing the furlong marker, dueled
with the winner to the wire and was bested in the final yards, while well clear of the rest for second. SPARKA (IRE) settled just off of the early pace,
advanced on the backstretch run, came outside of rivals to be four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a late rally in
the drive but was clear for third in the end. REMEMBER SUE was forwardly placed into the first turn, gained ground on the backstretch run, came three wide
along the second turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. IRISH WAHINE stalked the pace from the midflight while saving ground,
advanced on the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and gave way late. SUE ETTAS GHOST was allowed to settle, came three wide into the
backstretch run, maintained that path into the second turn and did not mount a late bid.

Footnotes
BIG DIFFERENCE broke alertly and was sent to the front, set solid fractions while pressed through the turn, edged away from the pressing rival in
mid-stretch, was confronted by the runner-up in deep stretch and determinedly held on to prevail. SEIGE THE DAY chased the early pace to the turn,
advanced while outside of rivals approaching the quarter marker, rallied four wide into the drive, confronted BIG DIFFERENCE inside of the
sixteenth-marker and was denied for the win, while besting the rest. A BIT MUCH showed early speed and pressed the solid pace through the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while holding for third in the end. HAMMER'S KNIGHT chased the solid early pace, gained
ground nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, was outkicked in the drive and just missed for third. GLORY CITIZEN chased the
pace from the rail and lacked a late rally in the stretch run. TEN THOUSAND STEPS was in tight in the early stages while toward the rear, was shuffled
back entering the turn, improved position in upper stretch but was not a factor. OAKDALE ROAD chased the pace to the turn, improved position nearing the
quarter marker but could not sustain that run and tired in the drive. EL CAPRICHO chased the early pace, lost position while three wide nearing the top of
the stretch, lost ground in upper stretch and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MR. MISCHIEF was forwardly placed early on, tracked the quick pace through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch and reeled in GREAT STORY in the
final yards to prevail. GREAT STORY broke sharply and was sent to the front, set quick fractions through the turn, opened to a clear lead inside of the
furlong marker, was confronted and tagged in the final yards by MR. MISCHIEF and was best of the rest. DIAMOND RANGER broke in at the start, was
hustled to attend to the pace to the turn, lost ground on GREAT STORY nearing the top of the lane, could not match strides with the top two and weakened
in the stretch but just held on for third in the end. ANNIE'S CHIEF was squeezed at the start and was slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, advanced
nearing the quarter marker but could not sustain that run and finished evenly in the stretch. TOM'S MOON chased the quick pace from midpack and did not
mount a late rally. MILEYS BLUECAT chased the pace from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch but gave way in the final stages. EL TENAMPA
broke out at the start, squeezed ANNIE'S CHIEF and was off slowly, was void of early speed, lost position in upper stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HER PERFECT VISION broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt mild late
pressure but held safely in the end. OH TRUTHY was hustled to be forwardly placed, tracked the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch to
the winner, closed in the final sixteenth and could not reel in the winner but held for second. R SILVER FLASH chased the early pace from the inside,
advanced in upper stretch, continued that rally in the late stages and just missed for second while securing third. SNOW HILL lost her path at the start and
was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, rallied in traffic through the drive and was gaining in the final sixteenth. PLATONIC was bumped at the start and
steadied in the first furlong, chased from the rear through the turn, swung widest into the drive and improved position in the final stages to challenge for the
minor awards. MIRACLE OF HOPE bumped PLATONIC leaving the break, chased the pace from midpack to the turn, improved position along the turn, was
floated four to five wide nearing the top of the stretch, rallied in the drive but was outfinished in the final stages. SUMMER PUDDING was a bit rank in the
opening stages, gained ground along the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. MINER'S MELODY stalked the early pace, lost
position on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled just off of the early pace, saved all of the ground to the second turn, tipped out leaving the quarter marker, overtook
MIDNIGHT FLOWER leaving the furlong marker and drew clear in the late stages. MIDNIGHT FLOWER was hustled leaving the break and set the fractions,
was well rated to the second turn, was confronted in upper stretch by the winner and was outfinished, while just holding in the end for the place. GETTIN
SIDEWAYS was unhurried in the early going, trailed into the second turn, mounted a two wide bid in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final stages but just
missed for second while securing the show. SHEZAGHOST tracked the early moderate pace, stayed in pursuit into the second turn, lost position in upper
stretch and faltered in the stretch run. LOTSABLING was allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run, continued that run into
upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled off of the pace while racing in midpack, saved all of the ground to the second
turn and did not mount a late rally. MISTY CAT stalked the early pace outside of rivals, gained ground on the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the
quarter pole while three then four wide, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
LIVIN' AT THE BU was forwardly placed into the first turn, saved ground while up close into the second turn, tipped out to go two wide into the drive, closed
in midstretch, confronted the runner-up approaching the sixteenth-marker, wore down RIVIERA SUNRISE and edged clear in the end. RIVIERA SUNRISE
was sent leaving the break, set contested fractions through the backstretch run, shook free along the second turn, was confronted by the winner inside of
the furlong marker and could not hold that rival off and was outfinished, while besting the rest. CHELINA broke slowly and was allowed to settle, trailed
through the second turn run, rallied four wide leaving the bend and could not reel in the top pair but held safely in the end for the show. ICY BREEZE stalked
the pace from the midflight, came three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside along the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. BEA
MISCHIEF was up close to the pace into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch and faltered in the final stages. KID DEELITES took back to settle off of the pace while four wide on the first turn, improved position along the
backstretch run, came three wide while losing position on the far turn and did not mount a late rally. LOCHMARA settled off of the pace while never far back
early on, gained ground from an inside path on the second turn but could not go on with that bid and tired in the drive. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW raced in
midpack in the opening stages, maintained position while two wide into the second turn, was boxed in and lacked room at the top of the stretch and did not
offer a late response. SLUMBERING BEAUTY was hustled leaving the break and contested the early pace, was a bit rank on the first turn, disputed the
pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
PROOF HE RIDES stalked the early pace to the turn, gained ground while two deep nearing the quarter marker, continued to advance in upper stretch,
confronted IKIGAI nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled with that foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail. IKIGAI broke alertly and was sent to the front,
set fast fractions while pressed through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, was confronted by PROOF HE RIDES nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that
bid but was bested in the end while drifting out under firm left-handed urging. INDULGE tracked the pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, was outfinished in the final stages but did get up for third in the end. OUR BOLD PRINCE chased the pace, came three then four wide nearing the
quarter marker, was outkicked in the stretch run but just missed for the show. RUNKERRY was hustled into early contention and disputed the fast pace
through the turn, could not match strides in the drive and tired in the late stages. SONOFAFINCH chased the fast pace outside of rivals and did not mount a
late rally. TABLE FOR TEN bobbled at the start and was off slow, lagged through the turn, showed late interest in the drive but was not a threat.

Footnotes
HANDSOME GARY chased the pace from midpack, improved position while going three then four wide approaching the top of the stretch, vied for the lead
nearing the eighth pole, steadily extended the lead into the final stages and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. THE LITTLE H MAN was off a bit
slowly, chased the quick pace to the turn, advanced nearing the quarter pole while three wide, continued that rally in upper stretch, closed well in the final
stages and could not reel in HANDSOME GARY in the end but held safely for second. HANDR'SDREAM pulled on the rider in the opening stages and was
close to the pace into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch, split rivals nearing the sixteenth-marker and was
outfinished by the top pair, while holding safely for third. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL chased the quick pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker,
re-rallied to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final stages. THEYREMINISCEOVERU quick to begin, settled into a stalking
position outside of EDINBURGH EXPRESS, pressed that one through the turn, took a brief lead but had nothing more to offer in the final furlong. HAY
JUAN lunged at the start, was hustled to engage the pack while nearest to the rail, began a rally passing he half mile marker, angled out a path from the rail
to pass MORE BUBBLY, was still in contention entering the stretch but was unable to sustain the rally. MORE BUBBLY away well and in good position
early, took up sharply approaching the quarter pole when HAY JUAN appeared to take his path and never recovered. COMMAND A PREMIUM was devoid
of early speed, took a four to five wide trip around the turn and was unable to make an impact. EDINBURGH EXPRESS broke sharply, led the field to the
stretch then gave way readily.
