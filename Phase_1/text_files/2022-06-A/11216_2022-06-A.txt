RINGS OF SATURN saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole, but was unable to stay with
the winner late. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN broke out slightly, then angled over to the inside, saved ground and finished in a mile rally. KIND OF GALLANT set
the pace along the inside, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole and weakened. LINCHTOWN Prompted the early pace while racing 3-wide to near the

LAGO DE ORO dueled for the early lead from along the inside, responded when asked to quickly draw clear and won with something left while drifting out
slightly during the drive. IMAROYALFLUSH was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn while saving ground, rallied four-wide into the stretch was
unable to reach the winner but was clearly second best. NUMMY NUM was prominent from the start while racing three-wide and finished in a mild rally.
SALTY DAN was brushed at the start by Andiamo Baum then dueled for the lead from between horses for three furlongs and tired. ANDIAMO BAUM broke
in at the start to brush with Salty Dan then dropped back and was not a factor thereafter. COASTAL WONDER showed brief speed while racing three-wide
and gave way.
