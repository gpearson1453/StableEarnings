Footnotes
ALPINE GHOST dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and maintained his margin to the wire. THAT
KHENNY dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and chased that rival home while drifting out mildly, the best of the rest. VALLEY VISTA chased the leaders on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, offered a mild bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. FROOME (IRE) raced off the pace on the inside
early, saved ground around the turn and made a mild improvement position in late stretch to just miss third. UNION SOLDIER hopped up leaving the gate,
recovered to track the frontrunners in the middle of the pack, navigated the turn from the three path and flattened out in the final furlong. DARE GOES DA
DEVIL trailed the field up the backstretch, improve position slightly while saving ground around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
FEELING DANGEROUS angled three wide into the first turn to get around GOLDENPENCE, tracked the pace set by MANGO TREE around that bend,
engaged the leader three wide into the backstretch, attended outside of GOLDENPENCE as that one took a narrow lead, kicked clear of that foe near the
seven sixteenths, saved ground around the rest of the bend, and maintained command under a mild drive down the lane. IRISH MAJOR was bumped
between horses in the opening strides, took back to the rear, trailed through the first turn and down the back straight, edged closer in the two to three path
on the far turn, rallied in earnest inside into the lane, came out near the sixteenth pole, and kept on willingly to prove clearly second best. MANGO TREE
was sent for pace inside, led into the clubhouse turn, was engaged by GOLDENPENCE and FEELING DANGEROUS into the backstretch, settled back to
track that pair, chased well behind the leading pair in the three path on the turn, was pushed along near the three eighths and edged closer, floated five wide
into the lane, and kept on mildly for show. MAXIMUS IMAGE hung five wide into the first turn, settled back to chased well behind the leading trio, was
pushed along in the four path near the three eighths and took closer order in tandem with MANGO TREE, swung four wide into the lane, chased between
horses through midstretch and flattened out pate. GOLDENPENCE was asked for speed but outsprinted by MANGO TREE into the first turn, tracked the
pace inside of FEELING DANGEROUS, engaged to take the lead into the backstretch, set the pace while prompted by FEELING DANGEROUS to his
outside, was headed near the seven sixteenths, saved ground while chasing the new leader, went to a drive between horses in upper stretch and
weakened. BORA BORA floated four wide into the first turn, settled to chase well behind the leading trio inside of MAXIMUS IMAGE, chased toward the rear
down the backstretch, faded in the five to six path on the far turn and was eased down the lane.

Footnotes
HARD LIKE HOLLY settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight down the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn, began to rally well past
the five sixteenths, swung out approaching the quarter, came into the lane near the center of the track, rallied strongly and got up five strides from the wire.
TANGO CITY prompted the pace outside of REINA DE LA ROSE, headed that foe approaching the quarter pole, drove clear near the three sixteenths, but
was caught five strides from the wire. TILDA tracked the leading pair inside through the first turn, tracked the leading trio down the backstretch, continued in
range in the three path on the far turn, proved no match for TANGO CITY from the three sixteenths, but chased on well enough to hold the show. WANDA
STRONG was reluctant to load, chased outside of TILDA through the clubhouse turn, settled back toward the rear down the backstretch, chased in the four
to five path around the far turn, swung out seven wide into the lane, kept on willingly but was outkicked for the show. LEA'S DREAMER was forced out by
GOSHEN GIRL into the clubhouse turn when that foe bolted, settled near the rear, was briefly keen to chase inside of WANDA STRONG approaching the
half, continued near the rear in the two to three path around the far turn, was in range in upper stretch but lacked the needed kick from the three sixteenths.
REINA DE LA ROSE was keen to the lead, set the pace while prompted by TANGO CITY to her outside, was headed by that foe approaching the quarter,
proved no match from the three sixteenths and weakened inside. GOSHEN GIRL was rank inside early, bolted into the first turn, pulled keenly to attend
outside the leading pair down the backstretch, bolted again into the far turn, pulled even further outside turning into the stretch and was allowed to trail
home.

Footnotes
KITTEN ROCKS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn, split horses to began a bid passing the eighth pole and pulled clear from there. FOOT RUB LOVE raced off the pace on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two and three path, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground down the lane
to just get second. APOLLO U ANYWHERE chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and finished
evenly, just missing the place. I LOVE TO RACE trailed the field in the early going, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn,
switched to the outside in upper stretch and finished well. SHE'S A BIG STAR was held firmly in place by her rider while racing off the pace on the outside in
the opening stages, came around the turn in the two and three path, remained in contention in upper stretch and cut in sharply with a late surge near the
wire. FIRST SQUADRON led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, battled gamely down the lane
and weakened in the final strides.

Footnotes
RIVER FINN took the lead inside into the clubhouse turn, set an uncontested pace, was briefly engaged by TWO COOKIE RULE approaching the half, but
turned that foe away into the lane and held safe under a drive in the lane. TWO COOKIE RULE broke well, tracked the leading pair while a bit keen around
the first turn, joined inside of SHE'S WANDAFUL to track the leader around the far turn, continued to track the pacesetter into the far turn, was urged for a
bid and briefly loomed near the quarter, was turned away while coming into the lane three wide and chased on second best. SUPRISE CAT tracked the
leading pair outside of TWO COOKIE RULE through the first turn, chased the leading trio outside of DELFT BLUE down the backstretch, improved to race in
range between horses in the far turn, proved no match for the top two in the lane but ran on willingly for show. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS settled toward
the rear inside, lost some position after his jockey lost his outer iron approaching the three quarters, reengaged when the rider regained that iron
approaching the half, chased while angling out around the far turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted out, and kept on mildly to prove best of the rest.
DELFT BLUE chased midpack, inched closer into the far turn and attained a tracking position inside around the far turn, but could not keep up with the
leaders in upper stretch and flattened out. SHE'S WANDAFUL bobbled in the opening strides but nonetheless showed early speed, tracked the pacesetter
through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, raced three wide into the far turn, began to flatten out in the five path around the far turn and was no
further threat in the drive. BUBBA CABALLO settled toward the rear outside of ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, continued near the rear in the two path on the
far turn, chased to midstretch and flattened out late. LOCASH settled at the rear, raced in the three path on the far turn, swung out near the center of the
track into the lane, drifted further out under a drive and ultimately lacked the needed rally. SMART TRIAL was wrangled near the rear inside, raced in the
four path toward the rear on the far turn and made no bid in the lane.

CHOCOLATE BUNNY stumbled mildly leaving the gate, was sent to the early lead, showed the way from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the wire. LEE LA DEW trailed the field from the
two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still in last place, began a late rally passing the eighth pole and gained ground from there.
POWERFUL MAN saved ground headed into the first turn, switched to the outside to press the pace entering the backstretch, battled on the outside around
the far turn, and chased the winner home, getting caught for second late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the
pace for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, offered a mild bid between horses in midstretch and flattened out in the
final furlong. IRISH TUFF raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn
and tired on the rail in the lane.

Footnotes
CHEETARA (CHI) broke well, prompted the pace outside of MUSIC CITY STAR, headed that foe near the three eighths while racing in the three path,
floated four wide into the lane, was driven approaching the three sixteenths, quickened well and took command. CHARLIE'S PENNY settled near the rear,
made a circling four-wide rally around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, could not get to the leader but chased on willingly to the finish. SHARP
HERO tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and along the rail on the turn, was urged up the inside into the lane, proved no match for the leading
pair through the final furlong but kept on best of the rest. CHANDANA chased inside of STRATEGIC BIRD down the backstretch, chased behind traffic in
the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and rallied mildly. RACETOTHEFINISH chased outside of CHANDANA down the back straight,
inched up to track the leading pair three wide between horses on the turn, swung six wide into the lane for the drive, and chased on only mildly. MUSIC
CITY STAR broke well and soon led, took prompting from CHEETARA to her outside, was headed by that foe near the three eighths, came two wide into
the lane in range but proved no match for CHEETARA, and weakened between horses. FEELING MISCHIEF settled at the rear, trailed in the five path on
the turn, swung seven wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT was sent between horses, settled back approaching the eleven
sixteenths when MUSIC CITY STAR came in, lost position inside horses from there, flattened in the four path on the turn, was driven inside in the lane and
proved ultimately no threat. STRATEGIC BIRD broke last, settled between horses at the rear of the main pack early, came in on WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY
near the half, weakened in the five path on the turn and had no more when driven in the lane. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY was anxious in the gate, checked
near the eleven sixteenths when DANCING AT MIDNIGHT settled back just in front of her, raced at the inside of the rear of the main pack after that, was
bumped by STRATEGIC BIRD near the half when that foe came in, raced in the four path on the turn, raced into the lane between horses and came up
empty.

Footnotes
LONG TALL WOMAN pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held off a late closer to the wire. STORMY EMPIRE raced off the pace between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a late bid with a
furlong to go and gained ground to the finish. SUMMER BELLE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, stalked the leader up the backstretch, cut in and raced in
tight quarters, steadying slightly headed into the turn, saved ground from there and finished evenly. STACY ATTACK raced off the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path, swung wide entering the stretch, gained mild ground in the lane and was outkicked.
STARSOVERPARADISE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong. QUILTING PARTY raced
inside up the backstretch, ran into traffic and was forced to check hard on the turn, raced in the two path from there and was not a threat. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN. AFTER REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE, THE STEAWARDS DISQUALIFED THE TWO
HORSE, SUMMER BELLE AND PLACED HER LAST FOR INTERFERENCE WITH THE THREE HORSE, QUILTING PARTY.

DEWY'S HIT was keen to the lead, set an uncontested pace while headstrong, was confronted by FAST ONE just to his outside near the seven sixteenths,
turned him away near the three eighths while racing in the two path, drove clear in upper stretch and held well clear to the finish. MALIGATOR settled
toward the rear, began to get going into the far turn, made a circling rally in the five to six path around the bend, floated eight wide into the lane, and ran on
with good interest to the wire while drifting in late. HANNITY tracked the leading pair, inched up inside of FAST ONE approaching the half, was relegated
back to chase the leading pair into the far turn, saved ground around that bend, raced inside foes into the lane, jumped just past the three sixteenths but did
not appear to lose significant momentum, and kept on between horses for the show. TALLESTOFTHETALL chased midfield inside of EMOJI GUY, waited
near the rear of the main group, saved ground around the far turn, was urged near the five sixteenths, improved inside in upper stretch, kept on willingly to
the finish but missed the show. WILLING TO SPEED tracked the leading pair outside of HANNITY, chased behind the tracking flight into the far turn, raced
in the three to four path between horses around the far turn, was driven three wide into the lane, chased on between horses to the finish but was ultimately
outkicked. HONEST TO GOODNESS settled near the rear, continued near the rear in the two to three path on the far turn, swung six wide to the lane, tried
to split horses near the three sixteenths but had to wait for enough room to open up between those foes, got through near the furlong mark, but was
outfinished in the final furlong. EMOJI GUY chased outside of TALLESTOFTHETALL through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased in the
four to five path on the five turn, was urged approaching the quarter, swung seven wide into the lane, raced in range to midstretch, and flattened out late.
FAST ONE tracked the leader around the clubhouse turn, chased well behind the leader down the back straight, took closer order approaching the far turn,
bid outside the leader near the seven sixteenths, was rebuffed at the three eighths, chased the leader around the rest of the turn, was driven in the lane,
and emptied out between horses. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN was taken to the rear, trailed well behind the field, saved ground through the far turn and
lacked the needed rally in the lane.
