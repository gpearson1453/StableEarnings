SOUTHERN RULES well rated mounted a bid racing four deep on the far turn looming outside the leader from mid track in upper stretch surging to get up
on the wire. ADMIRE pressed clear on the far turn widening a bit in upper stretch digging in from the three path being hooked late missing on the wire.
LIGHTNING FLASH slow early lagged to upper stretch angling in there from mid track finishing evenly to best the others. SLICK AS ICE slow early was
never involved. VALLEY WILDCAT set the pace wilting on the far turn. CAROLINA ISLAND gave a prompted middle move chasing on the far turn before
giving way in upper stretch.
