NARCISSISTIC was reserved early, came six wide into the lane, finished with interest to be along for the show award. VICTORY TOWN was off a beat
slow, then went up between rivals to set the early pace while being pressured by GRANSON, moved to the inside entering the far turn, then weakened in
the drive. TOURIST'S DREAM was settled early and was in between rivals on the turn, then passed the tiring rivals in the stretch. GRANDSON pressed the
pace and was two wide on the turn, came three wide into then lane, then was bumped soundly by the quarter pole by the winner, then was forced into

Footnotes
BANFF stalked inside down the backstretch, made a middle move to get a good position entering the final turn, waited for room and finished strongly to get
the win. JUST START ME UP showed speed to set the pace, repelled an early challenge entering the final turn and fought gamely to the wire but could not
hold off the winner. OCTOBER FROST trailed early while saving ground, waited for a path entering the stretch and angled out to rally for third. READY
HERO was rated in mid pack, then asked around the final turn, loomed up entering the stretch and evened out. ENGLISH CLASSIC was near the rear early
on, roused and angled out while 7 wide on the final turn and flattened out. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was five wide entering the first turn, was stalking while
four wide on the final turn and levelled off. LIARS CLUB was mid pack down the backside while saving ground throughout and had no finishing kick.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD set the early pace on the inside, turned back bids on the turn and drew clear leaving the turn, then drew out in the furlong grounds to
prove much the best under a drive, plenty of speed left to spare. STRIKING MOON chased the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and finished
well to be clearly second best, no match to the winner. HALLIE'S HERO stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, came four wide into
the lane but flattened out, bested rest. BEN LOMOND chased the pace and raced on the inside on the turn and had no rally while saving ground. BAY OF
RUM prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. PERLARANA was reserved early, came five wide into
the lane and passed the tiring rivals. DANI'S VICTORY was reserved early on the inside and lacked a rally. TALL WATER broke in the air at the start, then
failed to menace. STREET LEGAL was settled four wide by the three eighths and dropped back.

Footnotes
MASSETO (GB) was away alertly, stalked the pacesetter through the turn and finished strong the final eighth. THERE'S NO JOE broke sharp and was well
rated but could not hold off the winner through the run down the stretch. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) stalked while in the four path on the turn and closed well
just missing the place award. DESOLATOR was rated at the back of the pack early on and closed willingly to grab a minor placing. PERFECT CRIME was
in between horses and made a belated run through the stretch. HOLYFIELD was mid pack early, rallied mildly entering the stretch and evened out.
FINALIST was in tight on the turn and never reached contention. TOUR OF DUTY stalked on the turn, loomed into contention turning for home and was
empty. DANFUSI was steadied briefly while inside going into the turn and failed to respond. WHERE'S NEAL was well back early and took an awkward step
nearing the 1/2 mile pole and was not factor after that. EAGLE CHIEF was slow to get in stride and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PUGIN was well rated along the inside to the quarter pole, swung out five wide leaving the turn, closed well to edge away late under a drive. BEYOND MY
DREAMS was allowed to settle early, was three wide by the quarter pole, angled in for racing room by the sixteenth marker, rallied well to get the place
award. WILD RIVER WOLF was rated early between rivals, then shifted out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn to vie for command by the furlong
marker, but it was not enough while getting the nod for the show award. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, vied for command nearing the furlong marker but flattened out late, missed show award. COO BIRD chased the pace and was three to four
wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no kick. DR CHAPPELL set the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. COPINSAY lacked a
serious rally. CONQUER HIM had no rally. QUANTUM VELOCITY was allowed to settle early and weakened. MURCIELAGO was not a factor. MANE
SOCIETY was four wide early and stopped.

Footnotes
GOOGLY EYES rated well while saving ground throughout, split horses through the stretch and was inching away in the final stages. GAYELETTE was up
on the pace, repelled the early speed challenge and fought gamely but could not hold of the winner in the final sixteenth. LIVIN ON LUV took a stalking
position behind the two front runners and closed willingly to capture third. NOW IS A BREEZE was allowed to settle early on, rallied mildly to get a minor
share. TWISTER ALERT was bumped at the break by outside foe, rallied while widest down the stretch and levelled out. WARWOMAN loomed into
contention entering the stretch but was one paced the final eighth. HUSHEMUP broke inwards at the start bumping rival, was mid pack throughout and
offered little in the stretch. SILVER BULLET LADY was in a pace duel early and stopped badly through the stretch. MAKES SENSE TO ME was slow in
stride, trailed early and passed a tiring foe. AUTUMN STROLL was never in contention.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF DREW was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, was well handled and sent down leaving the turn and then was kept to left
handed crop urging to prove much the best. IL MALOCCHIO stalked the winner two to three wide and kept on willingly to hold on to the place award.
MUNNYFOR RO was reserved early on the inside, advanced two wide on the far turn, then finished well on the inside but needed more. ALYDIVA was
rated along two wide, then was two to three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the drive and had no punch in the drive. SKYGAZE was three wide into
the first turn, then settled three wide and was three to four wide on the turn while advancing, came five wide into the drive and had no late kick. BROADWAY
LADY was off a step slow, then was hard held on the inside, then advanced ton the turn and was two wide by the quarter pole, offered a belated rally.
NOVEMBER FOG was settled early while three wide, then was three to four wide on the far turn and came six wide into the lane and had no rally. BARKIN
was taken back early to trail the field, worked way down to the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. SILENT CAUSEWAY was reserved early
between rivals and then was not a threat. STAND FOR THE FLAG chased the pace on the inside and stopped. No head on replay was showed so notes are
based on pan shot only.

Footnotes
TURNED ASIDE was away alertly, then took back behind the leaders and waited for room on the turn, split horses down the stretch at the eighth pole, and
got up in the final strides. ROCKCREST broke sharp and gained the lead, shrugged off the pace challenger at the eighth pole but could not hold off the late
charge by the winner. ELEKTRONIC showed speed on the rail while battling for the lead, ran game in the stretch and weakened the final part to be third.
FORESTER'S FORTUNE rated mid pack between horses early, was asked at the quarter pole, loomed into contention turning for home and levelled out the
final sixteenth. REAL MONEY broke well, was roused outside through the turn and evened out in the stretch. SAIL AT SUNRISE was behind in the
beginning but closed willingly through the lane. NEVAEH'S DREAM was mid pack saving ground and offered little down the stretch. STRIKE SILVER was
near the rear and never factored. FIELDER was allowed to settle inside early and could not pick up horses down the lane.

Footnotes
SISTER SEAGULL was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn, shifted to the outside by the quarter pole, came four wide into the
drive and closed full of run, hit the front and drew away in the final seventy yards to prove best, driving. CURLIN CANDY set the pace on the inside and then
was challenged by LADY BREW leaving the turn, dug in gamely and was put to a long drive held off that rival but could hold off the winner late, game effort.
LADY BREW tracked the early pace and made a two wide bid leaving the far turn to loom boldly, but hung in the drive, bested rest. FIANNAS SONG was
allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and had no rally. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL tracked the pace on the inside and weakened.
IT'S ON YOU was four wide into the first turn, settled back three wide on the backstretch, was roused at the three eighths marker, came four wide into the
drive and lacked a rally. BESSIE prompted the pace three wide and tired. CRACKLE CANDY was fractious in the gate , settled three wide early and
stopped.

angled out six wide leaving the quarter pole, then was given a right handed pop with the crop, switched to the left hand by the furlong marker and drew off in
the furlong grounds to prove much the best. GRACE ON THE GREEN was bumped soundly at the start, settled early and was two to three wide on the turn,
then was in traffic and lacked room leaving the quarter pole, angled out seven wide by the three sixteenths, rallied well to be second best. BIG GINGER set
the pace on the inside and was headed by the three eighths marker, battled gamely to the furlong marker and then yielded in the furlong grounds while
staying on for the show award. ZEN (IRE) was settled back early and was on the inside on the turn, then offered a belated rally on the inside to just miss the
show award. LOADED SECRET chased the pace and was on the inside on the turn, tipped out two wide in the drive and had no kick. JAB chased the early
pace and made a five wide bid in the stretch but flattened out the final furlong. FEW REGRETS tracked the early pace and made a mild bid four wide on the
turn and then was empty in the drive. MILWAUKEE BAY was sandwiched and had to checked at the start, trailed early, was three wide by the quarter pole,
then was blocked nearing the furlong marker, then had a belated rally between horses in traffic, rough trip. SONET'S NAME prompted the early pace and
then made a bid to duel for command three wide and then weakened in the drive. HI HONEY chased the pace five to six wide and weakened.
DONNARUMMA raced between rivals early and then dropped back.
