Footnotes
BIG BOBBY BROWN chased the leaders between horses around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bold
bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch and narrowly held off a late closer to the wire. MORE ICE raced in the
two path at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole
and gained ground steadily to the wire but ran out of room. PICKING ROSES hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, swung out to the three and four path for the run around the far turn and gained ground mildly late. SPACE MOUNTAIN saved
ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly while
never threatening. LOVETHATCAUSE pressed the pace from the two path through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to duel on the outside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. EBRIO showed the way while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on
the inside up the backstretch, gave way nearing the quarter pole and tired further in the stretch.

OURS AND THEIRS bumped with the horse to either side leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,

stretch to just miss, the best of the rest. ISN'T IT TIME bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, led the way up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and weakened late. CUTE DINERO QUEEN bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to press the pace between horses
