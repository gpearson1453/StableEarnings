Footnotes
ANDIAMO A FIRENZE broke very fast and shot to the front, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, scooted clear in upper stretch, drew off
under mostly brisk hand-urging to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. MIRACLE MIKE dropped back while urged along, saved
ground through the turn and finished willingly for the place. DANSEUR D'ORO showed good early speed, chased the pace on the outside then in the three
path on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, was turned back by the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but
was clear for the show. NEW YORK PANTHER hit the outside of the gate at the start then lost his footing, was urged along near the back, moved from the
two path to the three path early on the turn, continued three wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. M. C. DOUBLE R was hard
ridden on the outside in third position, rounded the turn in the four path, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. LADY MINE was last to commence,
raced on the outside while ridden along, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. WEYHILL FARM RD. was urged along towards the rear, dropped
from the three path to the two path early on the turn, continued in the two path into the stretch and was no factor. N Y RIESLING was urged along near the
back, went five then six wide around the turn and also was no factor.

Footnotes
JASMINESQUE coaxed from the gate, vied inside a pair early on before taking narrow command five furlongs out and dueling with WEEKEND FUN to her
outside, into the turn, tipped to the two path through that bend coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got headed for the front and spun just off the
inside at the quarter pole, rallied to take back command nearing the eighth pole and edged away to the finish kept to task. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH vied
briefly from the three path before easing off with nine-sixteenths to go, came again at the seven-sixteenths four wide and stacked outside the top pair
advancing to take command put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch holding narrow command, dug in and yielded the
front near the eighth pole, ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. WEEKEND FUN vied from the two path between foes and then dueled
briefly three wide into the turn before knocking heads once more between rivals when placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. TIZ HER WAY chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch, trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
SCOTT ALAIA was sent hard from the gate, showed the way down the backstretch, raced inside around the turn, was asked when confronted by ALPINE
QUEEN at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch in the two path, repelled the aforementioned foe inside the furlong marker and held under strong
urging. PONCHO SONG dropped well behind the rest of the field, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, swung five wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished well but was too late while clear for the place. ALPINE QUEEN was last to commence then urged
along off the pace, began to advance late on the backstretch, made a strong run in the two path around the turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths,
battled outside of the winner into the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. JACRODRA'S DEVIL was rated in third position, moved out
at the nine-sixteenths pole, was asked in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick then just missed the
show. BIG TONY'S GIRL dropped back under coaxing, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path, moved to the rail late on the bend and
came up empty. CARLY HUSTLE was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. BASTET was hustled from the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MEXICAN WONDER BOY bumped lightly with a foe at the start, moved up quickly to take the lead then sped clear, dictated terms while inside through the
turn, responded well when shaken up some in upper stretch, was given a couple pops of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed
under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. HAPPY FARM chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, swapped back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and secured the place while no match for the winner. DURESS chased
the pace down the backstretch, dropped back nearing the nine-sixteenths then moved out, went three wide around the turn and tired. TROUBLING MOON
bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, was void of speed, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn, was not urged in the stretch and
showed little.

GALT was asked leaving the gate then well placed while coaxed along just off the pace, went two then three wide while in dead aim of the leaders around
the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch while directly behind the runner-up then tipped outside that foe, chased under a drive into the final furlong, gained
into the final sixteenth, was bumped while drawing even late and got up under good handling. HIGHLY RESPECTED pressed the pace on the outside then
in the three path around the turn, gained the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear while set down in the four path into the stretch, drifted out under
a left-handed crop in the final furlong, came out and bumped the winner late and was caught while clear for the place. UNBRIDLED BOMBER was off slow
and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, moved closer while two to three wide around the turn and lacked the needed response
but improved position to get the show. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. VARATTI was hustled from the start then forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide around the turn, dropped back six
wide into the stretch and capitulated. DOMINICAN PIONEER went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside on the turn, lost the
lead just after passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and faded. CATHEDRAL BEACH was hustled from the start, tracked the pace
between foes, dropped back under urging in the four path around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
WICKED FAST broke out at the start bumping GUSSY MAC, tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing tipped to the two
path three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying with good energy to get up in the last jumps and prevail. Q
F SEVENTY FIVE established the front shortly after the start and crossed to show the way in hand along the inside into the first turn, spurted away down the
backstretch to a commanding lead and widened into the far turn, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under growing late threat as his advantage dwindled and was caught in the final strides to the finish. IRWIN (IRE) three then two wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. THIN WHITE DUKE forwardly placed just off the
inside, came under coaxing tucked inside at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was outkicked. TRENDING steadied into the
first turn off heels of a rival when Q F SEVENTY FIVE crossed over forcing the field to bunch up briefly, tracked along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued along the inside into upper stretch and offered up a belated bid. GUSSY MAC (IRE) bumped at the start by WICKED FAST,
who broke outwards, saved ground near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. REGAL SPEAKER chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to
the wire. STARTING OVER chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact.
SHADIZAAR settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and came up
empty. CONQUER THE WORLD saved ground near the rear, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
CAUSIN' MAYHEM was reluctant to load, came away in good order and went straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two
path around the turn, responded well when put to a drive into upper stretch, held a clear lead under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and prevailed
under strong urging. OGLETHORPE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled well off the pace, was urged three then four wide around the
turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased the winner to the wire and missed while closing the gap but was clear for the place. THE PRINCE'S SPUR
raced just off the pace, chased four wide around the turn, pursued the winner with good courage in the stretch but lacked the needed kick while clear for the
place. CLUBBING was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide around the turn and failed to rally. CRIMSON ROCKET tracked the early pace,
made a bid around the five-eighths, chased in the three path through the turn and tired. BALI RIDDIM was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths,
saved ground on the turn and was no factor. PHANTOM JEWEL leaned in then brushed the gate and was off slow, raced at the rear under urging, rounded
the turn in the two path and also was no factor. BASHDAFLASH was hustled from the start then forwardly placed on the outside, came up empty while five
wide leaving the backstretch and retreated.
