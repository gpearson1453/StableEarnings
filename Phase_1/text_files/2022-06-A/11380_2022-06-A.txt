TAPIT'S SPIRIT vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was under pressure from the inside and nearby after straightening in the lane, continued on
under urging near the sixteenth pole, edged clear and held. TALE OF FAME raced in the four to the five path through the turn when never far back, swung
into the lane from the four path and improved for the place spot while not making up ground on the winner. LT. JUNIOR GRADE vied for the lead along the
inside into the turn, continued close up through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, challenged once straightened into the lane then could not gain further
while losing the place spot late. CONTACT TRACING was in the two or three path through the turn and lacked a closing response. JOVA was in the three to
four path through late turn, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing response. BANDIDO DE AMORES was in the two path when never far

Footnotes
NOBRAG JUSTFACT was in the two or three path into the far turn, waited while others swept past in late turn, came into the lane from the three path,
shifted to the four or five path and finished with a determined run. FIREWATER JAKE chased the pace from the three path, bid through mid-turn, cleared
into the lane, continued on a clear lead with an eighth to go then could not hold sway while saving the place spot. COUNTER OFFER was in the three path
through the turns and into the lane and was gaining to the end. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME bid quickly through the four path on the far turn, reached a serious
contender into late turn then flattened. THRU THE VINE was in the two path through the turns when unhurried, came into the lane from the five path and
never was a factor. EVIL EYE set the early pace while two wide, pressed the pace two wide then gave way into the turn. BIZERK was away alertly to set the
pace at once, continued to press the pace into the far turn then was done. BAD BOY was off to an awkward start and trailed throughout while along the
inside.

JEOPARDY THEORY set the pace from the outset while near the inside, was under pressure through the far turn and into the lane, repelled challengers into
the lane, cleared then held to the wire. LOADEMUPJUSTICE was unhurried while near the inside, continued reserved into the far turn, gained with
momentum through the three path into the lane, straightened into the lane from the four path then continued with good energy while splitting rivals late to
gain the place spot. NATES HEARTTHROB tracked the pace while along the inside throughout, bid into the lane and could not gain on the top one while
just saving the show spot. AMICABLE raced in the three path throughout, bid into the lane, was behind several rivals near the eighth pole, waited a bit then
finished with good energy. CIELO BLU was in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing
kick. RAPA NUI pressed the pace into the turn, chased the winner while straightening in the lane then weakened with and eighth to go.
OVERTHETOPJUSTICE raced in the three path through the turn when never far back then weakened into the lane. BOOK OF ROMEO raced six wide
through the first turn, continued well out in the track while moving up to stalk the leaders, entered the far turn from the four path, continued as a contender
into the lane, was tiring inside the eighth pole when shut off and was done. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY was outrun while in the four or five path. MY
BUCKAROO was done entering the far turn while in the four path and was eased to the wire and walked off. WISHY WASHY was done entering the far turn,
took to the seven path and was pulled up after entering the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR
CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
BLAZING SUMMER chased the pace from the three path into the turn, bid in late turn and into the lane, gained the lead nearing the sixteenth pole, cleared
then just lasted. HEY KITTEN was unhurried into the turn while in the three path, came off the inside and into the three path while gaining momentum,
continued with good momentum through the final eighth and just missed from the four path. KONA KAI was along the inside into the lane then stayed on
well to be gaining at the end. FAST COREY set the pace while in the two path through the turn, cleared when straightening in the lane then gave way inside
the sixteenth pole. COVENANT LADY was in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path and offered
a mild gain. ROBINHILL chased the pace two wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three path and lacked a closing
response. GIFT WRAPPED was along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. TETELLA was in tight and steadied at the start, raced in the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was a threat. MIZZEN ASH was well back while saving ground and never factored.
SEEKING SECA was along the inside through the turn, angled into the seven path and never menaced. IRON LADY AWAY pressed the pace while two
wide while attempting to get out, got out through late turn, bore out leaving the turn then dropped back on the far outside.
