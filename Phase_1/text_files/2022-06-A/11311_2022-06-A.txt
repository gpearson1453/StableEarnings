Footnotes
SADIE'S LIGHT broke out, with the leaders, fell back off the pace, swung four wide into the lane, drifted in past the furlong marker, continued to attempt to
drift toward the inside despite a firm right handed grip on the reins, late push, just up in a determined effort. TOTALLY ADDICTED off a step slow, trailed for
over three furlongs, roused just off the inside into the straight, floated in by the winner a furlong out, traffic, floated in again and brushed with that same rival
with a sixteenth remaining, continued in traffic, finished willingly to be up for the place in the final strides remaining inside the winner and between horses.
BIG RESULTS moved up to narrowly take control after the start, slight bobble when continuing on top into the turn, quickly recovered and showed the way
through the turn, briefly clear a furlong out, proved stubborn until very late. BERNIE SPECIAL closest to the two leaders along the inside, continued to save
ground turn, mild late close up the inside, not enough in the final strides. JACKIE MOON pressed the leader from the two path, continued to force the issue
into the lane, gave way soon after. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TOTALLY ADDICTED AGAINST THE WINNE FOR
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
THAT'S D 'CAT broke on top, set a soft but pressured set of early fractions toward the inside, shook clear late in the final turn, expanded that advantage
through upper stretch, not threatened the final furlong while being kept to task. POWER JET fell back to trail in lacking speed, continued to lag far turn,
roused three wide into the stretch, bothered slightly by a drifting DUST BOY past the furlong marker, was righted and finished willingly to be well clear for
the place, not a threat to the winner. DUSTY BOY in the second flight while in the two path, improved to chased the winner past the furlong marker, also
proved no match for that one, failed to contain the runner up, finished up best of the other two. THREE RUN HOMER away in good order outside the
winner, pressed that one in that same position through the first turn and up the backstretch, began to weaken midway on the final turn, continued to falter
down the stretch. DUTCHMAN last to leave, raced back in the second flight, failed to menace in the drive.

OLE STUD MUFFIN moved up closest to leader, pressed into turn, lost some ground into the stretch, got back to challenge inside the furlong marker, wore
that same rival down late under firm handling. SHARP CHARLIE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, shook clear into the lane, briefly resisted the
challenge of the winner with less than a furlong remaining then relented in the final strides, remained far clear of the others. FIREINTHESTORM away in
good order behind his entrymate, chased the top two in vain throughout, no match for that pair, remained clear of the others. PRODUCTION TIME bumped
at the start, raced back and toward the inside, slowly gaining for the show while also not a threat to the top two. COLE'S SENSATION broke in, bumped
PRODUCTION TIME to be last away, made little impact while racing three wide. QUEENIE'S LEROY fell back to trail soon after start, remained sluggish to
be always outrun.

A. K. A. GRAMS stalked the pace for a half while three wide, advanced and challenged three to four wide turning for home, drove well clear. BECCA'S
BOUQUET broke on top, pressed the issue in the two path into the turn, challenged between horses and inside the winner turning for home, proved no
match for that one in the run to the wire, held sway for the second spot. BEYOND D'ORO lacked early foot, continued back turn, four wide stretch, rallied,
gained the nod for the show at the wire. SHE'S MY PRIORITY in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting, improved a bit past the
furlong marker, flat late, missed the show. TENSAS VIRGINIA settled in the second flight along the inside,moved closer in the two path and between horses
turning for home, flattened out in the run to the wire. ROCKETT MAGIC dueled up front early inside the runner up, narrowly led that one into and through the
turn, weakened when headed entering the stretch. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG in mid pack early, fell back through the turn, not a factor through the stretch.
APRIORITY LADY shuffled back a bit at the start, steadily got out to be very wide before a quarter, dropped to the inside for the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
M AND M'S CUSTOM headed up the second flight in the run up the backstretch toward the inside, steered three wide when moving closer late in the turn,
engaged the leader from the outside with a furlong remaining, put that foe away late to be edging clear at the end. BLUE RIDGE RED pressed the issue
early in the two path, took over midway on the turn, briefly clear entering the stretch, responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong to run, gave
ground grudgingly to that one while remaining clear for the place. K T'S JILTED GROOM back off the pace, raced between foes into the lane, could do little
with the top two late toward the inside, finished well clear of the others. LUCKY BIG DADDY in the second flight outside, came four wide into the stretch,
lacked a closing kick. SHOT ON WINDY HILL last away, trailed inside much of the way and was never a threat. BOLD DANCER broke on top, set the early
pace inside, stopped when headed by the runner up late in the turn, finished far back.

Footnotes
PARTY OF FIFTEEN fell back to mid pack soon after the start, raced unhurried and three wide into the turn, four wide into the lane, set down, closed
resolutely down the middle of the strip, up final jump. CARIBE NIGHTS back off the pace and the inside, range up three wide to challenge into the stretch,
took over inside the furlong grounds, led late, nailed at the wire from the outside. QUANA DUDE chased the early leader up the backstretch, challenged in
the two path and between horses turning for home, gained the advantage to show the way past the furlong marker, could not last. THE BIG IRISHMAN last
to leave, trailed up the backstretch and through the turn, roused into the lane, steered out widest for the drive, improved position, gaining for the show.
CALLTHEWOLFE broke back, also lacked speed, two path into the lane, lacked a serious closing response to finish up evenly. LUNDI broke sharp, was
clear out of the chute, continued to show the way into and through the turn, faltered when headed entering the stretch. COACH HUDSON forwardly placed
for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
PRADO'S PRIORITY forwardly placed from the start off the inside advanced and took over in the two path turning for home, drew steadily clear under firm
handling. WISE ANCHOR in the second flight outside, raced three wide into the stretch, drifted out slightly nearing the furlong marker, was straightened and
finished up willingly to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. GIMMEASOUND off the pace, in the two path and between foes turning for
home, came in under a repeated right handed crop past and inside the furlong marker, up late for the show, not a threat to the top two. CAJUN BERTI
sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to hold a daylight advantage into and through the turn through some lively fractions, weakened gradually when
overtaken entering the stretch. THUNK broke back, continued to lack speed outside, four wide through the turn, improved position through some traffic.
WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG in mid pack while inside, continued to save ground into the lane, was going evenly past the furlong marker when put in tight
by GIMMEASOUND, altered course for room with a sixteenth remaining and continued one paced to the finish. GOLDEN PALACE last away, lacked speed,
three wide out of the turn, failed to produce a meaningful rally down the stretch. TOO MUCH BOURBON remained back to be always outrun. FLUFFPOINT
forwardly placed early, stopped late in the turn, eased through the stretch, walked in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH
RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BITSY'S CUSTOM C broke alertly, allowed the two leaders to go early in hand, confidently handled when ranging up three wide to challenge that pair late in
the turn, gained the advantage into the lane, drew clear under token pressure to win ridden out. XANTHUS WRATH void of speed, came between horses
and in traffic into the stretch in the four path, angled toward the inside for room approaching midstretch, finished willingly to earn the place, not a threat to
the winner. STEALING APRIORITY back off the pace, raced in the two path through the turn, steered out three sixteenth out, dueled to the wire for the
second spot, outkicked late. TOO MUCH CROWN lacked speed, came five wide for the drive, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. CORN SOUP
broke back, dropped to the inside when trailing into the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, moved out a bit to pick off a couple of tiring rivals,
never menaced. CARLOS PUNCH away in good order, narrowly set the pace inside for a half, gave way when headed by the winner. MR. SNOWFLAKE
forced the issue for almost four furlongs in the two path and began to back up.
