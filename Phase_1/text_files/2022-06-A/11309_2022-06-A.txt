Footnotes
BRETTMEISTER lagged back through the first turn, mounted an early move on the backstretch, split rivals approaching the second turn to continue the
advance, loomed a daunting presence three deep, nearing the quarter pole, reeled in the leader and shook clear inside the three-sixteenths pole, was kept
to task and held sway. CONSIDER ME broke outwardly and was away behind his field, tucked in to save ground while well back, came under a ride into the
second turn, got through every step and finished willingly to earn the runner up spot. SUPER NECESSARY settled saving ground, angled on to commence
his attack midway through the second turn, loomed a danger but flattened and settled for the minor award. BREWING STORM prompted the pace between
horses to the second turn and tired. PURRS WELL set the pressured pace along the inside, opened clear after a half, was collared near the three-sixteenths
pole and gave way readily once headed. IVY WAY pressed the pace three wide but stopped before going five furlongs.

Footnotes
THE EXCEPTION tracked the pacesetter inside, was driven inside around the turn, accelerated thru an opening on the rail, and kicked clear. HAZELS
LITTLE MAN broke out and bumped Big Irish Eyes, stalked in the two path, was driven three wide in upper stretch, and ran on for place. DAVID'S
PROSPEC raced well back from the two path, was hustled three wide around the turn, and improved in the stretch for show. DR. GRUNSEICH was
bothered at the start, trailed from the two path, and never threatened. HAIL SOUTHERN set the pace, was coaxed two wide into the stretch, but faded. BIG
IRISH EYES broke in slightly, stumbled, lost the rider, and walked off. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD INTO THE START OF THE RACE REGARDING THE
LOOSE HORSE BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
THISNAMEISOKAY set the pace, kicked away around the far turn, opened up into the stretch, and was much the best. THREE COINS chased four wide,
was cued while three wide into the stretch, and was the best of the rest. SURYA raced well back inside, was coaxed while drifting five wide into the stretch,
and ran on for show. LISA MARIE was off the pace inside, roused while three wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. SOLEADA stalked three wide, was
hustled along two wide into the stretch, but faded. FEMINISTA tracked inside, was driven inside around the far turn, but flattened. SEARCH was slowly
away, trailed, and lacked response in the stretch. COME WHAT MAE raced well back in the two path, was ridden three wide into the stretch, but was tired.
WAY LUCKY rated from the three path, but was no menace. MARK WITH AN E raced in midpack between, was six wide into stretch, and empty. WILLING
pressed two wide but backed out around the far turn.

DEFEND set the pace three wide, opened in hand rounding the turn, was cued passing the eighth pole, and forged clear. RILEYS DUDE pressed two wide
early, was ridden two wide around the turn, and ran on for place. MOMOS prompted the pace inside, was ridden inside around the turn, but lost a stretch
duel with RILEYS DUDE to end up with the show honors. EPIC LUCK trailed, was cued inside around the turn before the rider lost the whip at the quarter
pole, and finished one paced. HIM SHE KISSES chased between, raced three wide into the stretch, but was tired. MIDNIGHT FIRE tracked three wide, was
ridden three wide around the turn, but faded.

Footnotes
INANNA'S QUEST chased between, made progress two wide around the turn, swept four wide in upper stretch, and rallied. FOX FORCE FIVE tracked
inside, made progress two wide rounding the far turn, tipped into the three path at the top of the lane, and held place. GIRL'S ON FIRE set the pace, cut the
corner into the stretch, and held on for show. GLOSSAMER rated three wide, was coaxed inside around the turn, tipped into the three path for the stretch,
and ran on. EPHEMERAL raced in midpack from the two path, hustled three wide around the turn, and improved. TIKTOKNAWAY stalked two wide, was
roused inside around the far turn, but was one paced. RUNNING ON ENTRY raced from midfield inside, but flattened. DOWNTOWN KATIE was well back,
but made progress racing three wide around the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch, but was tired. TALKS IN HER SLEEP tracked in the three path,
raced four wide around the far turn, drifted five wide into the stretch, but came up empty. FARCICAL was squeezed out at the start and never a factor.
PERGOLA broke out and pressed early, but dropped out around the turn.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FLYING raced well back early, made progress inside around the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, and surged past the pacesetter.
SOUPER CATCH set the pace, was roused inside along the far turn, and held place. NASHVEGAS prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead two wide
into the stretch, but was repelled and held show. JOHN'S PROMISE stalked while three wide, was driven in the four path at the top of the lane, but finished
evenly. INGREIDO tracked while four wide early, was in the three path rounding the far turn, and flattened. AND WON missed the break and was not a
factor. ODDS ON chased inside but was tired rounding the far turn.
