Footnotes
EIFS broke slightly in the air, was under urging early, saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, swept to command inside the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. CAROLINA ICE hugged the inner rail on the turn and in upper stretch, was taken to the three path in mid stretch and had a
slight rally. CONGRESS HALL lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home, failed to seriously rally and passed tired foes. BULLETS LADY , off
sluggishly, rushed up three deep leaving the backstretch, disputed the pace outside SHACKABOOM around the turn and through upper stretch, tired.
SHACKABOOM sped to the early lead, raced along the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DAT DARES GOLD tracked an early duel while in hand, moved up three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit wider into the lane, moved up to take
command outside rivals in mid stretch, kept on under solid handling and held firm. R TRUE SENSATION , bumped the break, led early then was joined from
her outside and dueled, rated back off the leader near the three eighths, came back to challenge inside runners near mid stretch, fought on gamely with the
winner but wasn't quite good enough. ALL ABOUT KATHERN lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane, eased out, gathered momentum past the
three sixteenths, split runner and finished up with good energy. MAKE IT A DOUBLE drifted out at the break, corrected and rushed up to the outside of R
TRUE SENSATION, sparred into the turn, shook clear under a light hold with three eighths to go, drifted out a bit entering the lane, was joined from both
sides approaching mid stretch and faded. GRACE ISABELLA hopped in the air and bumped with a rival, moved up towards the rail heading towards the
turn, eased out to pursue three wide and to the inside of TORCH CARRIER mid turn, drifted in past the three sixteenths and came up empty. TORCH
CARRIER , three to four wide chasing the pace, lacked a stretch response.

Footnotes
INSIDE STUNT was forced in a bit at the break, straightened and was sent up between foes to dispute the pace, held a short lead leaving the far turn,
handled pressure from both sides around the turn, responded to right handed asking and kicked clear past the three sixteenths, kept on a drive and widened
a bit late. CLASS WIZARD drifted in at the break bothering the winner some, corrected and saved ground in mid pack, eased out into the lane, moved up
between runners in mid stretch and kept on willingly while earning the place. PICKIN SEA GLASS chased the dueling trio while clear of others, angled five
wide for the drive, moved up in mid stretch then flattened out late. CALLYOURIGHTBACK , in close soon after the break, dropped off the pace while saving
ground, was under pressure mid turn, moved up nearing mid stretch, eased out and closed between foes. WEST VIRGINIA BOY , urged from the gate and
inside rivals, dueled to upper stretch, stayed on willingly past the furlong grounds then faded late. BEN RUMSON tracked four then three wide early, bid
three deep leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane, kept on with effort past the eighth pole then weakened very late. TWICE GOLD , off slow when
steadying at the start, lagged off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to generate a serious response. GALWAY LAD came in at the break
bothering TWICE GOLD, dropped off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, angled out but lacked a bid. GLASTONBURY chased three wide and gave
way through the drive.

SEVEN ON THE ROCKS showed brief speed down the backstretch, was two wide on the turn waiting for home, moved to the three path in upper stretch,
aggressively split foes inside the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed under a hand ride. BIG TALL DAWG , rated behind horses entering the turn, waited for
room on the bend, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, challenged for the led near the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game performance. MAGIC
MULE circled foes around the turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch and flattened out. ROMINSKI disputed the pace outside ABUELO PAPS, opened a
clear lead near the eighth pole and weakened late. ABUELO PAPS showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and weakened.
SUGAR GRAY LEONARD , slow to begin, advanced three wide on the turn to reach a striking position approaching the stretch then gave way in upper

Footnotes
FLAMING EAST , away in good order, was taken in hand and rated off of a dueling trio, eased out and bid four deep in hand near the three eighths, kicked
clear heading towards the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage under pressure past mid stretch then held sway. QUINCANNON , nudged to
contention, dueled inside a pair of rivals through the opening half mile, remained inside pursuing the winner from the head of the lane and continued on
gamely to cut back into the margin. BOURBON ON THE BAY settled off the pace, came three wide for the drive and had a belated run between foes. HE
ROLLS dueled between rivals, held a slim lead after a half mile, gave hard chase and shifted four wide into the lane, kept on with effort but was out kicked
for the drive. LUV YA BYE BYE drifted out at the break, corrected and settled off the pace, moved up three wide past the three eighths, angled five wide for
the drive, made progress past mid stretch then flattened out late. NIGHT BOSS , off the pace while saving ground, angled six wide into the lane, made some
headway past the three sixteenths but failed to sustain. PHRA PHROM saved ground advancing to the half mile marker, chased the quartet of leaders past
the three eighths, failed to kick on in the lane and faded. SPRITZER , with the early pace three deep, ceded the lead past the three eighths and weakened.
TIZ PATRICK broke slowly and dropped far back.

Footnotes
A MO REAY engaged BABY MAN from her inside leaving the chute and disputed the pace under some rating, held a short lead leaving the far turn, ceded
the lead and came under pressure while battling inside a pair of rivals nearing the lane, fought back under strong encouragement to retake command
leaving the eighth pole, spurted clear a sixteenth out, held firm and was kept to task to the final yards. BABY MAN led early while disputing the pace outside
the winner, sparred between rivals from the five sixteenths to mid stretch, drifted out a bit and stayed on willingly to hold down the place. GLOWSITY
tracked three wide, ranged up past the three eighths while coaxed along, gained a short advantage soon into the stretch, maintained the lead while dueling
past mid stretch, failed to hold and faded in the final seventy yards. DOTADA , close up while about two wide, dropped down towards the rail and moved up
to have aim leaving the quarter pole, gave hard chase past mid stretch but came up empty. DRY WELL , in a bit close at the break, saved ground and
edged up leaving the five eighths, chased around the turn and faded. WET MY BEAK bobbled outward at the break, corrected and rated well wide, moved
up four wide leaving the far turn, was under a ride pursuing into the lane, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and faded.
