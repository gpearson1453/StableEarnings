FAVORITE HEARTBEAT away cleanly, quick strider was quick into stride, dueled with rival and edged away late. SOCKIT TOOYA broke in, bumped rival at
the start, dueled with rival and came up second best in a good try. MATILDA THE EAGLE came out at the start, urged right handed, failed to fully straighten
out in a solid effort. SOMEWHERE OUT WEST away awkwardly, took a bit to level, showed decent acceleration and finished evenly. VANISH away cleanly,
bumped early by outside rival, shifted out passing the gap, and lacked bid solid hand urging.
