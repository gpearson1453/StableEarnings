Footnotes
PROPENSITY stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead in the four path into upper stretch, responded well under
pressure in the final furlong and held sway under steady urging. BOOM BOOM KABOOM settled just off the pace under light restraint, drafted inside around
the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path, lacked optimal room between foes from the three-sixteenths to the
furlong marker and altered out, chased to the sixteenth-pole then steadied when kept behind the leader by STEELERSFANFORLIFE, found room late and
finished willingly to just get the place while losing his best chance at victory. STEELERSFANFORLIFE broke in a bit and was slowest into stride, settled at
the rear, moved from the two path to the four path under urging around the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well on the outside to loom a threat
into the final sixteenth, kept the runner-up behind the leader at that point and hung then just missed the place but was clear for the show. GASLIGHT
pressed the pace loosely between foes, vied in the two path around the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened. STANHOPE was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into upper
stretch, fought into the final furlong then gave way. SAND DUNE settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and failed to rally.

UNION LAKE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
rallied inside and knocked heads with AMARETTI through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home and gamely inched away at the end.
AMARETTI coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until tucked to the two path into the turn, began to climb greenly resenting the kickback and was
guided three then four wide midway on the turn swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in head to head with
the aforementioned foe getting displaced from the front with seventy yards to the finish and was along clear of the rest in a good initial effort. FREE
CHICKENS hustled from the gate, chased six paths off the inside early on before tucking four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. DON'T OVERLOOK ME five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild bid. CUPIDS GIRL brushed the off side stall at the start, raced briefly in the five path before tucking three wide nearing the turn, went to the rail through
the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SPICY GINGER chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. QUOTABELLE hustled
from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
LIANA B coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand three then two wide through swift splits under some pressure from the aforementioned foe to the
outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat from flanking challengers and yielded just outside
the eighth pole, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
KERRY was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then shifted to the two path into upper stretch,
rallied to the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. HALF A CHANCE broke very alertly, angled in while crossing in front,
showed the way inside through the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, fought on well after losing
the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole but missed while clear for the place. FOURWAY STOP hesitated at the start and was off a bit slow,
moved into the middle of the field, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the
needed response while just able to get the show. RIVKA (IRE) broke out and bumped hard with a foe, chased the pace from second position, raced in the
three path around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. LOVE TANK was bumped hard at the start then forced into
another opponent, raced towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the two path around the turn and lacked the needed kick then raced in hand
nearing the wire. RANTING was off slow then bumped by a foe and forced out, angled in at the rear, went three wide under urging around the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. INFLUENTIALOUS bobbled one stride out of the gate, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide
on the turn and came up empty. PUZZLE brushed the inside of the gate at the start, dropped back under urging, saved ground around the turn and was no
factor.

FUNNY JOKE three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge through the final furlong, had BALTASAR shy out under a left handed crop and was herded latched on to that leader nearing the sixteenth pole,
took command seventy yards from home and gamely prevailed on the wire. BALTASAR coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide in closest aim of
the leader, tucked to the two path put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths pressuring the front, spun three wide for home, shied in under a right handed crop
brushing NICHOLAS JAMES, seized command and shied out a furlong out under a left handed stick herding out FUNNY JOKE two paths a sixteenth from
home, got caught with seventy yards to go and ran on safe for the place honors. LIFE CHANGER broke in at the start, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. NICHOLAS JAMES coaxed from the
start, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under pressure from BALTASAR and got set down taking the two
path into upper stretch, got brushed with three-sixteenths to go by BALTASAR and yielded command, then weakened in the late stages. BEZOS chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. VICTORY BUILT coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GRIS TORMENTA settled nicely in the front half of the field, went three to four wide under coaxing around the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then
rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well to make a bid inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong handling. TRINITY TITOLI was hustled from
the start then taken in hand early, stalked the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the two to three path, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took
the lead while asked for her best in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. THE HONORABLE RUTH was
urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show. HANDLE
THE TRUTH was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch but lacked the needed kick. QUEENTIGUA was
urged along off the pace, went five to six wide around the turn and came up empty. CANDY MONET was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear
advantage, raced inside to the two path around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. APPRECIATE was urged along off the pace, went
three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. LOVE THAT FACE had her head-turned at the start and was off a step slow, went four to five wide
around the turn and tired. CROSSTOWN GIRL was urged towards the rear, went five wide around the turn, moved inward in the stretch and never reached
contention. CLASSIC VINMAN dropped well back in the field, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. BELLA DOMENICA settled off the pace,
was roused while inside to the two path on the turn and also lacked the needed response. TAMI'S ORCHID broke a bit slow then dropped well behind the
rest of the field, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. HIDEOUT broke a bit awkwardly, was hard ridden on the far outside, dropped back
while moving from the seven path to the five path around the turn, angled to the two path coming to the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LADY ROCKSTAR (GB) tracked the pace three then two wide unhurried as the leader spurted away, remained patiently handled and came under light
coaxing taking closer order through the far turn and advancing to take command swinging three wide into upper stretch when set down for the drive, edged
clear under a drive through to the finish kept busy to the end. MIA MARTINA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. FLANIGAN'S COVE got bumped at the start by FEDERALIST PAPERS, who broke
outwards, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper
stretch, tipped out a path or two straightened away and offered up a mild bid. FEDERALIST PAPERS broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned
foe, tracked just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and failed to quicken staying on one paced to
the wire. CHAMPAGNE IVY led early on before being displaced from the front into the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim for the opening six
furlongs, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
AMERICAN BRIDGE (GB) spurted away in the two path, tucked inside through the far turn, got overtaken and cut the corner into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. Please note the opening quarter split was hand timed due to a teletimer procedural error.
