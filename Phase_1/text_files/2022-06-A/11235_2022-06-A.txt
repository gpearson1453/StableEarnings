CHOCOLATE BAR stalked the pace early on, loomed near the five sixteenths pole, took over command nearing the quarter pole and drew away down the
lane while geared down in the final stages. CRAFTY DADDY chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no
match for the winner. TRUCULENT tracked the pace early, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but weakened late in the drive.
WINTER POOL trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. PROVERB was never a threat. BIG LAKE set the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane and gave way down the lane.

Footnotes
COLORFUL MISCHIEF tracked the early trio, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders three wide, inched clear and
held sway in the final stages. GUNNING raced back early from the rail, was in the two path into the lane, blocked in the upper stretch, was altered out near
the three sixteenths pole, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. PLEASE BE KIND pressed the pace early three wide, was in the four
path into the lane, inched ahead near the eighth pole but yielded late in the drive. JAG WARRIOR vied for the lead early along the inside, stayed near the
rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. OVERCOOKED chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and moved up late in the stretch
drive. SMUGNESS vied for the lead early from between horses, was in the two path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. SACRED KITTEN was
never a threat. LIL TOWN SIS chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and faded down the lane.
SUMMER MATE was never a factor. CLASSIC COYNE stumbled at the start and was through after a half. MADELYN'S MAGIC was through early.

out then drew off late under a steady drive. WE ALL SEE IT raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane under a rally, made a bid down the lane
but was no match for the winner late. GLACIAL was bumped early along the backstretch, chased the pace, was in the five path into the lane and moved up
late in the stretch run. EMIRATES ROAD was unhurried early on, raced in the seven path entering the lane and improved position late in the stretch drive.
RIDER'S SPECIAL trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch. MENDENHALL tracked the pace early, was
in the three path into the lane while making a bid but drifted in a bit down the lane and weakened late in the drive. STELLAR TAP was never a threat.
VOLCANIC was never a factor. SACRED SAMURAI pressed the pace early on, took over and led nearing the lane, was in the two path into the lane and
caved down the lane. MY BUDDY B came out and bumped foe hard early along the backstretch. AWESOME AARON was bumped hard early along the
backstretch. DURANTE set the pace for a half then folded up.

Footnotes
SHE'S ALL WOLFE trailed in the two path, came into the far turn two wide before shifting to the four path at the three furlong pole in pursuit of the top three,
chased those rivals through upper stretch, grinded away while taking aim in midstretch, and drove past the leaders in the final sixteenth. AVA'S GRACE set
a clear pace, held sway while shifting ground outwardly in midstretch, drifted further out approaching the final sixteenth, but was surpassed by an outer
on-charging rival in the late stages, and held place from an inner foe. ARMY WIFE broke in a bit of a tangle at the start, stalked two wide, pressed between
around the far turn, but failed to progress on the leader's advantage in upper stretch, shifted inside of that drifting rival inside the final furlong, but lacked the
needed punch, and missed reaching place. PAULINE'S PEARL broke a beat slowly, tracked three wide and outside of foes, pressed into the far turn, but
lacked the needed kick in upper stretch to produce a bid, flopped back to her left lead while getting mildly herded out in the final furlong, and was outkicked
for a minor placing soon after. TEMPER TIME tracked along the inside, but required urging to keep pace around the far turn, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ADMISSION OFFICE trailed, took the far turn in the three path, swung five wide in upper stretch, pursued the top trio through midstretch, surged outside of
them in the late stages, and gained an advantage at the wire via a tight photo. GET SMOKIN set the pace, held sway firmly through upper stretch, clung to a
margin tenaciously through the final furlong, but got nailed at the wire. FIELD PASS tracked three wide, took aim while just off of the leader's flank around
the far turn, but only managed to chase that foe through upper stretch, grinded away in the final sixteenth to attempt a late bid, but was outfinished
approaching the wire, and missed reaching place. FLORIFORM settled off of the pace, tracked the top trio two wide around the far turn, shifted outside of
them entering the lane, but failed to progress on the clear leader's margin through upper stretch, and leveled off in the late stages while getting outkicked for
a minor share. LIKE THE KING stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane. GRAY'S FABLE pressed the pace setter from the outside, but
weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
BANGO broke a beat slowly at the start, tracked from midpack two wide in to the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, rallied on his left lead through
traffic to bid entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. NECKER ISLAND stalked along the inside, sustained a rail chase through the lane, but was
outkicked by an outer bidding foe at the sixteenth pole, vied for place in the closing stages, and prevailed via a narrow photo. TOP GUNNER stalked outside
of the leader and from the three path around the turn, forged a narrow advantage while shifting to the five path entering the lane, but drifted outwardly in
midstretch while showing the way, got outkicked by an inner rival a sixteenth from home, and lost place to an inner foe at the wire while saving show. LONG
RANGE TODDY set the pace inside of a pressing TOP GUNNER while a path or two off of the inner railing, got headed by that one at the quarter pole, kept
on through the lane, but yielded between rivals in the final sixteenth. MILES AHEAD broke a step slowly, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
BOB'S EDGE settled off of the pace two wide, shifted out in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. JALEN JOURNEY chased outside of the leading pair while in
the four path around the turn, and steadily faded through the lane. PYRON trailed along the inside, but was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC ONE settled off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the four path around the far turn before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied
to vie in upper stretch, gained an advantage entering the final furlong, inched clear soon after, and held from an outer rallying PROXY in the late stages.
PROXY stalked along the inside, backed off to a tracking position down the backstretch, came under urging to pick up stride in the two path around the far
turn, but lacked a response and was outmoved by an outer DYNAMIC ONE approaching the five sixteenths pole, altered course outside of that bidding foe
passing the three sixteenths pole, and rallied in pursuit of that leader in the closing stages to reach place approaching the wire. SCALDING laid forwardly
placed in the three path and between horses just behind the leaders early on, stalked outside of foes down the backstretch, chased the top pair under urging
around the far turn, ranged up while being floated to the five path entering the lane, vied four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the
furlong grounds, and lost place in the closing stages. AMERICANREVOLUTION stalked three wide while in the four path around the first turn, sustained
pressing pressure two wide into the far turn, vied while getting floated to the four path entering the lane, battled between horses in upper stretch, but gave
way to a pair of outer bidding rivals entering the final furlong. SANTOS DUMONT vied two wide early on, cleared his inner counterpart entering the
backstretch while continuing to feel outer pressure from AMERICANREVOLUTION, showed the way while hounded by that foe around the far turn, shifted
out to the three path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with outer bidders before yielding between horses at the furlong grounds. SUPER STOCK
vied along the inside early on, backed off to stalk from the pocket entering the backstretch, attempted a bid through a large rail opening in upper stretch, but
flattened out at the furlong grounds. MILITARIST tossed his head in the air at the start, raced at the rear two wide, trailed in the five path around the far turn,
and was outrun.

Footnotes
KITODAN laid off of the pace three wide, picked off foes with a five wide blitz around the far turn to bid for the lead along with an inner SMOKIN' T entering
the lane, then sparred with that foe in the spirited tussle through the lane, and prevailed. SMOKIN' T tracked in midpack in the three path, gained four wide
around the far turn as an outer KITODAN did the same, bid for the lead along with that foe entering the lane, dueled tenaciously with that rival through the
final furlong, but was outgamed to the wire. GRAND SONATA trailed, took the far turn in the four path, shifted six wide entering the lane, and stayed on to
reach a minor placing in the final furlong. PLAY ACTION PASS settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn three to five wide while inside of
GRAND SONATA, and stayed on along with that foe through the final furlong. RED RUN laid far back in the three path, trailed turning for home, shifted
outside of foes approaching midstretch, and moved up. MAJOR GENERAL pressed the pace two wide, vied turning for home, but was outkicked by a pair of
outer rivals passing the quarter pole, and yielded. JAMES JONES stalked two to three wide, but was outmoved by outer foes entering the lane, and tired.
SPEAKING SCOUT bobbled while breaking a step slowly between horses at the start, tracked in midpack in the two path, but was outmoved by outer foes
turning for home, and made little impact. SUMMER ANTHEM set the pace, vied inside of a trio foes entering the lane, but weakened in upper stretch. SPIN
WHEEL raced far back in the two path, and never got involved. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE stalked along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. PER
RULING #22-0136 FROM THE KENTUCKY HORSE RACING COMMISSION, SMOKIN T WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.
