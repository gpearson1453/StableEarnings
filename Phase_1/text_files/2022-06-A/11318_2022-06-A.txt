WHAT A RUMOR inside speed pressured to stretch, lost lead past the furlong marker, roused feverously through the final seventy yards to gamely fight
back for the win. MIDNIGHT MIKEY three wide speed to the turn, led eighth pole but outgamed to wire. BRILLIANT JOURNEY dueled between horses to
the turn, gave way grudgingly late. BRINK POINT broke tardy from the gate and could not keep up throughout while shifting out for the final furlong.

position, coming back too late. BONNIE'S THE BEST unhurried to the stretch, angled inside through the final furlong to rally along for the show spot under
good handling. MISS SOVELIA good early speed to the front, drifted off rail with a steady fade from the turn. PEACELUVNSPRINKLES never a menace
throughout. SUMMER AUTUMN ROSE was through early and could not keep up. CREATIVE WHIT pressed pace outside to the stretch but gave way
readily.
