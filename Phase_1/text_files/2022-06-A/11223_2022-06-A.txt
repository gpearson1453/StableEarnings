Footnotes
TALTY pressed the pace, saving ground along the inside, then made a move in early stretch and rallied down the lane, drawing away from the field to win
easily. GOLDEN HAMMER was near the back, racing along the rail, then angled out around the turn, four wide and closed willingly to get up for second.
SWEET BABY SHAE was in contention early, near the leader, in the three path, then offered a mild bid in the stretch drive to grab show money. LUNAR
LASS made the lead early, holding them off until the head of the stretch and then got tired and gave way. WITTS QUESO was mid field, traveling two wide
and had an even effort. CHARMINGSIDE hopped at the start, racing near the back and showed little. CIBOLO SALLY chased the pace, from three wide and
dropped back in the turn. Due to inclement weather, the rest of the card was canceled.
