SUSAN STRONG tracked the leader from the two path through the final turn then wore down the leader to draw clear in the last sixteenth. G'S DEADLINE
chased the leaders from the two path through the first turn and down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and angled out to four to five wide
at the sixteenth pole but was not enough. FIANNA HILLS saved ground just off the rail to set a clear lead through the final turn tried to hold off the challenge
from SUSAN STRONG in the final furlong but came up empty. HONEST WOMAN stalked the pace from the three path for a half but lacked the late kick
needed. BOBBIES REASON was forwardly placed in the three path around the first turn and down the backstretch and gave way with three furlongs left.

GOLD INCLUDED was allowed to settle in the two path made a bid going into the final turn drew even with leader at the eighth pole and cleared under light
urging. CARSON'S PRINCESS went to the lead from the three path through the final turn and was collared at the eighth pole to be second best. GINNY B
was position just off the pace while saving ground throughout but lacked the late response needed. SAINT KENNEDY was rank for the first half then settled
in mid pack in the two path but failed to menace. GOINGTOAGOGO tracked the leaders from the three path for three quarters and faded.
MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA saved ground throughout while trailing and was never a threat. MELODY ROSE raced near the back in the three path made a
mild bid on the turn but raced one paced.
