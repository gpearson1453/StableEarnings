Footnotes
DONNA'S HOPE broke on top then conceded position and tracked the leader into the turn, hustled along two to three wide at the head of the lane, took over
the lead from DIAMOND OF EKATI in upper stretch and pulled away. SHAITAAN rated just out of striking distance in the opening quarter, was ridden along
three wide around the turn, sustained steady response into the lane and had to settle for second best. DIAMOND OF EKATI sped to the lead soon after the
start, showed the way under pressure into the turn, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch and gave way. ATOKAD ROSE pressed the pace in early
stages, continued in contention along the inside around the turn then faded. LAUNCH IT DARLIN saved ground and failed to move into contention.

AUTUMN ASPEN vied for the lead in early stages then shook free leaving the three eighths pole, widened to a commanding lead in upper stretch and kept
to task under a mild drive. JACK'S PARTY GIRL raced in range inside around the turn then tipped two wide for the drive, was no match for the clear winner
but sustained response and secured second best. GOODNIGHTSUGAR raced off the early pace, hustled up leaving the turn, came three wide into the
upper stretch then shifted to the inside and ran on for a share. SOYBEAN vied for the lead with the eventual winner in early stages, chased after rival
through the turn then gave way. CLINE TIME lacked early speed and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch and failed to respond.
I'M NASTY TOO chased the top pair three to four wide around the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
RAISIN RAISIN was patiently handled tracking the leader along the inside around the turn, cut the corner and given cue in the upper stretch, roused forward
along the rail and edged away under a driving finish. REMITTANCE SENT sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, came
two wide into the upper stretch, got collared by rail running winner and had to settle for second best. ADD IT ALL UP raced near midpack into the turn,
hustled along three wide into the lane and cleared the rest. CAMCORDIA raced off the early pace, coaxed two wide around the turn then angled inside in
the lane and failed to threaten. SHY RUNNER was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased in close contention around the turn then faded in the final
furlong. HOLIDAY ROMANCE raced three to four wide off the early pace and never menaced. PRAIRIE FIREBALL raced in the back then came four wide
into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
CHASING SHADOWS was well placed racing just off the pressured pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn then given cue four wide at the head of the
lane and finished going away. MISCHIEF MAMA tracked the early pace then made a move to engage SABRIA for the lead midway around the turn, battled
on past the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. SABRIA dueled inside of CYCLONE SORORITY for the early lead then took
on the challenge from MISCHIEF MAMA midway round the turn, battled for command past the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and
weakened to show. SWEET LAURA was off slow at the start and trailed in the opening quarter, came five wide into the upper stretch then angled in and
improved position. CYCLONE SORORITY dueled for the early lead with SABRIA then came up tired late on the turn. CALL THE SHOTS showed response
in the opening quarter then weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
BIG PINES SANDY settled off the pace in early stages, hustled up midway around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch then shifted out wider,
dug in gamely and drew clear. COWBOY CASANOVA dueled for the lead up the backstretch, shook free past the quarter pole, held clear a furlong out then
got denied in closing strides. OSCAR WINNER WALLY raced near midpack entering the turn, coaxed five wide in the upper stretch and got up for show.
FOR ME LET IT BE chased two wide into the upper stretch, tipped wider for the drive and got edged for show. LAUNCHED tracked the embattled pair into
the turn, raced up close and given cue a furlong out, showed brief response then yielded. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND lacked early speed and raced in the
back, saved ground into the lane and improved position without threatening. MAFIA DON raced off the early pace, came two wide into the upper stretch and
failed to rally. RIDING THE TRAIN raced near midpack in the opening quarter then flattened along the outside. NEW GOSPEL dueled for the lead up the
backstretch and around the turn then faded. PHILLIP JUSTIN showed interest in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.
