ALGODONAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook off a foe down the backstretch, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. LACEE
well placed outside, held position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and held the place
safe. HOXIE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, weakened late and held
the show. SECRET TEMPLE never far back, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and weakened the final furlong.
SCINTILLATION passed a tiring rival. MELISANDE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally.

GRAND MAMOO hopped at the start, was allowed to settle, circled the field through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then drew off inside the furlong
marker under mild urging. RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide
into the lane, gained a short lead, then was no match for the winner and held the place. SONG OF INDY mid pack, moved to position on the two path
through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and flattened out, holding the show. CHECOTAH stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a
short lead on the two path through the turn, held the lead into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. PEACEFUL WAY set the pace on the inside, stayed
on when challenged through the turn, then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SURVIVOR broke in, bumping a rival at the start, moved up quickly to stalk the pace inside, vied for the lead through the turn, then gained a short
lead into the stretch, shook clear and drew off inside the furlong marker. EAGLES PALACE mid pack, angled out to gain position three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the winner and held the place. SUMMER BOSS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN bumped and pushed in at the start, saved ground
gaining position through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. BENCH WALK allowed to settle, looped four
wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. PITON set the early pace off the rail and faded the final furlong. DUN RIGHT
well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and had no rally. TRAPPED N PARADISE was
never involved. SURPRISE KICK was a brief factor.
