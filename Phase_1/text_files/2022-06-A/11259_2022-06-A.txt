Footnotes
SHADOW SPHINX off slow in the beginning, allowed to settle inside, shifted to the two path around the far turn, tipped out in the stretch, reached the front
nearing the sixteenth pole and held over the runner-up. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR off slow from outside, went five then four wide on the first turn, moved closer
three deep on the backstretch, traveled four wide through the far turn, rallied outside the winner but could not get by. ONE FAST BRO settled inside, saved
ground to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped two wide with a furlong to go, finished well but got outkicked by the top pair. CANE CREEK ROAD
sped clear around the first turn, showed the way along the rail up the backstretch, met a bid past the three-eighths pole, responded and cleared that rival at
the quarter pole, led clear into the final furlong but weakened in deep stretch. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR rated on the inside then moved outside the leader on
the backstretch, bid past the three-eighths pole, lost touch with a quarter mile remaining and weakenend. CLAYTON DELANEY broke a step slow, went
three wide around both turns and failed to rally. BIG TALKER was in a bit tight between and behind a rival early, tracked in the two path then between
runners and never responded to urging. NERVES OF STEEL stalked two then three wide, remained off the rail on the far turn and weakened down the lane.
LONE SCOUT broke slow, reserved in the early stages, traveled four then three wide on the first turn, trailed four deep into the second bend, moved in a bit
and exited the turn three wide and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
BECCA TAYLOR broke well, prompted the pace from outside, dueled DANCE TO THE MUSIC two to three wide around the bend, put away that rival in
midstretch and was kept to task to the wire. DANCE TO THE MUSIC broke a bit slow then went up to take control while under pressure from BECCA
TAYLOR, dueled around the bend, fought to midstretch but could not kick on with the winner late. SAMURAI CHARM stalked the top pair up the
backstretch, moved to the two path on the turn then eased further out leaving the bend and lacked the needed response in the stretch run. DYNASTY OF
HER OWN broke a step slow then chased along the inside, drop back while moving out on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BESTRELLA (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, waited for room around the far turn, tipped out and bid between rivals while getting crowded in upper

pressed the pace from outside, challenged for command through the far turn, vied three deep in upper stretch, fought with BESTRELLA (IRE) late and went
gamely to the wire. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) came away slow from outside, stalked the pace from between runners to the far turn, tip three wide leaving the
far turn, bid four deep in the stretch, lacked then needed late kick to get by the top pair but saved the show. ZABAVA took a bump from inside leaving the
gate, trailed three then two wide around the first turn, traveled along the rail into the second turn, came two wide into the stretch, moved in then back out in
the drive and missed the show. ALOHA KITTEN set the pace on the inside with company alongside, dueled around the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch,
then weakened in the final sixteenth. BRITTLE AND YOO broke out and bumped rival, forwardly placed three deep early on, remained outside rivals then

LOV U MEAN IT was off slow to begin, tracked off the rail then angled to the inside leaving the backstretch, crept closer while moving to the two path around
the bend, steered outside the top pair in the lane and drove clear. KRIXUS FLASH up close early, bid from outside on the turn, kept the pressure on into the
final furlong but got outkicked by the winner in the late stages. REIGN OF SPEED hustled clear early from inside, met the challenge from KRIXUS FLASH
on the turn, maintained a short lead into the final furlong, relinquished command midstretch and flattened to third. STAY IN THE GAME tracked off the rail,
three then four wide around the turn and never produced a bid. KNOCKOUT GUY stumbled and broke in a bit, chased two into the turn, four wide into the
stretch and weakened. INDICT THE TIGER forwardly placed outside a rival into the turn, went four then three wide around the turn and weakened.
RESCUE STORY broke a bit slow, traveled four then five wide around the turn and weakened. FUN MONEY stumbled badly and lost the rider in the
beginning, caught by the outrider in the stretch and walked off. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF FUN MONEY AND RULED THAT SHE
CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

time through the stretch, came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane, drifted in late and rallied for the place. LOOKINTOGETEVEN broke out,
pressed the pace from outside, challenged and dueled on the backstretch. ADELIE (IRE) pulled while tossing her head first time through the stretch, chased
two wide into the backstretch, roused along the inside with a quarter mile remaining, moved out in the stretch and had her path taken by VIVANDO and
force to check late halting all momentum. DEAR BEAU (IRE) settled off the pace and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, steered out in the lane but
failed to rally. CARROLL GIRL set the pace from inside, dueled up the backstretch and far turn, fought on to the eighth pole then weakened in the late
stages. TALENTED LADY was off a bit slow to begin, traveled along inside then two wide on the first turn, remained two wide on the second bend and failed
to menace.

MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING bumped with rival leaving the gate then sped to the front, pressured by COSMO KATIE into the turn, maintained a short lead to the
stretch, then cleared approaching the eight pole and remained strong to the wire. COSMO KATIE forwardly placed in the beginning from outside, bid three
then two wide on the turn, kept the pressure on in upper stretch but faltered in the final furlong while clearly second best. SMOKEM HOWARD raced in
range early outside a rival, chased two wide into the lane and held the show. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY broke a step slow, chased off the pace outside a
rival, rounded the turn three wide and got denied for the show honors. HOT MEMORIES raced up close on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and
faded. MY MAN BIGGIE bumped leaving the gate, took the turn four wide and was not a factor. WESTERBERG broke a step slow, trailed three then two
wide and never made an impact. WEASLEY climbed early racing off the pace, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
WAR AT SEA was closest in pursuit early on in the two path, urged through the far far turn, bid outside the leader with a furlong remaining and edged away
to prove best. CABO SPIRIT unhurried in the beginning, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail on the backstretch, entered the lane two wide,
angled out in the stretch, rallied but was too late. BEEF WINSLOW set the pace on the inside, drew away briefly on the backstretch, led clear into the
stretch, challenged at the eighth pole and yielded in the final sixteenth. BALNIKHOV (IRE) stalked off the rail, three deep on the backstretch, chased outside
a rival three wide into the stretch and finished evenly late. RED ROAD pulled early along the inside then checked hard off heels entering the first turn,
gained on the leader past the half-mile pole then had to pause when lacking room at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the far turn and tired
in the lane.

stretch, drew clear past the eight pole and held safely over the late charge from the runner-up. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ dropped back early, raced outside
a rival into the turn, lacked room behind a wall of rivals on the turn, swung out into the stretch, closed fast but was too late. LUCY'S WAY closest to the
leader early, bid between past the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside the winner into the stretch and flattened late. SEVEN EXES bumped at the start, sat off
the pace early on, went two wide into the turn, moved out and entered the stretch four deep and failed to threaten. DREAMER GIRL sped clear and crossed
over to the inside, challenged by a pair of rivals to the outside past the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch leaving the bend and weakened. WORTHINESS was
off slow to begin, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the stretch and failed to menace. SWEETHEART raced off the pace along the rail into the
turn, moved out to the two path around the bend and tired. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH fractious in the gate, chased out of range two wide into the turn, lost
ground around the bend and raced outside a pair of rivals into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
DANIEL'S MAGIC tracked off the rail, three deep into the stretch, bid four deep in upper stretch, drew clear with a sixteenth remaining and held safely. ONE
MORE BID was off slow in the beginning, stalked between, got shuffled back into the turn, lacked room on the heels of rivals around the bend, angled out in
upper stretch and gained the place. QUINTECENTS broke slow and came in at the start, forwardly placed early on and steered to the inside, saved ground
around the bend, tipped out and bid between rivals at the eighth pole but faltered late. SPYCATCHER broke a step slow from outside, went two wide into
the turn, swung widest entering the stretch, summoned a late rally and earned a minor award. CONCH DADDY broke well then came in leaving the gate,
hustled to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, led clear into the drive, overtaken nearing the eight pole and flattened. VANCOUGAR up close early
outside a pair of rivals, shifted to the two path early on the turn, chased two wide into the lane and also flattened. NAUGHTY NIKO off slow to begin,
traveled near the back and went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend and lacked further response. PERCOLATE (IRE)
stumbled sharply and almost lost the rider leaving the gate, Gonzalez regained his left-iron after crossing over the dirt, trailed along the inside then tipped
two wide around the bend and failed to threaten. GABBYSONHOLIDAY broke a step slow, dropped back early, steered to the inside and saved ground
through the turn and was not a factor.
