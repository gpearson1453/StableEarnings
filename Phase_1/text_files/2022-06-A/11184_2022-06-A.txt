Footnotes
CHEROKEE PARTY was reluctant to load but got away in good order, prompted the early pace four wide, took over the lead heading into the turn, was
cued when headed by Mi Yayis entering the stretch, but responded gamely to hold on for the win. MI YAYIS was slowly away and restrained early, made
progress while four wide heading around the turn, bid for the lead two wide entering the stretch, but was repelled. MISSPOKEN raced off the pace in the
three path, was driven along in the three path rounding the far turn, took aim at the tiring pacemaker and caught him late to get up for show. ILLUSION OF
HOPE set the early pace, lost the lead entering the turn, was roused inside along the turn, but lost show late. TAIPANS CHERRYBOMB stalked from the
inside, raced in the three path into the stretch but was tired. MY LUCKY HEART trailed early and was never a factor. PERFECT SURVIVOR pressed
between but was done into the turn.

far turn, but finished evenly. DECOUPAGE broke well and stalked three wide, was driven along the path into the stretch, but flattened. DARIA'S ANGEL
pressed inside, took the lead down the backstretch, was asked two wide into the stretch, but faded. VIKING QUEEN set the pace early, but backed out into

Footnotes
VANHOOFER stalked the pace early, was cued from the three path into the stretch, drifted out passing the three sixteenths pole, but kicked clear. DESERT
LION tracked inside, was driven along the three path into the stretch, and rallied for place. SWILL MERCHANT set the pace, was asked from the two path in
upper stretch, but yielded late. GREAT ASSUMPTIONS was slowly away and trailed, was ridden along from the two path into stretch, and ran on well.
TEMPLE OWL LIAM raced off the pace in the three path, was roused inside around the turn, but finished evenly. CONSIDER ME raced in mid pack
between foes, but flattened. HIGHLAND DREAM was well back inside and never a factor. SUMMUM NOOR chased three wide and was tired rounding the
turn.

NEIGH DUDE tracked from the three path, made progress along the three path around the turn, continued in the three path into the stretch, and edged
away. ANOTHER LULU trailed early, was behind and four wide into the stretch, but rallied well for place. GOLDEN AVIEATOR set the pace, was asked in
two path into the stretch, but tired in the final furlong. THAT'S MY BOI TOY was well back early, was driven along the two path in upper stretch, and
improved position. MY FREEDOM was slowly away and off the pace, raced in the six path coming into the lane, and finished evenly.
STEVETHEVANDRIVER stalked the pace early, raced in the three rounding the turn, but was empty in stretch. CAJUN INVASION chased from the two
path, raced in the five path in upper stretch but never threatened.

Footnotes
SANSA ARIEL was quickly away and led two wide, opened up around the turn, was cued in upper stretch, and ridden out. TAPPIN JOSIE pressed the pace
inside,
was
coaxed
when
headed
by
Creative
Cadence
coming
into
the
stretch,
drifted
in
before
the
eighth
pole,
and
was
2nd
best.
MUCHMORETHANREADY raced off the pace two wide, was ridden while two wide in upper stretch, and ran on show. CREATIVE CADENCE stalked from
the inside, was roused two wide around the turn, but was tired in the stretch. LOVELY LIZA trailed early, was behind in two path coming into the stretch, and
never threatened. FIVE STAR FRAN was well back, and never a factor. TRUE QUEEN broke slow, tracked inside, and was empty in stretch.
