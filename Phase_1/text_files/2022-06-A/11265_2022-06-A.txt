ABSOLUTE LOVE from the outside and in the five path at the three furlong pole, shifted inside of that drifting rival approaching the lane pursued her through

Footnotes
HANEY BOYS pressed the pace setter from the outside, bid turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, drew off under driving pressure
approaching the furlong grounds, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. COLE SPUR stalked along the inside, failed to keep pace while chasing
the top pair from the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on to surpass a tiring rival for place leaving the furlong grounds. KISSALOT took the
turn in the four path while far back, and stayed on mildly. THUNDERHEART set the pace, met the eventual winner's bid turning for home, proved no match
for that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. GRAYWING chased from off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and made little impact. ONCOMING
TRAIN saved ground off of the pace, but was outrun.

Footnotes
NOBALS broke a bit outwardly, set the pace outside of RUN CURTIS RUN, cleared that foe into the turn before being re-confronted by that rival to his
outside at the three furlong pole, vied with that foe entering the lane, dueled gamely in upper stretch, persistently repelled that rival entering the furlong
grounds, and shook clear. RUN CURTIS RUN laid close up inside of the pace setter early on, rated back approaching the turn, tipped outside of that foe and
to the three path entering the turn before re-engaging the pace setter at the three furlong pole, vied entering the lane, dueled in upper stretch, but was
turned away entering the final furlong, and safely held place. B D VALESKI pursued the leaders four wide around the turn, then failed to progress on the top
two through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, secured show while changing over entering the final sixteenth, and narrowed the gap. SKY AND
SAND stalked three wide, but was outmoved by rivals on either side turning for home, and made little impact thereafter. AMERICAN STARLET was
crowded between horses at the start, tracked two wide and from between horses, chased behind the top pair turning for home, but lacked a bid before tiring
through the final furlong. CANDY LANDING saved ground while tracking the leaders, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
ISTHMIAN stalked outside of the pace setter, vied in the three path around the far turn, assumed command entering the lane, and drew off under confident
handling. OFFICER NICK set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, proved no match entering the lane, and safely held place.
WINTER'S GHOST tracked two wide and between horses, and stayed on through the lane for a minor share. MR GHOST stalked along the inside, but
failed to sustain position while faltering down the backstretch, trailed the field at the three furlong pole, then swung to the seven path entering the lane, and
moved up. BROWN DELIVERS broke outwardly and was off slow, rated far back three wide, improved down the backstretch, but failed to sustain a bid.
WORKINFROMHOME broke through the gate pre-race, then came out a step slowly, trailed the field into the far turn, gained five wide and outside of rivals
around that bend, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired through the final furlong. SOUTHERN SENSE laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to
factor. GO VIRTUAL broke a step slowly before being taken in hand between horses at the start, got rank running through kickback behind rivals into the
first turn, saved ground off of the pace thereafter, but to no avail. FOTHERINGAY tracked three wide, but faded in the four path approaching the five
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HANALEI'S HOUDINI pressed the leader from the outside, bid turning for home, dueled through upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, and just
lasted from an outer on-charging rival to the wire. DOUBLE CROWN brushed the gate while breaking a step slowly, trailed in the two to three path around
the turn, picked up stride between horses entering the lane, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of the clear leader in midstretch, surged in the
final sixteenth to bid at the wire, but just missed. COLONELSDARKTEMPER set the pace inside of a pressing HANALEI'S HOUDINI, battled with that foe
turning for home, but yielded approaching the furlong grounds. FLAT LUCKY stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, chased the top pair from the
three path and under urging around the turn, got outkicked for show in midstretch, and kept on. COLONEL BOWMAN laid off of the pace in the three to two
path around the turn, but lacked a bid. LONG TERM THINKING took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and made little impact. ESKENFORIT
tracked in the three path, but bore out to the five path at the three furlong pole, came into the lane in the six path, and faded. IMPRESSED saved ground off
of the pace, but was outrun.

CADDO RIVER stalked the top pair from the outside, loomed a danger turning for home, bid in upper stretch, and drew clear entering the final furlong.
ENDORSED tracked three wide, chased under urging around the turn, then sustained stride in the final furlong to bid for place among foes entering the final
sixteenth, and prevailed. HEART RHYTHM vied for the lead two wide, led entering the lane as an outer CADDO RIVER presented a bold challenge, but
proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong grounds, dug in for place from rivals on either side entering the final sixteenth, and got outfinished.
THREE TECHNIQUE tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, chased through midstretch before vying for
place inside of a trio of rivals in the final sixteenth, but flattened out late. SOUTH BEND trailed early on, pursued the leaders four wide around the turn,
chased a bidding CADDO RIVER through upper stretch to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but leveled off. MR. WIRELESS vied along the inside, but
gave way in upper stretch. SOUNION stalked in the two path while behind the leaders into the turn, but weakened between horses approaching the lane.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, took over command down the lane and drew off and was geared down in the final
stages. LEGIONNAIRE chased the pace early on, was shuffled back along the turn, raced in the four path into the lane, came again down the lane but was
no match for the winner. CONCERTED was slow at the start and raced back early on, began a rally along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch run. MASTER OF ARMS stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive.
CYCLONE was on the inside into the lane and improved position in the stretch. BOURBON HEIST was never a threat. MASTER GAME tracked the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane and empty late in the stretch. KINGMAKER was never a factor. GRAND ASPEN was done early. MISBEHAVED
set the pace for a half then folded up. FRONTAL ASSAULT had brief speed then stopped.
