Footnotes
CLOCHARD STREET was off a bit slowly, tracked the pace to the turn, was in tight leaving the three furlong marker and lacked room nearing the quarter
pole, tipped out at the head of the stretch, made a steady run through the drive, confronted MERGIE TROID inside of the sixteenth marker and made a final
push to prevail in a blanket finish. OYSTER SHOOTER tracked the pace outside of rivals, was roused three wide into the drive, finished well while on even
terms with the winner and just missed for the win while earning the nod for second. MERGIE TROID was hustled to the early lead, set the pace through the
turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, gamely held foes at bay until the final stages and was nailed for the win and just edged for the place.
PULPIT SINGER was forwardly placed in the early stages, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, lost position while still in contention
nearing the eighth pole but could not sustain that effort and weakened late.

Footnotes
SADIE BLUEGRASS broke alertly and ceded the early lead into the turn, took command into the drive, pulled away in the final stages and was geared down
in the end as much the best. EYE ON TIGER was hustled in the early stages, contested the pace with SADIE BLUEGRASS through the turn while carving
out quick fractions, could not match strides in upper stretch with the winner but stayed on well to hold for second. LION'S LAIR chased the quick early pace
from a ground saving position, shifted to the two path entering the drive, was outkicked in upper stretch but kept on to secure the show. CLASS CODE
stalked the quick pace outside of rivals, was asked for run at the top of the lane and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SOUTHEAST ASIA settled off of the pace on the first turn while four wide, made a middle move to advance along the backstretch run, lost ground nearing
the quarter marker, made a steady gain on the pacesetter in the drive, reeled in HYPERSONIC in the final sixteenth and held over the oncoming runner-up
to prevail. COOLCROSS was unhurried in the early going, advanced along the backstretch run, was roused three wide into the drive, closed well in the late
stages and just missed for the win while securing second. HYPERSONIC was hustled leaving the break and cleared the field into the first turn to set the
pace, set moderate fractions through the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth marker, could not hold
off SOUTHEAST ASIA in the end and was edged for second while holding for third. MEGAMEISTER was sent in the early going and prompted the early
pace, lost ground on the second turn, improved in the late stages and was outfinished in the end. TWIRLING DERBY saved ground on the first turn while
just off of the pace, lost position nearing the half-mile marker and lacked a late response. EARNEST was off a bit slowly, recovered to be up close on the
first turn while under a snug hold, lost position along the backstretch run and gave way in the drive.

CHANCERY WAY was off a step slowly but recovered while in hand to take the early lead to the turn, extended the margin nearing the quarter marker while
setting fast fractions, drew clear in midstretch and geared down in the end in a good debut. CALLMEMARTHAJANE broke alertly, chased the early pace to
the turn while saving ground, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on to be best of the rest. GRANDMA SHARK showed early speed to press
the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the lane, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. MILITARY PRINCESS lacked
early speed, lost ground on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
LOUD FUSAICHI was sent to the front leaving the break, showed good early speed while setting the quick pace through the turn, extended the lead in
midstretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up but held safely in the end. RED HOT LASS broke in the air and was away slowly, improved position
along the turn while saving ground, rallied in the drive, put mild pressure on the winner in the final stages and could not reel that one in but was up in time
for the place. HALF HOPING chased the early pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, continued to advance in upper stretch, was
edged for second in the final stages and held for third in the end. AUSTRIAN NAVY chased the pace outside of rivals, gained ground while four wide
nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a final rally in the drive. TURA LURA chased the early pace, swung three wide along the
turn, gained ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the drive. BIG CHICK bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn and
did not mount a late rally. HAYDEN'S ANGEL tracked the quick early pace to the turn, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, lost ground
in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
LEMON ZINGER was sent leaving the break, set moderate fractions while prompted to the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, was all out in
the final sixteenth while under pressure from the runner-up but held on for the win. J T'S CREDITCARD settled just off of the early pace, gained ground
along the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid along the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, closed in the final sixteenth and could not get by the
winner in the end but was best of the rest. LOVE OF THE SPORT settled off of the pace while three wide along the first turn, advanced along the
backstretch run, gained ground in upper stretch, angled out nearing the eighth pole, finished well in the final stages and was up in time for third. OH GREAT
(IRE) was hustled after the break and engaged LEMON ZINGER to prompt that foe on the front end, maintained pressure through the second turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD saved ground while stalking the early pace, advanced on the second turn,
mounted a two wide bid into the drive but could not sustain that run in the late stages and flattened out in the end. SENOR DEL CAMPO was unhurried in
the early stages, saved ground to the second turn and lacked a late rally. AWESOME CURLIN was a bit slow into stride early on, settled at the rear into the
first turn, lagged through the backstretch run and was not a factor.

REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke sharply and was sent to the front, set solid fractions while prompted through the turn, shook clear of that pressing rival in
upper stretch and kicked clear in the end. BLUE WILDCAT took back off of the early pace, chased the speed while two wide on the turn, lacked room
nearing the quarter marker and altered course in upper stretch to shift inside, closed well in the final stages but could not reel in the winner and was best of
the rest. LOVELY COLLEEN was crowded at the start by REDSTWIRLINGDANCER and was away slowly, chased the pace to the turn, advanced outside
of rivals nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. AMAAZA kept close attendance to the pace through the
turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the drive. NENE ROMANO was a bit keen in the early going while chasing the pace, lost position on the turn
and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
MEMO DADDY (CHI) was shuffled back leaving the break and was away a step slowly, settled two to three wide off of the early pace, advanced along the
backstretch run while outside of rivals, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, came within aim inside of the furlong marker, overtook LORD BRANCUSI
inside of the sixteenth-marker and won in a drive in the end. LORD BRANCUSI was a bit rank and hard to place on the run into the first turn, stalked the
pace into the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter on the second turn, took command into the drive while on the left lead, was all out inside of the
sixteenth-marker and was overtaken by MEMO DADDY in the final stages, while holding safely for second. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) raced in the second
flight while never far back early on, advanced on the backstretch run, came two nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on
well to secure third. SEA OF LIBERTY was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the backstretch run and into the far turn, advanced in upper
stretch and found his best stride in the final sixteenth. ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and was sent to the front, set prompted fractions through the
backstretch run and into the second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch by LORD BRANCUSI, kept on to mid-stretch but weakened in the late going. SAL
N LOUIE settled off of the pace while racing in midpack early on, lost position on the backstretch run and did not offer a late bid. KODIACTION was
forwardly placed while saving ground in the early stages, lost position along the backstretch run, was still within aim in upper stretch but did not have a late
kick in the drive. LOAFERS BOY was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, was asked for run nearing the quarter marker and lacked a
late response.

Footnotes
PRAYER OF JABEZ was hustled leaving the break and was forwardly placed into the turn, kept close attendance to the pace through the turn, overtook the
pacesetter while in hand at the top of the lane, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up.
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE took back off of the early pace, was two wide along the turn while unhurried, advanced in upper stretch under steady urging,
came on in the final sixteenth to challenge the winner and secured the place in the final stages. ALWAYS LITT stalked the early pace, improved position on
the turn, made a two wide bid into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but was well clear for third.
HAVAKASH READY was sent along leaving the break and showed good early speed while setting solid fractions, was confronted by the winner in upper
stretch, met that bid and stayed on into the final furlong but weakened in the late stages. RETIREMENT MISSION chased from midflight and did not mount
a late rally. CARDIFF CRACK chased the early pace, advanced while three wide on the turn and did not have a late kick in the drive. STAN THE HOT MAN
broke a step slow, shied when RETIREMENT MISSION drifted into his path, then steadied when I CAN'T HEAR YOU drifted in front of him, swung widest
into the stretch, lost touch with the field but did manage to pass a few while under a steady drive throughout. HUNTERS GHOST was unable to keep up
early, asked to keep up by her rider passing the half but lacked any kind of response. RING GENERAL mid-pack and five-wide in the early going, remained
wide and was slow to quicken when asked and tired in the late stages. I CAN'T HEAR YOU away well from the rail, attended the early pace to challenge
HAVAKASH READY, then was steadied passing the half-mile pole, attempted to re-engage but began a steady fade from there.
