Footnotes
AWESOME THUNDER hustled from outset to establish a ground saving pose around the turn and led the field at every call for a gate to wire score.
GENTLE GEORGE pressed the pace along the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, angled out at upper stretch, but came up empty in the end.
UNBRIDLED GUY rallied mildly along the rail after giving chase from a ground saving stance. CROSSBOW CIMARRON lacked a needed rally to improve
position after trekking three wide around the turn. SECRET PICASSO trailed from outset and was never involved.

PAID THE PORTER rushed form outset to gain first command, saved ground around the turns, and fended off all rivals for a wire to wire victory. GREAT
REALIZATION trekked the widest of all in opening turn, moved to the two path at halfway point and closed the gap on the frontrunner but was unable to
catch that rival in final furlong. BENTLEY bucked shortly after the start and lost ground on field, tucked to rail, and rallied for the show. IDENTIFY showed
interest in early command by forcing the pace from an inside stance, swung to the two path and made an advancement at the halfway point, but tired in the
late strides. UNOPHABULOSSO retreated rapidly in the latter portion of contest after stalking the pace from a three path stance in opening half.

HEY ROXY hustled from outset and gained first command, saved ground around the turn and inched away from field in final furlong. LUCKILY chased the
pacesetter from between rivals, rated close up and in the two path at upper stretch, but proved no match for winner in final furlong. LADY ABIGAIL tucked to
inside shortly after the start, saved ground through the turn as the innermost rival of three abreast in the second flight, then finished willingly and holding
onto the show. FLAN stalked the front runner from the second flight as the widest of three rivals, maintained that line through the bend and lost ground to
pacesetter, then finished evenly. GRACIE G lost contact with rivals early and failed to threaten.

STRONG WOMAN rushed from outset to set the pace in tandem with MISS COFFEYVILLE, dueled alongside that rival the entire way and proved best in
duel in the end. MISS COFFEYVILLE hustled away at the start and led the field in concert with eventual winner, trekked the two path for the entirety of
contest then was outdueled in final sixteenth. J LOVE settled in behind pacesetting duo, was roused nearing the end of backstretch, angled out at upper
stretch and finished with a rush to be closing fast on leaders at the wire. SILVER POM POM stalked the pacesetters from an inside stance, rated close up
nearing the quarter pole, swung out three wide at upper stretch, but came up empty in the final furlong. HARPERS VISION trailed from outset.

Footnotes
MONET'S DEVIL hustled from outset to share early command as the inner most rival of four abreast, maintained that track along the backstretch, gained
sole command in the final bend and kicked clear in the end. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE trekked wide early, gained a slight advantage at second call, rated
in the two path at upper stretch and was outfinished in the final strides. FROGGY was unhurried in the opening half before rushing up for the show along the
rail in final furlong. PISSARRO'S MANDATE rated alone in the second flight in the early going, traveled the three path throughout and lacked a closing rally.
MAJOR GRIFFIN showed reserve in opening strides then closed gap on the leaders along the backstretch before weakening in the crucial stages.
PERFECTOMUNDO pressed the early pace from between rivals, had the slightest of advantages at the first call, then faded after the half.

WRITTEN PERMISSION trekked three wide into and around the first bend, challenged the pacesetter along the backstretch, gained command inside the
quarter pole while traveling two wide through the final turn, then strided away in the homestretch. DAAHER'S SUCCESS settled into the second flight and
gave chase to the front runner from between foes, was roused in the final bend and finished under a stiff drive to prove second best.
LASTCALLFORALCOHOL was unhurried and chased the field from a back rated stance before closing with a rush in the final furlong to earn the show.
INTERACTIF MOMENT saved ground early, while trekking in the second flight then angled out at upper stretch to no avail. VALID DECISION rushed from
outset to set the pace from an inside pose, relished command near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid.

BELLE gave chase while travelling three wide around first bend before hugging rail in late going to earn the show. QUICK CALISIA improved placing with
late interest after saving ground early and angling out to three wide at upper stretch. BLACK COFFEE BUZZ travelled widest in the first turn and tired in the
crucial stages. GEORGIANO came up empty after leading the second flight around the first turn while saving ground and angling out wide at upper stretch.

Footnotes
HURRAY FOR RHEA hustled away from outset and set pace in tandem as the widest of three, impeded rival nearing the first turn, gained sole command
around the closing turn and held off all rallying rivals in final sixteenth for the score. SHE'S GOT CHROME set he early pace from between rivals, relished
command nearing the final bend, angled out to the three path at upper stretch nd rallied back for the place. MOONSHINE PRINCESS was unhurried in the
early going, trekked the two path, then closed with a rush to be gaining on leaders at the finish. MOONLIGHT BLAZE rushed from outset to dispute the pace
as the inner most rival of three abreast, rated close up throughout and was nipped for show in the stretch duel. DEN'S ROSE gave chase to pacesetting trio
in early strides, was impeded and forced to a wide stance through the first turn, maintained the wide line through the closing bend and finished willingly.
SCORNED LOVER came up empty in the final furlong after leading the second flight from a two path pose and tucking to save ground at upper stretch.
CULEBRA menaced mildly while giving chase from a back rated pose. LANDALAFFIT steadily faded while saving ground.
