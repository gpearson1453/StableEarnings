Footnotes
DIAMONDBACK was well rated on the lead, shrugged off an early challenge on the turn, then was headed at the eighth pole and had enough late to repel
foe in the final sixteenth. KOSMONAVT was rated down the backstretch, loomed outside of horses midway on the turn, collared the winner at the eighth
pole but could not get past the winner in the late stages. RIGHT TO STRIKE pressed the winner throughout the backstretch and turn and levelled out down
the lane. MORE HARDER trailed throughout and passed a tiring for late for a minor share. DANCING DRAGON was away alertly, stalked inside on the
backstretch and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
TWICE AS SMART showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole and held gamely late under all out pressure.
CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE chased the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to narrowly gain the place position. DIXIE
BIN was off a step slow, raced five to six wide and moved up through the drive. TARADAR was allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the far turn
and had not enough in the drive. TARASUS tracked the early leader from the inside down the backstretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile while
racing from the inside. PAPA DOBLES stalked the early going from the inside and had no late response. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF dropped back early, raced
near the inside through the far turn through the stretch and failed to have a response. ZIJJ RUNNER was off a step slow, raced near the inside and never
threatened.

WENJACK steadied briefly at the start, rated just behind the pacesetters on the outside through the turn, took command at the eighth pole and was drawing
away late. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE broke outwards at the start, stalked the leaders, waited on the turn behind horses and angled out in the stretch to finish
well for the place. HALF LIT was away alertly, settled inside behind horses backstretch, angled out widest in the stretch to rally for third. BLIND TRUST
forced the early fractions while outside, was collared by the winner at the eighth pole and leveled out late. KEEN SAMURAI was in a battle for the lead while
inside and faded down the stretch. SEA SCOUT was compromised at the break and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TAKOTA was forwardly placed to lay just off the early leader down the backstretch, moved up to challenge through the far turn and finished well while racing
three deep to edge clear under strong handling. CLASSY N' SILENT showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced near the inside in the stretch run
and was no match for Takota to finish second best. PRETTY RACHEL chased the early leader, raced near the inside around the far turn, raced two deep in
the drive and had not enough late. VALLEY GIRL stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and moved up in the lane to improve position.
EVER SO D'WILD dropped back early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled widest through the lane had no rally. NORTHERN RUBY was
coaxed along early, raced five wide through the far turn and had no late rally. MY FINAL TRICK chased the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a
mile while racing four wide. LIME dropped back early, raced three to two wide and had no response. WICKED MIAH was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE was well rated inside, waited behind horses through the turn, angled outside in the four path and was drawing away late. MOON OVER
MONTANA stalked mid field while outside, was roused on the turn and rallied widest in the stretch to just get up for second money. DYNAMITE KARMA was
mid pack between horses early, loomed into contention at the top of the stretch and ran on just missing the place award. TRANQUILITY BASE vied for the
lead, took command briefly at the eighth pole and flattened out the final sixteenth. EXECUTIVE SIGHT near the rear early, and offered little down the
stretch. COMBATIVE was the early inside speed, was collared at the eighth pole and faded while on the rail. FIRST SPRING was in tight and was shuffled
back around the 5/8 pole, and offered little response from then on. SOBERANO (FR) was near the back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LION KINGDOM was rated patiently behind horses on the final turn, split foes in the stretch and was full of run in the late stages to win drawing away.
DERZKII loomed into contention entering the stretch, took the lead at the eighth pole but could not hold off the winners charge. POUND GREEN set the
pace throughout, was collared at the eighth pole and held well to hold onto third money. CRYPTIC CREED was rated back early on, then circled horses
three wide on the turn to contend and stalled through the final furlong. WENTRU vied for the lead inside and had nothing to offer down the lane. THE
NEWFIE EXPRESS was rated behind the pacesetters early, was outrun on the turn and could not keep up in the stretch.

Footnotes
LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was off slowly, quickly recovered as we coaxed from the inside down the backstretch, moved up three wide in the stretch run and
finished well to get up under strong encouragement. MUSKOKA SUMMER vied for the early lead from the inside and kept on to the wire. DOPPLER was
unhurried early, moved up through the far turn while racing just off the inside, made a good rail bid in the drive rallied for the show position. OHEAVENS
broke in, bumped at the break, stalked the early going, made an outside bid in the drive and had not enough. THE HARD WAY stalked the pace, raced five
wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. CAPTIVATING ART settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced well off the inside in
the stretch run and had not enough. DAZZLING DIVA settled off the pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. SHE MAKES ME TIZZY was
bumped at the break, pressed rivals early on while racing between and faded in the drive. VIVIAN ANN was bumped on both sides at the break, coaxed
along early to lay up close while racing three deep and tired. FREE CARRYCOMB raced far back and never threatened.
