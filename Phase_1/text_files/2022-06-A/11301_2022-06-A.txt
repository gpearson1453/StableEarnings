RYEGATE STONE stalked the pace through the backside engaging rival from the inside on the far turn wresting the lead outside the quarter pole moving to
daylight in upper stretch holding foe at bay while drifting a bit late. PRINCE AMADEUS hustled clear set a quick pace through the backside being hooked
from the inside on the far turn grudgingly ceding into upper stretch staying on to keep the winner honest late. ITS BIG off slowly raced evenly off the pace
through the far turn coming five wide down the lane showing some belated interest. THE HAPPY GIANT saved ground racing evenly to upper stretch tiring
there in the three path. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was never involved. GALLIPOLIS breaking slowly was always outrun. HOOK 'EM JOHN folded up early.

Footnotes
BACK ALLEY CAT set a moderate pace through the backside being challenged from the outside near the quarter pole responding to kick clear in upper
stretch showing to have plenty left there under a vigorous hand ride. AMICUS BRIEF stalked the pace rallying to press bid outside the quarter pole only to
be summarily dispatched by the winner in upper stretch finishing well as a clear second best. JUST U AND ME KID unhurried early angling out while being
roused to bid on the far turn wavering into upper stretch finishing evenly. RUM ON THE ROCKS hustled early retreated while saving ground to upper stretch
weakening there. GENERAL DIRECTION stalked the early pace then folded up on the far turn.
