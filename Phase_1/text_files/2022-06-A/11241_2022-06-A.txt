Footnotes
KIT KAT KIDD balked a bit at loading, broke sharp, narrowly showed the way into the turn closest to the inside, dueled exiting the bend, continued on equal
terms with the runner up past the furlong marker, regained the advantage and was edging away late. STAR SYZYGY broke back, moved up to join the fray
four wide into the turn, dueled outside the winner into and through the length of the stretch, had a head inf front with a furlong remaining, outkicked in the
late going,clearly second best. FREE FROM GUILT broke with the field, fell back off the lead pack, asked along three wide midway on the turn, came four
wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two with a slow gain late. TUCKER THE GRUMP asked early to keep up while between foes, fell back into
the second flight while moving to the inside midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane. REAL ACTION raced briefly forward while inside the runner
up and three wide, also fell back before a quarter, continued to weaken in the drive. COLT'S BRIM dwelt at the start, trailed while four wide through the turn,
remained back down the lane in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
GEORGE ALLEN behind the pace while saving ground, steered out, finished full of run down the middle of the strip, won going away. ZOEY'S HIPPIE broke
alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, gained a slightly larger advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner late, edged clear for the
place. CALL ME COLLECT also away in good order, alternated up front outside the runner up, vied between the top two past the furlong marker then could
not keep up, far clear of the others. JOHNNY JUDE broke back, continued to lack speed through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
serious threat. HONORABLESTATEMENT went one paced throughout while racing three wide. COUNT ON RAIN made little impact while racing four wide.
WILD FIST fell back to trail soon after the start and showed little.

Footnotes
FREE LIKE A GIRL broke behind the leaders, moved up to press the issue midway on the first turn under her own courage, dueled through some
quickening fractions in the two path up the backstretch, salted away the other speed turning for home to be well clear a furlong out, kept to task late to hold
the runner up safe. WHOLELOTTAMO bothered at the break to be last away, raced back and toward the inside, asked along three furlongs out,, steered out
turning for home, finished willingly to be slowly getting to the winner late, far clear of the others. FIRST I'VE SEEN broke out to help tighten up and bother
the runner up, fell back to trail, continued to lack speed in the run up the backstretch off the inside, lodged a middle move three wide midway on the final
turn to be closest to the two leaders, failed to sustain that advance through the lane. BELEOUT broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn inside,
dueled the middle half mile inside the winner, caved in entering the stretch to lose a couple of positions. COURTLY DOC broke in to help tighten up
WHOLELOTTAMO, raced in the second flight while outside, was finished after four furlongs. SERAPE away in good order, raced forward early off the
inside, also began a steady fade after four furlongs, jogged in well back.

Footnotes
BIG CHOPPER broke well, cleared to the inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch while still in hand, let out a notch entering the stretch in the two
path, found more late under brisk right handed pressure to dig in and narrowly prevail in game fashion. VODKA GIMLET settled behind the two leaders
along the inside, continued to save ground when moving closer turning in to the stretch, shifted outside the winner's right shoulder for room inside the
furlong grounds, grinding late to be slowly getting to that one while holding sway for the second spot. TOUCHUPONASTAR a bit restless in the gate, broke
with the winner off the inside, pressed that one from the outside up the backstretch, called on for run in the second turn, made little progress into and
through upper stretch, could not contain the runner up late while three deep at the wire. MORE MEMORIES settled off the pace in the two path through the
first turn, moved out, was within striking distance turning into the stretch, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. COSMIC TRAIN last to leave,
continued to trail for five furlongs, was never dangerous in lacking a closing response. FORGED IN STEEL in mid pack early after breaking out, stopped
after a half, fell far back, well beaten.

Footnotes
NET A BEAR unhurried early while off the inside, moved briefly closer three wide into the far turn, lost some position in traffic and between rivals turning for
home, set down when clear for the drive, finished with good late energy to win going away. WORLD WAR closest to the early leader, vied between into far
turn, took over in the two path soon after, shook clear into the lane, proved no match for the winner late while proving game for 2nd. GREAT IN RED
allowed the pace to go early, moved closer in the three path before a half, pressed through the second turn, challenged outside the runner up inside the
furlong marker, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. SHE'S GONE D'WILD in the second flight, shuffled back in traffic
late backstretch, encountered traffic again late in the final turn, improved upper stretch, then saw that advance flattened out a bit late. AKIANE'S SOLDIER
last to leave, four wide through the first turn when well back, continued outside, four wide again through the second bend, came up empty for the stretch run.
SUMITUP broke sharp, soon sprinted well clear past the wire the first time, continued to show the way onto the backstretch, confronted with just under a half
mild remaining then gave way when headed soon after.

Footnotes
FAME FEATHER outrun in the early going, asked along into the turn, made a steady advance through the bend in the two path, shifted out a bit to the three
wide for the drive, finished with good resolve to be up in time. SPIRITED BEAUTY forwardly placed while racing off the inside, asked, moved closest to the
leader through the turn, took over from the outside past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late while holding sway for the place.
SNOWBALL last away, trailed up the backstretch, began to move midway on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the
top two late while outside that pair. STRONG BEAUTY forwardly placed inside in the run up the backstretch while closest to the inside, stalled late in the
turn, encountered some traffic into the lane, within striking distance just off the inside with a furlong remaining, lacked the needed closing punch.
SCARLETT O'HARA in mid pack for three furlongs off the inside, four wide exiting the turn, roused, failed to muster a significant response to go evenly to
the wire. LADY HOPPER broke alertly, cleared soon after, showed the way into and through the turn, weakened when headed by the runner up when
straightened for home. MISS NITAP was finished early while racing four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S GALAXY broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, shrugged off his closest rival and rebroke approaching the furlong marker, stayed clear to the
wire while being kept to task. CREOLE CHARLIE in mid pack while off the inside early, raced three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, finished
willingly while out in the strip to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. TAKES TWO TO TANGO move dup to be forwardly placed while
well wide into the turn, four path through the bend, bid outside the winner turning for home, flattened out a bit and was caught late for the place, narrowly
held the show. BLACK SWORD forwardly placed early along the inside after breaking with the winner, shuffled back a bit early in the turn, continued to save
ground, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. WIN YA WIN back off the pace while three wide, improved a bit while not posing a serious
threat. YANKEE SEVEN broke near the front, raced forwardly and three wide for just over three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. ALTERANA broke
out, raced in the lead pack early in the two path, fell back after a quarter and continued to weaken through the lane. RELENTLESS DANCER broke near the
back, four wide through the turn, failed to rally. MICAJAH off slowly, remained back while racing four wide through the turn. BRIMESTONE KID broke in the
air, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MAGA MAN allowed the three early leaders to go onto the main track, moved closer off the inside into the far turn, floated out four wide in to the lane by the
leader, engaged that one approaching the furlong marker, finished with good determination to prove narrowly best under brisk handling. JACI'S ROYALTY
void of early foot, asked along and began to advance in the two path far turn, steered out to the five path and widest into the straight, closed with good
energy to be up for the place at the wire. BEHEMAH STAR broke forwardly, raced with the heated pace three wide, gained a slight advantage midway on
the final turn, led the winner into the lane to that one's inside, continued to hold a slight advantage with a furlong remaining, proved stubborn to the end.
CITY PARK broke back, lacked speed for over five furlongs, began a steady advance three then four wide out of the final turn, continued to grind through
the lane while remaining well out in the course, narrowly missed the show. BRITTS A CLOSER settled in the main body well off the pace, three wide
through the second turn,improved improve the stretch to briefly challenge a furlong out then flattened out to lose a couple of positions late. BEAUREGARD
in mid pack, raced between rivals in the second turn, also bettered himself in upper stretch, flat late to also lack a closing punch. JAX MAN in the main body
as well while saving ground, fell back after a half, continued to race the inside second turn, failed to response in the drive. TREYS MIDNITE MOON last to
leave, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MANGELSEN away well, with the pace while between
foes, gave way late in the final turn, continued to back up stretch. FORESTDUNGONE broke sharp, quickly cleared to the inside onto the main track, set
most of the pace, giving way when rank turning for home, continued to back up to the wire.

Footnotes
ROUX BANDIT with the early pace in the two path, fell back off the two leaders in the turn, came three wide for the drive, rebid a furlong out, edged clear
under a firm right handed crop. ZIPITY vied early up the backstretch, dueled through the turn in the two path, held the advantage between foes with a
furlong remaining, could not match the winner late, remained clear for the place. LES AND MADGE back off the pace after being bumped at the start, raced
back and outside, four wide when asked along turn, continued to rally down the middle of the strip to be up for the show. LOCO LUCY with the first flight
early inside, shuffled back along the rail a half mile out, two path into the lane, improved position a bit with some mild late interest. T J'S SUNSHINE in the
second flight outside, moved closer turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run. HER GREAT GRANDPA slow to settle in falling back to trail early,
five wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest. LA SMOOCHIE with the early pace while between foes, dueled up front while closest to
the inside, caved in through the stretch. COSMIC BELLE broke out to bump LES AND MADGE, bobbled to fall back, improved position through some traffic.
GALAXY AFFAIR went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. SHEZA SHERIF last to leave, remained back in failing to threaten. COURT IN
SESSION in mid pack early, began a steady retreat three wide in the turn. SUNSET FLASH was finished early while racing five wide.
