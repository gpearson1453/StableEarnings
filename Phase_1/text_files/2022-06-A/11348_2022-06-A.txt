Footnotes
AWESOME FAMILY stalked from outside, went three wide on the turn, took over near the three-sixteenths, drew clear and was kept to the task. FLASHY
RICHIE received several light bumps just after the break, raced outside rivals in the back half of the field going three to four wide on the turn, kept on to
secure the place late but was no threat to the winner. WILD WES broke in and bumped a rival then was forced by that one into the outside rival exchanged
several light but repeated bumps, shifted in heading to the turn to race mostly in the two path on that bend, came out a bit in the stretch, was outfinished for
second. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was bumped then in turn bumped a foe at the start, went two wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch, ran on with mild
late interest to improve position. DAY IN THE COUNTRY moved clear to dictate terms inside, gave way in the lane. RAHFEE TOWN switched outside the
leading pair to track in the two path, came out a bit further on the turn, was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
NIFF bumped the inner rival lightly at the start then was coaxed clear and shifted in to the two path to dictate terms, set the pace still racing off the rail,
drifted out a bit in late stretch despite right-handed encouragement and held a rival at bay. GOLDEN GOPHER stalked the winner three wide, drifted out a
bit in upper stretch, kept on to close the gap but could not get past while clearly second best. READY AT MIDNIGHT was light bumped at the start, carried
three to four wide heading into the first turn then tucked in two deep, attempted to move forward leaving the first turn but had to tap on the brakes when in
tight, moved between foes about the nine-sixteenths then shifted in heading to the far turn and taking closer order on the leaders, lacked the needed late
kick. LOCASH raced two to three wide early off the leaders, went two deep on the far turn, came out in upper stretch but failed to produce a rally. UNION
PARK GAL (IRE) settled into stride early, switched out heading to the first turn, moved out further from two to four wide on that bend, continued three deep
on the far turn, failed to threaten. JOY ENAMORADA rated in behind the leaders on or just off the rail into the first turn, was shuffled back a bit at the
nine-sixteenths, appeared to be getting out near the five-sixteenths and given right-handed correction at that juncture, failed to produce a bid. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION, HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL moved to the fore quickly to set the pace inside while pressed from outside by a rival and racing just off the rail, edged clear in the
stretch, was given confidently handling and held safe from SUNDAY SCHEMING, who lacked gate speed, angled out early but was in tight at that juncture
and forced back in, saved ground on the turn, came out a bit turning for home, rallied to close the gap but was only second best. SUPERSTAR DIVA
pressed outside the winner three wide into and through the turn, weakened in the lane. SACRED STORM tracked mid-pack, went two then three wide on
the turn, came out further in upper stretch, failed to produce a rally. A FAST BROAD chased briefly from outside, went three to four wide on the turn and
came up empty. FLYING BUSINESS raced toward the rear in behind three wide into the turn, came out five deep late on that bend and was never near
enough to threaten.

Footnotes
BETTER THINK TWICE raced inside into the first turn then moved out a path late on that bend steadying ever so slightly near the three-quarter marker,
moved back in heading to the far turn, saved ground early on that bend before coming out a bit, kept on determinedly through the stretch with room between
runners late to get the nod. SIMPLE LOGIC was caught three to four wide on the first turn between runners stalking the leading pair, edged closer up the
backstretch and moved in a bit, challenged for the lead on the far turn going three wide, took a narrow advantage, drifted out a tad in upper stretch, fought
on gamely but was outfinished. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN bumped the outer rival lightly at the start then promptly angled in, raced on or just off the rail well
back of the leaders early, began to advance inside on the far turn, shifted out gradually through the length of the stretch for room and was gaining fast but
too late. SUPRISE CAT vied inside heading into the first turn, eased off the leader late on that bend and moved out a bit, shifted from two to four wide on the
far turn, posed a threat in the lane but was simply outkicked. DEORA STORE vied two wide into the first turn then moved clear to set the tempo, was
challenged into the far turn, kept on through the stretch but was outkicked. ROAR OF THE LION settled at the rear three wide through the first turn, moved
to the rail late up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came out in late stretch and showed late interest. MISTER CHARMING was forced four to
five wide on the first turn, moved in while dropping back into the far turn going three wide on that bend, came out turning for home and was not a threat.
EMPTY HOLSTER stalked two to three wide early, floated five wide into the stretch, came up empty. COMING UP ACES was lightly bumped at the start,
raced two to three wide on the turns far back, angled six wide at the top of the stretch and was not a factor.

MARYHADALITTLELAM stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, drove past late. DOLLY'S LINE brushed a rival at the start, dueled outside a
different foe, put that one away to edge clear in the stretch but was outfinished. LADY WHITE SOX tracked from inside, was abruptly taken up and veered
out past the half-mile marker dropping well back, came again in the stretch to get up for show. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY dueled inside, weakened. LORI
ATTACK was brushed lightly at the start, tracked from between runners early then kept on two to three wide through the turn, needed more in the stretch.
USA USA USA broke a step slowly and was lightly bumped, trailed early, swung five wide, failed to menace. FEATURED POWER went two to three wide on
the turn, failed to rally. LADY BABA bobbled into a rival at the start and checked, shifted in, had no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
TEST PILOT was reluctant to load, came in soon after the start forcing a chain-reaction inward while being urged forward, set the pace in the two to three
path through the turn, drifted out in late stretch and held. NO MORE Z U was forced into rivals early, chased the aforementioned three to four wide, was
carried out late by that one. J J'S SOLUTION was bumped early, chased inside on or just off the rail, kept on. YO DAWG was bounced around between
runners early, went three wide on the turn, ran on. LORD DYLAN was in just a hair tight after the break, settled four wide into the turn, swung seven wide
out of that bend and wider still once in upper stretch. B G ATTACK was bounced around and squeezed back early, raced on then just off the rail on the turn,
needed more. LUKE ATTACK had to alter out sharply early to avoid mishap, went two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. RAZ COUNTRY broke
awkwardly and about four lengths slowly, raced just off the inside and was not a factor. CAMARGO was bumped and checked sharply about sixteenth out of
the gate. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS' CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY. IN ADDITION, THE RIDERS OF B G ATTACK AND NO MORE Z U
ALL LODGED OBJECTIONS AGAINST TEST PILOT ALLEGING INTEFERENCE. AS WELL, THE RIDER OF YO DAWG CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST NO
MORE Z U. UPON REVIEW, TEST PILOT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED LAST FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO NUMEROUS
HORSES UP THE BACKSTRETCH WHILE THE LATTER OBJECTION WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY raced outside three wide early, moved to challenge after going three then four wide on the far turn, struck a narrow lead in late stretch and
just lasted from a rallying foe. CLEAR N CONVINCING tracked inside on then just off the rail, angled out about the furlong marker for room, once clear
rallied strongly to be gaining but too late. LAVENDER EARL bumped the outside rival at the start, stalked two to three wide then edged closer to force the
issue up the backstretch, had a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, was headed in upper to mid-stretch but fought on well. JOLTING JOE was bumped
between rivals at the start, settled toward the rear two to three wide, angled seven wide in upper stretch and gained late. DIAMOND DAVE bumped the
inside foe at the start, settled toward the rear shifting in, raced on or just off the rail till the stretch, came out and gained mildly. CAMMACK came in after the
break, was forwardly positioned tracking two wide into the first turn, rode the rail in behind into the far turn, moved out three wide near the five-sixteenths,
made a bid in upper- to mid-stretch but flattened out. DRAMATIC KITTEN saved ground inside mid-pack till upper stretch, altered out a bit nearing the
furlong marker and ran on evenly. JUST GUN IT set the pace inside on or just off the rail, dueled late up the backstretch into the far turn then weakened.
GAGOOTS broke awkwardly and steadied slightly, settled at the rear in the two to three path, was never a threat.

DR. ANN tracked from inside, switched outside the leader about the three-sixteenths, struck the lead just past the sixteenth pole and held. SAY CHEESE
stalked from between runners, went two then four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was bumped past the eighth pole and kept on to gain
steadily late but missed. BAILESTON LASSIE quickly moved clear to dictate terms racing just off the rail, came back nearer the rail in upper stretch, was
outkicked. AVASARALA was within striking distance three wide on the turn, lugged out and bumped a rival past the furlong marker and flattened out.
ORDAINED KISS was loaded riderless, broke out just a bit, lacked the early speed of the others, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to produce a
bid.

THE LAST OPTION stalked the dueling leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, took aim and drove past late then held off a late charging rival. OUR
THOMAS broke a bit awkwardly then settled into stride, went to three wide on the turn, came out in the stretch and was gaining late. W W KAN DO dueled
inside a rival on or just off the rail, was outkicked. HALO HUNTER dueled outside two to three wide, weakened. OFFLEE FUN shifted in early, saved ground
on the turn, failed to menace. GIVIN UP NONE switched out past the half going two to three wide on the turn, faded. GRAND HIDEAWAY bobbled slightly at
the break and was not a factor. Z U SOON tracked mid-pack early, appeared to move awkwardly past the half-mile marker, was pulled up and vanned off.
