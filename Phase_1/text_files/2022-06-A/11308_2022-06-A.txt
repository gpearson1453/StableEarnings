Footnotes
GAGETOWN was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, then brushed with an inner rival in the early stages before settling in a four wide
stalking position, inched closer to vie for the lead outside of the leading pair at the three furlong pole, then edged clear entering the final furlong. EMERALD
EXPRESS took a bump from an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace three wide early on, vied two wide and between horses around the turn as
GAGETOWN loomed large, then failed to keep pace with that foe in midstretch, and held place through the late stages. PICO D'ORO broke outwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, then bumped with an inner BELFAST BOY while brushing with an outer GAGETOWN in the opening furlong, laid close up along
the inside, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, shifted two wide turning for, then four wide in upper stretch in pursuit of the top pair, and stayed on late.
BELFAST BOY broke a step slowly at the start, then steadied when put to tight quarters along the rail in the opening furlong, tracked two wide into the turn,
got floated five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. BOHEMIAN BOY set the pace two wide before being hounded by a pair of outer rivals around the
turn after his inner counterpart backed off, and weakened approaching the lane. SANTA CRUISER bobbled at the start, chased in the five path around the
turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
HOMETOWN HERO stalked four to three wide into the turn, ranged up to a leading NORTH BAY entering the lane, forged an advantage approaching the
final furlong, cleared entering the final sixteenth as ONE MORE BABY gave chase, and held safely from that foe late. ONE MORE BABY tracked two wide,
came under a heavy drive three wide into the turn, chased the leaders around the bend before shifting four wide entering the lane, grinded away to take aim
on a leading HOMETOWN HERO in the final furlong, but did not have enough to reach that rival while gaining place. NORTH BAY pressed three wide,
tugged forward to bid for the lead at the half mile pole, vied outside of ON SPOT into the turn, cleared approaching the five sixteenths pole, met
HOMETOWN HERO's bid entering the lane, battled with that foe through upper stretch, but was headed approaching the furlong grounds, and yielded
entering the final sixteenth. TREATY tracked in midpack in the two path, moved up in the four path and between horses passing the quarter pole, and
stayed on mildly. B G LEE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted out in upper stretch, and improved between horses. TRICOLOUR trailed in the two path,
and failed to factor. SNOWSCAPE took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and was outrun. SENSIBLE JIM was urged along four wide while
off of the pace around the turn, and faded five wide entering the lane. MIZZEN MAN prompted the pace two wide and between horses leaving the chute, but
failed to keep pace with those rivals at the half mile pole, chased them from the two path around the turn, but tired through the lane. ON SPOT set the pace
along the inside, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

ACTUATOR vied for the lead two wide, disposed of his inner counterpart as an outer HIPPODROME made his presence known, but swiftly repelled that
rival when set down passing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and inched further away under driving pressure. HIPPODROME chased three
wide, ranged up outside of ACTUATOR turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and was clearly second best. BOONE'S PATH took the
turn in the four path while void of early speed, fanned six wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to reach show in the closing stages. GENERAL
STRIKE set the pace inside of a vying ACTUATOR, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. STAND FOR FREEDOM saved ground off of the pace,
then committed to a rail charge through the lane, chased to bid for show in the final sixteenth, and flattened out late. JONAS' DREAM broke a step slowly
before tossing his head at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path swung five wide entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick before getting
outkicked for a minor placing in the final furlong. PAPA ROCKET tracked in the three path and between horses around the turn, but lacked a kick in upper
stretch, and tired among rivals in the late stages. AFJAN stalked along the inside, then a bit off of the inner railing around the turn, chased between horses
entering the lane, but faded. BENDETTIJOE tracked four wide, but tired between horses in midstretch. YORK TAVERN lagged well behind the field into the
turn, then cut the gap on the field late.

Footnotes
TWO SIXTYONE established a clear margin early, maintained that loose lead around the far turn, widened her advantage entering the lane, and held sway
under driving pressure. VIBURNUM trailed in the three path, swung seven wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes while flopping back to her left lead
entering the final furlong, and sustained her bid to reach place in the final sixteenth. CELESTIAL SPIN laid off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room
behind rivals turning for home, split foes three wide entering the lane while improving position, got floated further out in upper stretch while chasing, ran on
to bid for place entering the final sixteenth as an outer VIBURNUM rallied to do the same, and got outkicked for that position. WAYWARDNESS stalked
along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch while chasing a clear TWO SIXTYONE, flopped back to her left lead entering the final furlong, and tired inside
of a pair of rivals in the final sixteenth. OFF WE GO tracked two to three wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn, but faded five wide and between
horses in upper stretch. SPARKLE OF HOPE stalked two wide, pursued the loose leader from between horses around the far turn, got floated four wide
entering the lane, and yielded between horses approaching midstretch. HATARI settled off of the pace along the inside, was driven along four wide to gain
ground around the far turn, but lacked a response, fanned six wide entering the lane, and gave way.

Footnotes
INDIAN GULCH rated at the rear two wide, improved inside of rivals passing the quarter pole, rallied in pursuit of the clear but tiring leader in the final
furlong, and reeled in that rival approaching the wire. HOME RUN TRICK set a clear pace in the two path, met EXULTING's challenge entering the lane,
swiftly repelled that foe in upper stretch, shook away to a clear margin once again, but tired in the final furlong, and was worn down a few strides from the
wire. LEADER OF MEN laid off of the pace along the inside, chased two wide and between horses around the far turn, then stayed on. TIZ LIGHT THE
WAY tracked from off of the pace in the three path, moved up to vie for show entering the lane, but yielded between horses in upper stretch. BEAR OAK
took the turns in the four path while off of the pace, got floated five wide entering the lane, and gave way. EXULTING stalked outside of the pace setter while
in the four path, pursued that foe in the three path around the far turn, attempted a bid entering the lane under a stern drive, but was turned away in upper
stretch, and weakened. EAGLE PASS laid at the rear along the inside, and was outrun. HIGHER AUTHORITY stalked along the inside, but faded around
the far turn.
