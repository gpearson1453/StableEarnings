PRINCESS HALIME loomed four wide on the turn, took a brief lead entering the stretch, and finished well but could not hold off the winner. SNEAKY
REBEL was near the rear in the early stages, angled out in the stretch to rally for a clear third. IS THERE A FOREST was rated mid pack between runners
and closed belatedly for a minor share. J M R GEMMA vied for the lead, was collared entering the stretch and faded down the lane. BABY MO sat behind
the leaders on the rail, waited for room on the turn, and ran evenly through the stretch. BLU SKY SUNRISE stalked mid pack inside, waited behind horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. LINDA LOVES LACE showed speed, was collared turning for home and stopped. CALL ME KITTY chased between
horses, was roused on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MY REDEMPTION broke in, bumped at the start, settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn, raced five wide through the upper stretch, came
in near the eighth pole Cousin Rob to take up sharply, an objection was filed and My Redemption was disqualified and placed fifth by order of the stewards.
SPIRAL STORM was unhurried in the early stages, moved along the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid in the stretch run and finished gamely
to the wire. MY BOY CHRISTIAN was off slowly, rushed from the in the inside to duel in the early stages and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile.
TREBUCHET dueled for the early while racing just off the inside, was clear near the eighth pole and weakened in the final stages. COUSIN ROB settled off
the early pace, raced near the inside near the quarter pole, shifted four to five wide in the stretch, checked sharply near the eighth pole due to rival impeding
his action and was moved ahead of My Redemption and placed fourth. MOBILIZER settled off the early going, raced four wide through the upper stretch
and never was a factor. WILKABEE RUSH was bumped at the break, stalked the pace and tired. SOCIAL JUSTICE raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
COMMANDER JOE stalked the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and finished well in the drive to edge clear late under steady handling.
CAPE COD pressed the pace, raced two deep in the stretch drive, led deep stretch and was wore down late. RAT PORTAGE was allowed to settle early on,
raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up. RAISE A PROFIT vied for the early lead from the inside down the backstretch and weakened
a bit the final eighth of a mile while racing off the inside late. PINK GELATO was unhurried early on, raced five through the upper stretch and had not
enough the drive. SCENIC HOLIDAY settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the lane and had no response. CONDITIONAL was off slowly, raced
at the back of the pack early on, saved ground and had no response. SILENT RISK was coaxed along the inside early on and tired. BIG WARDEN failed to
sustain a bid.

Footnotes
TOLD IT ALL chased the leader throughout while just outside and wore down that rival in the final sixteenth. SWOT ANALYSIS was well rated while setting
all the fractions and was game down the lane but could not hold off the winner in the final stages. CASH DIVIDEND stalked between horses, was roused
entering the stretch and finished up well between foes for third. SOUPER DORMY was in a stalking position, loomed up three wide in the stretch while
outside horses and levelled off the final eighth. SILENT RUNNER was near the rear and never entered contention. SOLIDIFY trailed and was never a factor.
HAPPYMAC stalked early, then moved up inside on the turn to contend but stopped through the stretch.

MACCOOL'S GIRL broke a bit awkward, was rated down under a firm hold early on, moved up three to four wide in the drive and got up under strong
handling. VIVID VIXEN settled off the early pace, swung out five wide through the upper stretch and closed in gamely late. SECRETARYOFTHENILE
showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in through the stretch and gave way grundingly late. DANCE WITH DESTINY hit the gate at the break,
was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MOQADAMA (IRE) was slow early on, moved up along the
inside through the far turn, raced near the rail in the drive, experienced traffic near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. LADY MOONSHINE settled off
the early pace, raced in a bit tight near the sixteenth pole, shifted three wide and had not enough. BROKEN PROPOSAL was allowed to settle early on,
raced four wide in the drive and had no rally. ASTONISH raced towards the inside and had no response. RIGHT MATTERS dropped back early, raced four
wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOIRA rated outside horses at the early part, circled four wide on the turn to take the lead at the eighth pole and finished well holding off a late challenger.
PIONEER'S EDGE brushed the gate on the break, settled through the backstretch ,waited on the turn behind horses then angled out widest turning for
home and was gaining on the winner with every stride. AUBRIETA was stalking three wide on the turn, loomed up to the lead turning for home, rallied well
but could not keep pace with the top two. SOUPER FLASHY chased the early speed, contended for the lead at the quarter pole while between horses, and
was outkicked the final eighth. INTO TOURING trailed early, never entered into contention but passed tiring rivals down the stretch. SUGAR IS GOLDEN
stalked inside while racing mid pack, waited on the turn and offered little down the lane. MOMMASGOTTARUN took command early, led through the turn
while saving ground, headed at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch while in tight on the rail.

Footnotes
SEASONS was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside down the backstretch, angled six wide through the upper stretch, came in a bit near the
eighth pole, was straightened and edged clear under strong pressure. GUILEFUL pressed the pace, raced two to three wide in the stretch run and kept on
to the wire. LIDO KEY was rated along in the early stages, angled wide through the upper lane and finished willingly to the wire. EPHRATA (GB) stalked the
pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. UMNEYAAT stalked the pace early pace, raced two wide while racing
between rivals and had not enough in the drive. BLAZING SKY showed good early speed and weakened while racing near the inside. MISS MARIE was
forced to check in the early going, settled off the pace, raced four to five wide and had no rally. LUZ DE LA LUNA broke in sharply, dropped back early,
raced two three wide in the lane and never was a factor. PHILLY EAGLES (IRE) raced in tight early, raced near the inside and never threatened.

ROSEBUD'S HOPE was away alertly, took command soon after the start, well rated throughout and had more than enough left to repel any challenges.
PEACE SEEKER was stalking while outside of horses, rallied gamely through the stretch but could not catch the winner and was a clear second. SWEET
SERENADE chased the leader throughout and finished well while holding onto third. AFLEET KATHERINE was rated mid pack between horses and closed
mildly down the lane to get a minor share. GOTE GO saved ground throughout and ran evenly late while passing tiring horses. SARATOGA VISION was
rated in mid pack through the backstretch and turn, roused in the stretch but had little to offer for the finish. MADEMOISELLE NOVA chased the leader
inside and faded through the field in the stretch. PERSEVERANCIA trailed early, then moved seven wide entering the stretch to contend but tired the final
eighth. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

PATIO PARTY stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside through the far turn into the stretch and finished well to prove best under strong
encouragement. SAME AGAIN DOC pressed the early leader from the outside, led narrowly inside the inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with
the winner late while racing three wide. ACTION POINT stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced four to five wide through the stretch run and moved
up late. TWO YEAR CONTRACT was bumped at the break, stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced five wide in the lane and had not enough.
SUMMER HARRY was bumped, took up at the break, dropped back early on, moved up five wide through the far turn and had no final winning bid in the
drive. SILVER SIGNATURE settled off the pace, raced towards the outside in the drive and had no closing run. DOC FISHMAN was unhurried early on,
raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. MOJO JOJO was slow early, raced towards the outside in the stretch run and never
threatened. SENSIBLE PORTIONS was off slowly, dropped near the back of the pack, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and
never was a factor. CHOICE PLAYER was coaxed along early to press the pace from the inside and faded in the stretch run.
