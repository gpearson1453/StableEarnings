STANLEY RYDER saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch, responded when challenged, but could not resist the winner.
INQUISITION was unhurried early, moved forward on the turn, split rivals entering the stretch and finished in a mile rally. CLARENCE HEADS was four to
five-wide throughout and made up some ground late. PREACHINATDINNER steadied slightly nearing the three-eighths pole in traffic along the inside and
failed to threaten thereafter. MOBJACK prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and weakened nearing the stretch.

CAPTAIN DASHI saved ground while being allowed to settle in side, moved up on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and was up in the final eighth to
win drawing clear. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE saved ground while being unhurried early, swung out for the stretch run and finished well for the place. IOWA KID
sprinted clear early, saved ground seeing the pace, but was unable to resist the top two late. COASTING was bumped at the start by Imissbaymeadows,
then moved up along the outside to force the pace and weakened late. IMISSBAYMEADOWS stumbled badly at the start, then came in to bump with
Coasting, moved up to be prominently place on the turn and gave way leaving the three-eights pole.

Footnotes
GOLD N GLITTER was brushed at the start by Smiling Salsa, then saved ground while being allowed to settle, improved her position on the turn, angled out
for the drive and was up in the final strides. ZAZEN sprinted clear early, set the pace in hand while racing slightly removed from the rail, responded when
challenged and just missed. ENCHANTING WAY stalked the early pace, angled out three-wide for the drive and finished in a mild rally. SMILING SALSA
broke in to brush with the winner, launched a three-wide bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. AKASI lacked early speed,
swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. WEGOTTODRINKING had his saddle slip shortly after the start and was not a
factor thereafter.

IT'S CURLIN TIME allowed to settle in stretch, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final strides. SHIRL'S HOUSE broke in, then
saved ground while stalking the pace, swung out to come two-wide into the stretch, caught Feather Inthe Wind nearing the sixteenth pole, but was unable to
resist the winner late. FEATHER INTHE WIND saved ground setting the pace to deep stretch, but lacked the needed late response. COASTING IN broke
out, then saved ground, but lacked a rally. HELLS CROSSING was off a step slow and was outrun thereafter. AMERICAN RIDGE steadied from between
horses at the start and was unable to recover.
