Footnotes
SATANTA was unhurried through the early stages, trailed through the turn while saving ground, advanced in upper stretch, tipped out nearing the furlong
marker and overtook the leading the pair and held safely in the end under steady urging. CONTINENTAL UNION settled off of the fast early pace, came
outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. DARKSABER
was hustled leaving the break and set quick early fractions while pressed through the turn, dueled with EXCESSIVE CAT to the furlong marker, was tiring in
midstretch when confronted by the winner but stayed on in the end to hold for third. EXCESSIVE CAT broke alertly and engaged with DARKSABER in the
early stages to contest the pace, pressed the speed along the turn, dueled with DARKSABER to the furlong marker but could not sustain that run and
faltered in the late going. KNOCKOUT BERT chased the quick pace from the inside, advanced in upper stretch but could not go on with that bid and
flattened out in the final stages. QUIET CHARM was a bit washy leading up to the start, chased the fast pace from the second flight, came three wide
through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch but gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
TIZ A THRILL settled off of the early pace while saving ground, was well placed through the backstretch run and into the far turn, closed on the tiring
pacesetter in mid-stretch and made a late push to prevail. BLUE SILVER was sent leaving the break and set the pace while carving out moderate fractions,
extended the lead along the second turn to be clear into upper stretch, was tiring in the final stages and was tagged by the oncoming winner and held safely
for second. COUSIN MARK settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, maintained position through the second turn, was roused to go three wide
into the drive, finished well in the final stages and could not reel in the top pair but secured third in the end. WHISPER AND WINK was unhurried in the early
going, saved all of the ground into the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch and made a belated bid in the stretch run. AFRICAN PRINCE showed
early speed and attended to the moderate pace, lost ground along the second turn and tired in the drive. BIG WILD WEST was forwardly placed into the first
turn while three wide, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch run and into the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final
stages. ASANO'S BACK ducked in at the start and was a bit green in the early running, lagged through the first half-mile and was not a factor in the end.

Footnotes
COLORMEMONEY broke alertly and took back off of the early pace, advanced on the turn, overtook the pacesetter in hand in upper stretch and drew clear
in the final stages. SUNSET DRAGUNN bobbled at the start and was off slowly, rushed into contention in the early stages and was not far back into the turn,
came three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive but just got the nod for second in the final strides. THAT'S BIND BABE chased the
solid early pace from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was just nipped for second on the wire while clear for
third. KING EDDIE came under a tight hold in the early going while just off of the pace, was steered three wide nearing the quarter marker and did not offer
a late rally. CASH LIMIT lacked early speed to the turn, gained a bit of ground while outside of rivals on the turn, ran evenly to the stretch and did not have a
late response. SLEEP OVER showed early speed and was sent to the front, set solid fractions through the turn, was overtaken by COLORMEMONEY in
upper stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SHOT OF A LIFETIME was hustled to the front leaving the start, contested the early pace on the first turn then inched away on the backstretch run, put
away AMERICA GREAT along the second turn, was kept to task and pulled away in the final stages. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) stalked the early pace,
was a bit keen and under a snug hold into the backstretch run, tipped out nearing the top of the stretch, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to earn the
nod for second in a close finish for the minor awards. DESERT DUDE stalked the early pace from a two wide path, came four wide into the stretch run, lost
ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in the late stages and just missed for second while getting up in the last stride to secure third. AMERICA GREAT was sent
leaving the start and kept close attendance to SHOT OF A LIFETIME through the backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn, remained in
contention into upper stretch but did not have the needed late response. DEALERS HAND settled off of the decent pace, came two wide while improving
position on the second turn and lacked a late rally. SYNC saved ground while settling just off of the pace, lost position on the second turn and did not offer a
late bid.

Footnotes
MAN OH MAN crowded STOLEN VOTE at the start, showed good early speed to the turn, stalked the quick pace to the top of the stretch, steadily gained
on MEADOWOOD in midstretch and wore down that rival to prevail in a drive. MEADOWOOD broke alertly and set the quick early pace, was tracked by the
winner through the turn and into upper stretch, could not hold off MAN OH MAN in midstretch and was outfinished, while holding for the place over an
oncoming rival. CHUCKANUT BAY chased the quick pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch and responded
well in the final stages to just miss for second, while clear of the rest for third. TANGLEDUPINGREY chased the quick pace from midpack, came three wide
into the drive, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly. IDAHO ONCE was forwardly placed early on, tracked the pace from a two wide path on the
turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. STOLEN VOTE was crowded by MAN OH MAN at the start then shied away from that
crowding and was off slowly, was void of early speed, improved position while saving ground on the turn, rallied in the drive and finished well in the end but
could not make an impact. CHARBONNEAU chased the early pace from toward the rear, was rank and lugged out entering the turn, recovered nearing the
top of the stretch but was not a factor. MOTHER'S PRAYER chased the quick early pace from midpack, lost position on the turn while two wide and faded in
the drive.

TOM'S SURPRISE was content to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter marker, circled the field to
go four wide into the stretch, made a strong late run to overtake JUNGLE CRY inside of the sixteenth-marker and won in a drive. JUNGLE CRY was
forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid pace while saving ground through the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, vied for the lead
nearing the furlong marker, took the lead into the final sixteenth, was overtaken in the final stages by the winner and held safely for second in the end.
MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke alertly and took command of the early pace, set solid early fractions into the backstretch run, went clear nearing the half-mile
marker, came under pressure approaching the top of the lane, stayed on to midstretch but was outkicked in the late going, while clear of the rest for second.
SEATTLE BOLD was away in good order and took back off of the early pace to stalk while three wide on the first turn, advanced on the second turn from
that three wide path, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, gave ground in upper stretch and did not have a late response. LONG LANCE settled just
off of the early pace, kept a three wide path through the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally.
CREW DRAGON settled just off of the solid early pace while not far back, gained ground while two wide on the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch
and tired in the final stages.

KALINE hustled from the gate to grab the early lead and the rail, rated kindly and was allowed to set moderate fractions while running in the two-path, kept
COOLCROSS to his outside down the backstretch while floating that rival out a bit, angled back towards the rail entering the far turn, quickened when
prompted and prevailed in the dash to the finish. COOLCROSS broke well, took up a tracking position to the outside of KALINE while racing in the two path,
stayed to the outside through the turn, was able quicken with the leader but was always second best. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT first from the gate but was
outrun to the turn by KALINE, had to steady going into the first turn when that rival took the rail path, continued down the backstretch to the inside while
tracking the leaders, steadied passing the half when KALINE retook the rail, was boxed in through the second turn, continued to lack room to midstretch,
angled out inside of the the sixteenth-marker but was unable to reel in the top pair.

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended the solid pace through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter while in hand nearing
the top of the stretch, overtook LEMON ZINGER into the drive, extended the lead through the lane and drew off under hand urging in the end. MOUNT
PELLIAR broke in at the start, lacked speed through the early going, swung widest to go five wide into the stretch run, ran evenly through the final furlong
but secured second in the final stages. ROBIE was bothered at the start and was off slowly, recovered nicely to be near the early pace on the first turn,
came three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and was outfinished for second in the final stages. BARHOPSKY was allowed to
settle in the early going, saved all of the ground to the second turn, tipped out to go two wide into the drive and could not muster a late rally. LIL MIRACLE
MAN was squeezed at the start and was off slowly, came four wide along the first turn while just off of the pace, maintained position to the second turn,
shifted to the two path nearing the top of the stretch and did not offer a late response. SKY DINSKI raced in midpack along the first turn while three wide,
gained ground along the backstretch run, came three then four wide nearing the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and did not threaten in the final
stages. LEMON ZINGER broke alertly and was sent to the front, set quick fractions while being closely attended to by the winner, was confronted by A
MAN'S MAN nearing the quarter-marker, could not hold that rival off and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
WALKING BOSS raced in midpack to the first turn, found a ground saving pocket just off of the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, continued that
gain into the second turn, was set down for the drive, overtook the pacesetter leaving the furlong marker and pulled away under hand urging in the end.
BROTHERLY LOVE settled just off of the early pace, maintained position to the second turn, shifted out at the top of the lane, could not reel in the winner in
the final stages but finished well in the end to secure the place. NUESTRO ENGREIDO broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, floated GALLANT
OAK nearing the five furlong marker, pressed the quick pace through the backstretch run and into the far turn, could not match strides with WALKING BOSS
in upper stretch and was outfinished in the drive, while holding safely for third. STAY LIT was unhurried in the early going, improved position on the second
turn, ran evenly to the stretch and offered a mild late rally in the final stages. BIG BENO was allowed to settle, maintained position through the backstretch
run while saving all of the ground, angled out at the top of the stretch and was gaining ground in the end while unable to threaten. HOLIDAY HUSTLE was
sent leaving the break and set the pace into the first turn, set quick fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the
quarter marker, stayed on to the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner and weakened in the late going. GALLANT OAK was forwardly placed into the
first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run and was floated out a path nearing the five furlong marker, gained ground through the backstretch and
into the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. ENJOY IT STRAIT bobbled at the start and was a bit erratic and hard to place
into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn while keeping that three wide path and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
CLASS PROOF broke out at the start making contact with MY LITTLE TAYLOR, corrected course quickly and sped to the lead while simultaneously angling
to the inside under a snug hold, maintained that lead through the turn, responded when asked passing the quarter pole and prevailed under strong handling
to the finish. OLYMPIC SILVER was away quickly from the gate, bobbled just past the gap, kept to the inside down the stretch then switched to the two path
around the turn made a run at the leader from the five-sixteenths marker but was second best in a good effort. REALLY EASY was off a step slowly,
recovered well and was forwardly placed to the turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late
stages. VANDENBERG broke well but was outrun to the turn, moved into contention at the halfway marker while three to four wide, dove to the inside
passing the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in deep stretch while looking for room and finished evenly. MY LITTLE TAYLOR was bumped hard by CLASS
PROOF after the break, losing some ground on the rest of the field, was able made up some ground into and around the turn but tired in the stretch. ROYAL
HEART broke slow from the gate then drifted inwards, spotting the field several lengths, was never able to re-engage with the field while racing four to five
wide throughout.
