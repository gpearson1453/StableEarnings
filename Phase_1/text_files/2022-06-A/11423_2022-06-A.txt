Footnotes
KATERI EMPIRE close up along the rail, took the two path leaving the backstretch, was carried out four wide into the lane by BIG CYN, put that one away
and under pressure proved best. BIG CYN vied for the lead along the rail, took the two path into the last turn, drifted wide carrying the winner out into the
lane, chased and finished second best. SMART BROAD drifted out nearing the three-quarter pole causing TUXEDO LEMON to clip heels and toss the
jockey, four wide on the last turn and made a mild bid. THE NEW MIAMI forced the issue along the two path for a half mile, dropped back on the last turn
and tired. ROYALBONNIELEGACY saved ground throughout and tired. TUXEDO LEMON clipped heels with SMART BROAD nearing the three-quarter
pole and lost the jockey. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning SMART BROAD drifting out nearing the three-quarter pole, resulted in the
disqualification of SMART BROAD from third to fifth. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter was hand timed.

CATCHYASOON Slow to load in the gate, unhurried along the three path, took the rail into the turn, gained inside into the lane, quickly found the front and
drew off. MOLCAJETE Tracked the leader four wide on the turn, chased the winner leaving the furlong marker and held the place. CAPE COD GEM Set the
pace along the three path around the turn, was hooked and then came back on along the rail to just miss the place. SHARED SUCCESS Well placed five
wide into the turn, four wide out of it and weakened. HOW YOU FEELING Broke sluggishly, lagged back along the two path and failed to threaten.

LABAN M MO In hand along the two path well placed, took the rail on the last turn, eased out, responded, gained to take on the leader and drew clear. I
FOUND IT Away on top, set the pace along the rail while pressed, kicked loose two from the rail on the last turn, was collared and then finished well to
secure the place. ACHILLES HEEL Unhurried up the backstretch, began to gain some removed from the rail on the final turn, responded inside and finished
well while drifting out some late. STOP THE SPREAD Four wide well placed into the first turn, continued in a striking position on the last turn, entered the
lane four wide and weakened. LORENZEN Slammed at the start by DEVIOUS BANKER, forced the issue along the two path to the last turn, tracked into the
lane and tired. STARSHIP OREO Saved ground throughout to no avail. DEVIOUS BANKER Broke awkwardly, ducked out after that slamming into
LORENZEN, four wide up the backstretch, three path on the last turn and tired.
