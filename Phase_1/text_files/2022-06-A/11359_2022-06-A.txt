Footnotes
QUICKFLASH coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along just off the inside under some pressure from TAP'N DE BANK to the outside,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, clinging to the front under threat from a
pair, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside gamely to take back command nearing the sixteenth marker and prevail at the
finish. TAP'N DE BANK bobbled at the break, prompted the leader from the outside four paths off the rail, tucked to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in between foes and took narrow and brief command a furlong from
home, dug in and was displaced nearing sixteenth pole, battled on to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. UNIQUE UNIONS coaxed from the
gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in latched on to the outside of the top pair offering up
a bid until repelled inside the final sixteenth and was along clear of the rest for the show honors. WIN FOR GOLD six then five wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. SAFALOW'S MISSION brushed at the start by MY LAST
MISSION and BIG CASTLE, chased four then three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, continued three to four wide for home and passed tired rivals.
VINCENT three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and offered no response. BIG
CASTLE broke in at the start and brushed with SAFALOW'S MISSION, then got steadied conceding three lengths to the front when losing his lane, crossed
directly to chase along the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. MY
LAST MISSION stumbled just after the break brushing and leaning on SAFALOW'S MISSION while settling into stride conceding two lengths in position,
chased two then three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
UNCLE MOONLIGHT went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, shook clear along the rail on the turn, extended the advantage outside
the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. SET SAIL broke a half-step slow,
settled comfortably off the pace, moved closer to track inside around the turn, shifted three to four wide while roused for his best at the quarter-pole, pursued
the winner in the stretch and safely secured the place. BRIGHT FUTURE tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the four path around the
turn, spun five wide into the stretch under pressure and weakened but was well clear for the show. THREE JOKERS was coaxed along off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two then three path, shifted four wide into the stretch and came up empty. ALADO broke a step slow, settled near the back,
went three then four wide under urging around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GOOD CULTURE settled well back in the
field, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. HIGHER QUALITY settled on the outside, was roused five wide around the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. POWER AGENDA leaned out and brushed the gate at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the
three path under urging on the turn, dropped back with five-sixteenths to run and stopped.

Footnotes
MATAREYA bobbled at the break but broke on top despite the small misstep, showed the way in hand three then two wide safely in front down the
backstretch settled into a rhythm through moderate splits, remained patiently handled until placed to hand urging cutting the corner into upper stretch, drew
off under a hand ride to the finish and prevailed comfortably on the wire. DIVINE HUNTRESS three to four wide in pursuit down the backstretch in closest
aim of the aforementioned foe, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear of the rest for the place honors. DREAM LITH broke out a step at the start, chased just off the inside
until tipped three to four wide nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing three wide at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. INVENTING coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked to the rail with nine-sixteenths to
go, got coaxed along three furlongs from home and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY was coaxed along to establish early position, settled well behind the leading duo in third, moved closer in the two path around the turn, was
roused near the quarter-pole, rallied outside to get the advantage into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. WAKANAKA (IRE) leaned out at
the start and brushed the outside of the gate, was taken under a hold early then reserved far off the fast pace, went two then three wide while let out on the
turn, was roused for more into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. IN ITALIAN (GB) broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, showed
speed on the outside of LEGGS GALORE while opening up on the rest of the field, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide around the far
turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped in while shaking off the pacesetter in upper stretch, lost the advantage
to the winner into the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for the show. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL (FR) was off slow and spotted the front a couple
lengths, settled at the rear, moved out of last outside the five-eighths pole, saved ground while getting closer around the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths, came off the rail into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. LEGGS GALORE was hustled to the front, showed the way through
quick fractions, was urged along in the two path around the turn, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and gave way.

down the backstretch, came under coaxing tucked to the rail once more half a mile from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one
paced to the wire coming again to pass tired rivals in the final sixteenth. FIRST CONSTITUTION (CHI) broke out at the start bumping LOCALLY OWNED,

CLAIRIERE three wide in pursuit from afar as a pair of rivals spurted away in tandem, came under coaxing in concert with MALATHAAT to her inside three
furlongs from home and began an advance, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied as a pair to engage the embattled leader inside the final furlong
overhauling her seventy yards from home when dueling to the finish and just got the nod on the wire. MALATHAAT coaxed from the gate, chased three wide
from afar albeit in closest range of the widening away top pair, tucked to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing joined by the aforementioned
to the outside when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in dueling with CLAIRIERE through the stretch issuing a
challenge to SEARCH RESULTS inside the final eighth pole, took command seventy yards from home leading late but lost the bob in the final jumps.
SEARCH RESULTS coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of LETRUSKA from the outside three wide nearly latched on down the backstretch while
widening away from the rest as a duo to a commanding gap between them and the others in swift splits, tucked to the two path through the turn and steadily
latched on applying pressure and taking command with five-sixteenths to go, swung three then two wide into upper stretch shaking off her main pace foe,
got roused at the three-sixteenths and edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in under confrontation from the top pair and was caught when growing leg weary
seventy yards from home, finished well clear for the show honors. BONNY SOUTH just off the inside in pursuit from afar near the tail of the field, tucked
inside and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but made no late headway through
the final furlong. LETRUSKA coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under pressure from SEARCH RESULTS
to the outside, came under light coaxing midway on the turn as her main rival took steadily closer order, got headed for command with five-sixteenths to go
and began to back away when taking the inside route into upper stretch, then got eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CASA CREED moved in while settling nicely off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, rallied behind
the leaders outside the furlong marker, moved out behind the leading duo inside that marker and closed fast to get up late and prevail. ARREST ME RED
stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path around the turn, made a bid while asked at the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of TRUE
VALOUR into the final sixteenth, gained a short lead late but was denied while able to get the place. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) went to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch,
dueled gamely with the runner-up into the final sixteenth, lost the lead shortly thereafter and missed in a good effort while clear for the show. CHANGE OF
CONTROL settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground while asked around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the leaders into the
final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the last spot in the superfecta. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN settled towards the rear of the field,
saved ground on the turn, was given his cue in the two path at the quarter-pole then tipped to the three path, moved a bit further out into the final furlong
and improved position. GREYES CREEK was off slow and spotted the front many lengths, settled at the rear, went two then three wide around the turn, was
roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) settled on the outside, was roused four wide on
the turn and failed to rally. SMOKIN' JAY bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, settled
towards the rear, angled in late on the backstretch, raced in the two path while in hand behind horses around the turn, was roused while finding room into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. OMAHA CITY was urged along just off the pace, went around the turn in the three path and came up empty.
GEAR JOCKEY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired.
SCUTTLEBUZZ settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, had the rider lose his crop while moving further out
around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) stumbled at the start and bumped hard with a foe then was taken up some, spotted
the front several lengths, went five wide around the turn and came up empty. CHASING ARTIE broke a bit awkwardly and bumped with a foe, settled
outside under some urging, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
FLIGHTLINE broke a half a beat slow when lunging slightly from the gate, began to advance inside and was taken in hand and steadied lightly seven and a
half furlongs from home as SPEAKER'S CORNER crossed briefly in front before taking to the two path, began to advance once more inside and was taken
in hand six and a half furlongs from home as SPEAKER'S CORNER once more took over the rail in front, tipped to the two path six furlongs from home
coming under very light coaxing, got floated three wide through the turn while making a steady advance to get on near even terms three furlongs out before
taking over command nearing the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew clear under a drive and was geared down
in the final seventy yards. HAPPY SAVER three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. SPEAKER'S CORNER established the front and crossed to the inside forcing
FLIGHTLINE to steady off his heels seven and a half furlongs from home, tipped back to the two path and had FLIGHTLINE advance once more and tucked
inside forcing that rival to again be taken in hand this time when latching on, remained inside and steadily came under pressure floating to the two path and
carrying his main danger three wide through the turn getting put to coaxing as that rival got on near even terms three furlongs out, yielded the front nearing
the five-sixteenths and went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. ALOHA
WEST chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was outrun. INFORMATIVE
chased four wide throughout under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and trailed.

Footnotes
TRIBHUVAN (FR) moved in while strolling to the front, showed the way in the two path, extended the advantage with five furlongs to run then drew off to a
sizable advantage, remained well clear in the two path through the final turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a left-handed
crop outside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. ADHAMO (IRE) bumped with HIGHLAND CHIEF nearing the first
turn then steadied while squeezed back between foes, raced in the two path while rated under tight restraint, remained in hand through the far turn, waited
while lacking room behind horses from the quarter-pole to inside the three-sixteenths, altered course outside the furlong marker and brushed with a foe then
came between horses and finished willingly for the place. GUFO saved ground around the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, moved out leaving the
backstretch, was given his cue in the four path around the turn then roused for more while five wide into the stretch, passed foes on the outside in the
middle of the course and finished willingly to just get the show. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) bumped with ADHAMO early while tugging at the bit, was rated
under restraint in the three path, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick then
just missed the show. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) dropped towards the rear early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was caught five
wide into the far turn then dropped to the three path, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position.
SANTIN had a shoe repaired in the paddock, came away in good order, was taken in hand early, went three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong, had the rider get the crop
knocked from his hands at the sixteenth-pole and tired. L'IMPERATOR (FR) was keen then taken back while crowded when pressure came down from the
outside early, raced inside to the two path around the opening bend, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under
light urging, paused behind horses coming to the the furlong marker then altered course to the outside for room and failed to threaten. IN LOVE (BRZ) was
taken back early, went three wide through the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled three wide around the far turn, was roused four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. CHANNEL MAKER was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, angled in while fighting the rider a bit
early, raced inside to the two path on the turns, swung seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. TOKYO GOLD (FR) was taken in hand early then
rated on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe outside the furlong marker and came up empty.

Footnotes
MO DONEGAL coaxed from the gate, went two to three wide through the opening bend before settling three wide in pursuit down the backstretch in mid
pack, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go and began to advance to be just off the pace, came under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths and
swung four wide into upper stretch with dead aim on the top pair, took over command three-sixteenths from home, edged clear under a drive shying out
under a left handed stick a sixteenth from home before being corrected in the late stages while hand urged out to the finish. NEST stumbled at the start and
was bumped by RICH STRIKE, who broke inwards and conceded three lengths to the front, advanced along the rail into the opening bend and settled just
off the top pair down along the rail before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths remaining and rode the pocket in
behind the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out four to five wide straightened away into upper stretch, and ran on to chase
the winner home shying in a sixteenth out under a right handed crop while clear of the rest and along second best. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING brushed the
off side stall at the start, raced forwardly placed two to three wide through the first turn before settling three to four paths off the inside attending the leader to
the outside, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go and intensified the pressure on WE THE PEOPLE through the far turn getting on near even
terms near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire while
unable to match the top pair in the late going. WE THE PEOPLE coaxed from the gate, established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand
just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch under the watchful eye of the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside into the far
turn and came under intensifying pressure from that rival getting placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under
threat from a pair, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest. CREATIVE MINISTER
lunged at the break, chased along the inside from mid pack coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped three wide into upper stretch and tired.
RICH STRIKE broke in at the start bumping NEST solidly after that rival stumbled and pinched her back, raced briefly inside into the first turn before going
two then three wide and then back to the two path briefly into the backstretch, tipped out and chased four wide with seven and a half furlongs to go,
continued four wide through the far turn coaxed along from the half mile pole, swung four to five wide at the head of the stretch and tired. BARBER ROAD
broke in at the start bumping GOLDEN GLIDER, raced three to four wide through the first turn before tucking to the two path into the backstretch, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths and came under urging half a mile from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. GOLDEN GLIDER got
bumped at the start by BARBER ROAD, raced three to four wide through the opening turn before tipping five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went
three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
AL'S ROCKET settled towards the rear of the field, raced in the two path early on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the five-sixteenths, swung six
wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed strongly to get up late. FLOKI'S FLIGHT went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage,
controlled the action while inside around the turn, was set down into upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the
place. DRAKON broke out at the start, became keen when taken under a hold early then was rated just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was
roused in the two path into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. JUST LIKE THIS was taken in hand early, bobbled slightly
approaching the seven-eighths, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed
to rally. NORTH CAROLINA stalked the pace on the outside under a strong hold, was let out in the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch
and came up empty. NECCO was reserved on the outside early then settled more kindly, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and
never reached contention. CHEEKY TICO was last to commence, became rank under restraint early then was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BALI RIDDIM broke in and was off a bit slow then hustled, moved out at the rear of
the field, went four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. MISSOURI was taken back leaving the initial dogleg,
settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and failed to respond.
