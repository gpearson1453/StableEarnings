BUCKETS showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside but was no match for the winner in the drive. PERFECT BLEND bumped rival at the
break, dropped towards the back of the pack early on, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough for the top

FANTASTIC DAY was unhurried early on, moved up five wide around the far turn, made a wide bid in the stretch run and finished well to get up under
strong handling. MUNCEY stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. LA WAUN chased the early
pace, challenged the leader near the eighth pole and had not enough late while racing three wide. FOREVER GOLD showed good early speed to set the
pace and weakened of a mile. BRILLIANT BIRD was reluctant to load, dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and had no response. CHUMLY was
hustled along and tired.

JERSEY RED chased the top pair early on, moved up through the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to edge clear late
under strong handling. WHENDUCKSFLY dueled for the early lead while racing two wide and kept on to the wire, Whenducksfly had to be vanned off after
being pulled up. EDDIE AND THE KING dueled for the early lead and kept on to the wire. SMOKE AND BURN settled off the early pace, raced six to seven
wide through the upper stretch and made a good late bid. SHOCKAZULU stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled five wide
through the drive and had no late run. PARTY FOR ONE settled off the early going, raced five wide and had no late response. DEMERARA was slow early,
raced towards the inside and never was a factor. CLARENCE HEADS ducked in at the break and unseated his jockey.

SPITTIN IMAGE showed good early speed to set the early pace and drove clear in the stretch run under strong encouragement. EL ALTO HOMBRE was
coaxed along early, raced near the rail through the far turn into the upper stretch, shifted out three wide in the drive but was no match for the winner. MR.
STANG chased the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. STAND TO settled off the early pace, raced near the
rail in the stretch run and had not enough. MAKAH LANE broke to the inside, raced four wide through the far turn, raced along the inside in the lane and had
no late run. NATIONHEART chased the pace while racing three wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FRANKS FIX IT dropped back early, raced six
wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
DEEPINGREEN stalked the pace, made a good four wide in the lane and edged clear late under strong encouragement. JEDI KNIGHT showed good early
speed to set the early pace, dug in through the stretch drive but was wore down late. NOUMEA settled off the early going, made an outside bid in the drive
and moved up. DYF pressed the pace and weakened while racing three wide. BLAME IT ON KITTY was unhurried early on, raced three to four wide and
had no response. MISO FAST failed to sustain a bid. The quarter and half mile fractional time was unavailable.
