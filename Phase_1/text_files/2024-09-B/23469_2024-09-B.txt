Footnotes
FANCY FASCINATOR set the pace two wide early on, showed the way in the two path turning for home as an outer pair applied pressure, shook free in
upper stretch and held sway. INVENTING ANNA pressed in the three path and between horses into the turn, crept closer to bid outside of the leader
nearing the lane, but failed to maintain even terms in upper stretch and chased the winner home to prove second best. STARCOURT prompted along the
inside, pursued close up around the turn, but only managed to chase the top pair through the lane and held show. EVOCATION broke a step slow, then was
forced to clip the hind heels of an inner rival when an outer foe shifted across their paths leaving the chute, recovered to track outside of rivals, tucked three
wide into the turn, then ran on evenly between horses into midstretch and was denied show. HAND IT OVER shifted in soon after the start, stalked in the
four path, bid outside of the top pair turning for home, but spun to the five path into the lane and gave way while delaying changing leads until the furlong
grounds. VIBE CHECK came out a beat slow then had her hind heels clipped by an outer rival early on, pursued two wide and between horses into the turn,
then failed to factor. MY SPRING SUNSHINE chased along the inside and faded turning for home. LITTLE SASSER broke outwardly, lagged behind the
rest into the turn, took the turn in the two to three path, rejoined the rest moving to the five path into the lane but made little impact.

Footnotes
UNO LE leaned out at the start, prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, assumed command kicking clear tucking to the two path nearing the
lane, then held sway safely from an outer on-charging rival under a drive. HIGH SHOT trailed in the four path, shifted to the six path into the lane, rallied to
gain place reaching midstretch, then closed in well on the clear leader late but was second best. BARBANERA broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in
the two path, shifted out to the five path into the lane, bid for place along with an outer rival in upper stretch but was outkicked and flopped back to her left
lead at the furlong grounds. FLAT STORMIN set the pace inside of the eventual winner early on, but proved no match for that one turning for home and
weakened. SWEET TROUBLE broke outwardly at the start, chased the top pair from the three path into the turn and tired.

an advantage reaching the furlong grounds then drove clear. ANGKOR vied two wide, led around the turn, shifted out a path as an outer rival bid in upper
stretch, clung between bidders shortly after, but was bested by his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds and proved second best. MINNESOTA READY
bumped with an outer rival upon leaving the gate, stalked outside of the top pair, bid four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder
reaching midstretch and flattened out. SPANKSTER bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied along the inside, prompted inside of the leader around the

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA BURRITO tracked in the three to two path into the turn, advanced inside of rivals entering the bend before offering a bold bid outside of the
leader turning for home, assumed command entering the lane and drew off under a drive. INSTANT REPLAY raced forwardly in the three path and between
horses early on, got outmoved by an inner rival while pursuing into the turn, claimed place while no match for the leader in upper stretch and was second
best. KEVIN'S STRIKE broke slowly, raced off of the pace tucking down from the five path into the turn, took contact from an outer rival while two wide
passing the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, advanced to reach show late and held that position from his outer bidder
stable-mate at the wire. DEREK'S LAW broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the seven path in midstretch and ran on
willingly to miss show. MINTASTIC bumped with an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, surpassed an inner faltering rival into the
turn, saved ground turning for home and moved up inside of rivals. JUJUBEE set a clear pace along the inside into the turn, but was collared by a bold outer
challenger at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that one shortly after and weakened. STEELIN BASES raced forwardly two wide and between
horses, gave way with a half mile to go, chased around the turn and failed to menace. SHOTGUN broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four to five path
and made little impact. BOURBONATOR stalked four wide early on, but faded with three furlongs to go, drifted in and bumped a rival at the five sixteenths
pole then continued to weaken. ROCK SOLO bumped with an inner rival at the start, lagged well behind around the turn and showed little. MAZZEO tracked
along the inside, but faltered once rank and appearing to not handle the surface approaching the turn and was done early.

READY PURSUIT laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide into upper stretch and rallied to reel in the embattled leading pair in the final
sixteenth. BETTERING bumped with an outer rival leaving the gate before taking square contact from an inner foe to be jostled between rivals at the start,
pressed two wide and between horses into the turn, vied turning for home, led narrowly into the lane, dueled with his inner counterpart thereafter, but was
surpassed by an outer bidder in the closing stages. BYE BYE LIAM broke outwardly and firmly bumped a rival at the start, set the pace along the inside,
vied with an outer foe turning for home, fought on after getting headed entering the lane, gamely sustained the battle into deep stretch but got outkicked
late. SPURRIER broke a bit outwardly at the start, stalked forwardly along the inside, tipped three wide to take aim outside of the embattled leading pair in
upper stretch, but lacked progress thereafter and got outkicked for show at the furlong grounds. SHAKIN LOOSE raced at the rear two wide, shifted four
wide into the turn, fanned six wide into the lane and made little impact. CHITWOOD was bumped by an inner rival at the start, stalked three deep into the
turn, but faded while drifting five wide into the lane.

Footnotes
EXTRADITION stalked in the three path, bid three wide entering the lane, dueled with an inner rival into deep stretch and edged ahead late. SHOGUN
raced forwardly two wide before tucking to track along the inside with nine sixteenths to go, stalked around the turn, slipped through to bid inside of the
leader as a wider rival challenged entering the lane, sparred with that one through midstretch, but was bested in the final sixteenth and saved place at the
wire. PUBLISHER tracked from midpack in the four to three path, shifted outside of the leading trio while chasing into the final furlong, ran on late and
missed place. BUZZ ROCKET was slow into stride, trailed in the four to five path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and rallied belatedly between horses.
BURNING GLORY tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, lacked progress while
hanging on his left lead through midstretch, yet changed over at the sixteenth pole and stayed on between horses well late. EXUBERANT MISCHIEF was
bumped between horses and steadied out of crowded quarters at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path, shifted to the five path into uppre stretch
and stayed on willingly late. OUR FAVORITE SON bumped with an inner rival at the start, sped clear early on, got a breather approaching the turn, showed
the way in the two path around the bend, but was headed by bidders on either side entering the lane and weakened in the final furlong. AMERICAN
PROMISE tracked in the three to two path but lacked a bid. CONSECRATED broke slowly, saved ground toward the rear, but to no aavil. INTO THIN AIR
pursued two wide but was through early. PIQUANT was bumped by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide with
three furlongs to go, but tired.

Footnotes
COZEE RAGS got shortly after the start, settled into stride well back along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before fanning to the six path into
the lane, rallied to reel in the tiring leader along with an inner co-bidder in the final sixteenth, shifted in and brushed that foe while vying nearing the wire and
prevailed. BROUGHTY FERRY laid off of the pace three wide, moved two wide around the far turn, rallied to offer a late bid along with an outer rival in the
final sixteenth, was brushed and floated in by that one nearing the wire and got outkicked. MISS HEBRIDES showed the way from an outer presser into the
backstretch, drew away from that one with three furlongs to go, opened up turning for home, but began to tire in the final furlong and got worn down by an
outer pair in the final sixteenth. LET'S DUET laid off of the pace in the two path, moved out to the five path entering the lane, shifted in and failed to menace.
PRETTY PROVOCATIVE tracked from the three path, pursued in the four to five path around the far turn, chased into the lane and gave way. OFF THE
LAM pursued from midpack along the inside, checked when put in tight by an outer rival entering the lane and tired. CONDONE trailed around both turns
and got outrun. TAKE SHAPE pressed the leader from the three path, but faded in the four path around the far turn and faltered between horses in upper
stretch.
