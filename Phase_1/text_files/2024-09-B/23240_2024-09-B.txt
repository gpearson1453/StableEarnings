well under urging. VOLKERT showed good speed racing outside of FADETHENOISE, bid at the quarter pole, could not stay with that rival, then dug in
gamely and held well for the place spot. MAJESTIC EAGLE raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out in the stretch, rallied mildly between horses
and got third. CABINET PIK chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and was outkicked for the show spot. EDDIE THE

weakened. MARATHONER chased three wide, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. ONE FAST DREAM raced four wide early,
chased three wide on the turn and tired. GET BACK GOLDIE raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT raced off the rail, off

GROUP TICKET set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, shook free turning for home, responded when roused, pulled away and was kept to the
task. THREETHIRTYTHREE raced three wide early, stalked two or three wide, bid three wide on the far turn and rallied for second. HARD SPUN FANTASY
raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied mildly and got third. SHOGUN BE FAST pulled while in front
nearing the first turn, then was rated back off the pace, stalked, bid on the far turn and weakened. AGARRAMESIPUEDES raced four wide early, settled off
the pace between rivals, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. STRONG LIGHT trailed the field, raced
inside and did not factor. LONELY RIDE raced five wide early, settled three wide of the pace, chased on the far turn and faded. JERSEY PERFECTION
tracked inside early on, then pulled between rivals on the backside, chased and gave way.
