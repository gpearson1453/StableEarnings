Footnotes
WILLOW BEND broke out then bumped with a foe while corrected by the rider, established a forward position in the early going, brushed with BACKED BY
GOLD while keeping that foe in behind the leader inside the three-quarter pole, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two to three path on the
turn, took over while put to a drive at the quarter-pole, shook clear under a strong hand-ride into upper stretch, responded well when put to a left-handed
crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. WHISTLER'S STYLE broke awkwardly and was off slow, dropped well back while climbing
some on the backstretch, leveled out while in the two then three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, found her best stride in the final
furlong and finished fast for the place. BACKED BY GOLD was carried in early then brushed with a foe while trying to get to the outside of the leader inside
the three-quarter pole, chased the pace, dropped back in the three path on the turn, was driven into the stretch in the four path, pursued the winner into the
final sixteenth, gained second position inside the sixteenth-pole but was caught for that placing while clear for the show. ROYAL POPPY stumbled at the
start but broke with the body of the field then bumped with a foe, moved in while going to the front then went clear, raced inside on the turn, was asked
under threat from the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, moved off the rail near the furlong marker and weakened.
BANK ON ANNA was hustled from the gate, moved out inside the three-quarter pole then chased on the outside, dropped back in the three path on the turn
and tired. HAZARDOUS HUMOR bumped with foes on both sides at the start, angled in towards the rear, was urged along well dropping well off the pace,
moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor.

GRACE AND GRIT forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn, settled briefly just off the inside in aim of the leader before advancing to take
over when sensing the dawdling early pace with five and a half furlongs to run, slipped away and tucked inside through the far turn patiently handled until set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. SARATOGA SNOW
coaxed from the gate, showed the early on just off the inside and then along the inside through the first turn, had the aforementioned foe advance and was
displaced from command with five and a half furlongs remaining and tracked that rival in closest aim along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home and secure the place honors. ONE MORE DANCE shied in at the
start filling the space left vacant by INFASTUATION, went just off the inside through the first turn and then chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. BRYANT AND COOPER got away to an awkward
beginning conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. HEAVENLY LIGHT broke out at the start and was corrected, raced just
off the inside and grew briefly rank under restraint into the first turn before going just off the inside, chased three then two wide advancing under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. TIMIA broke in at the start, raced just off the inside through the
first turn before heading three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. INFASTUATION broke in at the start brushing KISSED BY KARMA and
conceded two lengths to the front, tracked just off the inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch and weakened. KISSED BY KARMA broke awkward and then got brushed by the aforementioned foe breaking inwards, raced just off the inside
through the first turn, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. SPEED AND
BEAUTY lost her rear footing at the start and conceded three lengths to the front, raced three wide through the first turn and then five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn under coaxing briefly from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and was
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CINDERELLA'S CAUSE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide advancing to take command just outside the quarter pole, got set down spinning
four to five wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was kept to task. RACING COLORS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just of the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the place honors. APRIL
ANTICS stumbled at the start, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to the finish to garner the show
honors. ECHO IN ETERNITY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
KRYSTALHEIR chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. MAGGIE T dueled early
on from the two path before emerging with narrow and sole command tucked to the inside into the turn, yielded the front under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. THE SHOE LADY dueled inside of the aforementioned foe down the backstretch, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MASTER FREUD bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed on the outside then went clear around the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped from the
two path to the rail early on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride into the final
furlong, was given one light tap of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a solid hand-ride to the finish while much the best.
WIND DANCER became restless in the gate when another foe was fractious, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came under a drive in
upper stretch and willingly earned the place. SPOKEN BLUNTLY was fractious in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the inside of
the winner, was taken back off the pace near the nine-sixteenths pole, followed the leader in the two path on the turn, chased in the three path into the
stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. ORENO was taken in hand early then rated under restraint,
saved ground while let out on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. COUSIN ED bumped with a rival at the start, moved in
while settling off the pace, raced between horses leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused near the quarter-pole then
swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BUSTINO SANTINO settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, came six
wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. KING PUCK broke in and hit the gate, moved in while settling in the front half of the field, was asked in the three
path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path and failed to respond. ROHAN bumped solidly with a rival at the start then dropped back while slow
into stride, went around the turn in the three path, turned into upper stretch in the four path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MANGETSU settled just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
seized command straightened away, shied out a path from a left handed crop outside the eighth pole, dug in under some threat to the outside and rebuffed
the challenge to the wire. WILLFUL MAMA tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive offering up a mild kick to threaten the top one but was ultimately repelled to the finish. ON A SUMMER DAY got bumped at the start by TRES
ARIES and then lost her lane to WILLFUL MAMA, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. NONNA LYNNE broke a half a beat slow and lunged at the break shying from the assistant starter's kicking motion,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the end. CARA'S DREAMWEAVER
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no headway through the stretch. TRALEE GIRL
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened. ARGENTIERA chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. YOUNG AT HEART established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside, got let out at the quarter pole and yielded the front straightened away, then faltered in the stretch. TRES
ARIES broke in brushing the near side stall and then bumped ON A SUMMER DAY, chased just off the inside and then along the inside growing detached
at the tail of the field into the far turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout when eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES settled in the front half of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, shifted to the three path outside the quarter-pole,
chased the leader into upper stretch then made a bid, battled with two foes into the final sixteenth, dueled with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly
prevailed on the wire. MYSTIC NIGHT was hustled from the gate, angled out early then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path for most of
the turn then moved to the four path, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch then took the lead outside the furlong marker, battled with two rivals into
the final sixteenth, fought with the winner to the finish and was denied clear for the place. SUERTE went clear early then showed the way, controlled the
action in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside the furlong marker,
battled with two foes into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. FIRST GLIMPSE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on
the outside, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and lacked the needed
kick. HIGHER QUALITY was urged along on the outside, moved in just inside the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the three path and failed to
respond. MAJESTIC FRONTIER settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground
on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BOLD VICTORY was hard ridden while
showing no speed, traveled around the turn in the five path, moved out in upper stretch and never reached contention. COMMANDPERFORMANCE was
urged along well back in the field, rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor. GRANDPA'S KID was urged along towards the rear, went around
most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail and failed to threaten. HE'S GOT THIS was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn
and retreated. LIFE AND LIGHT broke out and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, was urged along in the five path on the turn and faltered.

MZ BIG BUCKS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, took over
command nearing the eighth pole and edged away under a drive to prevail. MARCO T. got bumped at the start by AUTUMN GLORY, chased just off the
inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors.
AUTUMN GLORY broke out at the start bumping MARCO T., chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. PATRIA coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside early on before being displaced
from the front by QUEENS DANCER with seven-sixteenths to go, chased along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut
the corner into upper stretch and seized back narrow and brief command near the three-sixteenths before being displaced by the top one, then weakened in
the late stages. LATEST EDITION coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. WEEKEND RAGS coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered no response. QUEENS DANCER coaxed from the gate,
raced three wide in aim of the leader before advancing to issue a challenge tucked to the two path and taking command with seven-sixteenths to go, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. IM JUST KIDDIN four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and then got taken hold of firmly when shuffled back as SPOOKY LADY faded
directly in front and was taken back to near the rear of the field, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick when flashed the crop and
tepidly ridden to the finish. SPOOKY LADY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide, retreated midway on the turn and went three wide into upper
stretch, then tired in the drive. STRICTLY TABOO coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
LES REYS (FR) saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the
stretch then moved out, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up in the final sixteenth to prevail. ORI was hustled from the gate, moved in
while going to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, fought on
gamely in the stretch, regained the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole but was denied by the winner while just able to get the place. DYNAMIC
PRICING (IRE) raced in the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside but with the benefit of cover, was roused while three then four wide on the far
turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders while outside in the drive, swapped back to her inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and finished
willingly to just miss the place while up for the show. POOLSIDE WITH SLIM (IRE) broke in while away awkwardly then bumped with a foe, rounded the first
turn in the three path, settled towards the front on the outside, went around the far turn in the three path, was asked late on that bend, turned into the stretch
in the four path, made a bid near the furlong marker but was outfinished. PROCTOR STREET stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, engaged
the leader on the far turn, took a short advantage at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong, was headed outside the sixteenth-pole and
out-kicked. WHISKEY DECISION was taken up while tugging at the bit into the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, was reserved towards the
rear, saved ground on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. LADY DE BERRY broke in at the start,
moved in towards the rear early, was carried out to the four path on the first turn, settled outside at the back, went around the far turn in the two path, turned
into the stretch in the three path then moved out and lacked the needed response. READY TO JAM was hustled from the gate then moved in early, saved
ground while well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and
came up empty. CLOUDWALKER bumped with a rival at the start, tossed her head while rank early, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved
off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MISSELIOFWAR hesitated at the start conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside and then just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish
to score. BUBBE DEAREST coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled
out eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors. JUST WORDS broke in at the start trading a bump with
AILANI, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went nine wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish.
TOWER TWENTY TWO coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the wire. PRACTICALLY SUMMER coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung five wide into upper stretch taking over command, dug in under threat and was collared inside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. T D
MAGEE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, weakened in the
late going. SILENT SANDY coaxed from the gate, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, swung six
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. FIFI LA FUME coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide in aim of the front, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SELECTIVELY SWEET hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. DIVORCED OF COURSE hustled from the start, chased just off the
inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. AILANI reluctant to load prior to
the start, broke out at the start trading a bump with JUST WORDS, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure for the initial time by a pair of rivals, got displaced from the front and took the inside route into upper stretch,
then folded in the drive.
