Footnotes
MISS LONELLE took light contact from an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the turn, tipped out five wide in upper
stretch, rallied to bid outside of the leaders in the final furlong and edged past. EMMY BLUE broke out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked tucking to the
two path while behind the leaders around the turn, smoothly tipped to take aim two wide at the furlong grounds, bid along with outer rivals shortly after, but
was outkicked and gamely held place. LA FANTASTICA pressed three deep, chased the top pair into the lane, kept on to vie among bidders in the final
furlong, but got outkicked and was denied place. LOVELY EMMA led while vying with an outer rival around the turn, inched free in upper stretch, but flopped
back to her left lead as outer rivals bid leaving the furlong grounds and yielded late. GLEAN took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide,
chased between horses through upper stretch, then weakened three wide in the final furlong. ALWAYS PRACTICAL lunged outwardly upon leaving the
gate, took back in the aftermath, settled well back in the two path, shifted out nearing the lane before fanning to the seven path at the quarter pole, and ran
on mildly. DON'T CALL ME BABE tracked in the three path and between horses, angled out to the five path leaving the quarter pole but lacked a rally.
REMATCH saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. LATHAM RIDGE broke a step slow, got bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe and steadied
between horses at the start, trailed in the two path and made little impact. BAYOU CANDY broke slowly, lacked speed in the four path and never got
involved. OMAHA STAMP pursued from midpack four wide, floated to the five path entering the lane and faded. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RANDOM HARVEST tracked three wide into the turn, ranged up in the five path nearing the lane to issue a bid at the quarter pole and drove clear.
BOURBON THIEF trailed into the turn, waited behind horses entering the lane, rallied between rivals before tipping out to the five path at the furlong
grounds, recovered momentum after requiring strong left handed straightening correction leaving the hook, ran on and edged place late. NOVARA pursued
held up behind foes whilst midpack in the two path into the turn, bumped an outer rival to tip three wide entering the lane, vied for place into the final furlong,
but got outkicked by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. MAMA BELLA stalked forwardly two wide, glided through a wide opening between horses to bid
two wide with three furlongs to go, vied between horses into the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the quarter pole, then yielded place to an outer
pair at the sixteenth marker. LUZ DIVINA stalked along the inside, chased in the two path into the lane, angled out in upper stretch and yielded.
SCARBOROUGH FAIR vied for the lead with an outer pair around the turn, got headed at the quarter pole and faded. DIFERENCIA pursued two wide and
between horses, but failed to menace. STAY LOST saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MY SEXY BLONDE lacked speed while hung in the four to
seven path and made little impact. REDO broke a step slow but avoided crowded quarters between rivals by doing so, laid off of the pace in the four path
and failed to factor. COME TO MAMA prompted outside of the top pair, vied in the four path around the turn, but was bumped by an inner rival and steadied
hard between horses entering the lane, and subsequently faltered. LEMONS AND ROSES vied for the lead in the three path and between a pair of foes into
the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole and was done early.

Footnotes
DRIPPING GOLD tracked in the three path, reeled in the leader to gain an advantage passing the three furlong pole, assumed command entering the lane,
drew clear and held sway. DESERT DUKE saved ground in midpack, gained place from outer rivals in upper stretch and held that position.
MENDELSSOHNS MARCH stalked in the two path while closest to the clear leader, chased in the three path and between horses into the lane, vied for
place with an inner foe in the final furlong but was denied. KITODAN steadied between horses early on, trailed along the inside, swung out to the eight path
into the lane and rallied willingly. DYNADRIVE lacked speed two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, shifted five wide at the quarter pole and
chased mildly between rivals. TATANKA showed the way early on, opened up a wide margin down the backstretch, but was caught by the eventual winner
with three furlongs to go and weakened between horses in upper stretch. HIDDEN STASH laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. OCEAN
ATLANTIQUE laid off of the pace in the three path, crept closer in the four path and between horses around the far turn, but emptied out in upper stretch.
WINTERS LION pursued from midpack in the two path, chased in the four path and between horses around the far turn, fanned to the seven path into the
lane and gave way. BARBERINI lacked speed along the inside, advanced five deep and outside of rivals around the far turn, but tired through the lane.

Footnotes
BOY BOY bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses before backing off to stalk along the inside with a half mile remaining,
slipped through to offer a rail bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch, edged an advantage at the furlong grounds, flopped to and from his left lead in the
final sixteenth and held sway. COURAGEOUS CLAY pursued from midpack, crept closer in the four path around the turn, sustained a five wide rally into the
final furlong, dueled with an inner foe for place late and narrowly prevailed. GOVERNING PARTY vied three wide, then two wide turning for home, kept on
while getting outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, sparred for place with an outer foe through the closing stages but just missed. TRAIN AND
TRUST checked back from between horses early on, settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four to five path nearing the lane, then stayed
on belatedly. TKAC broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, moved closer at the quarter pole, tipped inwardly while behind the leaders at the
furlong grounds and sustained a rail chase. WAR AND MAJESTY stalked outside of the leaders early on, pressed four to three wide around the turn, kept
on mildly four wide and between horses into the final furlong, but yielded shortly after. CAPTAIN JUNUH vied for the lead with an outer pair into the turn, led
turning for home, but was headed by an inner bidder at the furlong pole and faded between horses. SKATER raced forwardly early on, tracked the leaders
form the three path around the turn but gave way. SPIRIT RAGS hit the inner stall door at the start and was rank into stride, trailed in the five path and got
outrun. FLOATING SMOKEY broke a step slow before taking firm contact from an inner foe at the start, took back, lacked speed in the four path and
showed little.

Footnotes
NEECIE MARIE lacked speed in the two path, crept closer in the four path turning for home, fanned out to the six path into the lane, rallied to sweep past
the leader at the furlong grounds and drew clear. VERGARA stalked in the three path, bid outside of the leader entering the lane, led leaving the quarter
pole, but proved no match for a wider bidder at the furlong grounds and held place late. THREE PRIESTS (JPN) laid off of the pace along the inside,
brushed with an outer rival at the nine sixteenths pole, chased two wide and between rivals into the final furlong, stayed on to threaten place in the late
stages but was fended off. GREENFINCH laid close up along the inside, attempted to vie inside of the leader entering the far turn, but backed off to stalk
approaching the final nine sixteenths, pursued from the two path turning for home, chased three wide and between rivals in upper stretch, then lacked a bid.
CHOP CHOP tracked along the inside, then two wide and between horses into the far turn, brushed with an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole, took aim
four wide and between horses in upper stretch, but lacked a punch. FOREVER AFTER ALL tracked in the four path, got outkicked by an outer rival while
chasing five wide in upper stretch and failed to factor. ANGEL NADESHIKO showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder at the quarter
pole and stopped. VIVA LA RED trailed in the two path and got outurn. LOVED REIKO pursued two wide and between horses, dropped further back before
taking the turn in the three path, then continued to tire.

SIMPLY IN FRONT hesitated at the start and spotted the rest multiple lengths, trailed in the two path, shifted out to advance six wide at the half mile pole,
rallied to bid outside of the leaders coming to the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner rival through late stages and prevailed. PIPSY (IRE) vied two wide,
led and crossed over to the inside at the half mile pole, dug in to meet outer challenges at the furlong grounds, gamely battled with a rival through the final
furlong but was bested. VIVE VEUVE pursued from midpack in the three to four path, chased five wide and between horses in upper stretch, rallied to duel
for show with an inner rival in the late stages and narrowly prevailed. TIME TO DAZZLE tracked along the inside, got subtly shuffled back behind a rival at
the half mile pole, regained stride shifting four wide and between horses nearing midstretch, dueled for show with an outer rival late but missed. KAIRYU
(IRE) vied along the inside before being wrangled back as an outer rival took charge into the turn, stalked turning for home, chased behind that foe into the
lane, vied for show leaving the furlong grounds but yielded late. BUTTERCREAM BABE broke slowly, advanced five wide and outside of rivals while tugging
around the turn, attempted a bid between horses at the quarter pole, but got outkicked and faded. PHAROAH'S WINE lacked speed three to five wide,
swung out to the eight path into upper stretch and failed to menace. AMIDST WAVES lacked speed two wide and between horses, shifted out six wide
entering the lane, then leveled off without threatening. POUNCE yielded between rivals at the six furlong pole, tucked to save ground off of the pace into the
turn, checked behind rivals at the half mile pole, moved out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. VISUALLY pursued two wide and between
horses, then gave way. GAVEA (GER) tracked in the four path got outkicked by outer rivals entering upper stretch and tired. REGULATORY RISK stalked
three to two wide, attempted a bid along with outer rivals at the quarter pole but faltered between horses shortly after. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOLIAD showed the way two wide before crossing over to the inside into the turn, built a clear margin while well in hand nearing the lane, responded when
set down in upper stretch and held well through the late stages. CASH EQUITY (FR) rated at the rear in the two path, swung out to the seven path entering
the lane and rallied to gain place late. TALK OF THE NATION pursued from midpack three wide, shifted five wide nearing the lane, rallied to bid for place
along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth but got outfinished. RECKONING FORCE broke a step slow before steadying when put to crowded quarters
between horses at the start, trailed in the three path, moved out to the eight path into the final furlong and rallied belatedly. EMMANUEL tracked along the
inside, claimed place from an outer rival while taking aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase in the final furlong and
flattened out late. IRISH ACES pursued from midpack two wide, then between horses around the turn, chased along the inside into the final furlong and
lacked a bid while one paced. ANCIENT ROME settled off of the pace along the inside, moved to the three path into the turn, fanned to the sis path reaching
the lane and lacked a rally. TUT'S REVENGE prompted along the inside before backing off entering the turn, stalked outside of the leader and from the
three path along with an outer foe around the bend, chased into the lane and weakened between horses. FUNTASTIC AGAIN stalked outside of the top pair
and from the four path, chased into the lane and weakened between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
HOWARD WOLOWITZ tracked four deep, bid and gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, got subtly headed by an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, fought on while lightly grazing with that one in the final sixteenth and re-edged an advantage late. YELLOW CARD pursued from midpack in the
two to three path, tipped five wide with three furlongs to go, rallied to bid and forge a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, but failed to change leads in
the late stages, flattened out, hung and was turned away. MANSA MUSA (IRE) laid off of the pace in the three to four path, swung six wide into upper
stretch and rallied to edge show late. EVADE (FR) broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, moved to the three path with three furlongs to go,
tipped four wide and between horses entering the lane, ran on to vie for show with an outer bidder in the closing stages but got outfinished. PLEASE
ADVISE took light contact from an inner rival at the start and grazed an outer foe in the aftermath, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out to the seven
path in midstretch and rallied belatedly. BEAR RIVER raced forwardly two wide and between horses, turned for home a bit keen among foes, chased
between rivals in upper stretch and lacked a bid. HEDWIG tracked along the inside under strong restraint into the turn, encountered traffic at the quarter
pole, shifted out and failed to menace between horses. SMOKEY SMOKEY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path and failed to factor. GENERAL
LEDGER vied along the inside before allowing an outer rival to show the way into the turn, stalked close up inside of that one around the turn, took rail aim
entering the lane, but lacked a bid and caved. APOLLO TEN brushed an outer rival upon leaving the gate, stalked in the three path and between horses,
pursued in range turning for home, but weakened through the lane. VOTE NO took a light brush from an inner rival soon after the start, trailed in the two to
three path and got outrun. JOE SHIESTY transferred light contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, rushed forward to grab the lead from an
inner rival into the turn, showed the way in to the lane, but got headed by outer rivals at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. THE RIDER OF YELLOW
CARD CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HOWARD WOLOWITZ ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
COGBURN showed the way in the two path while well in hand around the turn, drew off when let out in upper stretch and was driven home to seal the deal.
KHAADEM (IRE) was fractious in the paddock, then broke slow, lacked speed along the inside into the turn, rallied three wide and between horses in
midstretch then edged place from inner rivals in the closing stages. AXTHELM lacked speed in the three path, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch,
rallied belatedly to narrowly reach show at the wire. NOBALS pursued from midpack in the four path, chased two wide and between foes into the lane,
progressed to vie for place in the final furlong, but was bested late and got nailed for show. CHARCOAL laid close up tucking to the inside into the turn,
stalked around the turn, attempted a bid inside of the eventual winner at the quarter pole, but proved no match shortly after, gave way and lost place in the
final sixteenth. ONE TIMER tracked along the inside and chased along the rail through the lane. GEAR JOCKEY was shuffled back behind rivals into the
turn, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path nearing the lane, chased between horses and lacked a bid. COPPOLA stalked in the three
path and between horses, brushed with an outer rival entering the lane in the four path, chased among foes into midstretch and faded. NOBLE
REFLECTION pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, but tired. MO STASH stalked in the four path, brushed with an inner rival
nearing the lane in the five path and tired. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE failed to factor from the five path. WITTY trailed in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
THORNBURY had position mid-pack settling three to four wide, advanced with clear running room heading into upper stretch, struck the lead near the
eighth pole and forged clear. FOUR TOP bumped with rivals at the start, settled well back inside, saved ground, came out four wide in the stretch, rallied
between runners but was bumped into a rival near the sixteenth pole. PUBLICITY was bumped at the start, moved forward outside mostly four to five wide
coming into the stretch, came in nearing the sixteenth pole bumping a rival, kept on. PHREDDIE MAC exchanged a light bump at the start, settled toward
the rear kept racing off the rail, swung widest coming past the furlong marker to be nine deep, was gaining late. LOU'S LEGACY was in a bit tight inside in
the early going, outpaced through the beginning stages, still had much to do coming past the quarter pole, angled seven wide by the furlong grounds,
gained late. FIREFIGHT set the very early pace then dueled inside a foe on or just off the rail, lacked the needed late kick. FAYETTE SPIRIT bumped a rival
at the start, moved forward to press then duel for the lead outside, lugged out near the sixteenth pole and was bumped inward, lacked anything extra for the
final stages. RACHMAN tracked the leading pair inside the second flight, came out about the three-eighths, dropped back significantly over the next bit of
ground but kept on in the stretch. DE LA CALLES was forwardly-positioned not too far off the dueling leaders outside two to three deep, was still within
range coming to the stretch, forced in while in tight quarters at the sixteenth pole and could not threaten thereafter. SECURED LENDER came in a bit after
the start, was well-positioned early moving forward settling inside and off about mid-pack, advanced in the stretch, checked near the sixteenth pole when put
in tight and altered out to avoid runners, was not persevered with thereafter. BEE PLUS was always well back racing off the inside and not a factor.
THABAAT bumped with a rival at the start, was always outrun and had no response.
