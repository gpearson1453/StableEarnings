Footnotes
MINE THAT STAR tracked the early pace, raced five wide through the turn, made a bid on LIBERTY FOREVER in mid stretch, dueled with that rival to the
wire and prevailed. LIBERTY FOREVER followed the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, angled in through the turn, found room in early stretch,
dueled with the winner and just missed. DEAN'S LIST was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out stretch and finished evenly
late. TRUTH SEEKER was void of any early speed, raced six wide and offered no late rally. SHOTSHELL set a clear early pace from off the rail and faded.
BENDER was unhurried early, loomed up five wide and flattened out.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS RYDER followed the early pace, ranged up five wide out of the second turn, took control mid stretch and edged clear. GRIFTER raced in mid
pack early, advanced four wide through the second turn, angled in stretch, mild rally, second best. REIGN OVER ME set a clear early pace, raced off the rail
into the turns, couldn't hold and weakened. COMING ABSTRACTION was void of any early speed, raced five wide through the second turn, angled out to
the seven path and finished belatedly. GREENBRIER was allowed to settle from the inside, angled out in the drive and was empty late. SMOKEN HOUDINI
was outrun early, raced four wide into the second turn and never fired. MIDNIGHT SUSI was unhurried early, raced three wide into the second turn and was
no factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
