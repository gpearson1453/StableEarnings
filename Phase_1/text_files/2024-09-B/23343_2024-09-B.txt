Footnotes
AGOO showed the way in the two path, felt pressure from a pair of outer bidders passing the three furlong pole, turned away those challenges as an inner
bidder loomed a danger in upper stretch, got headed by that one at the furlong grounds, yet fought back to regain an advantage in the late stages.
MIRACLE WORKER stalked close up along the inside, tracked the leading trio turning for home, slipped through to offer a rail bid in upper stretch, led into
the final furlong, but gave in late and got outfinished. PARKWAY pursued from the three to four path, then moved up. TEMECULA leaned out at the start,
stalked in the four path, moved to bid and apply pressure outside of the top pair and three furlong pole, sustained pressure tucking to the three path entering
the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch and gave way. FINDAWAY broke a step slow, raced forwardly among foes in the three path, bid outside of
the leader along with an outer rival at the three furlong pole, prompted between horses turning for home, but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SALLY O'MALLEY got rank between horses nearing the nine sixteenths pole, shifted outside of rivals shortly after, brushed with an inner foe while entering
the turn in the five path, advanced in hand to off a bold bid outside of the leading trio at the five sixteenths pole, led entering upper stretch, drove clear and
held sway from a pair of inner pursuers. LADY ABERDEEN stalked forwardly along the inside, checked slightly behind the leaders entering the lane, slipped
through to gain place in midstretch, then held that position from an outer challenger while slowly closing in on the leader. EFFERVESCENT broke a step
slow and was brushed by an outer rival at the start, checked among foes with five furlongs to go, brushed with an outer rival while settling into midpack three
wide into the turn, awaited racing room before tipping five wide entering the lane, ran on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was denied that position
late. ENDLESS GLOW lacked speed along the inside, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and rallied belatedly. FOXY ZORRA prompted two wide and
between horses, tracked among foes into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, encountered traffic in upper stretch and lacked a bid. BEACH
BUNNY prompted outside of the leader and from the three path and between horses into the turn, bid turning for home, got outkicked by an outer rival in
upper stretch and yielded. LOTUS CASE broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted to the five path in midstretch and failed to factor.
ELLA ELIZABETH showed the way in the three to two path as a outer pair of rivals pressed into the turn, vied with those bidders turning for home, got
headed as a wider rival joined the fray reaching the lane and weakened between horses. FLIGHT ON RACE DAY brushed an inner rival leaving the gate,
got rank among foes with five furlongs to go, steadied back shortly after, settled well back in the four path and made little impact. VIN D'OR stalked in the
four path, bid outside of the top pair as an outer rival loomed a danger turning for home, then weakened between horses in upper stretch.
ITOOKDAMONEYHONEY trailed in the two path around the turn and showed little.

MO WINNING brushed an outer rival at the start, tugged to midpack along the inside around the first turn, stalked closer to the leader around the far turn,
slipped through to offer a rail bid along with outer rivals in upper stretch, dueled with an outer foe through the final furlong and prevailed. ASK ARTHUR
stalked in the four path, bid four deep in upper stretch, sparred with an inner rival through the final furlong but missed. GAMBLERS TAIL laid off of the pace
two wide and between horses, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and firmly jostled an outer rival at the furlong grounds, then
rallied along with that foe to edge show in the final sixteenth and held that position. MANDALORIAN brushed an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace
while tugging in the bit in the three to four path around the first turn, pursued the main group turning for home, but was firmly jostled by an inner rival into an
outer foe upon reaching the furlong grounds, ran on to vie for show with his inner offender in the final sixteenth but was denied. MO RUM pressed the leader
from the three path, bid three wide and between horses in upper stretch, got outkicked by rivals on both sides at the furlong grounds and gave way.
BETTERA pursued from midpack in the five to three path around the first turn, then from the four path while further back around the far turn, shifted five
wide trying to pick up stride entering the lane, but was bumped by inner rivals in midstretch and failed to menace. MY FRIEND LOUIE was squeezed back
between rivals at the start, trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path around the far turn and made little impact. MR MCGREGOR showed the way in the

UNION MIST pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, ranged up to loom boldly outside the new leader and from the four path turning for
home, bid at the quarter pole and struck the front entering the lane, then drove clear with a sixteenth to go. VIABLE broke a step slow and was brushed by
an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, waited before altering course two wide and between horses entering the lane, then rallied along the
rail to edge place in the shadow of the wire. VINO FRIZZANTE pressed the leader from the three path, vied approaching the far back, led at the three
furlong pole before meeting an outer challenge nearing the lane, got headed by that one entering it, fought on through midstretch, but yielded through the
final sixteenth and lost place to an inner bidder at the wire. CHURNING BERNI trailed in the two path, advanced past outer rivals while turning for home in
the three path, then moved up between foes. SHEZALITTLESTINKER tugged in midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, pursued
getting floated three to four wide into the lane, lacked a bid then lost fourth at the wire. PRESTWICK tossed her head and brushed an inner rival at the start,
tracked in the four path, chased in the five path into the far turn and gave way. LEISURE TIME lacked speed in the five path, shfited in entering the lane and
made little impact. RUNCATHERINERUN set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole and weakened turning for
home. VANISHED stalked along the inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, three wide and between horses entering the lane, then faded.
LEGACY DEFINED broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, but was done early, eased through the lane, jogged across the wire and
walked off.

Footnotes
ZEITLOS broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, tipped to the three path entering the lane, gained between horses before shifting out to the six path in
midstretch, then rallied outside of the leaders to drive past at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. POSITANO SUNSET pursued form midpack along the
inside, took the turn in the two path, got outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, then sustained a rail charge to gain place in the final sixteenth. HAPPY AM
I stalked the clear leader from the three path, chased between horses while shifting out to counter the leader's drift in midstretch, got outkicked by his
pursuing counterparts shortly after, yet kept on to wear down the early leader for show. RUN FOR THE HILLS set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out
slightly at the furlong grounds, got caught by an outer challenger at the sixteenth pole and weakened between horses. UNSUNG MELODY broke outwardly,
tracked in the four path and tired. BACKYARD MONEY was urged along pursuing in the three to four path around the turn, fanned to the six path into the
lane, then failed to factor.

of the leader passing the furlong grounds, forged an advantage at the sixteenth marker and inched clear. ATTACHE prompted outside of the leader and
from the three path, vied in the four path entering the lane, led and drew clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer bidder in the final furlong.
LINEBACKER pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped three wide at the three furlong pole, moved out to the five to six path in midstretch and ran on
willingly. HOUSE UNITED broke a step slow, trailed in the two path around the turn, swung out to the six path entering the lane and rallied to gain fourth
late. THINK BIG bumped with an inner rival at the start, saved ground well back and moved up. CALL ME ANDY raced forwardly getting keen behind the

stretch and lacked a bid. EDIFIED was reluctant to load, broke a step slow and bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced near the rear in the four path
into the turn and failed to factor. HARRODSBURG broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace inside of a prompting rival while a path off of the rail around
the turn, got headed by that one in upper stretch and faltered between horses. OWN THE FIELD made little impact from the three path. GLOBAL STAGE

Footnotes
MUSICAL MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, split the leading pair to bid at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear shortly after, then drifted out while
widening in the final furlong. CORNINGSTONE laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, got briefly keen nearing the backstretch, trailed
leaving the five furlong pole, bided time behind rivals two wide turning for home, rallied between foes into the final furlong, claimed place at the sixteenth
pole and fended off an outer challenger late. SHOTGUN HOTTIE settled near the rear in the four path early on, three wide around the far turn, swung six
wide into the lane, ran on to bid for place in the final furlong but was kept at bay. PIGALLE pressed two wide, bid between horses turning for home, led in
the three path in upper stretch, but offered little resistance to an inner challenge at the three sixteenths pole and yielded between horses. TAXED pursued
from midpack two wide, then between horses down the backstretch, tipped four wide to take aim in upper stretch, but lacked a kick and gave way. LOVED
broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. HOOSIER PHILLY tracked three wide, attempted a bid outside of the top pair turning for
home, but floated five wide and weakened between horses in upper stretch. FREE LIKE A GIRL bobbled very slightly upon leaving the gates while still
breaking towards the top, set the pace along the inside, met a pair of outer challenges turning for home, got headed in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
HAPPY IS A CHOICE pursued from midpack in the four path, fanned to the five path into the lane, rallied to take aim outside of the clear leader in the final
furlong, sustained slow progress to offer a late bid and wore him down in the shadow of the wire. SKELLY dictated terms with a loose advantage in the three
path around the turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but could not contain an outer challenger in the closing stages and gave in willingly.
HERE MI SONG stalked along the inside as the clear leader's closest pursuer into the turn, tipped out to the four path to take aim outside of that one at the
five sixteenths pole, chased along with an outer foe through midstretch, shifted in at the sixteenth pole but needed more to complete a bid. NECKER
ISLAND chased in the three path and between a pair of rivals around the turn, then lacked a bid. MANNY WAH saved ground off of the pace around the
turn, altered course three wide in midstretch and failed to menace. CYCLONE MISCHIEF trailed in the two to three path, shifted to the four path into upper
stretch and failed to factor. CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR pursued from midpack along the inside, lacked a bid and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
JONATHAN'S WAY set the pace inside of a prompting rival into the turn, held a margin as a wider rival took up chase turning for home, repelled that foe
entering the lane, kicked away in upper stretch and held sway. OWEN ALMIGHTY tracked two to three wide and between horses, drifted out to the five path
while staying on in upper stretch, rallied to reach place leaving the furlong grounds and narrowed the winner's margin in the late stages. GIOCOSO tugged
forward to track three wide and between horses, continued progress to attempt a bid outside of the leader leaving the three furlong pole, sustained pressure
nearing the lane, but was turned away at the quarter pole, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, lost place at the furlong grounds and held show thereafter.
MESERO laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the three path entering the lane, then advanced between horses through midstretch and stayed on
willingly. SANDMAN broke a step slow and brushed with an outer foe at the start, lacked speed in the two to three path and moved up between horses.
JACK'S TIME stalked along the inside, chased into the lane and gave way. MAGNITUDE brushed with an inner foe upon leaving the gate, pressed outside
of the eventual winner, then weakened between horses reaching the five sixteenths pole. STRUMMIN lagged behind early on, took the turn in the three
path, swung out to the eight path entering the lane and improved position. AUTHENTIC STRIKE tracked forwardly four wide, but faded in the five to six path
leaving upper stretch. FIRMUS retreated down the backstretch, raced far back in the five to tour path around the turn and got outrun.
POLITICALLYCORRECT broke a step slow and was last away, lacked speed in the five path and made little impact.

Footnotes
HANDSOME PANTS pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, bid three wide along with an outer
rival in upper stretch, sparred with that one through midstretch and inched clear late. KINETIC CONTROL broke slowly, laid off of the pace while in the bit
along the inside around the first turn, progressed three to four wide and between horses turning for home, bid five to four wide and outside of rivals in upper
stretch, dueled with an inner foe into the final furlong but failed to keep pace with that one late. COOPER was brushed by an inner rival and took back from
between horses at the start, trailed early on, advanced inside of rivals around the far turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and sustained progress
to gain show in the final furlong. MONET'S MAGIC pursued from midpack two to three wide, fanned six wide into the lane and moved up while hanging on
his left lead. TICKLED QUIST showed the way along the inside early on, stalked a clearing rival down the backstretch, rebid outside of that one at the five
sixteenths pole, but got outkicked by an outer bidding pair in upper stretch and faded. SO SANDY lacked speed in the three path, trailed around the far turn
then improved position. HOMER'S ODYSSEY laid close up along the inside, checked when tugging off the leader's heels around the first turn, tracked
before awaiting racing room turning for home, but came up empty. VADEN lacked speed along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and made little
impact. THUNDERHAWK steadied while forward in the three path and among foes around the first turn, split foes before being sent to a clear advantage
passing the nine sixteenths pole, but got headed by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole and readily stopped. DESERT AIRE brushed an outer foe at
the start, pressed two wide, stalked the clearing leader down the backstretch, then three wide around the far turn and weakened between horses reaching
the lane. RIPPED tracked in the four path, chased around the far turn and faded seven wide entering the lane.
