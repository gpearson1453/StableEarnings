was collared from the inside, chased, altered in late avoiding the winner and missed the place. EIGHT WEEKS LONG Hit the gate at the start, five wide
early, two path on the turn, eased out some and closed well late. RAGING BEAR Never far back six wide, five wide into lane, asked and failed to fire.
PURECRAZIGROOVE Close up five wide, four wide into the lane and then appeared to be blocked at the sixteenth pole and checked. UNCLE VIC Broke
