Footnotes
ANSTRUTHER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from the inside of MAKENA'S JOY in the run
down the backside, maintained her advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. MAKENA'S JOY away well and tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly one out from the
rail in the drive to prove easily second best. MISS LARUE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail in the run down the
backside, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. BROOKLAND stalked the
early pace into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. ZENARI broke sharply, but was devoid of early speed and dropped back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

ASKMENOQUESTIONS broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside,
opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and continued to widen late while ridden out late. DON W settled off the early pace while saving ground at
the rail, advanced from along the inside midway down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove
second best. BETTER TONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, mounted a three wide bid entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in
the lane to get up for a share in the final strides. WICKED NIGHT away alertly and dueled for the early lead while racing to the outside of
ASKMENOQUESTIONS through the first turn, chased that rival two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter
approaching the final turn, and was outfinished through the final furlong while finishing three wide in the drive. STANFORD NORTH away well and stalked
the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

PERFECT PENNY settled off the early pace while racing mid pack into the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in time. PENALTY TO RANGERS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, shook clear of her pace rival entering the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and
just failed to last. WALKINTHEWALK lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid from along the
inside entering the final turn, and closed with a rush five wide in the drive to just miss. DRILL BABY DRILL trailed the field into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail entering the backside, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the
drive. TEXAS LEGACY settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of PENALTY TO
RANGERS entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs with her pace rival nearing the final
turn, and faded over the final furlong. STAR FINALITY away well and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
but began to weaken approaching the final turn, and wasn't persevered with late.

SOMEDAY LADY away well and tracked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn,

entering the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from along the rail in the run down the backside, battled for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
was overtaken leaving the turn, but battled gamely two wide in the drive to prove second best. BREEZIN BRIANNE away alertly and dueled for the lead
from the outside of THEY CALL ME TOM entering the first turn, held a narrow advantage in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between
rivals through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the top pair entering the lane, and closed two wide in the drive to just hold on for a share.
ANOTHER LAST DANCE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and finished
with late interest three wide in the drive to just miss the show position. I'M IN CONTROL was off a step slow, but raced into a stalking trip one out from the
rail entering the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon late. WHY NOTS A
WYNNER stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, continued three wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called

Footnotes
AVANA settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to bide her time well off the pacesetters
into the backstretch, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in time. VIVA LA DIVA away
alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of EYES OF BEAUTY in the run down
the backside, took a clear lead into the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while proving easily second best. EYES OF BEAUTY away well and tracked
the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail. forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep
tabs with her pace rival entering the final turn, but battled determinedly two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. SIGNORA VITTORIA stalked the early
pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot. DREAMING D'ORO broke sharply and stalked the early pace while
racing two wide through the stretch the first time, held her position into the backside while racing three out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but was unable to mount a late bid while finishing four wide in the drive. BABY I'M A STAR unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the
first time, continued to bide her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BROOKE MAGIC stalked the early leaders while saving ground along the inside through the
stretch the first time, held her position into the backstretch, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
I'M SEEING RED rushed to the lead from along the rail passing the wire the first time, shook clear of early challengers int he run down the backside to open
a clear lead entering the final turn, and was never threatened late. KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE away alertly and pressed the pace two wide entering the final turn,
chased the leader two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just hod the
place. MAX BOOSTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the
drive to just miss the place. ANDALEIGH tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn,
and closed four wide in the drive. SHE'S KIND OF HOT away well and pressed the pace three wide into the backstretch, forced the issue to the final turn,
but had little to offer over the final furlong. FEBRUARY broke sharply and steadied while bouncing off the rail in the run to the first turn, settle off the early
pace while saving ground in the run down the backside, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
