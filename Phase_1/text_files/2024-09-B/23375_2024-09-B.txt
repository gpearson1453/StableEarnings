Footnotes
MISS ACCELERATE away well and tracked the pacesetter two wide into the backstretch, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn,
and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove best. FOOTHILLS BLVD. broke sharply and was hustled to the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained her advantage through the final turn, but was unable to fend off MISS ACCELERATE
in deep stretch while laying in under left handed urging. B C CHRISTIE away alertly and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run
down the backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn to loom a danger leaving the turn, but finished evenly late. ISLAND LIVING stalked
the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the
drive in an even effort. FEISTY ELLA settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, saved ground entering the final
turn, but failed to mount a late bid. DONE THAT settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail
entering the final turn, but was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHAMRA away well and tracked the pacesetter two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail while chasing the pacesetter into the
final turn, but was outfinished late. QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was off a step slow and trailed the field into the first turn, began to advance four wide upon
entering the backside, continued three out from the rail while looming a danger entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain her bid in the late going.
MISS THE HYPE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. WANDALITA away alertly and stalked the early pace while racing two wide into the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to just miss. NINE
OCLOCK CEASER broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, rallied
along the rail through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive and held off a late surge by WANDALITA to prevail. QUALITY COMMAND stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, lacked room briefly entering the
lane, but closed willingly from along the rail in deep stretch to get up for a share.

Footnotes
BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT broke sharply and eased off the pacesetters through the first turn to take a tracking trip into the stretch the first time, maintained her
position into the backstretch, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backside, continued three wide into the final turn, assumed command leaving
the turn, and drew clear to prove best. CHICKASAW settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, commenced her bid two
out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to prove second best. FRASER LANDING dueled for the lead from the outside of
SLOOP JOHN B entering the lane the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and from between rivals through the
final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. GROOVIN' IS BAK away alertly and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first
time while racing two out from the rail, lost position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail through the final turn, and improved her position
over the final furlong without seriously threatening. SLOOP JOHN B away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set
a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but weakened in the late stages. WISELY PLAYED unhurried early
while trailing the field into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing five wide in the drive. LOGICAL AL stalked the
leaders two wide through the lane the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over
the final furlong.

Footnotes
I'M ALL SHOOK UP away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of BLUEBIRD CAFE through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue
two wide in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prevail in the closing
strides. BLUEBIRD CAFE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail
in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive and just failed to last. FLYING MISS unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive to get up for a
share. WEEKENDINDELMAR stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run
down the backside, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. The rider of WEEKENDINDELMAR dropped
his whip leaving the final turn. MINI MARKET away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail,
maintained her position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shifted to the rail entering the lane, and closed from along the rail in the drive.
PETERSON LANDING settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, held her position in the backside, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in deep stretch while lacking room late. The rider of PETERSON LANDING lost her whip leaving the
turn. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground into the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong. FOREVER SUMMER settled well off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail through the first turn, was always
well back, and failed to make an impact.

turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get the place. DEAL EM unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid four wide entering the

entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished well from
along the rail in the drive and just missed the show sot. OUR BLOKE tracked the pacesetter two wide entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue two
wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late going. GO LENT GO stalked the leaders through the stretch
the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. PRINCE CAIRO settled well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside through the stretch the first

AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from the inside of BACK SHACK in the
run down the backside, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. BACK SHACK away well and pressed the
pace two wide entering the backstretch, continued to chase the pacesetter two wide into the final turn, was unable to gain on the leader late, but finished
smartly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. RACING RIVER broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and finished evenly to garner a share.
PARKER POINT tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, lost position in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. TIZ VICIOUS unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, bided his time at the
back of the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the lane. THERE GOES
MY HERO settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, continued two wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.
