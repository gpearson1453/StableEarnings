Footnotes
FORMAL ORDER lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail the final six furlongs, found a large opening inside RUNNING RIVER through the stretch, rallied
and took the lead in deep stretch. RUNNING RIVER set a pressured pace near the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch and just missed in a sharp
effort. EYE ON THE CANDY prompted the pace outside RUNNING RIVER, was floated wide by that one entering the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. AMERICAN D'ORO stalked the pace in a striking position down the backstretch, eased out four deep leaving the far turn then flattened out.
DAREDAVITE raced in the two path on both turns and failed to rally. FACTOTUM , three wide the first turn, dropped back and was eased through the
stretch.

DO IT FOR MICHAEL came in leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead and was taken to the inner rail, remained along the rail around the turn,
opened up in mid stretch and held sway under urging. BARBADIAN RUNNER , fractious going into the starting gate, was pinched back after a slow start,
circled the turn four wide and closed gamely. LITTLE BIT RISKY , four wide down the backstretch, moved to the two path on the turn, prompted the winner
to upper stretch then weakened. HAPPYFLYER , in tight quarters at the start, steadied in traffic soon after the break, was four wide on the turn and
weakened. KISSLING bumped with BARBADIAN RUNNER after being forced in at the start, chased the pace in the three path between horses and gave
way. SIR MICK , in tight quarters along the inner rail near the five eighths pole, hugged the rail chasing the early pace and faltered. ELLINGER , in traffic
about a furlong after the start, chased the pace between horses to the turn, faltered and was eased.

GIFT OF GAB relaxed nicely four wide outside a rival and off of a contested pace, cruised up into the lane to take aim, responded when roused past the
quarter pole, forged to command near mid stretch, spurted clear under a drive then held firm through the final yards. WISE AND ELEGANT , between foes
into the turn, angled five wide advancing into the lane, ranged up to take aim nearing mid stretch, continued gamely outside the winner but was kept at bay.
MILLIAT (IRE) settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, edged up behind foes, then worked further out into the course,
straightened and rallied between foes. LILLY SIMONE broke in the air and was away last, regrouped and was taken to the inner rail, eased out three wide
into the lane, was guided well out in the course past mid stretch and kept on willingly. FLOWER MOUND rated inside while in range mid turn, angled out for
the drive, was put in tight when trying to work between runners in mid stretch, got a seam soon after and kept on with good effort. BONDIVA tracked the
dueling leaders three wide, failed to kick on under pressure near mid stretch and faded. RAINAS ROLLIN got into a duel outside MARIAN CROSS (GB)
soon after the break, sparred on a slim lead into the lane, clung to advantage past the three sixteenths then weakened in the final furlong. MARIAN CROSS
(GB) broke sharp and got engaged in a battle to the inside of RAINAS ROLLIN, ceded the lead nearing the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then
surrendered. SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , off the duel and outside a rival, angled seven wide for the drive but lacked a bid. THE AMAZING MIZZEN , three
to four wide chasing the embattled leaders, weakened nearing the lane.

AUDACIOUS stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, moved up in the two path between horses on the bend, swung four wide at the head of
the stretch, secured command in upper stretch, went clear then dug in late under encouragement. TOO MANY KISSES lacked speed, saved ground the far
turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied nicely. PLANET CLARE , checked in close quarters mid way on the first turn, was rank
entering the backstretch, swung to the five path turning for home and flattened out. GO SHERRY GO , three wide the first turn, prompted the pace outside
MONARCH and tired. MONARCH broke in the air, rushed up four wide into the first turn, moved to the inner rail after sprinting clear entering the
backstretch, set the pace, drifted out turning for home and gave way. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD , well placed down the backstretch, circled the far turn three
wide and gave way. MIZ SENSE left her rider in the starting gate when vehemently throwing her head around at the break. There was a stewards' inquiry
concerning the start but no action was taken, as she had created her own problem.

Footnotes
NO SHOW SAMMY JO (GB) , taken to rate in range while saving ground, eased out with a smooth run into the lane, forged to command outside CUT
FROM CLASS nearing the furlong grounds, kicked away after some right handed asks then held firm while solidly hand ridden the final seventy yards.
ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) settled towards the inner rail while not too far back, awaited room from the three eighths to about the quarter pole, slipped through
along the rail into the stretch, shifted out to progress between runners leaving mid stretch, continued on gamely and earned the place to the inside of
CIRCLE HOME. CIRCLE HOME , taken back soon after the break, dropped in and settled off the pace, came off the inside leaving the far turn to commence
a run, circled rivals with a bold advance into the stretch, ranged up with aim past mid stretch, kept on willingly but was edged by an inner rival for the show.
CUT FROM CLASS cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, came under a ride entering the stretch, ceded to the winner near the eighth pole
and faded in the final yards. FOR FLYING (BRZ) , headstrong early while in close attendance outside CUT FROM CLASS, rated better soon into the
backstretch and tracked off the inside, was under pressure three wide between rivals nearing the lane and weakened. SHE'S DANCING stalked the pace
three wide, was under a ride four wide between horses near the quarter pole, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. BLOOD ORANGE
settled off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, shifted out some for the drive but failed to generate a rally.

LOON CRY lacked speed, raced inside horses on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, moved to the six path in upper stretch, closed smartly outside
rivals, led late and drove clear. QUEEN OF THE MUD (IRE) saved ground on the turn, advanced in the two path in upper stretch, challenged for the lead
outside ALL THAT MAGIC in mid stretch and continued gamely. LOVE APPEALS chased the pace between horses around the turn, eased out to the four
path in upper stretch, had clear sailing and lacked the necessary response. HAY STACK , rated down the backstretch, worked between hoses in the stretch
and closed too late. ALL THAT MAGIC set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. BLAME DAY saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in
the stretch and failed to rally. L STREET LADY , three wide chasing the pace on the turn, weakened. SHOSHANAH prompted the pace outside ALL THAT
MAGIC and gave way. MS. BUCCHERO three wide on the turn, angled in approaching the stretch and gave way. ANAITA , wide on the turn, was fanned to

POST TIME broke a step slow, recovered and dropped in advancing past the three quarter pole, continued inside progress past the half then was eased out
mid turn, bid between foes approaching the stretch, poked a head in front soon into the lane, powered away under stout encouragement in mid stretch then
cruised home through the final seventy yards. CURLIN'S MALIBU stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled well back, saved ground into the stretch,
worked outward in the final furlong and finished up willingly to gain the place in the final yards. DEBIT CARD rated off the leaders while off the inside,
advanced with the winner bidding three deep five sixteenths from home, sparred past the quarter pole, gave willing chase past mid stretch then faded late.
FRIGHTLAND vied outside AIN'T BEER COLD then went clear under coaxing into the turn, dropped in towards the rail to set the pace past the three
eighths, was taken on by a pair of outer rivals soon after, fought on past the quarter pole then weakened through the final sixteenth. AIN'T DA BEER COLD
disputed the early pace under asking and to the inside of FRIGHTLAND, shifted out after that one cleared approaching the far turn, lacked a response mid
turn, faltered and was eased through the drive.

Footnotes
P MONEY saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, gamely split foes through a narrow opening near the eighth pole and lasted under urging. HOLD UP ,
along the rail on the turn, eased out turning for home, moved to the five path in mid stretch and closed gamely. TWIRLING EXPRESS raced in mid pack in
the two path on the turn, swung to the six path in mid stretch and rallied. ROOMMATE MARTIN prompted the pace outside SHARP RED EAGLE to mid
stretch, finished willingly and his rider briefly eased up nearing the finish. THREE CAPTAINS , angled to the inner rail leaving the backstretch while outrun,
moved to the six path mid stretch and passed tired horses. LITTLE SKIPPY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. UPSIDEDOWN MAN
lacked speed, stayed in the two path on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SHARP RED EAGLE sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and
weakened the final furlong. TIK TOK DADDY , no factor, drifted wide entering the stretch.
