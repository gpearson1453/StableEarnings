Footnotes
ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT prompted inside of the leader before tipping to re-engage outside of that one into the turn, bid two wide turning for home, drew
clear in upper stretch and held sway. GUN BARREL moved forward to track in the three path and between horses into the turn, ranged up and took aim on
the new leader while drifting out to the four to five path entering the lane, but only managed to chase that one home and held place from an inner bidder.
KISTLER hopped at the start and was last away, laid off of the pace along the inside, crept closer around the turn, tipped to the three path into the lane,
advanced past an inner pair before taking aim inside of place in the final furlong, sustained a bid for place but was kept at bay. SKYLER chased forwardly
along the inside, moved to the two path in upper stretch and sustained even pursuit. UNCLE TUFFY broke a step slow, then steadied hard when put to tight
rail quarters by an outer foe at the eleven sixteenths pole, trailed along the inside around the turn, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch, tipped out in the
final furlong and gained fifth late. GETOUTYOURWALLET checked between horses approaching the turn, raced off of the pace along the inside around the
bend, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to menace. STORMIN LOVE was reluctant to load, lacked speed in the four path and failed to factor. PAPA
ALDEN set the pace before being confronted by an outer rival into the turn, got headed by that bidder entering the lane and weakened. SESAME STREEK
broke outwardly, raced forwardly in the four path and between horses, but faded with three furlongs to go. LUCCHESI broke outwardly, tracked in the five to
four path into the turn, gave way drifting to the six path into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
TERRAPIN STATION stalked three wide and from the four path, exchanged bumps with an inner rival whlie taking aim on the leader in upper stretch,
sustained a bid at the furlong grounds and edged clear whlie hanging on his left lead. LIL MUGGS prompted two wide and between horses while taking the
turn in the three path, failed to sustain pressure entering the lane, chased behind the leader while trading contact with an outer foe in upper stretch, was
kept hemmed in by that one until steadying entering midstretch, briefly took inside aim before altering outside of the early leader at the sixteenth pole, and
kept on to regain place late. D BIGALOW bumped with an inner rival at the start, set a pressured pace inside of rivals while a path off of the inner rail, inched
clear from a pair of pursuers entering the lane, but failed to resist an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole, yielded and lost place late. RAVENS DREAM
tracked outside of the leading trio and from the five path, crept closer under a drive around the turn, then leveled off in upper stretch. MISCHIEVOUS TIME
broke half a beat slow, chased from midpack in the two path, pursued in the three path in upper stretch and ran on evenly. CRISIS MANAGER was tough to
load, broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the two to four path before shifting to the six path into the lane and moved up. ATLAL tracked two wide and
between horses, chased in upper stretch and faded. VERMELHO lacked speed in the three to two path around the turn and improved. SWIRLING EIGHTS
bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased forwardly along the inside and tired. STREET MO broke a step slow, trailed in the four path and made little
impact. SERKETAS steadied from between horses early on, raced off of the pace in the three path and tired. THE RIDER OF LIL MUGGS CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF TERRAPIN STATION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

CHAMPLIN set the pace in the two path, felt pressure from an outer rival turning for home, shook free in upper stretch and held sway under a drive.
GULFPORT stalked along the inside, gained place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, failed to make headway on the clear leader thereafter and held
place late. GILCREASE laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of rivals to bid
for show at the sixteenth pole and edged that position late. OSBOURNE trailed along the inside, improved past outer rivals in the three path in upper stretch,
vied for show with an outer co-bidder entering the final sixteenth but got outkicked. SWEET CHERRY PIE stalked in the four path early on, moved forward
to press the leader from the three path at the three furlong pole, but gave way to that one in upper stretch and faded while hanging on his left lead. LOVE
THE NEST tracked in the three path and between horses early on, but got a bit keen into the turn, yielded shortly after and faded on his left lead.

Footnotes
MAD ABOUT MARIE trailed early on, advanced between horses in the three path leaving the three furlong pole, tipped outside of the top pair and to the four
path at the five sixteenths pole, took aim entering the lane, chased the clear leader in upper stretch, sustained slow progress in the final furlong, flopped
back to her left lead before bidding at the sixteenth pole and edged past. ANNA'S PROMISE showed the way in the two path, drew clear entering the lane,
maintained a margin through midstretch, but met an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole and was bested late. BOUTWELL TIME tracked along the inside,
sustained a rail chase and needed more to offer a bid. MY SHOT broke a step slow and was last away, stalked four to three wide before moving forward to
press the leader from the three path into the turn, but failed to sustain pressure at the quarter pole and weakened between horses entering the lane.
GHOSTTAPPER bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased from the three path and between horses early on, yielded getting floated to the four path at
the three furlong pole and faded. KEEPTHEPARTYGOING bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed into the turn
and was outrun thereafter.

game counterpart in upper stretch, took a brush inside the final three sixteenths, battled before inching clear in the final sixteenth and just lasted from an
outer surging bidder at the wire. PREPOSITION brushed with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the
four path entering the lane, moved out to the seven in the final furlong, surged with a strong belated kick in the late stages, bid nearing the wire but narrowly

counterpart entering the lane, fought on and brushed him inside the final three sixteenths, battled gamely through midstretch but yielded in the late stages.
CODE OF JUSTICE chased in the four path, shifted out while pursuing in the final sixteenth, got outkicked by an outer foe an stayed on. GENERATIVE

GOOD CHEER trailed early on, advanced outside of rivals with nine sixteenths to go, loomed up to issue a bold three wide challenge at the three furlong
pole, assumed command turning for home and opened up under mild urging. ADEERA stalked in the three path, bid along with an outer rival at the three
furlong pole, but quickly failed to keep pace with that one turning for home, proved no match and managed place through the lane. LA MARINERA showed
the way via a clear margin around the first turn and down the backstretch, but met challenges from a pair of outer bidders at the three furlong pole, got
overhauled by her widest rival shortly after, faded while hanging on her left lead through the lane. HEARTS UNITED laid off of the pace in the two to three
path, chased and narrowly failed to catch a tiring rival for show. TALKSALOT tracked along the inside but was through early.

HIT SHOW tracked the leading trio from the two path, then the four path down the backstretch, ranged closer in the five path around the far turn, took aim
on the clear leader from the seven to eight path in upper stretch, bid reaching the furlong grounds, dueled through the late stages and prevailed. COOKE
CREEK set the pace inside of a pair of pressers while remaining a path off of the inside, shook free before shifting out to the five path in upper stretch,
moved further out to brace for HIT SHOW's outer challenge coming to midstretch, dug in and battled gamely but was bested late. RATTLE N ROLL rated
well back in the two path, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the eight path entering the lane, rallied to gain show leaving the furlong
grounds and held that position from an inner bidder. DISARM broke half a beat slow, trailed in the two to three path before shifting to the five path entering
the lane, rallied between horses, but was forced to steady and alter inside of a drifting rival at the furlong grounds, recovered and kept on to offer an inside
bid for show but was kept at bay. WARRIOR JOHNY pressed the top pair from the five path, then the four path around the far turn, sustained pressure
outside of the leader turning for home, but gave way between the eventual top pair entering the lane, drifted out and into a rival's path at the furlong
grounds, then tired between horses. BOLZY pursued from midpack in the four to three path early on, but yielded with eleven sixteenths to go, raced off of
the pace in the two path around the far turn and failed to factor. STILLETO BOY prompted two wide and between horses, came under urging into the far
turn and faded turning for home. HAPPY AMERICAN broke a beat slow, saved ground well back and never fired.

Footnotes
REMI'S MOON broke slowly, trailed in the three to four path, swung to the seven path before brushing with an inner rival entering the lane, then rallied to
reel in the leader in the shadow of the wire. FIREFIGHT broke outwardly, pressed five deep into the turn, bid turning for home, sparred with a game inner
rival through the lane, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. VELOCIRAPTOR set a pressured pace along the inside,
clung to an advantage from a quartet of rivals around the turn, dug in to resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, sparred with that one through midstretch
but yielded in the final sixteenth. LIVEHAPPY was off awkwardly, raced off of the pace in the three path, brushed with an outer rival entering the lane in the
six path and moved up. KENMORE WEST pressed four wide and between horses but gave way entering the lane. KOSHER CAPONE broke a step slow,
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BOURBON BOSS vied two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. MISCHIEVOUS M vied
three wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.
