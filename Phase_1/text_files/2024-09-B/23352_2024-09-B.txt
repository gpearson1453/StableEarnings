Footnotes
RACING HOT LINE settled in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, took the nod leaving the
turn and held well under steady stretch handling. RUDD'S ROCKET rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
loomed a factor in the three path on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BLAZE FOR DAZE took over while tapering to the inside
and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met off the rail entering the stretch, drifted a bit at the eighth pole,
flattened stride and just lasted for third. STRIKE THREE steadied leaving the gate then saved ground well off the early pace, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and just missed third in an even finish. LITTLE RICHIE came away awkwardly and in and raced off
the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. GOGO GADGET bobbled
outward leaving the gate, raced off the rail the first turn and gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the
lane. FAPPIANO HALO was shut off leaving the gate, raced in the four path on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. GETTIN
SPICY ducked in leaving the gate then stalked three wide, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn. BEST HOP IS A DROP
saved ground.

CAMPAIGN PROMISES had the lead early then pressured the runner-up, contested even terms two deep on the turn, dueled for the nod mid-stretch and
dug in determinedly to inch clear later yards. MOLLY FACTOR ducked in past the false railing then hustled up to even terms approaching the five sixteenths
pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under steady handling leaving the turn, but reluctantly ceded inside the sixteenth pole.
ROSELYNN JANE gave chase well off the rail through the backstretch, raced in the four and five paths on the turn and dug in to take third under the wire.
BEAUTIFUL TOWN chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and was steadily handled leaving the turn, but was nipped from third
under the wire. OVERNIGHT EXPRESS had a brief early lead then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane.
MAMAWASAGOGOGIRL gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. BOSS LADY BINGO gave only distant chase and raced near the rail on the
turn. MAKING MISCHIEF chased then faded in the six path on the turn.

SISTER WINNIE settled off the rail the first turn, bid into the backstretch and gained steadily, raced in the five path on the far turn, dug in for the lead later
yards and drew clear toward the wire. ADDY MAE stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and took the lead in the three path approaching
the eighth pole, lugged in through the upper stretch and was caught while flattening stride later yards. QUINN ELIA settled off the rail the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, altered course from the heels of Addy Mae in later yards but flattened stride.
FAR MORE took the lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail nearing the
head of the lane and flattened stride. SHAMELESS VISIONS was reluctant to load then hustled along through the front stretch, raced in the three path the
first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. JUNE BELLE raced in the five path the first turn and was not a factor. HOLD DEM saved
ground on the first turn then faded through the backstretch. SUGAR CANE JANE raced in the five path the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
ALVY rounded the opening turn in the five path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced in the three path on the far turn, dueled
for the lead mid-stretch and ran clear later yards. DEVIL'S HARVEST stalked from the three path the first turn, moved to even terms into the backstretch
and dueled from that point, inched clear off the rail midway on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught mid-stretch and
flattened stride later yards. PRACTICAL SENSE settled back in the three and four paths, left the first turn outside and gave chase from the half mile pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and came along to take third mid-stretch. LIEUTENANT BROWN saved early ground, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, was eased outward to the five path on the far turn and passed some rivals. ANTIPOISON settled close in the three path the first turn,
gave chase into the backstretch then weakened off the rail on the far turn. MR. MOX set the early pace off the rail, was met and dueled into the backstretch,
but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and faded in the lane. OZONE raced off the rail the first turn and made only a mild middle move.
MAKOTO saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
