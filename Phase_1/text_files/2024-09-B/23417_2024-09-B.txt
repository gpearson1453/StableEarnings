Footnotes
FREDDY FLINTSHIRE tracked the pace along the inside jumping well to maintain position, remained on hold through to the final fence, cleared that hurdle
and tipped to the two path through the turn keeping L'IMPERATOR to his inside, angled out steadily four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive
having that rival follow him out, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under some late threat and held safe to prevail. L'IMPERATOR (FR)
saved ground near the rear of the field jumping well to maintain position, remained on hold after the final flight and was caught in a blind switch through the
far and final turn to the inside of the aforementioned foe along the dogs and unable to find a clear path unless backing out, remained patiently handled and
swung two then three wide following out FREDDY FLINTSHIRE into upper stretch, was in behind HIDDEN PATH straightened away, gained clearance to
the four path nearing the eighth pole and was unleashed at that station, dug in rallying willingly to the finish but was ultimately staved off. HIDDEN PATH
along the inside early on, jumped well and tipped two to three wide approaching fence five, remained patiently handled until let out after clearing the final
flight, advanced through the flat in the final turn to flirt with command straightened away, got displaced nearing the eighth pole and kept on to preserve the
show honors. EVIE'S PRINCE knocked heads while in hand along the inside with GOING COUNTRY in the two path, jumped well to trade command at
several points, jumped late at the final flight and came under urging in the last turn, took command swinging in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and was displaced nearing the eighth pole, and weakened in the final furlong. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) dueled in hand from the two path
jumping well to trade command at several points, came under coaxing after the final flight through the far turn in the flat and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE VIC was backed into the gate, came away in good order then was hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, was asked while inside on the
turn, shook clear in upper stretch, angled out behind the loose horse outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. SHERIFF BIANCO was
hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while remaining on his
inside lead until near the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and finished willingly to narrowly win a head-bob for the place.
RUNNINSONOFAGUN settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, swung out to the five path into the stretch, gained under a
drive into the final furlong, reached even terms with the runner-up around the sixteenth-pole, was put to lighter encouragement in the final seventy yards
while only flagged with the crop and was just out-nodded for the place while clear for the show. FACTUALLY CORRECT showed speed between horses
then chased the leaders, went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path and weakened. DISARMED was sent hard from the outside
post, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn and tired. DURANTE broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the four path and faltered. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the five path,
dropped to the three path into the stretch and also faltered. STAGE LEFT was bumped solidly at the start then stumbled and unseated the rider.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the finish being geared down in the final

mild kick to just secure the place honors over a rival on the wire. MR FLOWERS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. GUN BARREL CITY settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TAKE YOUR SEATS (IRE) broke in at the start
bumping LCGOLUCKY, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
PARTY WITH SMARTY tossed his head at the start and got away a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. FIRST TRUMPET established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under
light coaxing near the quarter pole and was displaced from command, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. LCGOLUCKY got bumped at the
start by TAKE YOUR SEATS, raced three wide through the first turn and then four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the far
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ST ANDREWS bumped hard with an opponent at the start then was slow into stride, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, shifted from
the two path to the four path on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths pole, rallied outside to make a bid in upper stretch then took the lead, shook
clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. CELESTIAL GLAZE bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the
pace, moved from the rail to the three path while drafting behind horses on the turn, waited behind rivals into upper stretch then was asked, moved in near
the furlong marker and willingly earned the place. SKYLANDER was well positioned just off the pace, made an outside bid in the three path on the turn, took
the lead coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive inside the three-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but
was clear for the show. EMPTY TOMB bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the two path on the
turn, took a short lead outside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and tired. KHAFRE broke out at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. ROCCO STRONG went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, was asked while inside turn, lost
the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. NIMITZ CLASS broke a step slow, dropped well behind the rest of the
field, rounded the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and showed little. BARESE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on
the outside, dropped back under urging with five furlongs to run, went three the four wide on the turn and retreated. ALTERNATE REALITY settled on the
outside, was roused while in the four then five path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while not urged in the drive and
faltered. PERFECT FLIGHT broke out and bumped with an opponent, moved out early then was urged along well off the pace, dropped from the three path
to the rail early on the turn, moved back to the three path later on that bend and was outrun.

Footnotes
SAVE US MELANIA established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear and was roused nearing the eighth pole, then continued to draw clear to the finish. PRINCESS
BECCA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths isolated between the leader and the rest of the field falling behind, swung
three to four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. BOBBY JEAN chased two to three wide
down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. ELLIPTIC chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. DUCKPHAT lunged at the start getting away a beat slow
and then chased sluggish early on growing detached at the tail of the field, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. MOONLIT WEEKEND chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. THORNY stumbled at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased home through the final furlong to the finish. DESTINE TO RACE chased four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under brief coaxing at the three-eighths, got eased up on and guided
outside to go nine to ten paths off the rail into upper stretch and was eased home to a walk to the finish, then walked off under her own power. THIS RACE

Footnotes
MAZZEI settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then moved off the rail while chasing in upper stretch, steadied
behind the leader coming to the furlong marker, found room between horses to make a bid inside that marker and moved clear in the final sixteenth under
strong urging to prevail. PRICE IS TRUTH was hustled from gate then well placed just off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn, was asked while
moving off the rail outside the quarter-pole, chased outside under a drive in upper stretch, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker, led briefly outside
the sixteenth-pole but was headed by the winner inside that pole and proved no match while able to get the place. STARSINTHECITY showed speed
between horses then dropped back, moved in near the nine-sixteenths pole, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch,
pursued the vanguard into the final sixteenth and also proved no match for the winner then missed the place while just able to get the show. MY LIFE
STORY broke out at the start, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, led under a drive
until just outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken, had the rider lose his left rein in the final sixteenth, gathered the rein back up late and just missed
the show. AWESOME FORCE went to the front then showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat near the
five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, was in tight against the rail while dropping back near the sixteenth-pole and tired. JIM BOB bobbled
after the start, moved off the rail then settled near the rear, was roused in the three then four path on the turn, came into the stretch in the six path then
moved further out and lacked the needed response. SEVENTH RACE SHAKE broke out at the start, settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two
path on the turn and failed to threaten. EGYPTIAN QUEST settled just off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
failed to rally. BRACA was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and also failed to rally.

Footnotes
BORN DANCER coaxed from the gate, settled tracking the leader in closest aim just off the inside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took over command spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, dug in under a drive and was bumped in the hind quarters and knocked
askew by MODICA due to pressure from FEATHERS ROAD nearing the eighth pole, continued on gamely to the finish to prevail by a neck. FEATHERS
ROAD settled just off the inside just off the pace, briefly tucked inside near the first turn before tipping out to the two path into that turn, almost ran on up on
the heels of BORN DANCER and steadied and tucked to the inside near the six furlong marker forcing MODICA to steady off his heels at that station,
tracked just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, came in under a right handed crop bumping
MODICA into the hind end of BORN DANCER just outside the eighth pole, came in once more under a right handed crop forcing MODICA to pause
between foes when brushed a sixteenth out and ran on to preserve the place honors. KICK A BUCK just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked
inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
show honors. MODICA tracked the pace along the inside, had FEATHERS ROAD tucked in front taken in hand and was forced to steady six furlongs from
home midway on the first turn, continued along the inside patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper
stretch, had FEATHERS ROAD come in under a right handed crop and was bumped into the hind end of BORN DANCER just outside the eighth pole,
continued under a drive and was brushed by that same rival near the sixteenth pole and was forced to pause, then attempted to be engaged by the rider
once more near the finish but was nailed for the show honors on the wire. FRONT MAN saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. HEATHGUARD three to four wide through the first turn,
chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid but was outkicked.
OUR COUNTRY two to three wide through the first turn, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coaxed
along from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. MORE VINO bobbled at the break,
showed the way in hand along the inside, got let out headed for command when taking the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
SCAT TU TAP just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper
stretch and offered no kick. MR. MENDELSSOHN just off the inside through the first turn, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the far turn, went nine to ten wide into upper stretch and had no rally. GHOSTLYPRINCE two to three wide through the first turn,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD three
wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
A MAIZE ZING DOTIE brushed with a rival at the start, let the pacesetter cross in front then chased that foe, made a bid in the two to three path on the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole, took a short lead into the stretch, dueled outside of MYBRONXBABY until near the sixteenth-pole, disposed of that foe at
that point and prevailed under strong urging. FIRST CLASS CAT bumped soundly with a rival while also making contact with another foe at the start, was
urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with late energy to
narrowly get up for the place. MYBRONXBABY was hustled to the front, angled in near the five-eighths pole, vied inside on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch, remained on her inside lead while dueling with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole then
weakened and was just caught for the place while clear for the show. STARRY MIDNIGHT bumped soundly with an opponent at the start, moved out at the
rear outside the nine-sixteenths then angled back in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two to three path and improved position. CAROL T
was urged along off the pace, moved in inside the five-eighths pole, chased in the three then four path on the turn and tired. FABULOUS FOX broke out and
brushed with a rival then was hustled, angled in while just off the pace then chased the leader, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, dropped back
in upper stretch and weakened. BIG HAZEL broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path and was no factor. FLIGHT CONTROL stumbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three path,
dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and failed to respond.

MIRIAM'S FIRE (GB) established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged
away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held on to prevail. PANACHE stumbled at the break, chased along the inside getting let out at the quarter
pole, tipped out to the two path a furlong from home, rallied to issue a challenge to the finish and missed at the end. BOSSY PANTS chased just off the
inside briefly before being forced to steady out between foes five furlongs from home when SILENT DREAMER came inwards from the outside, tipped out at
the seven-sixteenths to be four wide through the turn and advanced well outside rivals coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying with good courage to secure the show honors by a head over a foe at the wire. BOURBON MILK PUNCH
tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and kept on to the
finish. BANNER EIGHTEEN (FR) stumbled at the start, chased along the inside and got set down continuing in the inside route into upper stretch, stayed on
one paced through to the wire. EVERY VOTE COUNTS (GB) chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths and offered no response.
SILENT DREAMER chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, came up empty.
YESTERDAY lunged at the break, chased three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.
