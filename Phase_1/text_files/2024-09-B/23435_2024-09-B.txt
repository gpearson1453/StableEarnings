MISSION CONTROL was away alertly from the gate and set the pace from the outset, raced in the three path into the lane and drew away late in the stretch
under a steady drive. SCHOOL'S OUT stumbled and was bothered at the start, trailed the field early on, raced in the three path into the lane and was no
match for the winner in the stretch run. PALACE TEMPTATION was bothered at the start, stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch drive. TEMPERED DREAM was a tad slow at the start, pressed the pace early along the inside, stayed near the rail into the
lane and faded down the lane. CHECK THE FACTS came in at the start and was through after a half.
