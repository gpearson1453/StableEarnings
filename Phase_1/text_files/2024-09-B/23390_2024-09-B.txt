BARBARINA dueled inside, bid in early stretch to be clear and held sway under steady urging. BRIDGEPORT stalked the pace in the two path, angled to
the four path in early stretch, rallied late and gained the place. MATCH FIVE pressed the early pace between rivals, settled and had a mild late bid. SPUN
UP was bumped at the start, was well back and rallied inside in early stretch. VOLATILE MARKET pressed the early pace inside, faded and closed late in
the four path. THEHILLONWOODSIDE bore out at the start, dueled outside and gave way in the stretch. MISS RUMMIKUB (FR) was through early.
