Footnotes
MY GOOD GOOD BOY broke best and took the early lead while under some restraint, got an early challenge from MT. TAYLOR at the half-mile pole and
dueled that foe through the turn, responded when set down at the top of the late, finished willingly under strong handling and intermittent urging to prevail.
BURNZ DA BOSS raced close up on the rail down the backstretch, shifted out to the three path before the turn, pulled even to challenge for the lead at the
quarter pole, battled MY GOOD GOOD BOY down the stretch but could not get by and just lasted to hold second. GO LAKER GO was allowed to settle
mid-pack through the early stages, came four wide into the stretch and finished with a rush and just missed the place. MT. TAYLOR was pushed early to get
forward position, hooked up with MY GOOD GOOD BOY near the half-mile marker, was between horses contesting the lead turning for home but weakened
in mid-stretch. MENTIROSA ducked out, was taken up, then slow to get going, raced at the back of the pack through the early stages, kept to the inside
through the turn, came out to the three path for the stretch run but lacked a rally and did not threaten. BUFFETT lacked speed, raced near the back of the
field to the turn, lacked a rally and was not a factor. STYLE BENDER raced three wide down the backstretch behind the pace, dropped to last and remained
wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and could not improve.

Footnotes
ATTILA THE DUN seized the early lead without really being asked, was rated on the lead through the turn and was still in hand when MR. BIG RIG made a
bid at the three-eighths pole, was confidently ridden into the stretch, the sprinted away when roused and won clear. YOU ENJOY MYSELF last away,
steadily advanced down the backstretch and saved some ground through the turn, came out turning into the stretch and made contact with REVOLD AND
RIOT near the three-sixteenths pole, continued to gain ground under steady handling and intermittent urging to gain second while no threat to the winner.
MR. BIG RIG came away well and showed good speed but ceded the lead to ATTILA THE DUN early while stalking that one to the turn, moved to challenge
at the three-eighths pole but had that bid rebuffed, tired and shortened strides with a furlong to run and was passed for the place. MY DAD IS THIRSTY
settled mid-pack along the rail early on, saved ground through the turn, came under heavy pressure from the five-sixteenths marker but could not summon
the needed response and finished evenly. REVOLT AND RIOT raced mid-pack just behind the leaders down the backstretch, then came launched an early
bid near the seven-sixteenths marker was starting to flatten out when bumped off-stride by YOU ENJOY MYSELF at the three-sixteenths pole, kept on
under steady handling but could not improve. GORDY'S RULES broke well but was not asked for speed and settled well behind the pace, started to lose
ground rapidly and the field entered the turn, dropped far behind but kept on through the stretch and managed to pass one before the wire. ELLIOT was
unable to contest the early pace despite the best efforts of the rider, raced three to four wide down the backstretch and through the turn then flattened out in
the stretch and did not threaten. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. #3 YOU ENJOY MYSELF WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE AGAINST #5 REVOLT AND RIOT.

PASS IT AROUND sat just behind the trio contesting the early lead, started to gain on the leaders three to four wide through the turn then continued the rally
four wide into the stretch, finished well under steady handling and was along in time. SPEND AGAIN dueled with IFFY ASSET CLASS through the early
stages, did not go on when that rival opened up passing the three-furlong pole, was then set down near the quarter pole, came back on, took the lead in
mid-stretch but could not hold off the winner. COPPER STATE raced at the back of the compact field down the backstretch, launched a sustained bid
approaching the three furlong pole, continued to run on down the stretch and gained third. IFFY ASSET CLASS dueled outside of SPEND AGAIN to the
turn, took command with three furlongs to run, came into the stretch with a short lead, weakened a bit in mid-stretch and was out-finished. GOLD EXPRESS
saved some ground while racing in the back half of the tightly bunched field, launched a brief bid near the three-furlong pole but could not sustain the bid
and was outfinished in the late stages. WILD FIREWATER broke a step slow but was up to vie for the lead near the half-mile marker, came under a stiff ride
approaching the five-sixteenths pole, did not respond and was not a factor from that point.

Footnotes
D D S EXPRESS tracked three wide down the backstretch and through the turn, always traveling well, responded when set down at the top of the stretch,
had some trouble changing leads but straightened out and won clear. ZE'BUL was allowed to settle early, started a sustained run after passing the half-mile
pole and passed all but the winner in the stretch. AMERICAN OUTLAW broke well, dueled with FASTTRAINTOTEXAS to the turn, got the better of that foe
passing the three furlong marker, led into the stretch, finished well but could not hold off the top pair in the final yards. ORTH raced close up in the middle of
the back behind the pace to the turn, held position to the stretch and finished evenly. READY TO STORM came away well, tracked mid-pack, saved ground
throughout, loomed, lacked a winning kick. SNAPP DADDY was shuffled back at the start when DE LA LUNA took the path, then moved to the inside,
chased the field to the turn, was kept to task but had no late kick and did not improve. DE LA LUNA broke outward at the start then was outrun from the
start, dropped far behind early and was never a factor. FASTTRAINTOTEXAS dueled with AMERICAN OUTLAW early on, dropped back a bit on the turn,
re-bid near the quarter pole, loomed to mid-stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
HURRICANES WILDCAT broke well and stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, took command near the quarter pole, surrendered the lead near
the furlong marker then came back on under strong handling to prevail. SHES ACTING SINGLE pressed the pace two wide, was inside of three contesting
the lead at the quarter pole, finished willingly under strong handling and just missed. INEEDAMARKER was close up three wide down the backstretch,
remained there through the turn then bid for the lead nearing the top of the stretch, took a short lead in mid-stretch then hung in the final yards. FORTY
FIVE was close up inside from the break, moved out to the two path near the quarter pole to get around a tiring BONNIE MAE'S MARK, was finishing well in
the middle of the track but was not quite good enough. LA BELLA BELLA lacked speed from the break despite the intentions of the rider, bided time three
wide well behind the pace, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, came four wide and race a little erratically in upper stretch and finished evenly.
BONNIE MAE'S MARK broke well and got to the front before going a furlong, gave way at the quarter pole and had little to offer in the stretch. BONIFIED
WILDCAT broke a step slow, chased from the rear of the field down the backstretch, made mild bid through the turn but came up empty in the stretch. MO
JO MONEY unable to keep pace early, lost ground through the turn and lacked a rally. DO IT FOR DANNY had brief speed then dropped far back before
the turn, lacked any rally and trailed well behind the field to the finish.
