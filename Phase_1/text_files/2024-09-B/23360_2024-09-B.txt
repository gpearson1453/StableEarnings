Footnotes
MC COUGAR was away in good order and vied outside of SAVOYA RETURN while holding a slight advantage, shook free entering the turn, saved ground
turning for home, turned back the bid from HOOKED ON DREAMS in stretch run and finished clear. HOOKED ON DREAMS was well placed tracking the
top pair up the backstretch, moved up closer late on the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, raced in close range but could not reach eventual
winner and settled for second best. WICKLOW LADDIE dropped back after the start and raced in the back of the field, hustled along three to four wide
around the turn, gained position and ran on for a share. SAVOYA RETURN vied outside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not move on with
rival with three furlongs left to run, continued to chase the top pair around the turn then tired in the drive. SANGRIA SKY raced in range in the opening
quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MY RAPHA sped to the lead at the start, held a slim advantage then took on the challenge of TIME TO SING mid-way around the turn, continued near equal
terms into upper stretch, dug in gamely along the inside, shook free near the furlong marker and edged away. TIME TO SING was forwardly placed in the
early going then moved up to challenge MY RAPHA for the lead mid-way around the turn, vied outside of rival into upper stretch, could not match strides
past the furlong marker but kept on and secured place. CAUSE I'M ROLLIN was not far back along the inside in opening stages, tipped two wide and
hustled up mid-way around the turn, sustained a two to three wide bid through the lane and fought back to hold show. QUIETLINE raced in range, hustled
along three to four wide through the lane and just missed show. ALLEGRISSIMO raced in the back and steadily retreated. SHAME ON STEVE raced up
close along the inside after entering the turn then flattened mid-turn and dropped back in the lane.

GET THE LEAD OUT tracked the embattled top pair up the backstretch, moved up three wide to race in striking distance at the quarter pole, held a slim
lead with a furlong left to run, ran on under pressure from R N R BABY in late stages, dug in, turned back bid and finished clear. R N B BABY raced in
contention then moved up closer four wide near the quarter pole, came four paths wide into upper stretch, roused forward to race in striking distance of GET
THE LED OUT, could not get by the winner but finished clearly second best. SHE'S MY KINDAGIRL dueled inside of LUCYS STROLL up the backstretch
and around the turn, got collared past upper stretch, weakened and lasted for show. PISTOLPACKINGAL raced in the back, hustled along two wide into
upper stretch and just missed show. LUCYS STROLL dueled outside of SHES MY KINDA GIRL from the onset, continued to battle around the turn then
faded in the lane. MY FOUR POINT OH chased along the inside without moving into contention and dropped back in the lane.

Footnotes
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was unhurried and saved ground around the first turn, continued well off the pace up the backstretch, edged closer late on the
far turn, came four wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer racing in tandem with BIG PINES SANDY, dueled with rival nearing the wire and got a
head up in time. BIG PINES SANDY stalked the clear embattled duo around the first turn and up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide going by the
quarter pole, steadily moved up closer racing in tandem with MUNNYCANTMELOVE, dueled with rival nearing the wire and got outnodded for the win.
NASTY EXAGGERATOR dueled outside of SIR ELI around the first turn and into the backstretch while racing well clear over the next pursuer, shook free
past the mid-way point around the final turn, fought on gamely into the final furlong and got overtaken late. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND rated off the clear top
trio up the backstretch, was ridden three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten, vanned off after the race. GINGER RULES raced off the pace in a
strung out field up the backstretch, chased three wide around the final turn and failed to move into contention. SIR ELI dueled inside of NASTY
EXAGGERATOR around the first turn and continued into the backstretch while well clear over the next pursuer, battled on into the far turn, could not match
strides nearing the quarter pole and dropped back in the lane. HEZA WILD RIDE showed little.
