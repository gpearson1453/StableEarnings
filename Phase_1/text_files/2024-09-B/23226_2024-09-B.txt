Footnotes
STEAK FRIES broke sharply and led early on, took to rating and tracked three wide around the turn, responded when given his cue nearing the lane,
engaged the leader from his outside soon after, wrested command leaving the furlong grounds, was given some right handed asks and eagerly pulled away.
MISS MRAZEK , in a bit tight at the break, regrouped and raced in mid pack off the inside, advanced two wide between foes nearing the stretch, shifted out
and finished with good energy. SHANAPLAN accelerated to the inside of foes to take command, shook clear around the turn, entered the lane two wide with
command, held the winner off to about mid stretch then faded through the final yards. MARC THE MONEY MAN chased between foes then three deep past
the quarter pole, shifted out five wide but lacked a serious finish. TEN FIGURES showed speed and forced the pace two wide, pursued into the lane, stayed
on past mid stretch then faded. THE SHILLELAGH , fractious in the gate, hopped slightly at the break, raced off the pace and off the inside, worked between
foes past mid stretch, shifted in and continued with interest. PRINCE OF DEL MAR , off the pace three wide, angled six to seven wide for the drive but
lacked a rally. ROSIE TINKERBELL came in at the break tightening the runner up, corrected and edged up past the half, stalked inside, failed to kick on
leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. WAR IS HELL lost ground four wide pursuing the leaders then weakened in upper stretch. GOING WITH HER ,
inside and off the pace, failed to get involved.

Footnotes
TRUST DADDY edged up leaving the chute then angled out to stalk, shifted four wide soon into the lane with sights set on the leader, closed in steadily
under hand encouragement, took over a sixteenth out and drew clear. HONEYMOON SUITE came in soon after the break and tightened foes, corrected
and cleared, set the pace about two wide, drifted out a path entering the lane, straightened to maintain the advantage under pressure past mid stretch,
ceded a sixteenth out then gave way grudgingly. JOHN DUNBAR was lightly steadied in the opening sixteenth, regrouped and settled off the pace,
advanced between horses leaving the far turn, dropped in towards the rail and closed willingly. TOUCHDOWN BROWN , bumped and in tight soon after the
break, gained between foes and under a ride into the turn, circled four wide into the stretch but came up empty. KAHUNA MAGIC was squeezed back soon
after the start, raced well back early, saved ground into and through the lane and finished with interest. UNCLE REG broke through the gate pre race but did
not away, was bumped and in a bit close in the opening sixteenth, was taken to rate off the early pace, came under pressure around the turn, circled five
wide but failed to kick on. PARK CITY , four then three wide with pursuit, failed to go on nearing the stretch and weakened. PHOENICIAN GHOST forced
inward by HONEYMOON SUITE soon after the start, bumped with an inner rival, chased three wide and weakened. CURRY gave early pursuit towards the
inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
IRON MAN CAL , taken to rate after an alert break, relaxed outside a keyed up rival while tracking the pace, took closer order past the quarter pole, shifted
out and responded when shaken up, forged to command a furlong out then drew clear under a solid hand ride. KING'S ROAD broke outward, corrected and
took over, set the pace towards the inner rail, handled outer pressure into the far turn, maintained the lead under a ride into the stretch, failed to resist the
winner in mid stretch but continued on with good effort to be clear for the place. CURVINO secured the inside after a furlong, settled nicely, edged up some
leaving the far turn, chased, angled out for the drive and churned on. UNRIVALED HERO , three deep early, dropped to the inside through the backstretch,
remained inside into the lane but lacked a solid run. STINGRAY SHUFFLE broke a step slow, moved up between rivals into the first turn, raced off the
inside leaving the far turn and lacked a bid. ZABO ducked in at the break, lagged off the pace while saving ground, angled four wide soon into the lane,
shifted back in and had a mild response. VIDEO REVIEW , keyed up early pulling his rider forward while saving ground into the first turn, steadied near the
three quarter pole and again in early backstretch, settled better near the half, chased inside into the stretch and faded. FREEDOM OF SPEECH broke a bit
slow, raced off the pace and off the inside and failed to generate a run. JOHNSON'S MAGIC sped outside rivals early on, prompted outside the leader,
applied serious pressure past the half, pressed then faltered leaving the three sixteenths and was eased late.

Footnotes
TENMA edged up leaving the five eighths and gained a stalking spot towards the rail and just off the quartet of leaders, eased out past the three eighths
then knifed her way between runners while under a ride, angled three wide with aim into the stretch, closed in under right handed asks, engaged VODKA
WITH A TWIST with a sixteenth to go, dueled outside that one, gained a narrow decision in deep stretch and narrowly prevailed. VODKA WITH A TWIST
bobbled inward soon after the break, corrected and stalked four wide, bid four deep leaving the far turn, emerged in a duel outside NOONI past the five
sixteenths, poked a head in front approaching the stretch, shifted in towards the inner rail when clearing, kept on past mid stretch, dug on when confronted
by the winner, battled valiantly and just missed. SO THERE SHE WAS broke awkwardly, settled off the pace, angled four wide into the lane, worked
between foes inside the sixteenth marker and nabbed the show. JACK'S MAGIC GIRL stumbled outward at the break, regrouped and raced well back into
the turn, swung five wide for the drive and offered a slight response. NOONI attended the pace two wide between foes, gained a slim lead after a half,
dueled to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, steadied when in a bit close past the quarter pole then weakened. PROUD STARLET took command
inside foes leaving the chute then set a pressured pace inside a trio of foes, ceded command near the three eighths, failed to keep pace past the five
sixteenths then faltered. NIGHT BEACON had speed three deep, vied between foes into the turn, lacked a punch under pressure mid turn then faltered.
There was a stewards' inquiry concerning VODKA WITH A TWIST and NOONI and the run into the lane. No action was deemed necessary.

THOUGHT PROCESS rated kindly saving ground stalking the pace, eased out past the three eighths, engaged the leader two wide in hand soon after,
shadowed that one under confident handling past the quarter pole, took over when given her cue into the lane, spurted clear then held firm under a mild
drive. SUPA SPEED reared up the gate when fractious pre race, was backed out and examined, settled into an inside spot early on, edged up into the far
turn, continued progress saving ground past the five sixteenths, shifted out for the drive, switched over to her correct lead past mid stretch and finished well.
SEA RUNNER , a bit keen four wide moving to a forward spot nearing the first turn, relaxed three wide in range past the half, chased three wide into the
lane and kept on with effort to gain the show. CASALU sped clear early and dropped inside to set the pace, was joined into the far turn, held the lead under
a ride past the five sixteenths, failed to resist the winner in upper stretch, kept on willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. MADONNA OF LORETO ,
headstrong saving ground into the first turn, saved ground past the three eighths, angled out for the drive and offered a mild run. CAITLIN FEVER , three
deep early, raced four wide between foes into the stretch and lacked a serious bid. HEY LIL LADY , in range between foes early, gained a bit saving ground
past the five sixteenths, remained inside into the lane but came up empty. TWIRLING LIGHT rated off foes early, came five wide for the drive and failed to
menace. FONDEST DREAM (GB) , off slowly, rated off the pace, angled four to five wide and lacked a bid. APOCALYPTIC , bumped early, raced between
foes past the three quarter pole and weakened. GLOBAL CONSORT stalked two wide, shifted out three wide near the three eighths, failed to kick on past

SMASH IT vied outside a rival then took a short lead after a quarter mile, met an outside challenge from INTO MIDNIGHT around the far turn, sparred with
that one into and through the lane, kept on under solid right handed asks and proved resolute to the wire. INTO MIDNIGHT was knocked sideways at the
break, regrouped, angled and pulled his way forward to bid three deep nearing the turn, battled outside the winner from there, continued gamely but was
kept at bay. SOI NGERN gained a slim early lead dueling to the inside of the winner past the five eighths, was headed near the three and a half pole, failed
to quicken with the top two but stayed around to pursued, remained inside through the drive and continued with effort. CHARLIE'S TO BLAME drafted back
after an alert start, circled five wide into the lane and churned on. ARRAKIS was forward at the break despite a hop, lost ground five then three wide, gave
hard chase between foes nearing the stretch but came up empty. TAPIT DYNASTY , between foes leaving the three eighths, came two wide for the drive
but failed to threaten. YAQIN , four then three wide with hard pursuit, faded in the drive. ELUSIVE MOON , urged from the gate, was climbing early, saved
ground under a ride mid turn, failed to go on nearing the lane and faded. START MO UP broke inward soundly bumping INTO MIDNIGHT, corrected and
lagged back inside, angled out for the drive but failed to menace. WOLF AWAY broke slowly, raced off the inside and was outrun.

EYE ON RY settled three wide, crept closer leaving the far turn, angled five wide under a hustling ride to gain into the stretch, straightened away, forged to
command under right handed pressure leaving mid stretch, kicked away and was kept to steady handling. ZIO JO rated inside, edged up near the half,
eased out for room past the five sixteenths, worked his way between runners then kept on gamely to the inside of ON THE WHIM to earn the place. ON
THE WHIM , three wide, moved up into the far turn, bid between foes near the quarter pole, chased the leaders in mid stretch and continued willingly.
LAHAINA FLAVOR , unhurried early, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide and closed steadily. BARELY FUNTIONAL , bumped at the break,
settled between foes, raced in the clear two wide nearing the lane, eased out to make a mild run past mid stretch then flattened out. LOTTERY PICK saved
ground off the pace, steadied near the far turn, regrouped, angled four to five wide into the lane and kept on trying. SMART CODE , with the pace between
runners into the first turn, vied three wide outside the leader, dueled on a slim lead approaching the stretch, spurted clear into the lane, failed to contain the
winner past mid stretch and weakened. ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) , three to four wide, lacked a bid. TALKLESSWORKMORE tracked a contested pace
three to four wide, bid between runners past the five sixteenths, steadied when not quite quickening into the lane and weakened. NEWS AT TEN (GB) ,

Footnotes
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE had a shoe repair in the paddock, broke alertly and rated forwardly five then four wide outside foes, moved to the attack four
wide outside a pair mid turn, dueled on near even terms into the lane, shook clear of NEEZER DALTON near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed
under a drive. SAFA leaned in at the break, corrected and settled four wide, picked up momentum four wide under a ride past the five sixteenths, closed in
steadily while on his left lead and had his final surge fall just short. NEEZER DALTON moved up towards the inside leaving the five eighths and tracked the
pace, eased out and bid between foes leaving the five sixteenths, went head to head to the inside of the winner into the stretch, fought on past mid stretch
then faded late. SHARP RIDE , away last when breaking awkwardly, raced two wide between foes into the stretch but came up empty. R B'S TIGER saved
ground, eased out near mid stretch but failed to muster up the needed run. DADS ESTRELLA vied four wide between rivals through the opening stages,
chased mid turn then weakened into the lane. NO CAP , three wide between rivals contesting the early pace, remained a presence to mid turn then
weakened. BABY KRISTEN moved up to the inside of four rivals to take command, shook clear near the half, was taken on past the three eighths, stayed
on past the five sixteenths then tired. STELLAR CAP , three wide between foes leaving the far turn, was not a factor. WORTHY OF MAGIC broke outward,
lost ground six then five wide, dropped back mid turn then was eased.

Footnotes
HANG THE MOON bobbled inward at the break and bumped with ANISETTE (GB), corrected and rated off the pace while saving ground, advanced
towards the rail into the lane while still within herself, eased out when finding a seam leaving mid stretch, closed sharply under a drive between rivals and
was up late. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) , unhurried early while off the inside, raced outside the winner leaving the far turn, swung six wide for the drive and closed
well to gain and nab the place. ANISETTE (GB) , bumped at the start, regrouped and settled nicely while saving ground, advanced to the inside past the five
sixteenths to take aim, engaged ROYAL CHARTER (GB) from her inside nearing the furlong grounds, spurted clear under a drive but was swarmed over in
the final yards. DIDIA (ARG) relaxed in range while off the inside, raced three wide and took closer order leaving the far turn, angled five wide under a ride
into the lane, chased outside foes but came up empty. ROYAL CHARTER (GB) , quickly to the front, cleared and set a rated pace towards the inside,
handled outside pressure past the five sixteenths, clung to advantage mid stretch, wandered outward a bit and weakened. UNCORKED (AUS) rated close
while saving ground, eased out two wide near the three eighths, shifted four wide to pursue into the lane, chased between rivals near mid stretch then gave
way. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) prompted the pace outside the leader, was under pressure forcing the issue into the lane, failed to kick on past mid stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
RED FLAG rated forwardly off the rail, gained four wide under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths, then engaged the leader from his outside in upper
stretch, switched over to his correct lead dueling past the furlong grounds, wrested a slim advantage inside the sixteenth marker and was edging away at
the wire. PILOT COMMANDER , in close attendance four wide, bid three deep under rating mid turn, took over soon after, dug in when confronted in upper
stretch, clung to a slim lead past mid stretch, battled on inside the sixteenth pole, switched to his left lead lead and gave way stubbornly. ALL THAT GLORY
forced the pace three wide then between foes under a ride mid turn, could not go on with the top pair into the lane but stayed on with good effort to maintain
the show. WENDELSSOHN broke outward bumping a rival, straightened and edged up to be forward off the rail into the turn, was pushed along chasing
three wide into the stretch and churned on. WAYNE THE BRAIN lost ground four to five wide pursuing then came up empty late. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS
dropped well off the early pace, lagged back, swung seven to eight wide in upper stretch and offered a belated kick. HEART HEADED , off the pace, circled
five wide but failed to generate a solid run through the last furlong. SCHWARZMEIER , bumped at the break, saved ground past the five sixteenths, shifted
out and offered a mild run. CENTRAL DISPATCH sped to the lead leaving the chute, cleared then was taken on leaving the far turn, battled inside foes
leaving the five sixteenths, failed to go on past mid stretch and weakened. TRANCHE stalked inside, was ridden along leaving the five sixteenths and
weakened. SENSICAL , off the pace, came three wide for the drive and failed to rally. MONEY RUN , between foes into the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
SWEET DELTA DAWN prompted the pace to the inside of a rival leaving the chute, rated back and angled out to stalk, steadily advanced leaving the far
turn, outside bid to engage near the quarter pole, dueled, shook clear under a drive leaving the sixteenth marker, wandered outward and prevailed.
MIZZYAAN settled off the inside, worked her way four to five wide and between runners into the stretch, altered further out past mid stretch and closed
strongly. EVERYTHING BUGS ME rated between foes early, gained past the five sixteenths, shifted five wide for the drive and closed willingly between
horses. SOPHISTICATE saved ground off the pace, eased out near the quarter pole and made a steady run between foes. FIRE BAN rated inside, took
closer order leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive, moved up between rivals past mid stretch then was out kicked inside horses through the final
yards. UPCHARGE , unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside into and through the stretch and offered a late bid. HELGA BRANDT (IRE) vied
outside a foe then cleared off leaving the seven eighths, dropped in to set the pace, was joined nearing the quarter pole, fought on past mid stretch then
faded. MISS MANDALAY (GB) saved ground, eased out near the quarter pole but came up empty. INTERPLAY rated three wide in mid pack early on,
angled out, circled six wide into the stretch but failed to drum up a solid run. WIMBERLY bobbled at the break, recovered to raced forward and outside a foe
near the half, made a mild run between rivals near the five sixteenths, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened. BOLT'S BROAD lost ground four wide
and failed to make an impact. SWEET GEM , three to four wide within range early on, chased three deep leaving the three eighths, lacked a punch into the
lane and weakened.
