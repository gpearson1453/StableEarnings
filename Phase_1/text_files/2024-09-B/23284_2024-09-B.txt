HAIG POINT steadied slightly after the start, was allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. CATATUMBO mid pack and inside, angled out and moved up two
and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear late and was outfinished. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT
mid pack and outside, angled out while moving up through the second turn three and four wide, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then could not sustain the bid and held the show. HEY PADRE well placed and off the rail, raced boxed through the second
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, was blocked, angled out and edged up for a share. GIANT PAYDAY rated early,
passed tiring rivals outside. ADIOS BOBBY stalked the pace on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead down the backstretch, held the advantage through
the second turn, then faded the final furlong. JOSH'S HONOR set the pace off the rail and faded through the second turn.

a steady gain, edged ahead and held under steady pressure. BALLINDINE unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. SIGMUND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then drifted out and weakened late and holding the show. SON OF LIBERTY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. BOOKER'S CHARM allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, angled
widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. THREE O ONE well placed and between, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn,
came four wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and flattened out. TRAVELLER well placed and outside, gained a striking position three

Footnotes
COMEDIC TIMING mid pack, moved up inside through the second turn, angled five wide into the stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off
and was kept to the task. ET'S MAGIC MAN rated close up, angled out and moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain, then was no threat to the winner and held the place. DAZZLING TRUTHS unhurried, looped three and four wide through the second
turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed for the show. CANADIAN GAME well placed, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. CRAZY KATER mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. VILLAGE PREACHER unhurried, looped up four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and
improved position. SECRETARY OF WAR passed tiring rivals, widest. LEAVE 'EM LOADED well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. SEA
SPLENDOR was never involved. ECLIPTICALS BEAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch and through the second
turn, then faded into the stretch.
