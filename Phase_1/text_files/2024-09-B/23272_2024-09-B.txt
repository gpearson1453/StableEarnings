Footnotes
CUPIDS SWEETY was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up into striking distance mid-way around the turn, ran on two wide in upper
stretch, stayed on determinedly and edged ahead late. INCA STROLL sped to the lead soon after the start, held clear then came under pressure from
outside duo mid-way around the turn, cut the corner and widened advantage, continued to put in a good effort while holding a slim lead then got edged in
closing strides. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D tracked the pace in opening stages, moved up to race in aim mid-way around the turn, sustained a three wide bid
into stretch run, raced in close contention but lacked the needed kick to get by. SWEET STROLL chased the top trio into the turn, hustled along four wide at
the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally. KID BIZ raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

ROCK STAR PARKING tracked the leader in opening stages, moved up to engage rival mid-way around the turn, vied briefly then shook clear turning for
home, kept clear two wide under steady urging and held off the late inside bid of ZIP CODE ENVY. ZIP CODE ENVY was ridden along the inside off the top
trio entering the turn, hustled along two wide entering upper stretch then angled to the rail, steadily edged up closer on the winner but could not get by.
ADDABABY moved up three wide to race in aim for the lead midway around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then weakened while still remaining
well clear for show. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK raced in the back although never too far back early on, hustled along three wide into the upper stretch and had
no response. UNRIVALED QUEEN sped to the lead at the start, vied for the lead mid-way around the turn, could not match strides past the quarter pole and
steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SPANISH DELIGHT sat back two wide just off the early pace, let out a notch entering the turn, quickly advanced and took a slim lead at the quarter pole,
widened advantage heading into the lane and kept to task while ridden out. RUBYSA tracked the early pace, hustled up two wide going by the quarter pole,
came three to four wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and captured place. FULL SPIRIT settled just of the early pace, hustled up four wide entering
upper stretch then angled in two wide, kept on with response and got nipped for place. MORE THAN A DIVA sprinted to the lead soon after the start,
continued clear into the turn, got collared by the eventual winner near the quarter pole and gave way. SLUSHY raced in contention sitting behind the early
leader, flattened out mid-way around the turn then ran on evenly. HOUSE WRECKER raced in the back while saving ground, was put to a drive along the
rail at the head of the lane and failed to move on.

MOMENT TO SHINE sat off the second flight mid-way up the backstretch, edged closer four wide late on then turn, hustled along four wide into the lane,
steadily edged up closer, got up late and held on. BROKEN HEARTS BAY settled off the pace in early stages near the inside, picked up the tempo late on
the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under firm handling, closed gamely to the wire and just missed. MUSICAL DIVA
sprinted out to a clear lead in the opening quarter, continued on top while rivals began to close in late on the turn, came under a drive past upper stretch,
continued clear a furlong out then got overtaken late. CHIP SHORTAGE tracked the clear pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled along two wide into upper
stretch, edged up closer in final stages and got nipped for show. SUGAR BELL raced off the clear leader up the backstretch, closed in on rival late on the
turn, sustained bid into the lane, raced in strong contention in the final furlong then flattened late. COLLECTED GLORY raced off the early pace, hustled
along three wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE came up empty leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
ROWDY RAY stubborn to load, was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the embattled duo up the backstretch, was ridden three wide around the
far turn, given cue in upper stretch, responded, edged up to the leader in the final furlong and drew clear. GLOME was well reserved and raced in the back,
was ridden along late on the far turn, came under a drive two wide at the head of the lane and closed gamely. SPANISH KISS dueled for the lead late on the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle into the far turn, shook free past the quarter pole, continued to dig in on top a furlong out then got
overtaken by the winner near the final sixteenth. ESPRIT ROUGE rated off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide around the far turn, came five
paths wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. SASSY B KEEN tracked the top trio through early stages, was ridden along the outside late on the far
turn, came four to five wide into upper stretch and never threatened. STROLLER BOY was never too far back in the early going, chased along the rail
around the final turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch and had no late response. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP was forwardly placed around the first turn
then dueled outside of SPANISH KISS up the backstretch, continued to battle into the far turn, could not move on past the quarter pole and retreated in the
lane.
