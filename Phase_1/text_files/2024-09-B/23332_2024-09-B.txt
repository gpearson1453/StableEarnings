Footnotes
SING LUCY SING sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way up the backstretch, took on a pair of challengers entering the turn, dueled inside into
the stretch run, fought on gamely and refused to be denied. MOR FOXY was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, advanced to duel for the lead entering
the turn, battled on gamely outside of SING LUCY SING into final stages, fought hard but could not get by rival late. RISKY WHISKY raced in contention up
the backstretch, moved up to engage rival for the lead entering the turn, dueled three paths wide into stretch, could not match strides in late stages but
stayed on with response. C L LEGACY raced in range in the opening quarter, flattened around the turn and continued to weaken through the lane. MY
FIRING LINE pulled up not long after the start, was held onto by the rider and vanned off.

MIND YOUR MO tracked the leader into the turn, moved up and put a head in front at the quarter pole, quickly widened to a clear advantage and kept to
task. LIL FRIEND raced off the clear top pair in early stages, edged closer late on the turn, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and finished clearly
second best. TAKEOFF TIME sped to the clear lead strides out of the gate, continued on top into the turn, got collared by eventual winner leaving the
quarter pole and gave way in the lane. MIMOSA FOR LUNCH raced off the early pace, saved ground and failed to threaten. SMOKIN' NANCY raced two
wide off the pace, was ridden along four wide into upper stretch and never menaced.

DEER RUN chased three wide through early stages, hustled along three wide into stretch, steadily edged up closer and cleared command at the sixteenth
pole. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along five wide into upper stretch, rallied down the lane and got a nose up for
place. RAZOR WIRE chased four wide up the backstretch, moved up to engage COLORFUL NATIVE at the quarter pole, continued just off the leader a
furlong out, edged ahead to a brief lead then got overtaken by the winner and lost place in final stride. I AM LOWKEY was forwardly placed in the opening
quarter then weakened inside around the turn, launched a two to three wide rebid at the head of the lane and had a mild improve. COLORFUL NATIVE
broke sharp from the outside, cleared and crossed over, held clear then took on the challenge of RAZOR SHARP at the quarter pole, fought back gamely a
furlong out then gave way. LIL SCREECHER raced in contention in the opening quarter, ran on two wide around the turn then failed to keep pace in the

Footnotes
OURPEPPERMINTCANDY sprinted to the lead in opening stages, continued clear then took on the challenge of DREAMIN IT UP at the quarter pole,
battled gamely from the inside racing heads apart, poked a head in front in late stages and refused to be denied. DREAMIN IT UP tracked the leader in
opening stages then moved up to challenge OURPEPPERMINTCANDY for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled outside of rival into the stretch run, fought
gamely heads apart but could not get the winner in final strides. MY GOLDEN DAY settled in early stages, was ridden two to three wide around the turn,
hustled along three wide into the lane and finished with response. GISELE'S MAP raced in contention in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the
turn, ran on into upper stretch and got edged late for show. DREAMINONTHENILE raced in range along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and gave
way. THAT'S OUR VISION failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
TRIP TO FREEDOM vied for the lead in the early going, shook clear and led the way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more,
responded, turned back bids and finished clear. IRON LOTUS tracked the pace into the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and captured place
in final strides. DODGEBALL vied briefly in early stages then edged back and tracked the leader around the turn, launched inside rebid at the head of the
lane and got edged late for place. FIREBAUGH was ridden along off the early pace, failed to advance under pressure around the turn, came two wide into
upper stretch and failed to threaten. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC raced in range in early stages, weakened around the turn and continued to fade in the lane.
JACKIE FLASH raced off the pace, swung wide into upper stretch and never threatened. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT raced in the back, saved ground around
the turn and had no response.
