AMAZING SUCCESS tracked the early leaders, was a factor from the inside on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task.
SUNYANI forced the early pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. UNION COLONEL was
unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. RELOAD BULLET stumbled just after the start and
had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no kick. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN set a pressured pace and dueled on the
turn but had nothing left. MUSICAL STRIDE was well back and showed little in a dull effort.

ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN was unhurried early, had the lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS
was in touch, roused from the inside on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. MISS D'S PRIDE set a pressured pace but
was headed on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. SPANISH SERENADE was off slow, saved ground on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. DISCOVERY CHART was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch.
BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. PRINCE FOR A DAY
forced the early pace but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
BAYTOWN ELVIS tracked the early leaders from the inside, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task.
JACK THE CAT was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. JADE'S DREAM was
in touch and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back, closed the gap on
the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. GREAT GO GO showed speed from the outside but gave way on the far turn and was empty.
SAME AGAIN DOC stalked the early leader but lost ground on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off. MISTER MESEEKS was unhurried early and
in tight on the far turn, lost the rider and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN AROUND THE FAR TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS
POSTED.
