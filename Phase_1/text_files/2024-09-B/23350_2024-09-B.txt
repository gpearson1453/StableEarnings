OUTRIGHT tucked inside early to follow pace the while saving ground, rallied inside rivals nearing the lane to bid and draw clear, roused briefly about the
furlong grounds and drew off the remainder. WHOOPING JAY tracked the pace three wide then could not go with the winner in the drive while up for the
place late. SUMMER ALL YEAR moved up three and four wide in the lane to narrowly miss the place late. ROBERT WHO showed speed racing out from
the rail to lead to late in the turn, floated wide turning for home and came up empty the final furlong. POKER PLAY failed to mount a rally while saving
ground.

keep the winner safe late while narrowly up for the place. MR. BIG SHOT dueled on the lead from between rivals through the opening half, continued well in
the lane but was outfinished for position. TIZ BRIGHTER dueled on the lead inside rivals to late in the turn and had nothing left for the drive. LUCKY

through the turn and continued up the inside to hold clear for the show but could not get to the top pair. BETTY JO chased the dueling leaders from about
the three path and had no closing run. CANARY NATION failed to mount a rally four wide. ZIBBY TOO raced out from the rail and trailed throughout.

marker and draw clear. SCHMOOZE stalked the leaders three and four wide, rallied in the lane and narrowly gained the place late while unable to go with
the winner. CAPTAIN DON dueled on the pace outside PARLAY PETE through the turn into the lane then was worn down through the closing furlong.
PARLAY PETE dueled from inside a rival to upper stretch and weakened. MASTERPIECE DAY followed the pace four wide and weakened. CORTE trailed
the field home.

Footnotes
THUNDERSHOOK followed the pace four wide in the turn, rallied six wide into the lane and closed with a determined late run to prevail in the closing jump.
EXPLOSIVE PRIDE dueled on the lead inside rivals, continued to duel VERRAZANO FIRST into the lane then just failed to hold the winner safe.
AMERICAN SMOOTH settled in reach of the pace three or four wide, moved inside for the drive and rallied but came up short. VERRAZANO FIRST dueled
on the pace outside EXPLOSIVE PRIDE throughout then was outfinished for position in the lane. BIRDIE MACHINE stalked the pace out from the rail,
angled four wide into the lane but lacked a solid closing bid. TWO WORLDS was with the leaders early four wide, settled back on the turn and lacked a final
closing bid. VITALE saved ground and was not a factor.
