DAX A DREAMING stalked the pace to midway through the turn then moved up to engage the leader near the quarter pole and matched strides inside of
OLD FASHION TIME to deep stretch where he edged away to prevail. GRACEFULLYBROKE tracked the leader to the turn then made a mild bid on the
turn and continued on while fighting gamely to be second best. OLD FASHION TIME went to a clear lead to midway through the turn then was engaged
near the quarter pole and matched strides outside of DAX A DREAMING to deep stretch but gave way grudgingly. LEAF OF WISDOM trailed the field but
was never far back.

HAUGHTY KITTY prompted the pace to the top of the stretch then drove past the leader at the eighth pole and drew off. JANIS settled in the middle of the
pack while saving ground through the turn then slipped up the rail into the stretch and was up for the place. CINCO GAL was roused to the lead to set most
of the pace but was overtaken near the eighth pole and tired. DEL MAR LABOR DAY was void of speed to mid turn then made a mild three wide bid at the
quarter pole to improve position. IMA HAPPY DANCER trailed the field and passed tired one. IMA HOT TOTTIE rushed up to track the leaders through the
turn and was done, jogged in.

MAJESTIC LIAISON raced off the pace while running four wide around the turn, engaged the leader near the top of the stretch and drove past to draw clear
late. CAN DANZER stalked the pace from four or five wide then move up on the turn going five wide into the stretch but tipped in slightly to move between
horses at the sixteenth pole to be second best. GOLDEN BAND pressed the pace from two wide down the backstretch, engaged the leader near the three
furlong marker and matched strides outside of INCITATUS to the quarter pole then took a brief lead before being eclipsed and outkicked in the final furlong.
TOMBI was off slow and trailed the field through the turn while saving ground then made a late run in the stretch to improve position. GOOSE DRANK WINE
vied for the lead from three wide but lacked the late response. INCITATUS went to the front to a pressured lead to the three furlong marker then matched
strides inside of GOLDEN BAND to the quarter pole and gave way.

ALL ABOUT MISCHIEF rushed up rail to be off the pace before the turn then angled out to three wide at the three furlong marker and took command at the
quarter pole and cruised home. JAKE ON DAKAN shared the command to the half mile marker then inched away but was overtaken at the quarter pole and
tired. TIME TO SKIP TOWN was away alertly then dropped back and was not a factor. GUTFIELD shared the command to the half mile marker and fought
gamely around the turn but was empty in the stretch. PALACE PATCH reared as the gates opened and lost rider. THE PICK 3 DID NOT HAVE ANY

Footnotes
CELEE'S LAST TE sprinted away to press the pace from the two path then took command at the quarter pole then drew off to prove best. LONG MAY SHE
RUN tracked the leaders from the inside through the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and made a late rally but was no match for the
winner but proved second best. ROCKIN MARIE was hustled to the pressured lead on the inside to the quarter pole where she was overtaken and was
empty. BEHOLD THAT WORD showed no early speed and passed tiring rival. BRING THE POSSE raced in the middle of the pack then retreated on the
turn and was not a threat. FLYING LADY steadied early then trailed the field and was never a factor. THE PICK 3 DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY
WAGERED.

Footnotes
COLLUSIONIST trailed the field to the turn then angled out to three wide near the five sixteenth pole while gaining momentum and tipped out to four wide in
upper stretch but drifted in at the eighth pole, continued on to drive past the leaders to prove best. WHEELER DEALER pressed the pace from two wide
through the turn then moved up to engage the leader near the eighth pole but was empty and saved the place. TULSA TIME went to the front to set the
pace but was eclipsed at the eighth pole and tired but held on for the show. QUICKTRIP VAN raced off the pace through the turn then moved out to three
wide in upper stretch for the late run but had to shift out to four wide at the eighth pole and missed the show. DOCS CARO CAT trailed early then moved up
to the middle of the pack from three wide to midway through the turn and was done, jogged in. THE DAILY DOUBLE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY
WAGERED.
