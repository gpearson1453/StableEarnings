IZEONDEC raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around
the second bend and dueled in the lane to get up for the win late. UNIFIED WEEKEND raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled between horses to the wire to
narrowly miss. BOURBON DELIGHT raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
dueled in the way, giving way in late stretch. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE chased the leader while saving ground through the opening half mile, came around
the second bend in the two path and faded in the stretch. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. JET FLIGHT stumbled leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field the
entire way around the oval and was not a factor.

position in the stretch. KANT BELIEVE IT stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in
