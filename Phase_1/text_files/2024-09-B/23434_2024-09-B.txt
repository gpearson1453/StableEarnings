COMES A TIME chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and steadily wore down the leader to prevail in the final jumps to the finish. ROOKIE CARD brushed the near side stall at the start, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, had AU CONTRAIRE advance inside latching on at the five furlong marker and took the bait dueling that rival from the nine-sixteenths
until shaking that foe off with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive under new threat to the outside and was worn down to the finish and nailed in the last strides while well clear of the rest for the place honors. FEVER
NIGHT chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened while along for the show honors. TRACKING ERROR coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. FUN TO TAP broke in
brushing the near side stall at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BESTFRIEND ROCKET chased along the inside climbing a bit
green when facing the kickback and was given taps to the right shoulder to settle, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and tired. AU CONTRAIRE broke a beat slow getting near the rear of the field and was rushed under coaxing to latch on the leader five furlongs from
home, dueled briefly with that rival from the nine-sixteenths to near the seven-sixteenths when shaken off, got coaxed along near the five-sixteenths, tipped
out five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TWENTY SIX BLACK was hustled from the gate, moved up to race just off the pace, drafted in the three path on the turn, was asked in the four path into the
stretch then moved further out, rallied to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole, swapped leads back and forth late and prevailed under strong urging. BIZ BIZ
BUZZ broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, led under a drive until
near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to hold the place. ANACONDA was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn,
moved out while asked in upper stretch, chased while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just up for the
show. RUNNINGWSCISSORS was coaxed early then settled on the outside, went around the turn in the four path while asked, turned into the stretch in the
five path then moved further out, chased outside under a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the
show. STEADY ON was hustled from the gate then angled in while going to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while
asked for more on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) showed speed then contested the pace on the outside,
vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. HEAVEN STREET reared at the start and was off very slow
then stumbled while leaving the gate, went around the turn in the two to three path and was no factor.

Footnotes
EMIRATES ROAD settled on the outside, moved closer under urging late on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn, took a short lead into the
stretch, fought outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. NIGHT EFFECT was hustled from the gate,
showed speed then tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path while between horses on the turn, battled with
the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. UNSTABLE PRINCE settled off the pace, moved from the
two path to the four path under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and earned the show while no match for the top two. BRIGADE
COMMANDER was forwardly placed then moved closer late on the backstretch, made a bid between horses while three wide on the turn, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and tired. STORMING CHROME settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch
in the four path and came up empty. STRAPPED broke a step slow, was urged well back on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, traveled
around the turn in the five path, shifted out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. J J'S JOKER stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, moved in while
urged at the rear, went around the the turn in the two path, spun into the stretch in the three path and was no factor. MR. PAPAGIORGIO went to the front,
moved clear inside the three-quarter pole, was asked along the rail while under threat early on the turn, lost the advantage with three furlongs to turn and
stopped. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT MOST
ACCURATE TIME

Footnotes
BOBBY M'S GIRL broke out at the start pinballing SHE'S A NATURAL back and forth in concert with BOMB SQUAD in the opening three to four strides,
went two then three wide through the first turn, tracked the front four then three wide patiently handled until set down angled seven wide into upper stretch,
rallied with good energy to collar the front seventy yards from home, then inched away to the wire. AUTUMN raced just off the inside into the first turn
among a quintet stacked across the track and was pinched out seven furlongs from home when GALLANT GRETA tucked to the two path just in front at that
station, tracked just off the inside and came under urging near the three-eighths coming in slightly and forcing an already retreating TIZALLMINE to be taken
in hand, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow and brief command a sixteenth from home, then got displaced by the top one just after
and ran on to preserve the place honors safe from the rest. GALLANT GRETA three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path seven furlongs from
home pinching back AUTUMN between rivals, tracked just off the inside until tipped three wide nearing the half mile pole nudging LUNA PATINA four wide,
came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command inside the three-sixteenths, dug in
under threat from a pair and was caught a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors. ALITTLEBITNAUGHTY tracked the pace along the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. DANCIN JANE broke out at the start
bumping LUNA PATINA, showed the way in hand along the inside, got briefly headed at the first call before taking back the front into the backstretch, settled
into a rhythm through sensible splits on hold until coming under challenge nearing the quarter pole, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch
under threat, got collared just inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. SHE'S A NATURAL got bumped between foes at the start who
each broke her way and was pinballed between then for a few strides, raced three then four wide through the first turn advancing to be in close aim of the
leader four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just
off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BOMB SQUAD broke in at the start bouncing SHE'S A NATURAL back and forth in tandem with BOBBY M'S
GIRL, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. LUNA PATINA got
bumped at the start by DANCIN JANE, raced four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and was then nudged four
wide near the half mile pole by GALLANT GRETA, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. IN ALL MY
DREAMS got brushed and steadied along the rail seven and a half furlongs from home, tracked the pace along the inside on hold until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. TIZALLMINE raced five then four wide into the first turn, tucked three then two wide taking brief
and narrow command six and a half furlongs from home, got headed inside that station and settled in the two path latched on the leader to the outside,
began to fade nearing the far turn and backed away getting taken in hand along the rail near the three-eighths briefly when AUTUMN came inwards under a
drive, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
SMILE MON went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was roused in the three path into the
stretch and drew off under a strong drive to prove much the best. YORK TAVERN tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn,
dropped to the two path into upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. BEARY FUNNY was forwardly placed on the outside, chased
in the four path on the turn and tired while able to hold the show. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE was urged along well off the pace, moved from the rail to the three
path on the turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch and failed to threaten. IRIE MAN was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the
three path, turned into the stretch in the five path and came up empty. CHALKY CAT broke a step slow, was urged along well off the pace, went around the
turn in the four path, came into the stretch in the six path and was no factor. ICE ROAD was void of speed, moved from the two path to the four path on the
turn, entered the stretch in the five path and showed little. OCTOBER BLISS settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path for most of the turn then
dropped to the rail and failed to respond. I LOVE CARA was urged along near the back on the outside, went around the turn in the three to four path and
was outrun. PAYNTER'S PRODIGY was very fractious in the gate then backed out and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, established a good
position just off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. THIS RACE

Footnotes
MAN IN FINANCE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide, got let out spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command with
three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive to prevail. KENNY BE stumbled at the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was caught at the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top
one while clear of the rest and along second best. PROBABILITY broke out at the start under husting bumping HAVE A CIGAR, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. CORVUS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, improved position to the finish. DARK MAGIC broke in at the start, chased five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and
passed tired rivals. HAVE A CIGAR broke in at the start and was bumped by PROBABILITY, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and went by tired foes to the finish. SUNDAY GILT got bumped at the start by
HURRICANE BAIN, chased five wide and forced HURRICANE BAIN to check out at the nine-sixteenths in tandem with SUNDAY GILT, came under coaxing
from the three-eighths and tired. LIBERTY RISING broke out at the start, chased seven then six wide tucking over and forcing HURRICANE BAIN to check
out near the nine-sixteenths in tandem with SUNDAY GILT, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.
REVIVALISM strode greenly losing ground quickly to the tail of the field, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths and made no impact. CADDIEMASTER chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into
upper stretch and faltered. HURRICANE BAIN broke in at the start bumping SUNDAY GILT, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and had a
pair of rivals coming in and outwards and was squeezed from his lane near the nine-sixteenths and forced to check at that station, went off stride five wide

Footnotes
OCEAN CLUB went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace off the rail, responded well when set down after turning into the stretch, drifted out
some under attack while under the crop in the drive and held gamely under vigorous handling. FIVE TOWNS (GB) was well placed just off the pace on the
inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner while being carried out some, made a
bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought to the finish and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. BREATH AWAY (GB) bumped soundly with a rival at
the start, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the far turn, shifted three wide late on that
bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid in the final sixteenth but just missed while able to
get the show. ALLURING ANGEL (GB) bumped soundly with a rival at the start, saved ground while settling towards the rear, was roused on the far turn,
moved off the rail while gaining in the stretch and finished with good courage for the last spot in the superfecta. POCA MUCHA broke out and hit the gate,
saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came into the stretch in the four path and lacked the needed
response. MIDNIGHT MILE (IRE) raced in the three path on the first turn, came out entering the backstretch, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked
in the three path on the far turn, chased while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong and weakened. ELOUNDA QUEEN (IRE) rounded the first
turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the six path
and failed to rally.

Footnotes
WUDHOOH got bumped at the start by FUNDAMENTALLY, who leapt outwards, pressed the pace three then two wide between foes coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking narrow command just inside the eighth pole, battled on gamely
to rebuff a challenge to the outside to the wire. MONTEGO BAY prompted the pace from the outside of the top pair four then three wide coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting game through the final furlong but was ultimately
repelled to the line. FANCY QUALITY (GB) five paths off the inside down the backstretch, got bumped by AWAIT near the half mile pole, tucked three to
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and closed well to the finish to get up for the show
honors. FUNDAMENTALLY leapt outwards at the start bumping WUDHOOH, chased three wide down the backstretch and was taken hold near the half
mile pole when briefly off heels which in turn forced AWAIT to be taken in hand and guided briefly outwards into FANCY QUALITY, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. COIF showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside
under pressure from a pair of rivals, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was collared just inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. OUT TOO LATE (GB) chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. STRIFE veered out at the start forcing MY EXECUTIVE
SWEET to steady off her heels, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. SHOP LIFTING got bumped at the start by AWAIT, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AWAIT broke in at the start
bumping SHOP LIFTING, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, had FUNDAMENTALLY steady off heels in front and was briefly taken hold
of and angled out bumping FANCY QUALITY near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. MY EXECUTIVE SWEET got steadied at the start when STRIFE veered out in front and conceded three
lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
REDDINGTON was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two to three path, turned into the stretch in the four path, chased the runner-up
into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging to prevail at big odds. CLASSIFY chased the pace on the outside, made a bid with three furlongs to
run, took the lead at the five-sixteenths then shook clear near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the
place. GENERAL BANKER broke out and a bit slow, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and improved with good energy for
the show. CHILENO dropped well off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, moved out near the furlong marker and improved position.
ESCALATION CLAUSE stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and also improved
position. REYNOLDS CHANNEL raced in the front half of the field, went three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the six path and lacked
the needed response. KEY POINT was urged along off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, was driven into upper stretch in the five path and
also lacked the needed response. D DAY SKY broke a bit slow, raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch,
drifted in and struck the fence inside the three-sixteenths pole and was no factor. PRINTRACK bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, climbed
late on the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and capitulated. FIERY HEART saved ground on the turn and showed little. J D
FACTOR stumbled at the start, was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the four path and failed to impact. KYSER broke out and a bit slow,
raced in the three path on the turn, angled out into upper stretch and never reached contention. EXCELLENT TIMING broke alertly and went to the front,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
RABAJA established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from A LISTER to the outside, shook off that foe and came
