Footnotes
HOOTOWL HOOT led the way up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and drew off in the lane. T C GOLD raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside early, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and improved position in the lane but was no match for the winner. MOR
TIGER PAW bumped with the horse to his outside and checked at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
four path, began a bid entering the stretch and improved position from there. WHISKEYSIPPI RIVER tracked the leader on the outside through the opening
quarter, navigated the bend from the two path and chased on to the wire. MOE DINGERS raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and showed no kick. PAHAPESTO WILLY chased the leader on the inside through the early going,
saved ground around the turn and faded from there. BLUSHING BEE stumbled leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. CAN'T KNOW bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, trailed well behind the
field racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
YAMILE'S stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked
clear in the stretch. SMARTY BE GOOD tracked the leader between horses early, came around the bend in the two path and chased on to the finish. BABY
DOLL PEACH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in
the lane. RAETASTIC raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. RED VOLTA
dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. TACTICAL EXPRESS
chased the leader on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and tired in the stretch. SENDING dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and faded in the stretch. PETIT JEAN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to
the four path coming around the turn and made no bid. ZANZORA trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
D FLASH dueled on the outside up the backstretch, was bumped by SHARMA'D running loose on the outside headed into the turn, led the way from the two
path around the bend and drew off in the lane. UKRAINE STRONG chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the
four path and kept on to the wire. BABY NOVA dueled on the inside early, bumped lightly with D FLASH headed into the turn when that rival was forced
over by the loose horse, swung out to the four path from there and chased on in the stretch. B L'S CONCERTO raced off the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, was bumped soundly by SHARMA'D passing the half mile pole, raced in the two path around the turn and never threatened. BENNIGAN
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and weakened in the lane. PROFESSIONAL GRADE raced off
the pace on the inside through the opening stages, was bumped hard by SHARMA'D running loose on the outside approaching the half mile pole and forced
to check, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. SHARMA'D stumbled just after leaving the gate, lost his rider, bumped with several horses as he
galloped alongside the field throughout the race, was caught after the wire and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON
REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
JUST ASK JOEL raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path
coming around the far turn, dueled in the lane and got up for the win late. ROSENQUIST raced in the four path early, tracked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. DEVIL VISION raced in the three path around the
first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and dueled in the stretch, giving way late. REDISUR saved
ground around the first bend, trailed well behind the field racing up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position in late
stretch. TIGER HUNTER saved ground while racing off the pace through the opening half mile, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn and
never threatened. POLITICAL RIOT raced in the three path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far
turn and into the lane and weakened late.
