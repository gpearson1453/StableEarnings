Footnotes
BOOTSY'S MERLOT was well rated along the inside, made a rail bid nearing the quarter pole to take over leaving that marker, then drew off in the lane to
prove best while being kept to her task. MY JO JO was three wide into the first turn, then moved towards the inside while reserved, advanced on the inside
on the far turn, came two wide off the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best and no match to the winner. STYLISH ANNA set the pace while
clear and in the two path, then was headed by the quarter pole and tired in the drive, bested rest. RED JAG stalked the pace two to three wide, came three
wide into the lane and tired. LA TACHE was reluctant to load, settled three wide and came four wide off the bend and stopped.

BAD HENRY was well rated two wide, moved out three wide by the half mile marker, made a three wide move on the far turn to be clear by the quarter pole,
then drew off in the lane while being wrapped up the final sixty yards. SIDNEY'S BID was well placed on the inside, moved out to be two wide by the quarter
pole while making a bid, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best while running on the left lead in the lane. BAD HOMBRE was
bumped at the break, reserved early, three wide into the lane and was along for the show award late. DUKE OF DOOLY stalked the pace three wide and
made a bid two wide on the far turn but then was empty in the drive. LET IT RIDENESS broke outwardly at the start, then moved up and crossed over to set
a fast pace on the inside, then was headed on the far turn and gave way in the drive. SETTE STELLE chased the pace four wide and tired.

Footnotes
MITI FAST FLOWER vied for the lead on the inside, then relented and rated back off the pace, then moved out nearing the quarter pole and tipped out three
wide leaving the turn while making a bid, then took over and drew off to prove much the best under a drive. WICKED KITTEN clipped the heels of
CHACHITA and stumbled nearing the first turn, then was six wide on the first turn and moved up on the outside down the backstretch, made a three wide
bid on the far turn to draw clear, then was headed by the winner by three sixteenths and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best.
LUCKY HONEY chased the early pace and was shuffled back, then came into the lane on the inside and bested the rest. CHACHITA was five wide into the
first turn, chased the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn and tired. GOLDEN BOSS LADY chased the pace three wide and tired. IMA
SILVER LADY vied for the lead two wide, then went on to set the pace on the inside and gave way on the far turn. LADY GABRIELLE checked in between

SABI was three wide into the first turn, then moved in to rated along two wide, then continued to draft in behind the pace and came three wide off the bend
behind a wall of horses, was blocked and then angled in when the rail opens up for the chute and closed up the inside to get up late to prove best under a
drive. HENDRICKSON set the pace on the inside and then was pressured and dueled for command by the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the lane and held
off BIG BIG STAR but was caught by the winner late, gutsy effort. BIG BIG STAR prompted the pace and made a two wide bit to duel for command off the
turn and had a long drive but was out-kicked. PHOBIA was well placed on the inside and kept on but needed more. INBOUND tracked the pace three to two
wide, came three wide off the turn but had no kick while racing evenly. FINANCIAL DISTRICT was reserved on the inside, cut the corner leaving the turn
and had a late rally. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER was settled early three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the lane. MAMA
BANNED ME was off slowly, reserved two to three wide and was not a threat. CESNOLA was reserved two to three wide and was not a factor. ALOHA
MAN was settled on the inside and dropped back.

SNOW LAKE was rated early four to three wide, then was two wide on the turn, split rivals leaving the turn, came three wide off the bend and closed well to
get up with about seventy yards to go and edged away to prove best under a drive. BOLD BABY was away alertly and crossed over to control the pace
while clear, was well handled and still clear off the turn, then was sent down and roused but was caught late and had to settle for being second best. TIZ
RACE DAY chased the pace and made a inside bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive, bested rest. FLEETING EMBER tracked the early
pace in between rivals, then stalked the front runner three wide on the turn and came four wide off the bend and came up empty.

LATE FROST was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then was confronted by DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD and dueled with that rival to upper stretch,
made a bid and drew clear, then was still clear by the sixteenth marker but was tiring late and lasted to prove best while being all out. LADY LIBERTY
BELLE broke outwardly and bumped JUST GREAT at the start, then chased the pace along the inside, came two wide off the turn and then moved out by
the sixteenth marker and closed gap fast late. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD pressed the early pace three wide, then went up and dueled with the winner on the
turn, came three wide off the turn and flattened out while staying on for the show award. MALIBU BEAUTY was close up early two wide, then moved out to
be three wide on the turn tracking the dueling leaders, came four wide off the turn but had no punch in the lane. LADRO DI FICHI was reserved early on the
inside, came four wide off the turn, moved out in the lane and had a belated rally on the outside. JUST GREAT was bumped at the break, settled early three
wide, then was three to two wide on the turn, came three wide off the turn and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
FABULOUS CANDY broke a step behind the field, raced well off the pace into the turn, picked up the tempo around the bend, bid five wide in upper stretch,
under an all out drive prevailed at the wire. NAMI vied two wide into the turn, shook off inside rival around the bend, out kicked the bid from her outside rival
when leaving the quarter pole, and was stubborn through the wire. LADY LANCER was off to a slow start, raced off the early pace and between runners
around the bend and through the stretch, finished with a strong closing kick, just missing the place. JOY'S PRIDE very slow into stride, unhurried around the
bend, shifted out seven wide in upper stretch, and closed the gap willingly through the wire. BOH'S N O'S chased the pace from the three path, put to task
leaving the quarter pole, in range through the stretch, needed more late. SOMETHING SILLY off the pace and inside around the turn, bid inside nearing the
quarter pole, came home evenly to the wire. ZIFFY BUG vied inside, dueled around the bend, under outside pressure through the final furlong, gave way in
deep stretch.
