PULPIT'S JUSTICE stalked the earlier pace inside, started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path past the
quarter, dueled clear from there and widened the final sixteenth. ROMANTIC WARRIOR rated the pace inside, kept the edge over No Brake Needed leaving
the half mile pole and was pressured from the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the quarter pole then flattened the final furlong. BLOOD BROTHER
ducked out and made contact with NO BRAKE NEEDED leaving the gate then raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and came along for third inside the eighth pole. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then stalked off the rail,
challenged past the half mile pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. MEGS GOLDEN BOY saved early ground
well off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and passed some rivals. RUN ROCKY RUN had
his heels clipped past the three quarter pole and rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the five
path on the far turn. VOODOO DEVIL was forced in and shut off past the three quarter pole, raced off the rail on the first turn then gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, but faded into the far turn. RAPTOR RAZZLE ran up on, and clipped the heels off Voodoo Devil past the three quarter pole then
angled in a path, raced in the four path on the opening turn then faded from the seven sixteenths pole.

LATE IN THE GAME saved ground racing well off the early pace, left the second turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the five path and steadily gained to take over the final stride. MUAD'DIB settled back in the three and four paths, started his bid approaching the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and dug in to take the lead in later yards, but was caught in the final strides. JUBA'S NOTION rated the
pace toward the inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the five sixteenths and contested at a close disadvantage two deep
on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but flattened late strides. JUBA'S HAT TRICK rated close inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled
to even terms at the five sixteenths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but flattened stride later
yards. SOCIAL CHIC broke a bit awkwardly then settled off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far
turn, took aim entering the stretch but steadied from tight quarters at the rail mid-stretch and flattened stride. TEACHINTHERELEASE stalked off the rail
early, rounded the second turn about the three path and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
INTERCEPTION rated a slim lead inside, kept the edge over Wild Girl leaving the three eighths pole and came under pressure at the five sixteenths,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. SKIP THRU DA FIRE settled back off the rail the first turn, started an outside bid into
the backstretch and raced in the five path on the far turn, closed steadily from the head of the lane and took second the final stride. JUJU ON DA BEAT
settled off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, dueled through the stretch to hold third but was
nipped from second the final stride. MUCHO MACHO MRYTLE settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the four path on the far turn and flattened stride later yards. WILD GIRL raced with the early pace two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole,
but dropped back at the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn two deep and weakened in the lane. LOVE OF GRACE angled to the inside through the front
stretch and saved ground. MY SWEETHEART DANI recovered quickly from a bobbling break and stalked three wide the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.
