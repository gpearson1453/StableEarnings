Footnotes
ALL WEST tracked early then went up to prompted the pace two wide on the turn, made a bid to vie for command by the quarter pole, then put a head in
front nearing the furlong marker and was put to a long drive and prevailed to prove best while all out. IMPROBABLE STORY was rated early on the inside,
eased out on the turn, came four wide off the bend and rallied well to just miss. SANTA CRUISER vied for the early lead on the inside, then relented and
was well placed on the inside behind the two front runners on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for dead aim, made a bid but was outfinished.
GOOD JUJU was settled early, moved on the outside of IMPROBABLE STORY on the turn and came five wide off the bend and offered a mild kick in the
lane but needed more. SIR OLLIE bobbled at the break, then recovered and vied for the early lead outside of SANTA CRUISER, then went on and moved to
the inside to set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command off the turn and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong.

Footnotes
KOLOMIO set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the far turn , made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the furlong marker,
then held well late to prove best under a drive. CURLINS INCHARGE was rated along the inside and then moved up on the inside leaving the five eighths
marker under a long rein to be with in a length of the leaders by the half mile marker, then continued to save ground on the far turn, moved off the inside
leaving the quarter pole, came three wide off the bend, then angled back to the rail by the furlong marker and was gaining late on the inside.
SIXWILLBERICH pressed the pace in between rivals on the first turn, then two wide on the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the far turn to duel for
command, came three wide off the turn and could not go with the winner while saving the show award late. LONG CROW was brushed a bit leaving the
gate, then settled back early, two to three wide on the far turn, came four to five wide off the turn and offered a mild late rally to just miss the show award.
MAD ADAM chased the pace two wide, then moved to the inside on the far turn, cut the corner leaving the bend and then shifted out by the furlong marker
but had no late kick. STAR NATION was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally. ICEATUDE was settled early, made a three wide move on the far turn

Footnotes
SIX KINGS prompted the pace on the outside three wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn, then hit the front leaving the three sixteenths and was clear
by the furlong marker and then widened the margin in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. ROCKET NIGHT was in tight in between rivals on the first
turn and had to check hard, then got back into stride and tracked the pace two to three wide, came four wide off the bend and ran on to gain the place
award late. MOVING TO KENTUCKY pressed the early pace and then vied for the lead two wide, then was in between rivals nearing the five sixteenths,
then battled with the winner and came off the bend to the inside, could not go with the winner while losing the place award late. VINCITA was reserved on
the inside, then was blocked leaving the five sixteenths and waited nearing the quarter pole, swung out four wide leaving the turn, then angled out for racing
room nearing the furlong marker and had a mild late rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. ULTIMATE STRIKE was four wide into the first turn, settled
two wide and came three wide off the bend and had no kick. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS was settled back early, three wide trip and came five wide off the
bend and had no significant rally. PHOTO OP set a pressured pace and then vied for the lead on the inside and then gave way leaving the five sixteenths.
DANCING NOAH was in tight on the inside and was keen and had to check on the first turn, then pulled entering the backstretch still while saving ground
and then tired after six furlongs. IN THE NUMBERS was four wide into the first turn, tracked the early pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SOUND DOCTRINE was away alertly to set the pace while clear, raced on the inside to the two path on the turn, turned back a bid from ALILNALOT on the
turn, then drew off in the lane while being ridden out. ALILNALOT tracked the early pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to
be no match for the winner while being clearly second best. EL GUNNER moved up to track the pace in between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and
came four wide off the bend and was no match to the top two while getting the nod for the show award. PRINTS MONEY tracked the early pace in between
rivals two wide, then was on the inside on the turn, weakened in the drive and lost the show award late. QUARRYMEN was reserved early, saved ground on
the turn, cut the corner leaving the turn and had no rally. MIDNIGHT AMBITION was settled early, two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn
and came up empty. FORE FLAG was off slowly, settled back early and failed to menace. STUNNEM tracked the pace on the inside, moved out on the turn
and was three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
GLOBAL SENSATION hopped at the break and was off slowly, settled nicely two wide, moved out on the turn to make a four wide move by the quarter pole,
then engaged the front runner and edged away to prove best under a hand ride. PURE PANIC set the pace while clear and raced in the two path on the
turn, was headed by the winner leaving the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. SOLIDIFY was reserved early,
two wide on the turn, began to make a run nearing the quarter pole, swung out four wide leaving the turn and then moved out farther leaving the three
sixteenths but flattened out late, while saving the show award. BEYOND BEST was outrun early, saved ground on the turn, came two wide off the turn and
split rivals by the sixteenth marker and had a belated rally to just miss the show award. TIMELESS BOUNTY tracked the pace two to three wide and
weakened in the lane. GOT THUNDER tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE chased the pace four wide and tired.

Footnotes
CANDY LOVER prompted the early pace three wide, then fell back on the turn and was ridden along nearing the quarter pole, came four wide off the bend
and was put to a stiff drive and slowly got up late to prove best. CRAZY CAMI was allowed to settle early, two wide on the turn, angled out by the three
sixteenths marker, then advanced and angled back in leaving the sixteenth marker and finished well to gain the place award. SISTER KISSES set a
pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the quarter pole, then drifted out in the final furlong and was caught in deep stretch and
then lost the place award on the wire. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES tracked the pace along the inside, lost ground on the turn, then finished willingly but
needed more. IDALOU was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and offered a belated rally for the minor rewards. SOMBRA DORADA pressed the
pace two to three wide and then drifted in leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. LITTLE BLAZE chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
BILLAL was rated along between rivals, two to three wide on the turn, bulled way out leaving the turn to make a four to five wide bid leaving the three
sixteenths marker to hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then edged clear and kept the closing BANJO CHRIS safe at the wire to prove best. BANJO
CHRIS bobbled at the break, then settled along the inside, advanced nicely in hand while saving ground on the turn, was boxed nearing the quarter pole
and eased off the inside, then came two wide off the bend and was in traffic by the three sixteenths, split rivals leaving the furlong marker and then once
clear by the sixteenth marker closed full of run but was too late, tough trip. SAVE THE TREES was allowed to settle early, three to four wide on the turn,
came five wide off the bend and then moved out farther and offered a late rally to gain the show award. MARKET STREET was a bit fractious in the gate,
reserved early two wide, then swung out four wide leaving the turn, angled out farther leaving the three sixteenths and brushed with SAVE THE TREES and
had a late gain to miss the show award. FINSTER stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command between rivals by the
quarter pole, gained a short lead off the turn but was headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and faded. HOW'S UR ATTITUDE tracked the pace
four wide, then was bumped out to the five path leaving the turn and weakened. MR SKYLIGHT was off slowly, then was hard held on the inside, cut the
corner leaving the turn and angled out by the furlong marker and had no kick. NORMANDY HERO stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid to vie
for command by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. BARKSDALE was off slowly, then rushed to the lead on the inside to set a fast pace and then
gave way in the drive.

OPTICAL opened clear and angled in to dictate terms leaving the chute, widened on the turn and into the stretch, and drew away to prove much the best.
KY DO DECLARE tracked four wide in hand, came under a ride nearing the five-sixteenths pole, churned on through a prolonged drive and was up in time
to earn the runner up spot. DUAL INCOME came away a step slow and bumped with DESPARATE PROPOSAL at the start, moved up quickly between
foes, took a run at the winner into the turn, was no match for that one, fought on but weakened in the drive and settled for the minor award. REB was
unhurried into stride four wide, was put to pressure into the turn, advanced between horses through the bend, angled out in the upper stretch and improved
position. REAL CONVICTION tracked between runners, launched his bid nearing the quarter pole, but faltered once straightened in the lane and faded.
GOLDEN ICE settled toward the inside but lacked a response when called upon. DEPUTY A. P. lagged well back and passed only the tiring ones. G. ERIK
was allowed to settle four wide, was fanned out further entering the stretch and was never a factor. IL MARCHESSE prompted the pace to the turn and
dropped out. DESPERATE PROPOSAL broke slow, was bumped and squeezed at the start, moved up along the inside leaving the chute, was caught in
tight and checked hard inside the five furlong marker, shifted out to find room was in traffic entering the stretch and never threatened. OUT OF THE
CLOUDS contended between horses to the turn and stopped.
