Footnotes
GARDINER vied two wide, wrestled an advantage and put his inner counterpart to subtly cramped quarters in upper stretch, then drove clear leaving the
sixteenth pole. COLONEL YORKE bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack three wide into the turn, shifted four wide turning for home
before floating to the five path entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes to gain place in the closing stages. SELL IT vied for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, got put to tight quarters while headed in upper stretch, fought on hanging on his left lead through midstretch, but yielded late and lost place
in the shadow of the wire. HANK HILL broke out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked behind the top pair early on, chased along the inside around the
turn and pursued evenly through the lane. ASLEEP AT EIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start, pressed outside of the top pair around the turn, came
under urging before failing to sustain pressure turning for home, chased spinning to the four path into the lane, got outkicked for minor placings by an outer
foe in upper stretch yet kept on mildly therafter. HUEVOS D'ORO transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, lacked speed before
trailing in the three path around the turn, then moved up five wide leaving the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead. BELIEVE IN DREAMS took
light contact from an inner foe leaving the gate, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, leaned inwardly while hanging on his left lead between horses at
the furlong grounds and failed to factor. DOWN THE ISLANDS was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe and steadied back at the start, lacked speed
in the two path and made little impact. BAYTOWN GUVNAH pursued form the two path and failed to factor. BRAVE WORDS chased from midpack along
the inside and faded. BAMBY BOOM laid off of the pace in the four to six path and tired.

Footnotes
GILDED CRAKEN showed the way from a pair of lightly pressing outer rivals into the far turn, drew clear entering the lane and held sway under a drive.
DANCE SOME MO pressed two wide, then between horses down the backstretch, sustained mild pressure around the far turn, proved no match for the
leader entering the lane, yet kept on to prove second best. HARLEEZY fidgeted as the gates sprung and broke slow, tugged behind foes in the two path
around the first turn, trailed in the four path around the far turn, swung to the six path entering the lane, then rallied willingly outside of foes to gain show in
the final sixteenth. MUCHO MOJO tracked in the four path before taking closer order to press outside of the top pair entering the backstretch, sustained mild
pressure around the far turn but gave way in upper stretch. J T'S IMAGINATION was a beat slow into stride, tracked along the inside but lacked a bid. HE'S
A ANGEL laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path in midstretch and made little impact.

Footnotes
BERNIN HOT showed the way in the two path, built a clear margin around the turn, then held sway under a drive. DR. STORM was put to tight quarters
between horses by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace three to two wide and between horses, rallied to split foes at the furlong grounds and edged
place. ACTIVE DUTY tracked in the three to two path into the turn, shifted out to the five path leaving the three furlong pole, then stayed on willingly. TIS
CHARMING laid off of the pace along the inside took closer order inside of rivals down the backstretch, saved ground in pursuit around the turn, sustained a
rail bid for place at the furlong grounds but flattened out. COWBOY CODE came out at the start, stalked forwardly along the inside, tipped to the three path
to take up pursuit outside of the clear leader with three furlongs to go, but proved no match for that one entering the lane and faded. MO HOPE pursued
from midpack in the two path, then between horses into the turn, yielded around the bend and failed to factor. REMARKABLE MO bumped the gate upon
leaving it, lacked speed in the four path and made little impact. GHOST PRINCE trailed in the two path into the turn and failed to factor. SESAME STREEK
broke inwardly, pressed outside of the leader down the backstretch, but gave way in the four path at the three furlong pole and caved between horses
entering the lane. LUCCHESI chased from midpack four wide, but faded in the five path around the turn. JON'S STREET BAND broke out, lacked speed in
the five path, was done early, eased through the lane, pulled up nearing the wire and walked off.

drew off. UNCLE BERLEY tracked four to three wide into the turn, ranged up to bid at the three sixteenths pole, led briefly before offering little resistance to
an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, proved no match then held place from a late bidder. DAZZLEMESILVER lacked speed in the two path into the
turn, pursued behind rivals around the bend, shifted out four wide and between foes entering the lane, then stayed on to offer a late bid for place but was
denied. STINGY stalked along the inside, then between horses turning for home, entered the lane three wide and among foes and lacked a bid. CITY OF
CLOUDS saved ground off of the pace, paused behind a rival entering the final furlong, slipped through and moved up. MYSTIC POWER trailed in the three
path and improved position. SUPREMELY laid off of the pace three to four wide, floated six wide into the lane and tired. EXTRA HALO took light contact
from an inner foe soon after the start, vied three wide, forged an advantage from am single inner rival at the three furlong pole, drew clear tucking the two
path turning for home, but was caught by an outer challenger at the three sixteenths pole and faltered between horses. MOONSTRIKE (GB) brushed an
outer rival early on, vied inside of a pair of foes early on, got headed by a single outer rival at the three furlong pole, gave way turning for home and
weakened. TOWN BRANCH vied two wide and between horses, gave way with nine sixteenths to go and weakened between horses around the turn.

Footnotes
MITTY'S GRIDDY broke a beat slow, trailed in the two to four path around the turn before swinging to the seven path into the lane, then rallied with a good
kick outside of rivals to reel in the tiring leader in the shadow of the wire. EL PRESTIGIO vied for the lead two wide, drew clear in upper stretch, but tired in
the final furlong, was caught in the closing stages, weakened yet saved place. HITCHCOCK leaned into an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack
four wide, spun five wide into the lane, ran on to bid for place at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked for that position late
and missed place. AIN'T NO DISCO was urged along pursuing in midpack along the inside into the turn, shifted four wide and between horses entering the
lane, bid for place among foes at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked, then steadied in tight quarters nearing the wire. PERFECT FORCE bumped an
outer rival at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, bid for place two wide and between horses at the furlong grounds but flattened out. PUTTING
EAGLE chased forwardly along the inside, then from the two path around the turn and yielded three wide and between horses leaving the furlong grounds.
TOM CAT TUESDAY pursued in the three path and between horses, then failed to factor. CAMPAIGN TRAIL took contact from an outer foe and steadied
between horses at the start, laid off of the pace four wide and made little impact. ICAN took contact from an inner rival at the start, got briefly rank between
rivals moving to the five furlong pole, pursued from the two path and failed to factor. FREE COUNTRY set the pace inside of a vying rival, gave way to that
one in upper stretch and readily caved. CARCAR EXPRESS leaned in and bobbled at the start, then got outrun in the three path. BOB MO took contact
from an inner rival at the start, chased forwardly in the three path then faltered between horses turning for home.

ECHO SOUND vied for the lead two wide and between horses, forged an advantage entering the lane as an outer presser challenged, maintained a margin
while delaying a lead change to midstretch, then held firm through the final furlong. OLIVIERA pressed three deep, bid into the lane but was kept at bay.
BAYTOWN BUTTERFLY tracked the leading trio from the two to three path, chased through the lane and saved show late. ROSHIELL MY BELLE broke a
beat slow, trailed in the three to four path before swinging to the six path into upper stretch, stayed on willingly but missed show late, then was taken off of
the track in an equine ambulance. ANAKARINA broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace inside of a pair of prompters, got headed entering the lane
and weakened. INTO GOLDEN ROAD broke inwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside and was done early.

outer bidder. BROMLEY trailed in the two to three path, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied widest to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth,
but was kept at bay late. GULFSTREAM WAY prompted two wide and between horses, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from the two path,
encountered traffic three wide entering the lane, shifted in and ran on to edge show from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. KAVOD stalked four to three
wide, then between horses around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led into the lane as his outer counterpart loomed a danger, got headed by that
one nearing the furlong grounds, yielded and lost show in the late stages. RAISE CAIN took light contact from an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace
in the four path, fanned five wide into the lane, but lacked a bid. W W CANDY laid off of the pace along the inside, moved out to the three to four path and
between horses at the furlong grounds, then failed to menace among foes whlie hanging on his left lead. CONFIDENCE GAME bumped an outer rival at the
