Footnotes
MYMANROWEN broke sharp from the outside, cleared before a furlong, extended that advantage in the two path through the turn, continued to hold a
sizable advantage through the lane while being kept to task in proving much the best. LOST MY BAG bump start, broke inside the winner, chased that one
in vain throughout in the three path, no match through the stretch, second best. I NITA WARRIOR broke in, settled in the main body while closest to the
inside, continued in even fashion while saving ground to prove best of the rest. RUN RICE RUN back off the pace while racing three wide after bumping with
LOST MY BAG at the start, went one paced while racing three wide. BERNDT MARSHMALLOW void of speed, veered out to be three wide midway on the
turn when moving past a tiring rival, lacked a serious closing kick in the drive. NOW NOW MELVIN back off the early pace, gave way from between foes in
the turn and finished well back.

Footnotes
SACRED DREAMS away in good order, prompted the leader from the outside in the run up the backstretch, moved to engage that one in the turn, dueled
through the bend two path, kicked well clear through the lane while under steady handling. DEBBO broke running from along the inside, showed the way up
the backstretch, raced on equal terms with the winner through the turn closest to the inside, lost contact with that one in upper straight, remained clear for
the place. LA CANTAROS back off the early pace, angled out to be five wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to be getting to the runner up late.
ROBERTS REVENGE broke in, bumped foe start, settled in the main body toward the rail, saved ground turn, displayed some mild interest while not a
serious threat through the stretch. KOKOMO STARLET settled in the second flight while in the two path, came up empty for the stretch drive. CAT ATE THE
CANARY in mid pack while toward the inside, angled out a bit turning for home, lacked a finishing response to continue evenly through the stretch. JADE
D'AMORE lacked speed outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, lacked a closing response. HONDURAS PASSION made little impact while
racing three wide most of the way. SECRETLY SWEET broke out but forwardly, within striking distance for three furlongs while in the three path, backed up
through the lane. WAABOO bumped at the start, raced well back inside, steered three wide exiting the turn, lacked any kind of response to trail home. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROSY EDGE raced toward the front early inside, steered out three wide early in the turn, advanced on the two leaders late in the bend, put a head in front
when straightened for home, drew well clear late under firm handling. CRANKY SHEILA closest to the leader while just off the inside, went after that one
through the turn, took over late in the turn, dueled with the winner inside that one upper stretch then proved no match the final furlong. FUNTIMEGIRL back
off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, advanced to be closest to the top two with a furlong to run, had nothing for that pair thereafter,
managed to save the show. SMARTY'S ANGEL lacked early foot inside, angled out to be three wide by late in the turn, closing the gap on FUNTIMEGIRL in
the late going while also not a threat to the top two. LITTLE BURRITO went one paced throughout in midpack, lacked a closing response. AND CHANGE
hopped to spot the field a couple of lengths at the break, remained back while racing three to four wide. IMMA MADI TUE sprinted clear exiting the chute,
showed the way into and through the early part of the turn, stopped when headed by the runner up turning for home.

Footnotes
ANOTHERBOTTLE lacked speed, saved ground while still well off the pace through the turn, advanced up the rail past the furlong marker, steered outside
the lead pack late, surged in the final strides to be up in time. CADILLAC COWBOY with the pace in the two and between horses, continued to force or set
the pace through the turn, long drive, led late, nailed in the final strides by the winner in a solid effort. BABY'S LAST DANCE prompted the leaders from the
outside, engaged that trio early in the turn, continued to contest the issue into and through upper straight, late duel, grudgingly gave in the final twenty yards,
saved the show. GABARRA bobbled at the start, outrun early as a result, continued well back in the two path turn, switched to the outside when
straightened out in upper stretch and closed with good energy while too late. SUNNY SASSICAIA saved ground while also lacking any speed for three
furlongs, began to move up the inside upper stretch, moved out a bit late and was also going well at the end. TRIPLE RED ACES set or forced the pace
along the inside, continued to vie into the lane, weakened the final furlong to lose several positions. PINEHURST (IRE) behind the pace while racing
outside, continued four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. MALAKI EMPIRE behind the first flight just off the inside, came three wide for the
drive, weakened. HAPPY SEASON last to leave, lacked speed, was attempting to make a run inside the furlong marker when encountering traffic, steadied
and was left with too much to do. GET RIPPED with the lead flight up the backstretch off the inside, vied three wide and between horses turn, first of that
quartet to blink in upper straight, continued to weaken to the wire. HEXCEL tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA NATIVE gunned early to move up the inside to wrest control into the turn, dueled through the bend, drew out strongly through the lane in sharp
effort. DADDY DIGGS forwardly placed as well, moved with the winner to the front late backstretch outside that one, dueled through the turn in the two path,
also failed to match the winner through the lane, missed the place. ME PROMESA within striking distance well wide up the backstretch, bit closer three wide
turn, proved no match for the winner stretch, long duel for the place, gained the nod at the wire. MAXIMUM GRACE away well, with the early pace between
horses, fell back off that group late backstretch, well back in the two path turn, roused, moved out a bit and showed some mild late interest. REXINATOR off
the pace while inside, continued to save ground turn, improved position into the lane inside of several rivals, went flat to the wire to finish up evenly. FLINT
ROCK with the early leaders, fell back off the lead back by late on the backstretch, followed the lead group through the turn, three wide into the stretch, had
little for the run to the wire. HAPPY TALKER broke back, raced outside,six wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. STAR ROUGE lacked speed five wide
turning for home, also lacked a closing response to finish back. BIG MARV tired while racing three to four wide turn.

Footnotes
CAPELLA RED prompted the leader in the two path past the wire the first time, joined that one first turn from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, put that
same rival away by midway on the final turn, drew well clear through the lane. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) in the second flight, moved a bit closer in the
two path second turn, could not do much with the winner through the stretch, held sway for the place. ROSIE'S ANGUS void of early foot off the inside,
continued three wide second turn, roused for the drive, rallied out in the course and was getting to the runner up late. SUPER STORMY in the second group
after moving off the inside, three wide into and through the final turn, moved with the winner through that bend, flattened out through the lane to finish up
evenly. GIRLS GOT GAME settled off the pace and the inside, lacked the needed closing response. LADY WITH A CAUSE lacked speed while saving
ground first turn, continued inside into and through most of the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SIGNING back
off the pace, four wide into the lane, remained back. JESS'S RAINBOW away in good order, showed the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half mile
inside the winner, stopped second turn.

Footnotes
CONTRABANDISTA allowed the pace to go early toward the inside, remained settled in the run up the backstretch, angled out four wide when beginning to
advance late in the final turn, closed with good resolve to be up in the final strides. SAM'S PROMISE close from the start off the inside, vied three wide
through the final turn, gained the advantage, clear late, nailed in the waning strides. PERFECT STRIKE with the pace off the inside, allowed a rival the rail
after a half, vied inside the runner up through the final bend, could not match that one late nor contain the winner, saved the show. CHROME RUN bumped
start, carried out six wide early in the first turn, continued well wide in the run onto and up the backstretch, five wide through the final turn when within
striking distance, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. COUNTRY CUT in the second flight into the first turn in the two path, dropped inside, lodged a
middle move to take the advantage before a half, vied into and through the final turn then gave way in the drive. LE COOP devoid of speed, moved well
wide, six path into the far turn, dropped toward the inside midway on that bend and went evenly to the wire. ROYAL DE BE five wide into the first turn,
moved inside a bit while still well back, three wide through the second turn, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. BET ALL THE GOLD bumped
at the start, five to four wide first turn when forwardly placed, remained in the first flight while four wide through the second bend, backed up through the
stretch. ROULETTE attempted to get out when with the lead pack first turn, took up in some traffic, fell back, four wide into the second turn, passed tiring
rivals. LITTLE JONY carried out six wide in traffic first turn, raced in mid pack and tired in the drive. MUCHO MACHO CAM bothered and carried out five
wide early in the first turn, continued with the main body, five wide again midway on the second bend, gave way in the drive.
