Footnotes
RYNOTOGRACE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and held clear to the wire. HEAVENLYCONVEYANCE raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the bend and gained ground late. MIDNIGHT JOY dueled
between horses through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the three path and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased on to
the wire. LATIN FORCE tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid nearing the quarter
pole and kept on from there. CAT ON THE PROWL chased the leader on the inside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and
weakened in the lane. GOOD GRIEF CLAUDE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and improved
position in the stretch while never truly threatening. WESTDAKOTA trailed well behind the field racing up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming
around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. KIRILL THE THRILL raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, continued around the
bend in the three path and was outkicked from there. BURN BOSS raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from
the four path and made no bid. BEARS' D raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn
and faded in the stretch. THE MAN THE MYTH pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the
turn and tired in the lane.
