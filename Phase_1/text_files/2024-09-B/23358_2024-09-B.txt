a drive. BEN DREAMING was well rated early, made a two wide bod on the turn and hit the front nearing the furlong marker but could not go with the winner
late while being second best. DARE TO FAIL was settled three wide early, then advanced two wide on the far turn, swung out four wide and made a bid but

IN B. J.'S HONOR broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the break, went up to duel for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear
by the furlong marker and then remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. DELIGHTFUL HALO dueled for the lead two wide and ran on to the wire but
could not go with the winner while being clearly second best. COPPER CRUSH checked and stumbled after the break, then moved to the outside and
advanced four wide on the turn, then had a late rally to gain the show award. LITTLEBITOFAQUEEN prompted the pace three wide and faded in the drive,
lost show award late. NIGHT TIZZY was slammed and bounced around at the break, saved ground throughout and had no rally. MALLORY UNBRIDLED
was bumped at the break, settled early, three wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and had no rally. MALLORY'S OCEAN was reserved
early, came three wide into the lane and was not a threat.

Footnotes
UNO MAS BOURBON was reserved early in between rivals on the first turn, advanced two wide on the backstretch, then continued to advance on the far
turn on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn bumping with REGALO, then continued to bull his way out nearing the furlong marker, then once
clear made a bid and edged clear to prove best under a drive. THE DONEGAL CLAN set the pace and crossed over to the inside while clear, was well
handled and dug in when headed nearing the furlong marker, then ran on gamely to the wire but could not hold off the winner but stayed on for the place.
REGALO was rated along two to three wide, then advanced in hand on the far turn three wide, came four wide off the bend and was bumped hard by the
winner, then continued on and the rider tried to keep that rival in, but then was pushed out nearing the furlong marker and then continued to run on late to
gain the show award late. RUNNIN MUNNIN tracked the pace and made a two wide bid off the turn to go on even terms for command by the furlong marker
but flattened out, lost show award late. CORNISHMAN was reserved three wide early, advanced two wide on the far turn but had no late kick. CAROLO
RAPIDO was bumped at the break, settled in the back early four wide, then advanced on the outside on the turn, came wide into the lane and had a belated
rally. DJANGO was reserved on the inside and had no rally. TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR was settled while three wide, made a four wide move on the far turn
but weakened in the drive. CALI DREAMIN was rank into the first turn, chased the pace on the inside and stopped. REAL MEN VIOLIN was settled back
early and never factored and was eased thru the lane, walked off. THE RIDER ON NUMBER EIGHT REGALO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER,
after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was DISALLOWED and the race was made official.
