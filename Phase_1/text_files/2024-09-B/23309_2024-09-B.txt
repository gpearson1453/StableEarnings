dug in under steady encouragement to get up under the wire. MON GATEAU rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and
kept the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was nipped under the wire. BON BUENO was forced
outward and into CHICA CHUCK leaving the gate and dropped well back to save ground on the first turn, bid into the backstretch and steadily improved,
entered the far turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished well to take third mid-stretch. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then saved

clear mid-stretch and opened up the final sixteenth. JUBA B WILD stalked the early pace two deep, dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
contested the edge off the rail into the far turn but was met entering the stretch, dropped back a sixteenth away and had to settle for second best. SUMMON

came along for third late. LOOK AHEAD moved to the inside and rated a slim early lead, dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
dropped back at the rail toward the head of the lane, angled out leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride. KEEP SHINING ON US saved ground well off
the pace and could only improve her position. CLIMATE CHANGE settled in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole
but faded in the four path on the far turn. COLLECTING ANGELS rated just off the pace inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. POPPY MAC rounded the opening turn in the three path, left the turn outside and picked up

FULL MOON LOVER gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then eased out into the lane and dug in to get up the final yards.
MOONLIT KISS contested the pace soon after the start and took the nod leaving the five sixteenths pole, dueled with the advantage at the rail on the turn,
dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. DIXIE YODELER chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn
and finished well to take third the final strides. CHEROKEE CASTLE gave chase, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the
lane. SYMPTOMATIC gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened later yards. SILVER RULES chased, raced off the rail on the turn,
angled to the outside into the lane but showed little further. REMY'S HOTSHOT dueled with a slim lead the opening quarter mile, but dropped back off the
rail nearing the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
IM THE DIRECTOR took the lead shortly after the start then angled to the inside into the first turn and rated the pace, was urged away from the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail most of the far turn, bolted toward the head of the lane but was steadily handled and widened the final furlong. BAIL IS
DENIED stalked from the four and five paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, dug in from the
head of the lane and took second later yards. MANNY TOO was forced in entering the first turn then roughed off the inside flank of Im The Director half way
through the turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened the final sixteenth. DIRECT APPEAL settled
off the pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. BABY BOSS ALLEN settled well back
inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and passed some rivals in the lane.
TOODLESWASMYNAME rounded the first turn about the six path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the far
turn and showed little in the lane. JACK'S ALOHA raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and weakened in the lane. OUR BRIGHTEST STAR checked off the inside flank of Manny Too into the first turn then angled to the four path and was
shuffled back at the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. JOHN'S
NOTION raced in tight quarters early and was forced out into the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but faded
into the far turn. BULL RIDER showed little response through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed an objection against the rider of Im The Director for
interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Manny Too, and disqualified the former to third place for that infraction.

PLAY IT LOUD raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, rallied to the lead four wide past the quarter pole and dug in determinedly to inch
clear. CATALINA EXPRESS rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the first turn and dueled through the backstretch, was met at the rail
leaving the quarter pole and dueled gamely to late stretch before ceding; reluctantly. RAMSEY rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the
chase past the half mile pole but lost momentum off the heels of Catalina Express at the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the
lane. ORANGE JUICE raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and passed some rivals.
YANGARRA stalked two deep while between horses, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and remained a factor to the middle of the far turn before
weakening. LET'S EAT saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded while losing ground on the far turn.
ANNA'S GOT STYLE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. PROSPECTIVE
LOVE stalked from the three path the first turn, dueled at even terms into the backstretch then weakened three wide on the far turn.
