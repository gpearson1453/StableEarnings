Footnotes
GOLDEN AFTERNOON pressed the pace three wide and in between rivals, made a bid to be clear off the turn, then widened the margin to prove best
under a drive. DON'T BACKDOWN was well placed on the inside behind the contested pace early, made a two wide bid leaving the quarter pole and ran on
to the wire being clearly second best. CRYSTAL HILL lunged at the start, settled in the back, three wide by the quarter pole and moved out in the lane and
improved late to best the rest. PACK A LUNCH was reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane and offered a belated rally. JOHNY'S RENDEZVOUS
prompted the pace on the outside and was five wide off the turn and weakened. DOM TRACES was settled early, two wide by the quarter pole and had no
rally. HOTLINE BLINK pressed the pace three to four wide in between rivals, moved out leaving the turn and tired. BOLD COMFORT set a pressured pace
on the inside and gave way. BILDERBERG was outrun and was not a factor.

turn to gain a short lead but was out-kicked to the wire and lost the place award late while saving the show award. INFINITE DIAMOND was well placed on
the inside, waited for room nearing the bend, then tipped out two wide and made a bid but needed more late. SARA MIA was settled back early, saved
ground on the far turn, cut the corner leaving the bend, angled out by the furlong marker and had a belated rally. THISNAMEISOKAY showed good speed
on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the turn but weakened in the drive. MAXISUPERFLY was settled early and lacked a rally. ROSA was off a step
slow, four wide on the turn and was not a threat. MOON RAY (FR) tracked the pace three wide on the turn and came five wide off the bend and tired.

Footnotes
BALLERINA D'ORO was off a step slow, settled back and was two wide on the turn, split rivals by the three sixteenths, then moved out and closed while
green through the final furlong but got up in time to prove best, driving. TAKE NOTE OF THIS showed good early speed to vie for the early lead, then
relented and was rated back while saving ground, cut the corner and then tipped out and made a two wide bid, gained command inside the furlong grounds
but was denied late to just miss. BIG AIR vied for the early lead, then went on to set the pace while racing in the two path, drew clear leaving the turn but
weakened the final sixteenth while besting the rest. OCEAN RIPPLE was off slowly, then moved to the inside and made a mild two wide bid leaving the turn
but flattened out late while clearly securing the last spot in the superfecta. CHAMPAGNE ON ICE was void of early speed, three wide by the quarter pole
and improved position late. ARE YOU A SPY chased the pace and was on the inside on the turn and tired. GODDAUGHTER chased the pace and was two
wide on the turn and tired. MIDNIGHT IN AUSTIN was settled on the inside, moved out on the turn, came wide off the turn and had no rally. MO ICE
FORTHE LADY stalked the pace three wide and then was empty in the drive. LOB was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole while being no threat.
HEART'S COMPASS showed good early speed before steadying by the three quarter marker and then moved out to be three to four wide on the turn and
tired. MARGARITA BLUEBIRD dropped back.

Footnotes
TIZTASTIC was settled early, two to four wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn by the quarter pole to make a bid, then dueled with WEST BEACH
through the furlong grounds and prevailed late to prove best under a drive. WEST BEACH was well rated and saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid
leaving the quarter pole, dueled with the winner but missed. READY FOR PEACE was settled early and moved in to be two wide, then got thru on the inside
by the furlong marker to make a bid but needed more late, bested rest. COAL BATTLE was reluctant to load, settled back early, three wide on the turn,
angled wide in the lane and had a belated rally. THE BRIGADE was reserved early, three wide on the turn, five wide by the quarter pole and improved
position late. TURNBUCKLE was off slowly and bumped at the start, trailed on the turn and then passed the tiring rivals. I'M OTTER HERE set a pressured
pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the turn by the quarter pole but weakened. REACH FOR THE ROSE was allowed to settle early, saved ground on
the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no rally. EMMETT was bumped at the break and had no rally. KIRIN tracked the pace two to three
wide and then was empty in the drive. MIKA pressed the pace three wide and tired. FORGED STEEL chased the pace two wide and tired.

SHEZAFUNKYDRUMMER broke flat footed and then rushed up to vie for the lead three wide, then was two wide on the turn and made a bid to assume
command and move to the inside leaving the turn, then came out nearing the sixteenth marker three paths and then corrected and came back in and was
caught late. ABIENTOT was settled early on, then made a five wide move on the turn, then continued that move and was gaining late but needed more.
CIVETTA was well placed two wide, in between rivals on the turn, then made a three wide bid in the lane but had to steady when the leader came out into
path and faded late. GIVE LIFE vied for the lead on the inside, then was rated back while on the rail, then lacked room by the furlong marker and then
steadied by the sixteenth marker and had no kick. SHE'S ALL CHARM steadied early on the inside, then settled into stride on the inside, moved out and
swung out six wide by the quarter pole, made a bid but was trying to lug in by the furlong marker and hung. COTILLARD chased the pace three wide and

Footnotes
MAY DAY READY was rated along two wide, between rivals by the five sixteenths, swung out four wide leaving the turn and closed well to draw clear late to
prove best under a drive. BELLAVININO was close up early on the inside, then rated off the pace on the inside on the turn, was boxed by the five sixteenths
and blocked in the lane, angled out and finally got room around the sixteenth marker and was up for the place ward. SHE'S GOT WILL had outside pursuit
early, made a four wide bid off the turn and vied for command by the furlong marker but hung late losing the place award on the wire. MEAN EILEEN set a
pressured pace two wide early, then shook clear and moved to the inside then was headed by the furlong marker and faded late. SASHAY AWAY was off
slowly, settled back early towards the inside, angled out in the lane and had a late rally. SOMETHINABOUTHER chased the pace three wide, came five
wide by the quarter pole and weakened. TIGERISH was settled back early, swung wide for the drive and passed the tiring rivals. BONNE FILLE was well
rated on the inside under a nice hold but when roused weakened. FLIP FLOPS was reserved early and lacked a rally. SORRY NOT SORRY was settled
early and lacked the needed rally. INTO THE FRAY prompted the pace three to two wide and tired. PLAYFUL LASS checked after the start and was not a
factor.

BRILLIANT BERTI was reserved early and three wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn by the quarter pole, made a bid and was given a pop left
handed with the crop by the furlong marker and responded well to edge clear and remained clear to the wire to prove best. HERCHEE was well placed on
the inside, blocked leaving the turn by the quarter pole, split rivals by the three sixteenths to make a bid but was out-kicked by the winner in a game effort.
NEAT was reserved early on the outside, came six wide by the quarter pole, then rallied well but needed more. IN A JAM was allowed to settle early, two
wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid but flattened out late, held on to the last spot in the superfecta. DEPICTION was
bumped at the start, reserved early and made it to the inside on the turn, eased out on the turn, came five wide off the turn and steadied slightly leaving the
quarter pole, then once clear and had a late rally. LUCKY JEREMY tracked the pace and made a three wide bid but faded in the final furlong. KENTUCKY
GO GO passed the tiring rivals. ARMY OFFICER was settled on the inside and weakened. KARLWITHANARL was not a threat. ASPENITE pressed the
pace and made a two wide bid to vie for command in between rivals but then was empty. DRUNK ON SAKE set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
BORN FLASHY prompted the early pace on the outside, made a four wide bid in hand leaving the turn, then was roused by the furlong marker and
responded well, then switched back to the left lead while clear to prove best. BALTHAZAR was settled early, three to four wide on the turn, six wide by the
quarter pole and made a bid to loom boldly nearing the furlong marker, but could not sustain that bid while saving the place award. RESEARCH RESULTS
was settled early between rivals, two to three wide on the turn, then made a bid and finished well to just miss the place award while besting the rest.
TIMETOMAKEMISCHIEF vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the final furlong. AINT NO JOKE was bumped after the start, reserved early, six
wide by the quarter pole and offered a mild late kick. INCURSION was void of early speed, cut the corner off the turn and passed the tiring rivals. GUN
BARREL chased the pace on the inside and then checked entering the turn, then moved out in the lane and had no rally. THUNDER APPEAL was reserved
early and failed to menace. LONGISLAND LORENZO chased the pace and was five wide by the quarter pole and weakened. DADDY'S DINERO tracked
the pace and was two wide by the quarter pole and tired. NA PALI JOE was bumped after the start, four wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. INDY
