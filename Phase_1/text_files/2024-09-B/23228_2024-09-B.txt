STYLISH MANNER hopped in the air at the start then was five-wide on the first turn, allowed to settle angling to the inside, saved ground, slipped through
entering the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win drawing clear. THUNDER BALL hopped at the start, then moved up between horses to be
forwardly placed while racing two-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner while proving second best. ENJOY THE
MOMENT prompted the issue while three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. PAKAS SECRET was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. WAITINGATTHEBAR saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and tired.

THE GOLDEN EGG set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, responded during the drive and edged clear late. FED GRANT was forwardly placed
while racing three-wide, moved up to engage THE GOLDEN EGG at the quarter pole, dueled with that one to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough.
GRAMMY WINNER was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. WIREWYRE was close-up early racing two-wide, angled out
to be four-wide entering the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR vied with THE GOLDEN EGG for the lead into the stretch
and weakened. SUBITO SLEW was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and gave way.

slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. EMPEROROFTHENORTH broke in the air then moved up along the outside to dispute the pace, was
tree-wide entering the stretch, came out slightly to bump with HAPPY DOES nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly in a good effort. NATION OF
FAITH was allowed to settle while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. WESTPHAL dropped back early, came three-wide
into the stretch and was not a factor. THE STEWARD CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS OF HAPPY DOES, WINTER FALCON AND
EMPEROFTHENORTH IN THE STRETCH AND THE JOCKEY OF EMPEROFTHENORTH ALSO LODGED AN OBJECTION BUT AFTER VIEWING THE
FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS CONTACT BUT THAT IT DID NOT AFFECT THE ORDER OF FINISH SO MADE NO CHANGE.

ELDER MACK saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when headed by JIN TONG nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that one to the wire
and prevailed under strong handling. JIN TONG saved ground stalking the pace, angled out three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, moved up to gain a
slight lead nearing the eighth pole then dueled with ELDER MACK from that point and just missed in a game try. FANTASTIC DAY was unhurried early,
came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. MONGOLIAN MEMORY prompted the pace while racing two-wide to the stretch and tired.
