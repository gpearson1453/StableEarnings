seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside of a rival while inside on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead to MOSIENKO near the
quarter-pole, dueled inside that foe into the final furlong then regained the advantage and moved clear in the final sixteenth to prevail. MOSIENKO broke a
step slow, moved up on the outside under some urging, gained leaving the backstretch then made a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the two path on
the turn, took a narrow advantage near the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner into the final furlong then lost the lead back to that foe and was

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG hustled from the gate, ranged up to be in close aim of the early leader before taking over just inside six furlongs to run, showed the way in
hand along the inside patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, drew off under a drive to prevail.

SCREEN chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show
honors. TABEGUACHE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BLAZING SEVENS chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. MAKER'S CANDY broke out at the start under coaxing bumping INSTANT COFFEE, established
the front shortly after the break and briefly showed the way until displaced just inside six furlongs remaining, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CURBSTONE chased along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. UNBRIDLED BOMBER chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no rally. INSTANT COFFEE got bumped at the start by MAKER'S CANDY,
who broke outwards, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WINIT chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. LOST ARK chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
SASSY ALLIE broke out at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, battled gamely in the stretch and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. BETTA GO GO GO came outward at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two then three path,
came five wide into the stretch then moved further out, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while up for the place. REVEREND
MOON bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid while three wide on the turn, battled outside of two foes in the stretch
and missed while just able to get the place. BE THERE broke out at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail
outside the quarter-pole and finished with good energy to just miss the trifecta. GENERAL AGENT broke a bit slow then dropped back quickly while taken
up off heels with the left-rein, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to threaten. EL ALACRAN showed
speed then disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, raced between horses passing the five-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. NILRUC was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced in the three path on the turn, came out into the stretch
and was no factor. JOHN THE BAPTIST settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn and failed to rally. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE bumped
with a rival at the start, raced at the rear, saved ground on the turn and also was no factor. LIBERTE DE BAYEUX settled on the outside, was roused four
wide on the turn and failed to respond.
