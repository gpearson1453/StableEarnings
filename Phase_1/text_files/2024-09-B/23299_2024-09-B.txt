two wide on the far turn but was no threat. MISTY MOOD was unhurried early then failed to menace. ANGEL IN THE AIR was unhurried early then was no
threat. MY BUTTERFLY set the early pace, drew off on the backstretch but was used up then gave way. MIDSHIPMAN'S LADY raced three wide on the
backstretch then made a bid on the far turn, was in between rivals in mid stretch and squeezed then faltered. FUNNY STREET was through after a half then
stopped. This race was originally scheduled to be run with turf rail at twenty feet at an about distance, but was instead run with the rail set to zero feet and
as an exact distance. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
