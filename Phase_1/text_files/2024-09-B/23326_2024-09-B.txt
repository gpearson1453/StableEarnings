Footnotes
ELEANOR RIGBY stalked the pace from the inside, got through at the rail in upper stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and and inched ahead.
DIAMONDS N THRILLS hopped at the start, tracked the pace four wide, gained outside of foes in the lane but was outkicked by the winner. BLINGING
BURR set the pace in the two path and yielded between foes near the sixteenth pole. FULL EXCHANGE raced off the early pace three wide, went five wide
around the far turn and could only gain mildly in the lane. CORAL DREAM saved ground off the pace, was ridden along in the three path rounding the far
turn and lacked the needed rally. WHODOYOULIKEHERE prompted the pace in the three path and weakened through the stretch. JOJO'S GONE failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. MOR DREAMS trailed while racing well off the rail.

Footnotes
VENEZUELA IS GOLD was prompted from up close in the two path, ridden along the inside around the turn, bid from the two path at the top of the lane, and
inched clear. CALL ME A CAB showed the way along the inside, was cued from the two path early around the turn, floated out to the three path turning into
the stretch, and was outkicked by an inner foe to place. OJIN stalked in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, swung from the five path turning
into the lane, and finished evenly to show. ADIOS BUSTER had a slow start, rated in the two path early but had to check along the rail entering the turn,
angled out to the six path under a drive in upper stretch, but made no impact. SKULL HONOR chased in the three path but never threatened. MAXCHERO
always trailed.

Footnotes
PUTMAN pressed the pace two wide, reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire and narrowly prevailed. SOUPER SUNSHINE had his
head turned at the start, set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner through the final sixteenth and lost the bob. MR. AMERICAN broke out and
bumped FORT ATTITUDE at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied for the show. FORT ATTITUDE was bumped at the start then in
tight, trailed inside early, angled four wide midway around the turn, floated wider turning for home and had a slight gain widest in the lane. CALYPSO
CHARLIE stalked the pace three wide and faded in the drive. GRAND MAXIME hit the starting gate and was always outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
ETRURIAN bumped between foes at the start, set the pace in the two path, received right handed cues while floating out to the four path turning into the
lane, and kicked on to hold sway. SUPER FREAKY GIRL broke in and bumped an inner foe, prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed in the two path
midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. NEXT RIGHT THING bumped between foes at the start,
chased in the three path, was roused in the four path midway around the turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, and kept on to be up for show.
ROSCOE VILLAGE stalked in the three path, tipped out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. DEFLECTION laid in
range in the two path, waited around the turn before being roused passing the quarter, but flattened in the stretch. TINKI ABARRIO trailed in the three path,
floated out to the five path midway around the turn, then went very wide out to the ten path turning into the lane, and never threatened. WELCOME BACK
bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace inside and never menaced.

Footnotes
SHE'S OUTTA HERE set a pressured pace in the two path, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and dug in. FOXY LADY prompted the pace
four wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, had aim throughout the lane, was gaining late but could not get by. IDEAL BREEZE
bumped at the start, raced up close inside, steadied near the three-eighths pole, had room inside of the winner throughout the stretch but was unable to
seriously gain. TROTTING GEAR had her head turned at the start, raced far back inside, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. BARBARA raced
off the pace two wide, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. MACASSA hit the starting gate, pressed the winner in
the three path and tired in the drive. JUST TAKE NOTES bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened.
