Footnotes
BRAD'S SWEETHEART tracked leader outside, dug in to take over outside in mid stretch, drew out. MARY WHO opened up early, short clear lead stretch,
gave best while giving way in mid stretch. JUST A POSE steadied mildly early, stalked four-wide, finished well, just missed the place. BITS OF LEMON
DROP saved ground, lacked rally. HIGHLANDER HONEY hesitated at the break, well back early, advanced off rail turn. WOKE JOKE broke outwards,
dropped back, showed little. DAISYSADOOZY, well placed inside, faded stretch.
