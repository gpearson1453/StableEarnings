drive. TEMPERED STORM was quickest to the turn, dueled in the stretch and outfinished. SPIRIT CHASER hustled inside and lacked a closing response.
HOPE SHINES saved ground early and offered a late mild bid. ONEMOREFORTHEROAD failed to threaten.

CALI CONQUEST attended the pace from the rail, gained an advantage into the backstretch, was overtaken by DON'T STOP DREAMIN in the far turn,
rallied inside into the stretch regaining control and held firm late. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR trailed early, took closer order along the rail when leaving the
backstretch, swung four wide in the final turn, closed well late and missed. DON'T STOP DREAMIN fanned three wide leaving the opening turn, sat in
striking distance while four wide, moved up to takeover leaving the backstretch, but came up empty in for the drive. RUNNINFORCOVER was unable to
improve position. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR attended the early pace between foes, was unable to keep pace with the field and tired. JOKER MATT fanned
four wide leaving the first turn, and tired early.

Footnotes
MONOPOLIZE broke outward into RECIO'S SKYE, tracked from the two path, waited in traffic into the final turn, angled out four wide then drifted in
midstretch, and won going away. JODEYS LIL PAIN sat just off the pace while three wide, moved up alongside DIAMOND DI entering the final turn to
challenge the front, was crowded midstretch between foes, and edged clear late to prove second best. DIAMOND DI quickly went to the front, was joined by
JODEYS LIL PAIN in the final turn, and weakened late stretch. RECIO'S SKYE bumped leaving the gate, tracked outside while four wide, circled wide at the
head of the stretch, and rallied belatedly. ANNAMARIA fanned three wide into the opening turn, pressed while four wide through the backstretch, was
unable to move on with rivals and lodged a late bid. CROWN OF CAIRO was not a factor.

SPRINGS steadied in the turn, rallied late and just missed. MYSTIC SALLY was steadied inside, and dropped back. WORTHY SPIRIT offered little.

Footnotes
SADIE MY LADY was quickest to the turn, showed the way into the frontside, remained unchallenged in the backstretch, opened up through the stretch and
was wrapped up late. ALBERTA reserved off the early pacesetters, chased four wide leaving the backstretch, and showed interest late. EL
CORRECAMINOS unhurried early, checked into the opening turn, chased along the rail into the stretch, and held show. KARDINAL ROSE stalked the early
pace while two wide, chased the leader through the far turn, and wilted. TENDER LOVE bumped leaving the gate, chased four wide through the
backstretch, and improved late. WICKED WIZZY fanned three wide into the opening turn, and faded. SMOKIN JOY reluctant to load then unseated the rider
behind the gate, loaded without the rider, was four wide into the opening turn, and tired along the rail. EVERYTHING TO GAIN broke out into TENDER
LOVE, trailed, and failed to threaten.
