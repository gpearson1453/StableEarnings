on gamely. MITHQAAL raced mid pack, rallied into the turn, bid six wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and was outfinished in game effort.
DUBRONSKY vied to deep stretch, yielded grudgingly and held safely for show. CHARLIE'S GHOST vied to the upper stretch and was unable to sustain his
bid. PLEASE THE COURT lagged early in a wide trip and finished well to improve position. NUMEROLOGIST advanced to the turn, went seven wide
entering the stretch and lacked a rally. STRYDER was in tight and bumped entering the turn, went eight wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid.
AWESOME STORM was in tight and bumped entering the turn, dropped inside and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
TIME IS PRECIOUS pressed the pace, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and wore down her rivals to get up late. I WIN LIKA GIRL set a
pressured pace to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. IT'S SAUL RIGHT veered in at the start, was never far back, went wide in the drive,
closed under mild urging and got up near the wire for show. SHE HIT A HOMER pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, vied to late stretch,
hung and lost position. BASIC was slow early, found her best stride late and gained ground. MISS LUCKY LADY bumped and was crowded at the start, was
void of early speed and improved position in an even effort. OUR SOARING ANGEL broke out and bumped at the start and failed to threaten in a wide trip.
ELDORADO DREAM got away well and was checked after the start, pressed the pace along the rail and gave way on the turn. SIERRA SUMMER bumped
and was crowded at the start and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BROADWAY DISH set a pressured pace, drew off into the stretch for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. WHATWASTHENISNOW rallied on the
turn, bid inside, closed well, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. BRAND LOYALTY stalked the pace, was carried out leaving the turn,
closed steadily and got up for show while no threat to the top two. ROSE GIRL pressed the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, leveled off and was
outfinished for third. FIFTY STARS was void of early speed, saved ground and lacked a bid. THE MUSIC WE MAKE was not a factor. ACES OVER
DEUCES raced close to the pace towards the outside, swung wide leaving the turn, stopped and was not urged late.

Footnotes
COPPER COASTLINE broke out, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, dueled to late stretch and drew off under strong urging.
BART SIP SOME broke out, set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel, was no match late and held safely for place. CANDY'S CHROME
shied from his rival at the start and veered out, raced mid pack towards the outside, put in a steady effort and was gaining late. GOLDEN GREEK was slow
early, swung wide leaving the turn, closed well and didn't have enough late. LEVON bumped at the start, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, fell back and
finished evenly. LOVESUNFAIR stalked the pace in an inside trip, weakened in the drive and faded from contention. RIGHT IN FRONT broke out, raced in
close early and lacked a stretch response. HARD TO FORGET hesitated and broke slowly, put in an even effort and failed to threaten.
THREECARDMONTE bumped at the start and was outrun.
