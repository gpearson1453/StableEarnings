Footnotes
NORTHERN TICK TOCK rated forwardly inside and then about two wide, eased out leaving the far turn and bid three deep near the five sixteenths, surged
clear into the lane then eagerly widened under a steady hand ride. GOOD KNIGHT NILE , under firm rating saving ground just off the lead, bid between
rivals leaving the three eighths, chased the winner from the head of the stretch and kept on with effort to save the place. SELASSIE settled three wide in mid
pack, was forced out to about the six path leaving the far turn, circled five to six wide for the drive and finished with good energy. RAPPER ZAPPER , three
wide tracking the pace, was carried out to the five path exiting the far turn, dropped in a bit for the drive and churned on between runners. MASTER OF
NONE , unhurried early while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, stayed inside and offered a mild run. FLASH IS BACK hopped at the break to be
away last, settled off the inside, knifed his way between horses leaving the far turn, took closer order approaching the stretch then flattened out. SUPER E
saved ground, edged up some near the five sixteenths, angled three wide but failed to sustain. OMAR COMIN took over early, set the pace towards the
inner rail, was joined by outer rivals near the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , four wide early,
failed to menace. BEE MAJOR prompted the pace outside the leader, bobbled nearing the far turn, carried out foes when taken wide soon after, was pulled
up, walked off the turf course then was transported off the main track by the equine ambulance.

soon after the break and gained a stalking spot, pursued the winner while saving ground into the lane, raced on his left lead inside the furlong marker and
saved the place. BAND TOUR , bumped around leaving the gate, regrouped and rated towards the inside, angled four wide for the drive and kept on with
some interest. NORTHERN CARDINAL broke on top and showed speed, ceded the lead to the winner nearing the half, stayed on to chase outside a rival,

GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) settled three to four wide in mid pack, gathered momentum leaving the far turn, circled four wide with continued progress into the
stretch, emerged as the closest pursuer of WISH ME HOME leaving mid stretch, kept on doggedly under a drive and wore that one down to be up in the
final yards. WISH ME HOME rated three wide outside a rival, moved up near the half, engaged the leader leaving the three eighths, took over about a
quarter mile from home, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch, dug in when collared near the sixteenth pole, dueled inside the winner and grudgingly
ceded near the wire. STREET COPPER rated off the inside while not far back, swung four wide into the stretch then closed in steadily outside the top pair
despite drifting out. GREY STREAK , unhurried early while removed from the inside, angled five to six wide for the drive and offered a mild run. FUN LOVIN
CRIMINAL saved ground off the pace, worked outward in upper stretch, advanced between foes near the sixteenth marker then flattened out. SAMUI
SUNSET rated in range while saving ground, lightly steadied off of a retreating foe leaving the far turn, eased out and faded. IN THE DANCE failed to
menace. DARK AND FITZY went clear early then was keyed up widening into the backstretch, settled better past the five eighths, dug in when confronted
exiting the fasr turn, battled to the head of the lane then weakened in the final furlong. VON HOFF prompted the pace, edged up two wide nearing the half,
failed to go on past the three eighths and weakened.

Footnotes
ISABELLA'S GLORY stayed along the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch and into the turn, moved to the two path mid way on the bend, took
command outside BOUND BY DESTINY near the three sixteenths pole then drew out under steady handling. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE broke slowly, saved
ground on the turn, eased off the rail entering the stretch, worked between horses in upper stretch, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. BOUND
BY DESTINY rushed up to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gradually faded in the stretch drive. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN lacked speed, saved
ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. MARLEY'S GHOST , four wide on the turn, had a mild move to upper
stretch then weakened. COAL MINE raced between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DATE NIGHT KISSES chased the pace and gave
way on the turn. DIVINE ROMANCE , three wide chasing the pace for five furlongs, faltered.

STORMY FLIGHT edged up outside rivals early, was urged along chasing the duelers past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane, surged clear
under a drive past the three sixteenths, eagerly opened up and was kept alert to deep stretch. THE WARDEN broke a step slow then was bumped in the
opening furlong, regrouped and moved up outside a foe leaving the far turn, entered the lane two to three wide, progressed between runners through the
final furlong and finished with good energy to be clearly second best. SINETIC , bumped and pinched back soon after the break, steadied in the opening
furlong, dropped back to last and rated behind rivals leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive, dropped back in some, bumped with an inner rival working
between horses leaving the sixteenth pole and rallied. ROLL ON JESSE broke slowly, had a wide trip and finished with interest. GREY FLANNEL BOSS
saved ground, eased out in upper stretch, bumped with an outer rival near the sixteenth pole and churned on. SUMMERINTHECOUNTRY had speed then
steadied off foes near the half, chased, drifted out fading late and steadied in the final yards. GO TO BINGO , three wide early, bid outside the leader mid
turn, sparred into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. MYLUCKEYVALENTINE , bumped at the break, altered out late. CORRELATION , bumped
at the break, rushed up inside and cleared into the turn, was joined mid turn, battled into the lane then weakened nearing the sixteenth pole. HONORS DUE
was shuffled back early. An objection by the rider of GREY FLANNEL BOSS against SINETIC for interference in the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
MAXIMATCH broke inward brushing a foe, corrected and sped clear, dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when set down soon into the lane, widened
nearing mid stretch the held well while kept to a drive. IKE'S GAMBLE , brushed by the winner leaving the gate, was taken to rate two wide and within
range, dropped in past the quarter and cut the corner into the stretch, advanced inside rivals near mid stretch and continued gamely. CHEVY MAN rated
three wide, angled six wide with momentum into the stretch, straightened to advance outside rivals past mid stretch and continued on willingly to bridge the
gap. LUCKY PRINCE prompted the pace two wide, was ridden along between rivals nearing the stretch, shifted out some in the drive and kept on with effort
between foes. HALLELUJAH HARRIS gained a tracking position along the inner rail around the first turn, was under some nudging to hold position into the
far turn, eased out for the drive but failed to muster up a solid finish. STOW ON THE WOLD , bumped at the start, was taken to rate while saving ground,
worked outward for room while advancing past the three sixteenths, bumped with an outer rival soon after then steadied with some run behind foes late.
COCKTAILS AT NOON unseated his rider when fractious behind the gate, sat off the pace while saving some ground, angled out in the drive, was bumped
and steadied leaving mid stretch and churned on. COLLATOR , four to five wide with pursuit, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch, steadied when in close
soon after and faded. NO FOOLIN MO , four wide, failed to respond. WORK HARD , awkward from the gate, lagged off the pace, saved ground into the
stretch and failed to menace.
