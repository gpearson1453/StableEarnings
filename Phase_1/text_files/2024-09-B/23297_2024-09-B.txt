Footnotes
PRETTY LILY raced in closest pursuit of the leader, drew away after half a mile and never menaced. JESS'S MOMENT trailed far behind then finished with
good energy too late. DIXIE MUSIC lagged far back off the leaders and advanced inside with good rally. SUNNY SIDE UP quickly sprinted away, was
collared after half a mile and gave way. TAN PAM flashed speed inside then stopped abruptly. PELOSI chased within range off the pace and faded.
MUCHO MISSTIQUE was scratched at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

DAD'S ON A ROLL stalked the pace, bid outside on the final turn and drew away in the stretch under moderate urging. WIZARD SERRAT steadied along
on the first turn, swung wide into the stretch and closed well. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE hustled to the lead inside, was collared at the quarter pole and
weakened. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY dropped well behind then made up ground without menacing. INDIRECTLY rated off the pace outside and lacked solid
rally. TWIXTER stumbled at the start, rushed up inside then gave way. HIBACHI prompted the pace for half a mile and faltered. SENSIBLE JIM dropped far
behind and was never in contention. THE TWINS SNEAKERS chased wide and gave way readily.

ROYAL UPSTART controlled the pace, was never threatened and remained clear all the way driving. SPANISH GIRL chased the winner throughout and
continued willingly to the finish. GO CHLOE GO chased wide, lacked a rally but lasted for the show. NAPOLITAN broke slowly, raced inside and was no
factor. ALI'S JERSEY GIRL flashed speed then weakened steadily. KEYSTORMRISING stumbled badly at the start unseating her rider.

outside, led briefly on the final turn and continued gamely to the finish. DIXIE GROOVE trailed for half a mile then finished well while no threat to the top
pair. BUNNY BONUS lacked speed, advanced in the two path then flattened out. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA reserved off the pace and failed to sustain rally.

inside for nearly half a mile and weakened. EVASIVE MOVES trailed for half mile inside and was never a factor. HAIZUM raced within range wide for half
