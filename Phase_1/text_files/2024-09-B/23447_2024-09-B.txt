STARSCAPE vied for the lead with J J'S RANGER from along the inside, responded when asked and gradually drew clear. J J'S RANGER vied with
STARSCAPE for the lead from along the outside, was unable to match strides with that one late but finished well for second. MAJOR MACK was
prominently placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PHENOMENAL DREAM settled in the back early,
came three-wide into the stretch and rallied late. ROPE A DOPE saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked the needed late response. LATTA
was reserved off the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. GOOD NEWS ROCKET settled in the middle of the field early, came
four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PUCKSTER was allowed to settle early, raced two-wide on the turn and failed to seriously threaten. COWBOY
LUKE was close-up early racing the inside, steadied repeatedly nearing the half mile pole in traffic then saved ground and tired. LUCKYASIWONSWAS
dropped back early and was not a factor. DIAMOND LORD was shuffled back early from between horses then settled in the middle of the field and gave
way after a half mile.

Footnotes
THE PRINCE'S SPUR was reserved off the early place, rallied two-wide into the stretch, split BLACK POWDER and SAINT IN THE CITY nearing the
three-sixteenths pole then took the lead approaching the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. BLACK POWDER tracked the early leaders, moved up
three-wide nearing the quarter pole, responded during the drive and finished well for second in a good effort. ONTHESTAGE settled in the back early, came
six-wide into the stretch and rallied late. FURIOUS ANGER saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and finished well in a steady effort. OUR DREAM RYE'D was four-wide on the first turn while being reserved off the pace, then angled in on the backstretch,
swung out to be four-wide nearing the stretch but lacked a rally. SAINT IN THE CITY set the pace racing off the rail under early pressure from I'M YOU
MAN, opened a clear lead after a halt mile then set the pace into the stretch and gave way readily when headed. I'M YOUR MAN prompted SAINT IN THE
CITY for a half mile from along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
RIGHTEOUS STAR was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, responded when asked and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. LORD
BARANOF saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged y SUNNY MAGIC on the turn, opened a clear nearing the eighth pole but was
unable to resist the winner in a game effort. CAPO LUCA saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and
rallied late. SUNNY MAGIC stalked LORD BARANOF racing two-wide, moved up to challenge that one nearing the half mile pole, disputed the issue to the
stretch but was unable to stay with that one then was bumped by MORALLY nearing the eighth pole and needed more late. MORALLY saved ground
chasing the pace, slipped through during the drive, came out nearing the eighth pole to bmp SUNNY MAGIC and then weakened late. PENEI was shuffled
back shortly after the start then settled in the back of the field, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. SKIP FACTOR saved
ground while being unhurried and failed to be a factor while dead-heating with SKATER for seventh. SKATER bobbled shortly after the start then dropped
back, came two-wide into the stretch and ended up on even terms with SKIP FACTOR for seventh while failing to menace.

three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and weakened. FORMAGGIO saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and tired. HEREFORAGOODTIME

Footnotes
SENIOR OFFICER was unhurried early, angled out to come six-wide into the stretch and was up with a rush in the final strides. TRUST ISSUES vied with
GOOD LORD for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off nearing the eighth pole but was unable to hold off the winner late in a game effort. I'M
MCDREAMY was reserved early, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. GOOD LORD vied for the lead from along the inside into the stretch
and held on well during the drive in a steady effort. UNCLE WILLIAM prompted the early pace while three-wide, angled in slightly nearing the quarter pole
but lacked a rally. DU MONDE settled in the back of the field early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. SNOOK was allowed to
settle early, came seven-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. ROWDY RIOT settle in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch
but failed to be a factor. SHORTSTOP was reserved off the pace, came two-wide into the stretch then was forced to steady nearing the eighth pole running
up on horses and finished willingly when clear. BLUE LINE was close-up early racing along the inside, came two-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
FLY J'S FUNTASTIC was prominently placed while racing two-wide and tired during the drive. HALFWAY JOKING was forwardly placed while racing
four-wide to the stretch and gave way.
