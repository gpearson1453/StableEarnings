MORE THAN WORK prompted the pace outside, bid clear nearing the eighth pole, drifted in slightly and held on gamely. MT SURIBACHI set a pressured
pace, lost the lead in the stretch, steadied slightly, angled out and came again in a determined effort. CASTAGNO saved ground close up to the stretch,
moved out and finished well. HOKU squeezed back at the start, dropped back then offered some late energy. AMERICAN UNITY stalked the pacesetters
outside, bid on the final turn then came up empty in the stretch. WE READY settled off the leaders inside and lacked a rally. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL trailed
early, raced wide and was no factor. SHPILKES lacked speed and faded far behind his field. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for
interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
GREENER PASTURES close up inside, awaited room on the final turn, split foes into the stretch and held on gamely. RUNYONESQUE moved strongly four
wide on the final turn, brief stretch lead but hung. ROMAN EMPIRE chased in midpack outside and closed well to capture show. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ)
prompted the pace, led narrowly at the quarter pole then faded in the stretch. KINGSVILLE saved ground early, moved out in the stretch and was no threat.
TYCOON set pressured pace inside then was finished after three quarters. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED settled off the pace inside and faltered.
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was urged close up three wide for half mile and gave way. SAINT MARCO trailed for three quarters and was always outrun.
SAILOR'S RETURN broke slowest and was never involved.
