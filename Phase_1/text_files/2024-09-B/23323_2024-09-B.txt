ROLL DEM BONES nearing the eighth pole and was fully extended to prevail narrowly in a prolonged drive. DENNARD saved ground while being
unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch then angled out to be three-wide nearing the sixteenths pole and finished fast to just miss. ROLL DEM
BONES saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved through along the inside to take a slight lead nearing the eighth pole and finished well to lose
narrowly in a game effort. NAPOLETANO was reserved off the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. BEAU MISCHIEF settled in the
middle of the pack, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. AIN'T NO SISSY was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked
