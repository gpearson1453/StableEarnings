BEL PENSIERO stalked close up two wide, commenced her bid nearing the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, responded when roused, finished
willingly and edged away from the runner up. BINGO'S BIRKIN stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, bid and
came up second best. MIA'S CRUSADE tracked on the inside, saved ground close up on the turn, rallied mildly in the two path in the stretch run and got
third. SUMMER'S COMIN steadied after the start, raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn, came wide into the stretch and rallied mildly outside.
DELIGHTFUL AVA raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. LET HER RUN set the pace on the inside, dueled with the
winner passing the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. CAPTURED DARLING raced off the pace between rivals and did not factor.

Footnotes
ROCKY SEAS stalked outside, bid three wide on the turn, led into the stretch, responded when roused and drew clear under urging. BAHAMIAN BABY was
bumped after the start and steadied back, settled in last, made a four wide run on the turn, rallied outside in the lane, tried the winner, then dug in to save
the place spot. I WANT RUFFLES was bumped after the start and steadied, raced off the pace, rallied four wide into the stretch, angled in and closed well
late inside. BABY CAKES chased inside, was forced to check when lacking room at the quarter pole, then closed belatedly. NEIGH JUDE was bumped after
the start, chased between rivals, chased on the turn, moved up three wide at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. QUIET DANCER chased the
pacesetter, bid between rivals entering the turn, dueled briefly and gave way. FANCY'S ROSEBUD away alertly to set the pace with a clear advantage,
dueled inside on the turn and gave way.
