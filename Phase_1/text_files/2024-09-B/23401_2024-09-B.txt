WILDWOOD DOROTHY encouraged to vie for the early lead, soon had the advantage, showed the way just off the inside, was asked again leaving the
bend then steadily opened up under urging in the lane. SPIRIT SMOKE without early speed, though urged along, waited for room behind WILDWOOD
DOROTHY through the turn, angled outside that one upper stretch, was no match for the latter but steadily pulled away for the place. DERBY DAY GOLD
moved to the inside early on and passed inside tired ones upper stretch. W W LAST HURRAH was hustled to press WILDWOOD DOROTHY from just
outside but began to yield before finishing a half mile. CUPID'S HOPE chased running widest and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TORTUGA ISLAND stalked the early speed while toward the outside, took the lead when allowed four wide on the turn then gradually opened up under
confident mild urging through the stretch. HER NAME WAS LOLA waited for a wider path along the rail in the early going, advanced from inside on the turn,
took over second as she loomed a threat midstretch, drew away for the place then could only just hold her position late. MISS DUTTON left the gate
somewhat slowly, moved outside early on, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, showed a willingness to run the last furlong, lugged in some in
the waning yards and came up short for second. LUCKSME disputed the pace just off the rail for a half mile, began to gradually yield leaving the turn,
angled outside TORTUGA ISLAND after entering the last furlong and continued to level off. TOO MUCH TUESDAY vied for the lead outside LUCKSME for
four furlongs, also began to yield as she floated out some leaving the bend, moved outside TORTUGA ISLAND upper stretch and continued to fade.
JERSEY GOLD pressed the early pace from between horses but faded after three furlongs.

FLASH CADILLAC hesitated, broke inward, bumped LUCKY MONICA, causing his rider to hit his saddle briefly, was urged along to stay close, angled in
entering the turn, progressed along the rail, angled outside QUALITY STORM upper stretch, was all out and got up in time. QUALITY STORM shared the
early lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, came off the rail some entering the stretch, lengthened command with little asking, put to
urging inside the last furlong, was outfinished but easily best of the others. LUCKY MONICA bumped from the rear at the break, disputed the pace three
wide, retreated on the turn, came into the lane from path four and battled outside TRICKY MOMENT for third to the wire. TRICKY MOMENT vied for the
lead from between rivals, did not keep up from just off the inside on the bend, altered out some when FLASH CADILLAC came out upper stretch, fought to
keep third thereafter but did not have enough in the waning yards. BLAKELY'S BOY was soon well back, saved ground and showed some interest in
running the final furlong. SPICY VALENTINA displayed early speed from outside but gave way widest on the turn. RECAUSE left the gate slowly and in a
trot, took a long time to find his running stride but finished the race and was walked off.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD POSSE forwardly placed behind the early speed, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned outside JULYNNE into the lane, dueled between
horses the last furlong and edged ahead in the final strides. JULYNNE raced in the second flight from outside, progressed outside GOLD OAK on the turn,
battled between horses for the lead inside the final eighth, was bumped a couple times by the latter nearing the sixteenth marker, had a slight lead in the
waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort. GHAALEB'S CITY was slow and a bit rank as she bore out when she left the gate, was soon under
control, stayed in path three on the turn, swung out widest at the top of the stretch, steadily closed the gap, fought for the lead the last sixteenth but did not
have the extra needed near the wire. CANTOO helped prompt the early pace from inside, angled out when her path was taken after two furlongs, retreated
while just off the inside on the turn, came into the lane behind GOLD OAK, altered inside that one upper stretch, dueled for the lead the final sixteenth but
also needed more in the waning yards. GOLD OAK shared the early lead just outside FREE LOVE, moved clear on the bend, floated out some entering the
stretch, began to wear down from between horses inside the last furlong, drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole, exchanging bumps with JULYNNE and
slowly yielded the last seventy yards. FREE LOVE displayed early speed just off the inside, moved to the rail after a quarter mile and began to fade before
finishing four furlongs. There was a stewards' inquiry into GHAALEB'S CITY'S start. It was determined she was prepared to break from the gate with the rest
but chose not to, so no action taken after their review.

IT'S ON broke inward, was without early speed, picked up her pace after two furlongs, came into contention along the rail on the turn, altered outside
HIGHLAND GIRL after entering the final furlong, continued her rally and got up at the wire. SKIP TO BALI pressed from outside, was four wide taking the
bend, edged to the lead upper stretch, moved clear of the rest inside the last eighth but was outfinished in a game effort. ZOEY ATTACK settled outside,
also commenced her bid after a quarter mile, improved position widest through the turn, came into the stretch outside SKIP TO BALI, gained third with a
sixteenth left but could only close the gap on the top pair in the late going. HIGHLAND GIRL hesitated then was forced to alter in at the break, moved up
quickly from inside to share the lead, drew clear along the rail after three furlongs, was challenged from outside leaving the bend and gradually wore down
through the stretch. HER SPEAKER'S ON broke on top, was soon chasing others from outside, gradually angled in on the backstretch, waited for room just
off the rail into the turn, gained a clear path just outside HIGHLAND GIRL midway on the bend then also flattened out for the drive. SNOW GLO was hustled
to dispute the pace from between horses, floated out some with three furlongs to go to brush with SKIP TO BALI and began to fade soon after.

ON THE MONEY RED a step slow at the break, moved up quickly to share the lead outside HAND OVER MY HEART, moved ahead on the bend, drew
clear when asked upper stretch, lengthened command inside the final furlong, was relaxed nearing the wire and held sway. DEVIL'S RULE without early
speed, was just off the inside on the turn, angled out some midstretch for a clear path, rallied belatedly, took over second eighty yards out and was closing
the gap on the lead nearing the wire. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC soon trailed, stayed well off the inside, moved to the rail on the bend, angled out widest upper
stretch and showed a willingness to run late. HAND OVER MY HEART vied for the early lead from inside, did not stay with ON THE MONEY RED on the
turn and flattened out along the rail the final furlong.

Footnotes
LAYTON THE DAY soon had the lead, showed the way in hand while just off the inside, was roused on the turn, floated out to path three entering the lane,
lengthened command under urging and held on under steady handling. FULL MAGAZINE was kept close just outside LAYTON THE DAY, also roused on
the bend, started drifting out under left-handed urging upper stretch, continued to gradually bear out when switched to right-handed pressure with a
sixteenth left, was closing the gap on the leader in the late going and proved clearly second best. ONE PUTT RICHIE in contention early between horses,
took the rail into the bend, battled for third in the stretch and edged ahead of CARL G for the show in the waning yards. CARL G advanced from outside on
the backstretch, angled in beside ONE PUTT RICHIE on the turn, fought to keep third in the lane but did not have enough left in the late going. TAPIT SAM
soon trailed, stayed off the inside, angled out widest at the top of the stretch and made up minor ground the last furlong. STAR OF KODIAK chased from
outside, improved position four wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane, altered out some upper stretch as FULL MAGAZINE came out, lacked a
rally, angled in after entering the final eighth and finished evenly. I'M YOUR VALENTINE was an early factor from inside, faded on the bend, swung out
nearing the end of four furlongs and had little to offer for the stretch run.
