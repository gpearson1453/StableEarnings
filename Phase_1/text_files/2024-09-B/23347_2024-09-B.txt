Footnotes
GOLDEN RIVER broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the
turn and set the pace off of the rail approaching the quarter pole, suffered a broken inside rein and lugged out in upper stretch, corrected past the furlong
marker and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, drew clear in the late stages and held sway at the finish. NOW THEN away in good order, rated off of
the moderate early pace and tracked outside of rivals heading to the half-mile pole, stalked three wide into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, was forced out in upper stretch by a drifting GOLDEN RIVER, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well for
second in deep stretch. I AM AMADEO stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, allowed to settle in the early running, mounted a four wide bid nearing
the quarter pole, needed more in the stretch drive, finished evenly and held safely in the end for third. KLINKERBRICK a step slow away from the start,
allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide along the turn, gained ground into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished for third. ELEGANT LIFE chased the moderate early pace from the inside, lost position along the turn and tired in the stretch drive. THERE WAS
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN UPPER STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT GOLDEN RIVER DRIFTED OUT AND
IMPEDED NOW THEN NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE AND COST THAT RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. GOLDEN RIVER
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
OH ANGEL allowed to settle after the break, moved to the rail when clear and saved ground through the clubhouse turn, advanced up the rail down the
backstretch, was up with the leaders near the three furlong marker then dropped back, re-rallied, slipped inside of the pacesetter near the quarter pole, took
command at the head of the stretch and finished best to prevail. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS settled at the back of the compact field. launched a sustained bid
after passing the half-mile mark, came three wide into the stretch, angled to the inside in mid-stretch, was kept to task and earned the place while no threat
to the winner. ACCLAIMED PREACHER was always close tracking RIVER OF AMBITION to the far turn, launched a bid for the lead passing the
five-sixteenths pole, loomed a threat in upper stretch and kept on under urging but could not find the needed response. RIVER OF AMBITION broke well
and was sent for the lead, got some mild pressure from ACCLAIMED PREACHER and to a lesser extent from OH ANGEL, led the field to the top of the
stretch then stopped and was not persevered with in the late stages. CONQUEST SECRET threw head up after the break then was a bit rank and raced
fairly close to the pace with a two wide trip, held position and tried to rally between horses going into the far turn, struggled to keep up approaching the
quarter pole and was outrun down the stretch. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT was close for a half-mile, dropped off the pace near the seven-sixteenths pole, was
taken in hand and galloped out to the wire.

GREATFUL ATTITUDE broke alertly, took back and tracked the moderate early pace four deep heading to the half-mile, was well placed approaching the
turn, chased five then four wide nearing the quarter marker, roused into the stretch, chased the leading pair approaching the furlong grounds, responded to
urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish. READY TO GIG prominent away from the start,
stalked the early pace outside of HOT JAMMIES, raced three wide into the turn, advanced to press the pace nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch
and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took a narrow lead past mid-stretch, was overtaken by the oncoming GREATFUL ATTITUDE in deep stretch and
held well for second at the finish. HOT JAMMIES sent to assume early command, set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into
the turn while off of the rail, set a pressured pace nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, grudgingly gave way in the final sixteenth and was clear
for third. UNION COACH took back off of the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn, rallied into the stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth
and finished evenly. ICY MISCHIEF a step slow leaving the start, rushed up and tracked the moderate early pace from between rivals, chased four wide into
the turn, lost position at the quarter pole and weakened. ABOVE THE FOLD unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the turn and did not factor in
the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RICH GOLD allowed to settle early, rated along the rail behind the pace under some restraint, began a steady bid with three furlongs to run then was
alongside SEA DOG at the top of the stretch, did battle with that stubborn foe the length of the stretch and won the bob at the line. SEA DOG broke well and
vied between horses into the first turn, dueled with ITS THIEVERY to the far turn while under a pretty tight hold, was let loose passing the three furlong
marker, opened up approaching the quarter pole then battled gamely with RICH GOLD down the stretch but came up on the short end of the head bob at
the wire. BROTHER O' BRIEN off a beat slow, was unhurried and settled near the back of the tight pack, saved ground and was kept to task and outlasted
the rest to gain the third spot. SUMMANUS hustled three wide for forward position, got caught out three wide through the first turn, raced mid-pack and
three to four wide throughout and did not threaten. IT AINT OVER settled near the back to the ouside of BROTHER O'BRIEN, launched a tepid rally on far
turn and was not making much of an impact then had to steady behind tiring horses at the top of the stretcn, regathered and showed some late interest. ITS
THIEVERY broke a step slow but was still able to contest the early, seized the rail into the first turn and had a pair of challengers at that point to the outside,
pulled ahead heading on to the backstretch with SEA DOG a constant shadow, held to the stretch then could not go on when that rival quickened away at
the three furlong pole, came under a stiff drive and was not a factor from that point.

Footnotes
BROOKYS GAL rated nicely off of the contested early pace, saved ground into the turn, angled three wide at the quarter marker and loomed into upper
stretch, rallied nearing the furlong pole, took command past mid-stretch, drew away into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish.
LEEDSTHESKY prominent away from the start, disputed the moderate early pace outside of HAPPY CHAPPY, pressed the pace into the turn, vied for the
lead at the quarter marker then took command into the stretch, was overtaken by the winner past the furlong marker, could not match strides into the final
sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. IRISH PRANCER forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the pace between runners heading to the
half-mile marker, advanced four wide into the turn, chased into the stretch, weakened past the furlong marker and held on for third. CEE'S THE IMAGE
lagged in the early running, trailed into the turn and saved ground nearing the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, offered a mild late rally and
missed for the show honors. PINEAPPLE CRUISE tracked the early pace from the outside, chased five wide into the turn, lacked a response into the stretch
and gave way. HAPPY CHAPPY hustled away from the start, assumed a slim early lead and contested the moderate pace from the inside heading to the
half-mile marker, disputed the pace into the turn, lost position into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. PONDERGATING stalked the early pace three
deep and between runners, chased three wide into the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the late stages. KEEPYOURPRANCEON
bumped by an inner rival at the start, was a bit slow into stride early on and chased from the rear heading to the half-mile marker, was guided between rivals
into the turn, got caught in tight and took up midway through the bend, dropped back at the quarter marker and came up empty in the stretch drive. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

BIG SOIREE came away well and tracked inside just behind the trio contesting the early lead, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole in tandem with
CARE FOR AUTISM, came three wide into the stretch, took command in mid-stretch under steady handling and won clear in hand at the wire. BUSY
MAKING MUNNY broke well then pressed and stalked the pace three wide through the early stages traveling well, bid two wide as the field turned into the
stretch, dueled with PENNYPATTER to mid-stretch, got the better of that one but was no match for the winner in the final yards. SHIPPING LANE broke in a
bit after the break and made light contact with SPICY ROSSO, but was still up with the pack in the initial stages, started to drop back before a furlong was
run, then came under a ride with more than a half-mile to run, finished willingly under intermittent urging but could not make up the needed ground.
PENNYPATTER broke well and got the early lead with several in close pursuit, had something left when beset by challengers at the quarter pole, battled
gamely to mid-stretch then gave way grudingly. CARE FOR AUTISM was close up with the forward group but about four wide, launched a bid from the
seven-sixteenths then circled three to four wide to get into contention on the far turn, loomed a the top of the stretch but flattened out. WALK'N THE BEACH
broke out and was bothered by the action to the outside dropped far back early but kept racing out in the middle of the track, made a sustained run through
the turn and was still five wide into the stretch and finished evenly with some improvement late. THIRSTY TRICKSTER vied inside for the early lead, made
an early bid up the rail near the seven-sixteenths then had to steady in traffic shortly after, lost ground and was not a factor late. SURF STAR ducked inward
then became rank when the rider tried to correct, dropped far behind the field, was hopelessly behind entering the far turn then closed a lot of ground in the
final quarter racing in the middle of the track and passed a couple of tired ones. SPICY ROSSO broke well and vied between horses in the tracking group
through the initial stages then started a steady fade entering the far turn and had little to offer in the stretch. CLASSY DOE took up at the start when both
SURF STAR and WALK'N THE BEACH converged in front, attempted to get away from those then was bothered again by SURF STAR, ended up well
behind before getting into stride, chased to no avail and weakened late. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TOWN PERFORMER vied for the early lead with SAINT IVES then assumed command, set a decent pace heading to the half-mile pole, set the pace a bit
off of the rail entering the turn and was pressured on the front end nearing the quarter pole, shook free into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong
marker and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, was hand ridden in deep stretch and held sway in the late stages. SAINT IVES broke alertly, vied for the
early lead then ceded to TOWN PERFORMER, stalked that rival through decent fractions heading into the turn, went up and pressed TOWN PERFORMER
nearing the quarter pole, was repelled into the stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and just held for second at the wire. MCLAREN VALE
allowed to settle while never far back in the early stages, raced inside of an outer rival approaching the turn, well placed at the quarter pole, shifted to the
three path into upper stretch, closed in the stretch drive and just missed for second at the finish. MY DOMINATOR took back to track the decent early pace,
raced widest into the turn and chased the leading pair nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide into upper stretch and could not muster a response in the
final sixteenth. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DADDY'S HONEY broke in at the start but recovered quickly and went to the front, got an early challenge from RIVER MARKET but once on the
backstretch was left alone to dictate the pace, maintained clear length or two on the rest to the far turn, then quickened on cue just past the
seven-sixteenths pole, opened up and cruised to a handy win. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE was ten or more lengths behind before entering the clubhouse turn,
then made steady forward progress on the rail mid-race, tipped out to the three or four path on the far turn to set up a stretch run but had to steady near the
quarter pole, switched to the inside, regrouped and finished well to get up for second. AFTER MY OWN HEART broke well but ceded the early lead, tracked
close behind DADDY'S HONEY while keeping to the inside path, was set down with about three furlongs to run but had to be urged to keep up as that foe
opened up on the field, had some trouble keeping a straight path and was unable to threaten but kept to task down the stretch to hold third. FRESNO CHILE
unable to join the early mix despite the efforts of the rider, settled in the middle of the field through the first half-mile, launched a mild bid on the far turn from
the three furlong marker, came three to four wide into the stretch but did not have much to offer, finishing evenly. IMA KEEN ICE got pinballed at the start,
had to steady and was last away, trailed by a large margin before the first turn, was still far behind as the rest hit the top of the stretch, kept to the inside and
was kept to task under intermittent urging and made some improvement down the stretch. RIVER MARKET was hustled from the outside to get a share of
the early lead with DADDY'S HONEY into the first turn, backed off to a stalking position down the backstretch, held that position to the far turn, came under
some pressure when unable to keep up near the quarter pole and had little to offer in the stretch. VIOLET THUNDER forwardly placed early, got shuffled
between rivals into the first turn, chased the decent pace through the backstretch run, dropped back. GEEJAYTEE came away well, was close up and got
involved in the pace battle down the backstretch then struggled to keep up from the three furlong pole, stopped and was not persevered with and galloped to
the finish. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
