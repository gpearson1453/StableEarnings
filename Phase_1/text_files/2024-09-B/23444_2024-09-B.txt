Footnotes
WITH THE ANGELS broke out and bumped with a foe while coming out clearly in front, showed the way while off the rail, dictated terms in the two path
through the turn, drew off under her own power in upper stretch, was shaken up near the furlong marker and widened under a brisk hand-ride while much
the best. VALTELLINA hit the inside of the gate then bobbled and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and
earned the place while no match for the winner. CARMEN'S CANDY JAR was carried in at the start, settled under some urging, saved ground while ridden
along on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. TRAIL OF GOLD bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then checked while
pinched back, spotted the rest several lengths, was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. SHE'S OUR
TIZ broke in at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, dropped back in the five path
into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT KITTY broke out at the start forcing SEDONA to steady, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before taking over with five and
a half furlongs to run, showed the way in hand tucking to the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused with
three-sixteenths to go and drew off under a drive, then held clear to the finish. I'M BUZZY chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SEDONA got steadied at the start when SMOKIN' HOT KITTY broke outwards
and conceded four to five lengths to the front, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered up late foot. FADE TO GREY bobbled at the break recovering to brush with SPRING MAGIC, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four then three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. AMITY ISLAND chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SPRING MAGIC got brushed at the start by FADE TO GREY, showed the way early on until displaced from the front five and a
half furlongs out, chased four then three wide before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SACROSANCT showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, easily shook off a rival near the five-sixteenths pole, extended
the advantage while dropping to the inside into upper stretch, was asked near the three-sixteenths pole, drew off under a mild hand-ride into the final
sixteenth then was geared down while much the best. BUTTAH was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, was urged along in the three
path on the turn and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. PAY THE JUICE was hustled from the gate, dropped back between horses,
climbed outside the five-eighths pole then moved out, went around the turn in the five then four path and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
SMILENSAYCHEESE was bumped very hard at the start then dropped back, trailed under urging, raced in the three to four path on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the five path and failed to threaten. MANHATTAN TWIST broke out and bumped hard with a rival, was urged along off the pace, moved from the
two path to the four path on the turn and came up empty. OATH OF OMERTA broke in a bit, settled off the pace, was urged inside for most of the turn then
moved to the two path and failed to respond. MCDIESEL was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn
and retreated.

Footnotes
WAR CHROME got bumped at the start by TRIPLE WORD SCORE due to pressure from FOUR EYES, showed the way in hand along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and
held safe to prevail. JANSSEN four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish
closing in late while well clear of the rest and along second best. BIG EGO shied in at the start in reaction to the breaking inwards ALBEDO bumping and
pinching out BERNING BEAUTY against KILKERRAN, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors.
BERNING BEAUTY got bumped at the start by BIG EGO and was pinched out against KILKERRAN, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before
tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. STANLEY
ROUGH broke out and traded a bump at the start with KILKERRAN, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. FOUR EYES broke out at the start bumping TRIPLE WORD SCORE twice before being corrected,
chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled out nine wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes through to the finish. TRIPLE
WORD SCORE got bumped at the start twice by FOUR EYES, who broke outwards and in turn bumped WAR CHROME the second time, chased three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. KILKERRAN broke in trading a bump at the start by STANLEY
ROUGH, then got leaned on briefly by BERNING BEAUTY before that rival was pinched back due to pressure from BIG EGO, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside at the quarter pole before taking to the rail straightened away and tired. SLOW DOWN
BIG ANDY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and faltered in
the drive. ALBEDO broke in at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went seven wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

between horses while four wide on the far turn, dropped to three wide into the stretch, dueled with MISCREANT into the final sixteenth and prevailed under
strong urging. DOWNTOWN CHANNEL was rated just off the pace on the inside, moved out to the three path late on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch, chased the leaders into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up for the place. GRAM went around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path while dropping back under urging on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with
good energy to just miss the place while up for the show. MISCREANT raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved under tight restraint at the
back, moved out near the nine-sixteenths pole, rallied leaving the backstretch, made a five wide bid on the far turn, dueled with the winner in the stretch and
missed while caught for the trifecta. WISH LIST saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, steadied behind horses into the far turn,
moved from three to five wide on that bend, came six wide into upper stretch and improved position with late energy. HIGHWAY HARMONY raced in the
three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while between horses on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch,
chased in the drive and lacked the needed kick. ALLEY'S SONG tucked in early, was hard held just off the pace in the two path, dropped back early on the
far turn, moved to the four path under urging late on that bend and lacked the needed response. ARTEMIS GIRL bumped with rivals on both sides at the
start then was in tight, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, steadied behind horses early on the turn, dropped to the inside late on that bend
and failed to respond. SUPERS LUCKY LADY bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside while inside of an opponent,
vied inside under urging on the far turn and gave way. ALETTE D'ORO went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the

JACK AND JIM broke a half a beat slow and then got bumped by POWMISSIO, advanced and impeded that rival leaving the chute forcing POWMISSIO to
check out between foes, chased along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, remained just off the inside through
the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, had to alter out when SKY MASTERSON shied out under a
left handed crop just outside the eighth pole, rallied to get up in the final jumps and prevail. LEON BLUE struck the near side stall at the start, established
the front shortly after the break and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and was caught in the late stages. SKY MASTERSON chased along the inside through the first turn and then three then two wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shied out under a left handed crop just outside
the eighth pole and ran on to clear of the rest for the show honors. NONNO JOE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths and stayed on one paced to the finish. JUST LICORICE got bumped at the start and was forced to steady off the heels of RESISTANCE
FUTILE, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. PRETRIAL
STATEMENT chased two to three wide until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home
and improved position to the finish. SOLO MIO just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the far turn, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. MILES AND MILES coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside early on and then
four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. DAYTONA MOONSHINE tracked the pace
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and made no impact. POWMISSIO broke out at the start bumping JACK AND JIM, then got checked
when impeded by that foe leaving the chute to the main course, saved ground in pursuit coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
for home and proved no factor. RESISTANCE FUTILE broke in at the start bumping and forcing JUST LICORICE to steady off his heels, raced just off the
inside through the first turn and then chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, gave way, and was
eased to the finish. I'M SOLO N IN LOVE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, backed away and went nine wide into upper
stretch, folded, and was eased home through to the wire.

Footnotes
BEING BETTY showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, dueled with the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging.
RED BURGUNDY raced in the four path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place. SPIRIT OF ESTHER was well placed just off the
pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then moved out under a drive in upper stretch and willingly
earned the show. ROAGNA bumped with a rival at the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn,
came out into the stretch, moved in behind traffic near the three-sixteenths pole and improved to just miss the show. SUMMER WHIRL saved ground on the
first turn, settled near the back, dropped from the three path to the rail on the far turn and improved position. STARTS NOW went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. NORTH END LADY went three
to four wide on the turns, came five wide into upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick. BOXED WINE dropped from the two path to the rail on the first
turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was held up behind horses coming to the quarter-pole, swung seven wide into
upper stretch and failed to threaten. BOSSY JEANS raced three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn,
chased into upper stretch and came up empty. MY CARA MIA MINE went two to three wide on the turns and lacked the needed response. LADY OF
THOROTON was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, moved from the three path to the
five path while gaining on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and was no factor. BUNNY HONEY bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the
two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and came up empty.
