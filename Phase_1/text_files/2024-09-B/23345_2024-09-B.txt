Footnotes
ARCTIC BREEZE saved ground while being reserved off the pace, moved closer on the backstretch, steadied running up on FRISCO FRILLS nearing the
three-eighths pole, angled out to split rivals nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was
allowed to settle while racing between horses, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the pace into the stretch but was unable to resist the
winner while proved to be second best. JAMIES INHERITANCE dropped back early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild
rally. FRISCO FRILLS sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace to near the quarter pole and tired. VICTORIA'S CHARGE settled in the middle of
the field while racing three-wide but lacked a rally.

VILIFIED saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by WIREWYRE nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one to deep stretch and
gradually edged clear late. WIREWYRE tracked the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to engage VILIFIED nearing the quarter pole, disputed the issue
to deep stretch but was unable to stay with that one late in a game effort. LAURA'S KIDOUGH was reserved off the early pace while saved ground, angled
out to be three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well for third in a steady effort. NIGHT TO REMEMBER saved ground while being allowed to
settle but lacked a rally. MONGOLIAN SPRING was forwardly placed while early while racing three-wide and tired.
