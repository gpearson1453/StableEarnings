ZOOMER saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through entering the stretch and closed strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. GREYZER was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole then took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist
ZOOMER late in a game effort. DESANTIS prompted the issue while racing four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and finished well for third in a steady
effort. GHOST STALKER was close-up while racing two-wide, steadied in tight nearing the three-eighths pole then dropped back while saving ground and
finished willingly. CAPTAIN CARDO was allowed to settle ready, came six-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SPECTRIER was unhurried
early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. GURT'S WARRIOR vied for the lead for six furlongs with SEMPER FIDELIS from
along the outside and then weakened. SEMPER FIDELIS vied for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole and tired.

ridden out. SNOOKIE BEAR was unhurried early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid entering the stretch but was unable to reach
the winner while proving second best. OMAHA OMAHA dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. UPTOWN TAPPIN

JUST KEEP LOOKING was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch while disputing the issue and drew clear late. BEAU
CIEL vied with DRMENTOR for the lead from along the outside, came three-wide into the stretch and continued to dispute the issue to deep stretch in a
game effort. STAYGOLDPONYBOY was close-up from the start, came two-wide into the stretch, steadied briefly when in tight near the sixteenth pole then
angled out and finished in a mild rally. DEMENTOR vied for the lead into the stretch from along the inside and weakened late. QUAHOG REPUBLIC saved
ground while being reserved off the pace and went evenly late. HOT STOTT settled in the middle of the field while two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch
and was not a factor. DUDE AFFRIGHT was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. KAKAO dropped back early and trailed.

Footnotes
VINGATIVA was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly three-wide nearing the quarter pole then took the lead entering the stretch and gradually
drew clear. BEACHGRASS was in tight shortly after the stretch then allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly.
SOLEMN OATH was prominently placed early while racing two-wide and finished in a mild rally. COLOR CRUSH was unhurried early, came five-wide into
the stretch and rallied late. NANA FANNY saved ground chasing the leaders and went evenly. BRAMBLE BUSH prompted GOLDEN HEART from along the
outside and weakened. CALL ON CLARA settled in the middle of the field early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BOARDWALK FRIES
saved ground racing in the middle for the field, lacked room nearing the quarter pole then angled out when clear and finished willingly. GOLDEN HEART set
the pace to near the stretch from along the inside and tired. LA LIMONADA saved ground while being unhurried and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
MAGNIFICENT PEARL tracked the pace from the inside, settled in just off the pace for the run down the back stretch, angled off the inside to avoid leg
weary foe leaving the quarter pole, then angled back to the inside for the stretch run, went clear under an all out drive. ALWAYS CONNECTED tracked the
pace from the three path around both turns, put to a drive while striking the front leaving the quarter pole, caught by inside rival in upper stretch, and was out
kicked to the wire. PARTY MONSTER was off to a slow start around the first turn, settled in towards the rear, upped the tempo while five wide around the far
turn, inched into contention leaving the quarter pole, flattened out to the wire. MY BOSS LADY broke a step slow slow, was angled inside soon after the
start, raced well back of the field down the backside and into the far turn, went by the faders in deep stretch. NURSE RACHETT vied for the lead in the two
path around the first and down the backside, under pressure between runners heading into upper stretch, weakened to the wire. WIN DIXIE RONNIE vied
for the lead along the rail, always under pressure into the far turn, gave way from the furlong marker.
