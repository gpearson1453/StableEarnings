to the wire and won the nod. LIGHTNING STRUCK went to a clear lead to the half mile marker where he was engaged by SEAHAWK CODY and matched
strides from the inside to the wire but was denied. DRIVEHAPPY was forwardly placed from three wide but fell back on the turn and made a late kick for the

RED FROST trailed the field through the turn while saving ground then angled out to four wide in the stretch to make the late rally and cruised home.
MALIBU SANGRIA showed good speed while dueling inside of JAKE ON DAKAN to the eighth pole and tired. JAKE ON DAKAN rushed up to duel outside
of MALIBU SANGRIA to the eighth pole and gave way. RUNNIN BUFFALO chased the leaders and was not a factor. JANIS showed no speed while racing
three wide around the turn and had no impact.

Footnotes
TENNESSEE MOON sprinted to a clear lead to set all the pace and won going away. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE was reluctant to load then hustled along to stalk
the pace from three wide, moved up around the turn but was no match for the winner and tired late. LOVELY LOLA trailed the field early then saved ground
around the turn and made a belated run to miss the show. CELEE'S LAST TE chased the leader through the turn and gave way. INTO CLASSIC was
always back. VIRTUALLY raced wide down the backstretch while racing in the middle of the pack to midway through the turn and retreated. JOCKEY
OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF VIRTURALLY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF LOVELY LOLA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
THREE FURLONG MARKER, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
