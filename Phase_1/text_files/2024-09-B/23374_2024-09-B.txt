Footnotes
GOLD CRUSHER was on the pace inside JAMES'S MOONSHINE through the turn into the lane, shook off that rival to edge clear and widened a bit under
steady handling. JAMES'S MOONSHINE forced the pace outside the winner through the turn into the lane and could not go with that one late while holding
clear for the place. LIBERTARIAN was just off the early leaders from along the inside, angled out in the turn to come four wide into the lane but lacked a
closing bid. ROSIE'S BOY moved up four wide into the lane but could not threaten late. DOGE OF VENICE failed to mount a bid from along the inside.
CASH EXPRESS stalked the pace three or four wide and weakened in the drive. LEVEL was not a factor from three wide.
