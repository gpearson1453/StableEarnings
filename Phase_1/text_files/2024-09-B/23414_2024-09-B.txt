Footnotes
KERNESS saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and held clear to
the wire. ENGLISH BOB raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back coming around the second bend,
entered the stretch in the four path and came on in again in the lane to gain ground late. MY DANNY BOY raced off the pace on the inside through the
opening half mile, came around the second turn in the two path and improved position on the rail in the stretch. NAUTILUS raced in the two path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.
DEEP FAITH raced in the three path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path
and showed no kick. BONDED raced in the three path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far bend
from the two path and faded from there. DESANTIS raced in the four path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped
back while saving ground around the second turn and continued to tire in the lane. STACKS OF SILVER trailed the field from the two path throughout and
was never a factor.

Footnotes
TRES MARIA'S DREAM raced in the three path early, led the way up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and dueled to the wire to just
hold the win. HEYBACKATCHA raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and
dueled to the wire to just miss. AMERICAN PEACHES raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the
second turn and never threatened the top two. CANNY LAND raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up
the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far bend and made no bid.

Footnotes
TURBO MILLIE tracked the pace from the two path, sent to work leaving the three eights pole, cleared the leader with ease leaving the quarter pole, and
drew off through the lane under a drive. BRAVO REGINA raced off the pace and along the inside, shifted three wide while making a bid leaving the quarter
pole, unable to catch the run away leader, held on for second under a drive. LUMINOUS RULER chased the pace into the far turn, put to task nearing the
quarter pole, bid four then five wide, flattened out in deep stretch. FUNZALO saved ground from off the pace into the turn, while making a bid leaving the
three eights pole the rider lost his crop, moved inside for the stretch run and improved her position while under only hand encouragement. MS. LADY T
tossed her head and walked out of the gate, unhurried around the first turn, bid into the far turn, and never threatened to the wire. SHAYMYNAME pressed
for speed soon after the start, under a strong scrubbing around the far turn, gave way from the quarter pole. TIZ D AMAZIN LADY was very slow into stride
around the first turn, settled in towards the rear into the far turn, and never fired through the lane.
