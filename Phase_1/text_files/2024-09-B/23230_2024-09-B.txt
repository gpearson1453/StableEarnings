Footnotes
GALWAY SHAWL broke well then veered in sharply causing a chain reaction involving the three horses to the inside, hustled to the lead and dueled briefly
with LADY WOLF around the first turn, was being pushed down the backstretch to put some distance on the field, continued to maintain the lead around the
last turn and increased the margin in the stretch. STANDFORGRIT took up sharply after the break as a result of the messy start, came under a ride early to
stay within striking distance, held the inside through the last turn then tipped out to the two path in the stretch, was kept to task and earned the place. LADY
WOLF hustled to the lead and dueled with GALWAY SHAWL through the first turn, could not keep up with that one down the backstretch despite being
under a drive from the half-mile mark, chased that foe into the stretch tired, and was passed late for the place. GOLDEN PINUP tracked in the third position
well off the pace, came under pressure late but could not improve. SAINT HELEN was squeezed at the start, raced well behind the pace after that, held
position then went very wide into the stretch, drifted out under right handed urging in the stretch. STREET TIGER steadied hard and was forced into the gap
as a result of the incident at the start, dropped well behind the field and trailed throughout. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF
THE RACE AND THE JOCKEY ON #1 STREET TIGER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY ON #4 GALWAY SHAWL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE
AT THE START. THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS UPHELD AND #4 GALWAY SHAWL WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST.

Footnotes
BARRISTER PROOF vied for the early lead away from the start, assumed command and showed the way into the first turn, was confronted by BOBBED N
LURED into the backstretch run, repelled that rival and set the pace into the far turn, kept to task into the stretch drive and drew clear in the final sixteenth.
BOBBED N LURED rated off of the early pace while never far back, saved ground into the first turn, bid between rivals into the backstretch run, was repelled
in that effort and chased BARRISTER PROOF into the far turn, could not keep pace with the winner in the final furlong and was a clear second best.
PRINCE OF MEMPHIS contested the early pace outside of BARRISTER PROOF, went two then three wide along the first turn, lost position into the
backstretch run and chased with a quarter mile to go, weakened in the final furlong and was a clear third. CLASSY PENGUIN off a step slowly to begin, took
back off of the early pace and trailed into the first turn, lacked a response along the backstretch run and did not factor.

Footnotes
HANDSOME GARY dueled with BRONZE WARRIOR through the early stages while under a stout hold, took command when let loose with a half-mile to
run, was confidently ridden to the stretch and geared down near the wire. LOOKOUT POINT was allowed to settle into stride after the break then moved to
the rail and saved ground while racing at the tail of the field but not far behind, moved up into third position on the second turn then took over second with a
quarter mile to go, was kept in a drive and chased the winner home while well clear of the next horse. BRONZE WARRIOR was intent on getting the lead
from the break and dueled to the outside of HANDSOME GARY, was under a ride to keep up about halfway through the contest, could not keep up when
that rival opened up on the field a the half-mile marker, weakened a bit near the quarter pole but was kept to task and held third. MAJOR TOM raced
between horse in the tracking group, dropped back to last after passing the stands for the first time but still close, struggled to keep up going down the
backstretch for the last time but kept on and managed to pass one in the late stages. DEFENSE WINS raced two to three wide on the outside of the tracking
group, tried to launch a bid after passing the five-sixteenths marker, went through the last turn still wide and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FIFTY CINCO was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace two wide into the first turn, lost position passing the wire for the first time
and saved ground into the second turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run, re-bid while saving ground nearing the furlong marker, tipped
three wide for the stretch drive, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, got by the stubborn MASTER RECOVERY in deep stretch and
determinedly held for the win in the final strides. FALSELY ACCUSED away in good order, took back off of the decent early pace and was caught three wide
into the first turn, saved ground into the second turn and was well placed entering the backstretch run, chased two to three wide nearing the furlong pole,
swung four wide for the drive, closed well in the stretch run and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure the place honors. MASTER
RECOVERY broke alertly and assumed early command, drew to a clear lead and set the pace into the first turn, was engaged by BABY WAYLON and set a
pressured pace passing the wire for the first time, was well handled while setting contested fractions through the backstretch run, shook free into the third
turn and was set down for the drive, led while all out past the sixteenth-marker, grudgingly gave way in deep stretch and was a clear third. BABY WAYLON
broke slowly, rushed up in the early stages and stalked the decent pace from an inside position, moved up to press the pace passing the wire for the first
time, chased MASTER RECOVERY nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the stretch drive and weakened. TRINIDAD settled off of the early
pace, saved ground through the first turn, got caught in tight and checked while a bit hard to handle passing through the stretch for the first time, advanced
three wide along the second turn, lost position two wide through the final turn and could not muster a late response. DO IT FOR DAVE bobbled at the start
and was away slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground throughout, offered a mild late rally but failed threaten in the late stages.

Footnotes
TEN THE SMART WAY broke well, seized the early lead, kept all rivals a length or two at bay through the entire trip and fended off a late bid from
YODERANDO to prevail. YODERANDO tracked three wide through the early stages, then pulled back off the pace and sat behind the pacesetters while
saving ground, got an inside run into the stretch, rallied and got within neck of the winner but hung and could not get up. HEY WILMAAA broke in tangle and
spotted the field a bit of a head start, rushed up to contest the early pace bided time while stuck inside through the first half-mile, got free run going down the
backstretch for the second time and was put into a drive to try and catch TEN THE SMART WAY, went a little wide through the final turn leaving the rail
open for YODERANDO and finished evenly. HYPHY stumbled at the break the rushed up to join the early fray, tracked three wide around the first turn then
got within a length of the leader approaching the half-mile mark, started to lose ground from there, was not a factor the rest of the way, then was eased in
the stretch and walked off. A BROKEN BREEZE broke very poorly, raced close up for about a half-mile then began to lose touch with the field, was eased to
the finish when hopelessly behind and walked off.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S GENIE broke well and won the sprint to the first turn, opened up a big lead down the backstretch, widened on the last turn and finished well under
steady handing as much the best in this one. BLURSDAY was hustled to get forward position but had to steady in tight quarters going into the first turn,
raced near the head of the tracking group then broke away from those on the last turn and chased the winner home. LUTE'S DIAMOND allowed to settle,
raced in some traffic through the first half of the race, launched bid from the quarter pole, finished with some interest but was never a serious threat. WELL
SPOKEN LADY lacked speed and trailed the field early, tried to rally on the far turn but ran into traffic at the eighth pole, took up, regained momentum and
was able to improve in the stretch. CASILLALATER hopped, then stumbled at the break, recovered then tracked two to three wide throughout, came four
wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. LADY RANGER was hustled to vie for the early lead then had trouble navigating the clubhouse turn, went three to
four wide but regained position, went into a drive to try and catch up to BOBBY'S GENIE then weakened on the last turn and had nothing left for the stretch
run.
