BOHEMIA BABE dueled inside for half mile then edged away through the stretch while kept to her task. DISCO DAISY rated inside, bid into the stretch and
finished well. ANGELIC STORM raced off the pace outside, bid very wide on the turn then flattened out. AKNA broke poorly, moved closer in the stretch but
was no threat. BELLA MARIA dropped back early then moved inside through the stretch. CUP OF LIFE dueled winner outside to the stretch then faltered.
MISS ALEX was urged close up in the opening quarter then gave way. OUI MADAME stumbled badly at the start unseating her rider. A claim of foul by the
runner-up against the winner for early interference was dismissed.

CABRA CHICA went after the pacesetter on the turn then pulled away through the final furlong under moderate urging. WISHING ONA PRAYER hustled to
clear early advantage, was collared into the stretch, weakened but lasted for the place. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE lacked speed, split foes advancing on the
turn and closed well. FAIRY DREAMS prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and lacked a bid. EXPECT TO BE READY moved close up
inside to the far turn and faltered. LEVIOSA chased five wide in close pursuit then stopped before half a mile.

Footnotes
AEGEAN SEA dueled outside, drew off on the turn, drifted out badly while widening through the stretch and never threatened. SHETALKSTOMUCH trailed
for half mile, split rivals into the stretch and finished strongly. COLLECT DATTT led narrowly inside in the opening quarter then faltered. CONFIRMED
GENIUS settled just off the leaders outside and lacked a solid rally. AVATAL HERO raced close up inside then began faltering on the turn. BATTALIA close
up between foes, was taken up sharply into the far turn. HIDDEN CACHE broke poorly then raced well back throughout. FAST MOTION raced wide and
began stopping on the turn. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident at the far turn.

THE KING CHEEK quickly moved clear, widened through the stretch then was geared down late. RUNYONESQUE well placed outside, bid on the final turn
and continued gamely for the place. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN settled off the leaders in the two path then rallied mildly late. SPEIGHTSTER RED saved ground,
moved closer on the final turn then flattened out. LAST ROMANCE crowded early, chased inside and was no factor. PEOPLE FORCE raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter and gave way at the quarter pole. YOU MUST CHILL dropped back early and lacked a response. SAINT MARCO lagged far
behind and trailed throughout.

RIGHT WING RUNNER pursued the pacesetter then wore down that rival while drifting out badly through the final furlong. BEYONDEXPECTATIONS
hustled to clear lead, was collared passing the eighth pole and held on gamely. CURIOUS SOUL saved ground off the leaders then went evenly in the
stretch. POSSUM was urged off the pace three wide then proved empty in the stretch. URBAN SYMPHONY squeezed back at the start, hustled up inside
then faded. MR. BOGAN broke poorly and was never in contention. MY DETROIT CITY broke slowly then raced very wide and stopped. L GOLDEN BOY
broke through gate and ran off prior to start resulting in a late scratch.

FLAMINGO WAY dueled for half a mile inside, moved clear and stayed safe holding off pair of rivals driving. SNAPPY RIDE advanced into the stretch,
loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. MISSY SIXTYSIX broke slowest, rallied along the inside with a gradual late gain. KINDRED HEARTS
dropped back early and lacked a response. DAKOTA SPRINGS vied with the winner outside for half a mile and stopped. JEZEBEL JADE lacked speed,
brushed rival losing rider near the far turn. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident near the far turn.

way and proved no match while easily second. GOLD MEDAL ANNA saved ground off the pace and continued willingly for the show. MARY Q rallied closer
before half a mile then had no further response. STASSI dropped back wide and weakened steadily.
