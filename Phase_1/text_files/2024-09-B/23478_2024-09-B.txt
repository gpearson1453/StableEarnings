Footnotes
UPO rated off the pace early, swung three wide in the final turn and won going away. BAKFIRE BABY broke alertly to set the early pace, saved ground
while setting the pace, disposed of inside rival leaving the backstretch, and had little left in reserve late. FLASHIN ACES lacked running room inside early,
pressed into the backstretch but was unable to move on with foes and tired. SAMURAI CHALLENGE stalked the early pace while three to four wide, moved
up closer but came up empty in the drive.

RAILWAY quickly went to the front to set the early pace from just off the rail, responded to a challenge from H K RAPPER then drove clear and was kept to
task through the stretch. H K RAPPER sat just off the pace while three wide, lodged a bid but was unable to get by. ALL RUN stalked the pace from the rail,
and lacked a kick that was needed. WRONG SPOT hesitated at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. DERZKII offered little.

BEAUTIFUL BABE vied between foes for the early lead, drew clear in the backstretch, and held under a drive. KEEPMEINPOWER broke outward, brushing
PERPETUAL BLISS, raced in second flight while three to four wide, advanced quickly in the final turn, closed well and missed. BLAZING SUN vied three
wide into the opening turn, raced in closest pursuit, and flattened out. GOLDIE SOCKS saved ground, lodged a mild bid and failed to threaten. PERPETUAL
BLISS sandwiched leaving the gate, and offered little. DRAMATIC FLAIR fractious in the gate, and was outrun. CUVEE TEE fractious in the gate, broke into
bumping inside foe, was outsprinted to the opening turn, and was done early.

FLASHFORDANI rated well off the pace, moved up closer leaving the backstretch, swung four wide in the final turn, and prevailed under a drive.
RIVERSIDE was four wide leaving the opening turn, chased five wide leaving the backstretch, was head at the top of the lane, and was outfinished. DECOY
was under a snug hold entering the front side, waited in traffic leaving the backstretch, and lacked the kick needed. COOLWIND last away then was gapped,
and closed late. SIR BREGOVIC showed the way early, responded to a challenge from SMART PLAY and wilted inside. SILENT RUNNER tracked inside
and faded. SMART PLAY steadied into the opening turn, moved up alongside SIR BREGOVIC to challenge the lead and tired.

Footnotes
VIOLENT VIOLET chased the early pacesetters, advanced quickly in the final turn, drifted out at the top of the lane, and won driving. MY KIND OF NITE
contested the pace while two wide, drew clear leaving the backstretch, and gave way late stretch. OOPS (GB) advanced quickly into the final turn, waited
briefly then closed well. SIRACHA vied between foes into the opening turn, was unable to move on with rivals and faded gradually. FLIRTATION CARD
contended the early pace from the rail, and tired. RUN MYA RUN was not a factor. SASSY PIPER outrun throughout. CINNAMON SAINT fractious in the
gate, was examined by the Official Veterinarian then reloaded, and was distanced.

Footnotes
WEDGE POND quickly went to the front, dueled inside of BON PRIX leaving the backstretch, drew clear into the lane, and was kept to task. BON PRIX
hustled three to four wide into the opening turn, pressed the pace in the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and evened out.
CREDIBILITY drove four wide in the final turn and closed steadily to score show honours. READYTOTAPNSING chased the early pacesetters, flattened out
in the stretch and was caught late. BARE BACK JACK was in tight quarters into the opening turn, took closer order from along the rail nearing the final turn
and offered a late mild bid. COMMON KNOWLEDGE contested the early lead from between foes, was unable to sustain the bid needed and gave way late
stretch. ZICATELA was brushed in the opening turn, and was not a factor. MUCHO MAGIC fractious in gate, and offered little.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S COPY was four to five wide into the opening turn, tracked four wide in the backstretch, rallied outside and prevailed. SNAP COUNT prompted
the early pace while two wide, gained an advantage into the final turn, rallied determinedly inside into the stretch, and was narrowly denied. ABOVE AND
BEYOND hustled outside, tracked three wide, rallied between rivals at the head of the lane and yielded late. H K MELODY fanned three wide, chased
leaders in the far turn, and lacked the kick needed. MY BOY CHRISTIAN set the early pace, was overtaken leaving the backstretch and faded inside.
AMEER trailed the field, and offered a late mild bid. BEAUGATTI rallied mildly late. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH hurried away, then was shuffled back in traffic
in the first turn, saved ground inside and tired. MOHAMAD lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
HENRY'S GAMBLE was quickest to the first turn, responded to a threat from LINAHASPECSHOES in the final turn and edged away. STOLEN JEWEL
stalked the pace inside, was roused at the head of the lane but lacked the rally needed. WHISKARITA was four wide into the opening turn, and closed
gamely to earn show. QUEEN RHONDA brushed leaving the chute, advanced inside in the final turn, and showed interest late. LINAHASPECSHOES sat
just off the pace, moved up alongside HENRY'S GAMBLE to challenge the front but was unable to move on with the eventual winner and yielded. GO
MAMA was unhurried while four wide, and rallied steadily late. ORANGE THEORY brushed early, chased midpack and tired. LITTLE HARPER chased wide
and tired. NO MORE JO KING saved to no avail.
