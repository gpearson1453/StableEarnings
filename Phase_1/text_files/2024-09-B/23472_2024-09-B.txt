Footnotes
BRADY BOY vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, showed the way, was encouraged late, held sway. I KNOW CASH FLOW raced off of the
pace, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field through the turn, raced in the six and seven path while closing fast in the stretch, was rolling
with momentum and gaining ground on the eventual winner but needed a few more strides, still a good second. UNDER OATH stalked the front runners,
traveled in the three path, maintained that position into the stretch then drifted out late. RONAMO was off of the pace early, traveled in the five path while
she improved position, was racing in between rivals and was in a stalking position after the three eighths pole, was trying to hold her position in the stretch
but had to check briefly to avoid a drifting competitor while lacking a late rally. PANCHO LEFT ME was off id pack and racing in the two path in between
rivals but made no real impact. VALENTINO WHO stalked the early speed briefly before retreating on the rail.

Footnotes
SHAKERS NO SECRET left in a stalking position, was kept on point and driven every stride, raced professionally, gained ground and made use of every
yard scoring the win at the wire. BOSANOVA BLOOD vied for the lead, raced determinedly, just did not have enough to out stride the winner late, still ran a
game second. MAKA ROON broke sharp while going for the lead briefly made contact with another rival, quickly refocused tried to maintain the lead but
could not sustain the bid all the way to the wire. EL GRANDE PAPI was off a step slow, lightly made contact with an inside rival, was kept on point but still
had very little impact. SAMMYS FISHINCHIPS was off mid pack, raced even with no late kick. DRAGON ON ICE was off a step slow and showed little. BOY
WITH CASH had an awkward start then was held straight before being encouraged. DEAN MIRACLES VIKE was off a step slow, trailed while drifting to the
outside.

Footnotes
DYNASTYS REFLECTION stalked the early leader, was able to draw beside then edge clear of that rival taking the win good fashion. EAGLES N DREAMS
was sharpest out of the gates, vied for the lead, had the lead, was hand ridden briefly, was asked again, but was caught and just missed. ASIAN
BUTTERFLY stalked out of the gate, was asked but did not have enough today. BUCKO was off in the middle of the field, encouraged left handed, ducked
out mid stretch, had to be steadied. JESSTIFYED was off mid pack, raced even in the early goings then had no late kick. MR FDD VENGENCE was off a bit
slow, drifted to the inside and made no progress. FAMOUS SHUES was off a bit slow and never got involved.
