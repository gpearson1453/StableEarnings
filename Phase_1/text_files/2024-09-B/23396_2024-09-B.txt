Footnotes
BOURBON ON FIRE trailed along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out midway on the turn, circled his field rapidly six wide under right handed
urging and was along in time. PANTHERA'S FATE matched strides for the lead three wide into the turn, gained the advantage before a half, shook clear in
upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. MSHINDI close up along the inside, altered course five wide at the top of the stretch and
finished best of the rest. SERGEANT COUNTZLER unhurried early, improved position five wide through deep stretch. SALTA dueled for the lead two wide
to the quarter pole then weakened. AWE SUMSUNFUN battled for the lead along the inside for nearly a half then gave way. SAGE RUNNER was outrun.
SIR MASON stalked the early pace four wide and was through after a half.

stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. VENETIAN DREAM chased the pace and went evenly. MONTAUK COVE had good early
speed then faded. THE DRAKE failed to menace. FIRST CITIZEN settled two wide, was bumped from his outside into CLASS ACTOR entering the turn,
checked hard and lost momentum. CLASS ACTOR settled along the rail, was bumped from his outside striking the rail entering the turn, checked hard and
dropped out of it. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED MY TWO AUNT JOANS FOR INTERFERENCE

MOMMA K'S BOY never far back, slipped through along the rail under right handed urging to make the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run
to win going away under confident handling. LUCKY VICTOR pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch, gained a narrow lead two wide at the top of
the stretch then was no match for the winner. DRILIN' FOR GEMS stalked the pace three then four wide and went evenly. COLOR BEARER failed to
menace. RUN RED RUN set a pressured pace along the inside and weakened late while two wide. DREAMINGABOUTTIME was no factor. LONE BOY
trailed far back.

rail at the furlong marker and was outfinished. WEEKEND RETREAT bumped at the start and failed to menace. MY BUDDY MICAH passed tiring rivals. EL

CLOAK AND DAGGER unhurried while saving ground into the stretch, shifted out three wire before the furlong marker responded with a burst of speed
three wide under left handed urging to make the lead near the sixteenth marker and drew off to win in hand. GLOBAL PRIDE dueled for the lead along the
inside and gamely gained second under left handed urging. PERMAFROST contested the lead two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished.
LIBERTANGO pressed the early pace three wide and was through after a half. TAP VALLEY well placed, failed to respond. THIRTYEIGHT WISHES was no

Footnotes
LO BUG stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win as
much the best. SECRET CALLER trailed into the stretch, had a mild late rally five wide and finished second best. ILLUMINATE unhurried early, closed
willingly late along the rail. BELLE BOTTOMS set a pressured pace along the inside for three and one half furlongs then was outfinished. SMALL TOWN
GOSSIP was bumped hard at the start and went evenly while six wide through the stretch. SECRET VALENTINE failed to menace. COMPLEXITY GIRL
bore out bumping hard with SMALL TOWN GOSSIP at the start, pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened.
