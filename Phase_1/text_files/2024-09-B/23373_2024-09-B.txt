Footnotes
PARTY HARDY bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid up close in the two path, was coaxed along around the far turn, bid between foes passing the
quarter, took the lead while still in the two path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to hold sway. LEROY BROWN bumped with an outer foe at the start,
then checked between foes midway through the first turn, rated in the three path, moved up to bid from the four path passing the quarter, and ran on for
place. HONOR THAT DUDE chased in the two path, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept
on for show. SIR ASCOT had a slow start and raced wellback in the five path down the backstretch, moved up under a drive going into the far turn, but
floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and was one paced. CALVINO stalked in the four path, bid under coaxing from the three path rounding
the far turn, but faded in the stretch. CENTERFOLD GUY tracked in the three path early but weakened. THREE WELLS showed the way in the three path,
was cued from the rail entering the far turn, but yielded in the stretch. RUIZ JUNIOR rated in the three path but failed to menace. TEMPERATURE RISING

Footnotes
TAKE YOUR POINT settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch, closed outside,
was up near the sixteenth pole and dug in outside of foe to prevail. REINA MAR raced off the pace two wide, split rivals in midstretch, closed inside of the
winner and just missed. TARIBA DREAM saved ground well off the pace, made some progress three wide around the far turn, shifted further out in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. ALMA PURA chased the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. MAKIA bobbled at the start, raced
off the pace three and four wide and rallied belatedly. AWESOME EMPRESS prompted the pace three wide, took the lead in upper stretch but faded
through the final furlong. WEST BANK broke slowly, raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, angled in down the backstretch, gained a bit inside
around the far turn, made good progress in upper stretch at the rail but flattened out. HIS CHOICE set the pace in the two path and faltered in the drive.
WINDRUSH was fractious in the starting gate and always outrun.

took the lead passing the eighth pole, angled inwards, and held sway. LOVE HER LOTS tracked in the two path, came under a ride along the rail entering
the far turn, bid inside passing the eighth pole, angled out around the sixteenth, and ran on for place. CONFER chased in the three path, was driven into the
far turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. JUDGE JUDITH showed the way in the two path, was cued while off the rail
passing the three-eighths mark, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, and faded in the final furlong. KIZZY steadied early around the first turn and
always trailed. AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF LOVE HER LOTS AGAINST THE RIDER OF LETS GO KOKO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE

Footnotes
TAPE RUNNER trailed inside for a half, circled five wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. UNION
HARMONY tracked the pace in the two path, kept on in the lane but was no match for the winner in the final furlong while going clear of the rest. STARSHIP
BOEING raced off the early pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and ran on for the show. VICTORY GIRL chased the pace three wide, was
shifting in in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. BETULA (GB) was fractious behind the starting gate, saved ground off the pace and lacked a closing
bid. MISS BIA pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, led to midstretch and tired. LAILA BELLA GIRL set the pace in
the two path, gave way near the five-sixteenths pole and steadied while tiring near the sixteenth pole. JILLAROO raced off the early pace three wide,
launched a four wide bid around the far turn but came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HUB CITY raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden into the turn, ranged up turning into the lane, and kicked on to draw past an inner foe in the final
strides. WARDA tracked in the four path, loomed up in hand to bid midway around the turn, took command passing the quarter, was roused from the two
path into the stretch, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe in the final strides to place. MISPRINT trailed in the two path, was roused
from the rail into the turn, tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and kept on while on her left lead for show. DOWN IN THE BAYOU rated in the
two path, was cued entering the turn, but had to check between foes turning into the stretch, and made no impact. MOBAY PRINCESS chased in the three
path, fanned out to the six path turning into the lane, but did not factor. PRINCESS BLAKELY prompted the pace inside but faded in the stretch. TAKING IT
ALL stalked in the three path but weakened. HOLY COFFEE set the pace in the three path but gaveway at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BLUE SPEARMAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, came under a ride passing the three-eighths mark, and kicked on
down the lane to draw clear. PAYNTED BLUE got bumped by an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid in the four path passing the
three-eighths mark, lost touch with the winner at the top of the stretch, and chased on for place. YEAGER laid up close inside, was coaxed going into the
turn, and finished evenly down the lane to hold show. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) tracked in the four path, was ridden into the turn, angled out to the six path
at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. SERGEANT SINATRA broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated in the three path, tipped to the rail turning
into the lane, but was one paced. SIR BANANA BRIAN had an awkward start and raced from wellback in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the
five path turning into the stretch, but did not factor. MIRACLE TRIP chased in the five path, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, but was no
threat. SHIPWRECK bumped between foes at the start, trailed inside, angled out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but failed to menace. DR. PERRY
stalked in the two path but weakened in the four path down the lane.
