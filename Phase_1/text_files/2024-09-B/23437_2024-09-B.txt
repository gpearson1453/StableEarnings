Footnotes
CUPIDS CRUSH away in good order, settled in the second flight off the inside past the furlong marker, continued to stalk the pace onto and up the
backstretch, made a sudden move three wide to assume command second turn, quickly expanded that advantage through upper stretch, enough left to hold
the runner up safe late while under steady handling. TOUR QUEEN in the second group while inside the winner for six furlongs, continued to sit while the
winner took over in the second turn from the outside, slipped through an opening along the rail into the straight, roused, responded well, accelerated and
finished willingly to be getting to the victor late. GYPSY REWARD void of early foot, raced off the inside in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn,
angled out to be four wide and between horses into the lane, rallied to be clear for the show, no threat to the top pair late. LET'S SKEDADDLE outrun while
racing outside, began a mild advance while widest final turn, floated out by GYPSY REWARD to be five wide exiting that bend, continued with modest
interest to improve position. PEPPER MILL dueled up front while closest to the inside, continued to alternate the middle half mile, allowed the runner up the
inside after being headed by the winner late in the final turn, steadily weakened in the run to the wire. THUNDERS ROCKNROLL broke on top, dueled up
front off the inside for six furlongs, faltered from between horses entering the stretch.

Footnotes
EL TOMATE closest to the leader while toward the inside, closer to that one into the far turn, continued to close the gap through the second turn, challenged
on the outside in upper stretch, brushed, gained command past the furlong marker, headed by a second rival with a sixteenth to run, found more to battle
back and narrowly prevail in game fashion. NORTH ARM BAY in the main body while racing outside through the first turn, moved up to race just outside the
winner in the run up the backstretch, in a challenging position while remaining on the outside into the stretch, challenged inside the furlong grounds, briefly
put a head in front with a sixteenth to run but was outgamed in the final strides. CLEAR THE COAST sprinted clear after an alert break to the show the way
into the first turn by daylight, maintained a sizable advantage up the backstretch, continued to lead into the lane, responded briefly when challenged and
brushed by the winner upper stretch, fell back off that one while unable to contain the runner up as well, stayed on and saved the show late. MY PARTNER
GLEN broke back off the majority of the field, continued to lack speed onto the backstretch, moved a bit closer up the inside with four furlongs to run, hard
ridden through the second turn, managed only a minimal response through the stretch to miss the show. DA GHOST in the second flight early, fell back to
trail after a half, failed to threaten. CAUGHT OFF GUARD broke in the air, lacked speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CLIFF DIVER close from the start after a solid break, closely pressed the early leader from along the inside for five furlongs, moved up to duel with that one
through the final turn, put a head in front when straightened for home, kicked clear with good energy past the furlong marker and maintained a comfortable
advantage to the wire under steady handling. HOUSE OF LORDS broke in to bother FOUND JORDAN, settled in the second flight while saving ground
behind the winner, enjoyed a good rail trip in getting through upper straight, could do little with the winner late, held sway for the place. TWOKO BAY raced
off the pace and the inside, three wide through the final turn, displayed some modest interest through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. THICK HAZE
in the second group while outside, continued three wide while within striking distance turning for home, went evenly to the wire to be found lacking in the late
going, lost the show late. FOUND JORDAN bothered at the start, outrun off the inside, four wide first turn, remained outside, four wide again through the
second bend, lacked a closing punch. CRAFTY KING back off the pace and the rail, three wide and in some traffic exiting the final turn, angled in stretch,
failed to make much of an impact in the run to the wire. CATHOLIC GUILT showed the way out of the chute off the inside just to the outside of the winner,
set a pressured pace, gave way when headed by that one entering the straight, continued to fade in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
KOOKYBERRY never far back outside, raced in the second flight in the three path into the far turn, outside bid turning for home, kicked clear in upper
stretch, not threatened to the wire while being kept to task. SUNSHINE FEVER balked a bit loading, broke alertly, early lead, relinquished the advantage
before a quarter, raced in the second flight inside, crept a bit closer along the rail late backstretch when beginning to encounter some traffic, continued
inside and had no room through most of the final bend, got clear after the winner shook clear nearing the furlong grounds, showed good resolve to annex
the second spot while left with too much to do to challenge the victor. CALY BALI hesitated at the break, lacked speed, moved closer in the second turn,
also caught up in traffic late in that bend, clear and three wide into the lane, lodged a bid for second, outkicked for that position while between horses.
FACTOR THAT in mid pack while outside, came five wide when advancing into a striking position turning into the straight, lost contact with the winner as did
others nearing the furlong marker, challenged for the runnerup spot, also outfinished late while widest of the second flight at the wire. MISS DOUBLE devoid
of any early foot, continued to lag into the second turn, swung out six wide into the stretch, improved position with a moderate rally well out in the course.
PRINCESS OF MALIBU back off the pace and the inside, came five wide for the drive, went flat the final furlong to lose some position. CHURCH SERVICE
in the second flight while racing between horses, involved in the same heavy traffic as a couple of others turning for home, came up empty when clear.
BANGO'S HEAT pressed the issue early from the outside, dueled the middle half, caved in entering the stretch from between horses. COUNTESS OF
CAIRO took control past the wire the first time, was the other half off the lead duo for the middle four furlongs, stopped when the real running began exiting
the final bend.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED WARRIOR closest to the dueling leaders, advanced three wide turning for home, lost some ground into the lane, engaged the leader inside
the furlong marker, kicked clear in the final sixteenth under firm handling. DISTORTED PRO in the main body while well wide up the backstretch, continued
out in the strip to be five wide through the turn, set down for the drive, closed with resolve to earn the runner up position late while not a threat to the winner.
STREET WARRIOR bumped at the start, recovered and dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed to shake clear in upper stretch,
continued to hold the advantage inside the furlong grounds but could not contain the top two. CREW DRAGON lacked speed off the inside, knifed through
four wide turning for home in some traffic, improved position without posing a serious threat. DIVINE LEADER raced four wide and inside the runner up into
and through the turn, went flat the final furlong to finish up evenly. EXXEL void of speed, came six wide out of the turn, lacked a closing response. HAPPY
DANCER in the 2nd group up the backstretch, fell back from between horses, trailed past the furlong marker then picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
never a threat. TENTH STREET DON in tight then bumped at the break to be last away, was used to make an early run up the inside, gave way. CENTRAL
PARK asked a bit to move up and duel along the inside, first to blink entering the stretch, backed up to trail home.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT five wide through the first turn when off the pace, raced under confident handling while remaining out in the strip up the backstretch, four
wide into the far turn, ranged up to a striking position turning into the stretch, roused, engaged the leader soon after and wore that one down under
continued steady handling. FIRST CALL took over soon after the start, clear while firmly in hand onto the backstretch, continued to rate into the far turn,
maintained that advantage into the stretch, responded when challenged past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly while narrowly holding the place.
TONKA WARRIOR settled off the pace and the inside, three wide and in hand late backstretch, shifted out around some traffic late in the turn, came five
wide into the lane, moderate rally while widest, narrowly missed the place. EMBER last to leave, continued to lag for five furlongs, four wide into the stretch,
modest rally to improve position, no threat to the top three. RICKY BOBBY lacked speed while racing in the two path, trailed final turn, passed some tiring
rivals through the lane without posing a serious threat. UNIFIED DREAMS four wide and inside the winner through the first turn, slight advance to race in the
second flight three wide up the backstretch, faltered in the final turn. SLIM SLOW SLIDER chased the runner up while off the inside, gave way in the drive.
SECRET POTION in the second flight along the inside, gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
O'BABE broke with the field, vied inside early, shook clear into the turn, steadily increased that advantage to the wire without being asked for her best to win
ridden out. CALL'EM ALL back off the pace while saving ground, continued inside, got through a large opening turning for home to inherit the runner up
position, enough left to save that spot at the wire. HOLY IMAGE void of early foot, rallied while off the inside, getting to the runner up late while between
horses at the wire to miss the place. HAUTE CHARLOTTE back off the pace, moved a bit closer three wide while being asked late in the turn, lacked a
further move through the lane, not enough for the show. HOTASAPISTOL back off the pace and the inside, four to five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing
punch. HONORABLE MISCHIEF vied early outside the winner and between horses, chased through the turn while hard ridden, tired through the stretch.
LOCK IT DOWN set or forced the early pace while racing three wide, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
TOWNER TOO behind the three leaders up the backstretch just off the inside, made a solid move to challenge the remaining two up front late turn on the
outside, quickly clear into the stretch, drew off as he pleased to win ridden out while only being shown the crop. SUSHI MAN vied up front while between
horses in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the turn in the two path, offered little resistance to the winner when that one went by turning for home,
held sway for the place. I'LL MAKE BANK with the pace along the inside, dueled turn rail, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, lost the duel for
the runner up spot. T C GOLD broke through the gate and ran off a short distance prior to the start, raced off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the
turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick;l. PAHAPESTO WILLY raced back off the pace, lacked a response in the drive,. MOR TIGER PAW
reluctant to load the first time, reloaded in good order, dwelt at the break, back, five wide into the lane, made little impact. VETTO'S VOW void of speed, was
never involved. BLUSHING BEE vied three wide early, gave way before three furlongs.
