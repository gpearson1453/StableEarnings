SHANGHAI PRINCE prompted the pace two wide the entire trip, dug in late under left handed urging and got up in time. POWERFUL PHIL set a pressured
pace along the inside, dug in determinedly under right handed urging but couldn't hold off the winner. UNBRIDLED CAUSE trailed into the stretch and
closed rapidly between horses three wide in the late stages. BABA LOOEY never far back, finished with good courage seven wide. RED HOT POWER
stalked the pace three wide in an even effort and finished on even terms with BABA LOOEY at the wire. ACCURATE saved ground to no avail. MUCHO
PRIMO well placed, failed to respond. VICTORY DIVISION was no threat.

BOURBON WISDOM stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, made the lead, widened into the stretch under right handed urging and won under an
energetic hand ride. BROADWAY SKY pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead briefly entering the far turn, drifted out to the
seven path near mid stretch giving up ground and finished second best. FAT DADDY never far back, found his best stride late in the seven path.
HAMMERIN AAMER settled two wide and went evenly. INDIAN FEVER allowed to settle, offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn then came up empty.
CUGINE set a pressured pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs and stopped on the far turn. HERD IMMUNITY trailed, lost contact with his field
on the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked through the wire.

Footnotes
COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead then finished full of run under left handed urging to win going away. STAGE
NAME stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the six path and finished second best. MR LOOOCH away alertly, set a rapid pace along the
inside for a half and weakened late. DARK VADER failed to menace. EXPRESS FASHION was no threat. QUIET AMIGO had brief speed.
