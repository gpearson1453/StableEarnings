RAINBOW CREST pressed the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, closed under left handed urging and drew off. KING BRYCE was never far
back, raced outside, closed steadily and got up at the wire for place while no threat to the winner. LET EM RIP pressed the pace, challenged three across
into the turn, fell back into the stretch, went evenly late and was caught for second. KID CUSTER hesitated at the start to be off slowly, saved ground to the
turn, went widest in the drive and closed well. ZACH WHO set a pressured pace, inched away entering the stretch and faltered past the eighth pole. WF
FRANKLY MY DEAR challenged between horses into the turn, stopped in the upper stretch and was not urged thereafter.

OUR TIME TO SHINE broke out, pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, fell back into the stretch, closed willingly, got up late and drew
clear. MARK IT DOWN broke out, vied to the turn, fell back, continued willingly and was outclosed to finish second best. MARQUIS LIGHTS vied to the turn,
drew clear entering the stretch, led late, faltered and settled for show. PRETTY PEPPY raced in close along the rail, was in hand early, angled out on the
turn, went widest in the drive and lacked a rally. ART CURATOR was not urged, trailed the field and showed little.
