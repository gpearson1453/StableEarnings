GRACE ON GRACE saved ground tracking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole before brushing with an
outer rival leaving that marker and gradually drew clear. LA BUKANA vied for the lead inside of STREAKING, got headed by that one into the far turn, took
light contact from her nearing the five sixteenths pole, altered course out to the three path and outside of her counterpart entering the lane, offered a rebid
along with an inner foe in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one while getting brushed at the furlong grounds, yet kept on to re-edge place late.
STREAKING prompted two wide, forged an advantage into the far turn, brushed an inner counterpart nearing the five sixteenths pole, inched free entering
the lane before digging in between bidders in upper stretch, got headed by her inner challenger reaching the furlong grounds, transferred light contact from
that one to her outer counterpart while attempting to avoid an errand piece of trash leaving the furlong grounds, then yielded and lost place late. MOM'S
CHEESECAKE was allowed to settle in the two path early on, took the far turn in the three path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch and stayed
on mildly. CO HEART was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch and improved her position. TAKE WINGS was prominently place while racing
two-wide and weakened during the drive. SHE'S SINGLE AGAIN brushed the inner stall door while off multiple lengths slow, rushed forward to rejoin the
main group down the backstretch, shifted four wide around the turn, crept closer entering the lane but emptied out without threatening. TON A LAUGHS was
off slow, saved ground while dropping back early, angled out to be two-wide nearing the eighth pole and failed to threaten. MADAME MARKIEVICZ was
forwardly placed for a half mile while racing two-wide and tired.

BEST SELLER prompted outside of the pace setter, took the lead from that one leaving the quarter pole and maintained a safe advantage. DIVINELY BOLT
was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly. ROSIE'S HALO was allowed to settle
while two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch then angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished fast. KLIMT'S MUSE was reserved off the pace while
racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TIFFANY TWIST was keen along the inside around the first turn, tracked before chasing
under urging around the far turn, came into the stretch two wide and failed to menace. JUMP INTO THE FIRE saved ground setting the pace, got headed
nearing the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) set the pace while racing two-wide, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and held a safe advantage to the wire.
BACKGROUND was four-wide on the turn while racing in the middle of the field, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. FRIAR LAURENCE
was prominently placed early while racing between horses, came out to bump J. P. RACE nearing the seven-sixteenths pole then move up to be three-wide
entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. J. P. RACE was allowed to settle while racing between horses, was bumped BY FRIAR LAURENCE nearing
the seven-sixteenths pole when that one came out and shuffled back, then moved forward along the outside, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. PAYNE saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and rallied late. JACKMAN was forwardly placed into the stretch
while three-wide and weakened late. THE QUEENS JULES prompted the early pace from along the inside, drifted out slightly to be two-wide nearing the
quarter pole and tired during the drive. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE JOCKEY OF J. P. RACE, FRIAR LAURENCE WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR THE INCIDENT NEARING THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

Footnotes
PISTOL prompted ERVADEAN from along the outside, engaged that one entering the stretch then dueled with her until near the sixteenth pole and edged
clear late. ERVADEAN saved ground setting the pace under pressure for PISTOL, responded when challenged by the one entering the stretch but wasn't
quite good enough while on on gamely for the place. AUNT BECCA bobbled start then rushed up along the inside, steadied nearing the half mile pole
lacking room, then angled out to be three-wide nearing the stretch, ducked in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and then race erratically in the stretch while
holding on well for third. OLGA bobbled at the start then moved up while racing four-wide to be forwardly placed on the turn and weakened during the drive.
CHARRIERE settled in the back for the field early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. ALTERED SHOT was close up early while racing
two-wide but lacked a rally when asked.

GIANT LEAP was bumped at the start by PAY ZONE then was in tight racing the inside nearing the half mild pole, continued to save ground then steadied
nearing the sixteenth pole running up on traffic and finished willingly when clear. TRIPLE TREA was bumped at the start from along the inside then settled
while racing two-wide but failed to be a factor. CAPER'S HOOLEY saved ground chasing the pace for a half mile and tired. THE JOCKEY OF JUSTIFREAK

BATTEN DOWN vied with NEXT LEVEL for the lead from along the outside while racing in hand, opened clear after five furlongs and drew off to win with
something left. HADES tracked the leaders early, rallied two-wide into the stretch and finished well for the place without threatening the winner.

three-sixteenths pole and finished in a mild rally. MUGATU was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch then came in slightly to brush
with ELEPHANTS EAR nearing th ethree-sixteenths pole and went evenly late. NEXT LEVEL vied with BATTEN DOWN from along the inside for five
furlongs and weakened. REAL MACHO hopped at the start then raced in the back of the field while three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a

MISS JUSTIFY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead from CHATALAS nearing the three-sixteenth pole and prevailed
under pressure. LIFE TALK was reserved off the pace racing between horses, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. CHATALAS saved ground
setting the pace, responded when asked but was unable to resist the top two in a good effort. HERE'S THE SPIDER was allowed to settle while racing
four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. NEON ICON settled in the back early, came three-wide into the stretch,
angled out six-wide nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. HOME GAME prompted CHATALAS from along the outside to the stretch and weakened.
LITTLE JAMIE was close-up racing along the inside but lacked a rally. MIDSHIPMAN'S DANCE saved ground racing in the middle for the field for five
furlongs then gave way and was taken in hand late.

UNDERCOVER was allowed to settle, moved up five-wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole then continued on to take the lead coming to the eighth pole and
gradually drew clear. JUST A COED was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, rallied three-wide into the stretch and finished well for second in a steady
effort. SANG vied for the lead with CRUISE MISSLE into the stretch while two-wide, responded to pressure and held on well for third. PRETTY PERTINENT
was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch then angled further out nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. PAHOEHOE D'ORO saved
ground while racing close-up, lacked room from the five-sixteenths pole to the sixteenth pole racing behind a wall of horses then angled in and finished
willingly when clear. TAKA settled in the middle of the field early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. CAPTIVE HEART was off a step
slow then allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CRUISE MISSILE vied for the lead into the stretch and weakened late.
PALMILLA'S BET was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DANCING PRINCESS was in the back early saved ground and
failed to seriously threaten. GO PURPLE was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired. MILVEN saved ground racing in the middle of the
field early and gave way after three furlongs.
