Footnotes
COLD FEET set the pace on the inside, opened up a comfortable margin on the turn, responded when asked, was kept to the task in the final furlong and
held well for the win. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and was gaining late
on the winner. EASY ACTION chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied mildly inside in the stretch run and got third. VAMOS VIEJO raced off the rail, off
the pace, moved up two wide on the turn and rallied mildly. POWER ATTACK chased three wide, chased on the turn, made a mild bid and was outkicked for
a minor placing. THE JUDGE AND JURY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, between rivals at the quarter pole, then lacked a rally on the inside. B
DETERMINED raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD raced off the pace inside, saved
ground at the quarter pole and did not factor. DANCIN WITH ANGELS chased between rivals and dropped back on the turn. SURPRISE BOSS was outrun.

Footnotes
ZIFFY BUG chased the pace into the turn, three wide and under a serious scrubbing leaving the three eights marker, engaged the top pair leaving the
quarter pole, wore down inside rival nearing the furlong marker, and kicked clear driving to the wire. NO WALK INTHE PARK was sent hard soon after the
start for position into the turn, pressed on while making his bid in the two path, shook free from one rival into upper stretch, and was out kicked to the wire.
TRECHMO GIRL off to a very slow start, trailed the field leaving the quarter pole, angled out around weary foe in upper stretch, eased her way back inside
while improving position through the stretch, never threatened the the top two. CHARLIZE CHUB chased the pace into the turn, bid five wide leaving the
quarter pole, and flattened out through the stretch. RITZ ON BROADWAY broke slow, unhurried into the turn, put to task six wide in upper stretch, needed
more through the lane. SAY NO MORE started slow, and never threatened. TOVIA sprinted clear soon after the start, collard entering the turn, under a drive
gave way along the inside.
