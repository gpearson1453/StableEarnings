THE LAIR prompted EMERY'S ROSE from along the inside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. SHADOW ON
THE SUN was reserved off the pace while saving ground angled out to be two-wide entering the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort.
NASTIKA'S SECRET was allowed to settle, rallied four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. EMERY'S ROSE set the pace under pressure from THE
LAIR, drifted out to be three-wide entering the stretch then steadied from between horses inside the three-sixteenths pole while tiring.

A SKIP IN THE PARK was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, swung out to be five-wide entering the stretch and finished fast to be up
in the final sixteenth. OWHATARUSH saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed late and held on gamely for second. MANGIA PANE was
allowed to settle while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PUBLIC APPEARANCE saved ground tracking the pace
but lacked a rally. UNCLE PETE dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. GYPSY GUN prompted
OWHATARUSH from along the outside early and tired.

Footnotes
COLONEL LUDLOW prompted the early pace while three-wide, took a short lead from A THOUSAND MILES nearing the half mile pole, opened a lead
nearing the eighth pole and the was all out to hold that one off late in a prolonged drive. A THOUSAND MILES vied for the lead while two-wide, responded
when headed nearing the half mile pole, dropped back slightly nearing the eighth pole and then rallied again late to just missed. CANDY CABALLO saved
ground while being close-up early, angled out for room inside the sixteenth pole to bump with SI THE TIGER and finished strongly when clear. SI THAT
TIGER was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, came in inside the sixteenth pole to bump with CANDY CABALLO and finished
in a mild rally. BORDER VIGIL saved ground while being reserved off the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. BIG
BOWIE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. CHECKERED FLAG was prominently placed early while racing
two-wide and weakened. SHESAYSHELLO saved ground while racing in the middle of the field and failed to seriously threaten. THIRSTY VISION dropped
back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor. NIJINSKY HALO was forwardly placed for five furlongs while three-wide and tired. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING CANDY CABALLO AND SI SI TIGER NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
