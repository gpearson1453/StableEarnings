Footnotes
BESS' CANDY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of NEARLY A LADY through the stretch, dueled with that rival and
prevailed for the win. NEARLY A LADY was allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the turn, angled towards the inside in early stretch, dueled with
the winner to the wire and finished second best. FEATHER WISH was unhurried early, advanced six wide through the turn, was gaining late and offered a
mild late rally. TEA ROSE raced in mid pack early, went three wide into the turn, was closing late and needed more ground. GINGERSRACEDAY was
reserved early, went four wide into the turn, angled in and finished belatedly. SEA SHANTY pressed the early pace, raced three wide and was empty late.
INTEL AGENT tracked the early pace, raced five wide through the turn, shifted in and offered no late rally. GET LOADED was outrun early, raced five wide
into the turn and never fired.

HAD TO HAVE HIM tracked the early pace, advanced four wide through the turn, made a bid on INVETABLCONNECTION, dueled with that rival, shook
clear and prevailed for the win. INEVTABL CONECTION set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of the winner mid stretch, dueled
to late stretch and finished second best. MID DAY IMAGE was allowed to settle early, raced three wide into the turn, angled out to the five path, was gaining
late and needed more ground. SWILL stalked the early pace from the inside and finished evenly late. OUTLAW COUNTRY was void of any early speed,
saved ground into the turn and offered no late rally. TENEBRIS was reserved early, went four wide into the turn and never fired.
