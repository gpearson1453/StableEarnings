THE GIRL'S NO JOKE hustled to the front, moved clear midway on the turn then lasted while tiring. INCAN MOON GODDESS dropped back at the start
and trailed then rallied well inside too late. PICARDY prompted the winner outside down the backstretch and faded. NORHO'S GAMBLE raced wide, was
put to urging on the turn but gave way. INTUITIONISTCLAIRE flashed speed in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
THESEGUYSGOTGAME saved ground throughout then wore down the leader in the final eighth in a long drive. NUEDORF vied outside, shook loose on
the turn and continued willingly. COMMINGLING fractious in the gate, faded on the turn then came again to gain the show. FINANCIAL STRENGTH raced
wide within range and finished well while nailed for the show. BLUEY dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. TOUGH WORKOUT flashed
speed inside then proved empty in the stretch. BOOK MARKER dropped back early, moved briefly closer on the turn then faltered. GAMERUN lagged far
behind and was never in contention. KEEP DEM TALKING showed speed outside and gave way after three eighths.

shook loose on the final turn to midstretch but was caught nearing the finish. DUDLEY DICKERSON well placed inside, moved closer before half milethen
faded in the stretch. FOREVER WICKED trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. CHIP'S FRIEND prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and
weakened. CARNIVORE dropped back early and faltered steadily. IMAGINE THIS trailed far behind throughout.
