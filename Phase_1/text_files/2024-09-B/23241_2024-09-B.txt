Footnotes
ALEXIANA was allowed to settle up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under
steady pressure and got up late. AINTNOSHAKIN KID raced up close in opening stages, got bumped by KANGENG when rival got in tight then bumped into
the rail, lost momentum briefly, moved back up and dueled for the lead between foes around the turn, sustained a two wide bid in aim for the lead in final
stages, got outkicked by late running winner and finished on equal terms with MISS MINGO. MISS MINGO moved up in the early going and challenged
SIPPING FIREWATER for the lead, dueled for command around the turn and continued in aim deep stretch, got outkicked by the winner nearing the wire
and finished on equal terms with AINTNOSHAKIN KID. SIPPING FIREWATER broke sharp and angled inside which impeded the progress of a duo soon
after the start, quickly challenged for the lead, dueled around the turn and into stretch run then weakened late. KANJENG got in tight when SIPPING
FIREWATWR angled in soon after the start, was forced in and bumped foe, moved up to race in aim around the turn then gave way in the lane.
STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE EARLY BACKSTRETCH, AFTER REVIEW SIPPING FIREWATER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH FOR ANGLING IN SOON AFTER THE START IMPEDING THE PROGRESS OF FOES

BYE LOVE GOTTA GO tracked the pace into the turn, hustled along three wide in upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and got up late. NORTHERN
GEM raced near midpack heading into the turn, given cue four wide in upper stretch, gathered momentum under a drive and finished gamely to the wire.
SABRIA was forwardly placed from the onset, tracked the leader along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide and given cue at the head of the lane, raced
in striking distance then yielded approaching the wire. GIRLS IN CHARGE sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the turn, cut the
corner and kept clear with a furlong left to run then came up empty late. BREW CASA raced off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. CATALE was off a step slow at the start, raced off the early pace and saved ground to no avail. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS lacked early speed
and raced in the back, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CHROME RACER raced three wide around the first turn, then settled in good position stalking the embattled pair up the backstretch, let out a notch entering
the far turn and steadily edged up closer, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, roused forward to challenge SET THE PACE near mid-stretch, shook
free leaving the sixteenth pole and kept clear. SET THE PACE dueled around the first turn and up the backstretch, held a slim lead at the quarter pole, kept
on gamely and led the way in upper stretch, challenged by CHROME RACER near the furlong marker, fought back briefly then flattened out, finished clearly
second best. SASSY AIN'T I trailed through early stages, saved ground entering upper stretch, hustled along near the inside and got a nose up for show.
MILLIGANMIKEANDME dueled inside of SET THE PACE around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not match strides with rival late on the final
turn, weakened off the top pair in the lane and got nipped for show. MUMBLEBEE settled off the early pace and saved ground, tipped two wide and given
cue at the head of the lane but had no response. BLESSED ANNA rated off the early pace, failed to respond when called upon and faded.

a slim lead at the head of the lane, dug in along the inside under firm handling, was all out in final stages but heled on gamely. EZ FITZ pressed the pace
around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled outside of DARYLS BOLT around the final turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but ran
on determinedly, edged back up nearing the wire but failed to get by. PRINCE IS MY BOY settled off the pace in the early going, hustled up late on the far
turn, ran on three paths wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer in the final sixteenth and captured show. ICE AXE rated off the early pace saving
ground, picked up the tempo mid-way around the far turn, tipped two wide entering the head of the lane, advanced into contention then lacked a closing
kick. DA RINGO settled off the pace up the backstretch, hustled along three wide late on the final turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, briefly edged
closer then flattened out. GO FOR IT was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty around the far turn.

Footnotes
AMOROSA raced up close sitting just off the early leader, edged close late on the turn, given cue two wide entering upper stretch, quickly roused forward to
the lead, opened up under left handed pressure a furlong out then drew off while ridden out. RUN FOR GOLD sped to the lead at the start, set the pace with
AMOROSA applying some pressure, led the way around the turn, got overtaken by the winner just past upper stretch and had to settle for second best. BIG
MAN STAN took a solid bump at the start then tracked the top pair two to three wide, lost ground on the leaders around the turn, hustled along two wide into
upper stretch and churned on for a share. RED ROMANCE raced off the top pair along the inside in the early going, weakened off duo around the turn then
retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
JUPITER MISSION was forwardly placed sitting just off the top pair early on, engaged rivals three wide entering the turn, matched strides then shook free in
upper stretch, widened advantage under steady pressure then pulled away and finished ridden out. RAYS BIG DREAM raced off the clear top trio up the
backstretch, saved ground and cut the corner entering upper stretch, tipped two wide and put to a drive, responded, edged closer and gained place.
RUDIANO vied inside of WICKED PRINCE for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle with the addition of JUPITER MISSION around the turn, could
not move on with eventual winner past upper stretch, weakened and lost place late. WICKED PRINCE vied outside of RUDIANO for the lead up the
backstretch, continued to battle around the turn then gave way in the lane. EYE OF THE PANTHOR dropped back after the start and trailed the field,
hustled along into upper stretch, had a mild improve but needed more to threaten. NICE ONE JULIO raced off the pace and had no response when called
upon.
