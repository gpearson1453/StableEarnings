Footnotes
CLUE vied inside, drew off into the stretch for a clear lead and held safely. MAXIMUM BULL was slow early, advanced on the turn, shifted out in the upper
stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. AMERICAN SOLO raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied on the turn, bid willingly to
get within range, didn't have enough late and settled for show. READS PET ZENON stalked the pace and lacked the needed late response.
DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH veered out start, stalked the pace and leveled off in the drive. MONIKER vied two across, dropped back entering the stretch and
gave way. STACKERS broke in the air and hit the gate to be off slowly and trailed the field.

Footnotes
IMA BLING CAT showed good early speed while racing outside, fell back, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. TEQUILA TIME pressed
three across, bid willingly, dueled late and was outfinished in a good effort. MOONLITE GRAHAM set a pressured pace to late stretch, was unable to
sustain his bid and held safely for show. SILVERBULLITBADGER saved ground, angled out on the turn, closed well and didn't have enough late. BIG
EVENT was slow early, closed inside and improved position. EL CHUMELITO was off a step slowly and pinched back at the start and lacked a bid in a wide
trip. ROCKY BAR SIX pressed the pace between horses to the turn, was taken back, angled in and gave way.
