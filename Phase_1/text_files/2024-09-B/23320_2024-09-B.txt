Footnotes
BABS DELIGHT sat just off the rail, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane, and won driving. NO PEOPLE hurried away, bid inside into the stretch,
and was outfinished. MAJESTIC HORIZON reared away, was quickest to the turn, and came up empty in the drive. DEVILISH SMILE reared leaving the
gate, chased leaving the backstretch while wide, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, and lacked a closing response. LITTLE HARPER attended the
early pace, was shuffled back into the final turn and finished evenly.

DECOY was four wide leaving the backstretch, closed gradually, dug in, in the final yards and won the bob after a multi-horse scramble to the finish.
TICKET TO THE TOP stalked the early pace under a snug hold, moved up alongside SIR BREGOVIC to challenge the front, dueled through the stretch and
was denied in the final strides. SIR BREGOVIC quickly went to the front, responded to a challenge from TICKET TO THE TOP, dueled inside and was
outfinished after a game effort. SILENT RUNNER offered little. ASYOUBELIEVE tracked five wide, was carried out leaving the backstretch, yielded, was
eased and was escorted off the track in an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
BOOTIFUL ROSE contested the pace while four wide, came together with CHATTY GAL leaving the backstretch, gained the advantage into the final turn,
and kicked away. CHATTY GAL contested the pace three wide, came together with BOOTIFUL ROSE then drifted in leaving the backstretch, and was no
match for the eventual winner in the stretch. NO MORE JO KING chased four wide into the opening turn, and rallied belatedly. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
chased outside, and passed tiring rivals. COUNT ON IT attended the pace, was in tight, clipped heels, and tired late stretch. TIMBERLAKE GAGE attended
the pace from the rail, shuffled back in the far turn, and faded gradually. STEWARDS INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider
of COUNT ON IT against the riders of BOOTIFUL ROSE and CHATTY GAL alleging interference in the far turn was upheld. BOOTIFUL ROSE was
disqualified and placed fifth for interference to both, COUNT ON IT and CHATTY GAL.

Footnotes
QUEEN RHONDA advanced quickly inside in the far turn, swung four wide, and kicked away. STARMA contested the early pace from the three path, dueled
inside of BLAZING SUN in the final turn and was outkicked in the stretch. KEEPMEINPOWER trailed early, circled the field off the final turn, and rallied late
to earn show. BLAZING SUN vied for the early lead, dueled outside of STARMA, and had little left in reserve for the stretch. PERPETUAL BLISS saved
inside and lacked a solid bid. BEAUTIFUL CALL lacked a bid. CUVEE TEE chased the early leader from between rivals, was unable to keep pace with the
field and faded.

DON'T STOP DREAMIN was three to four wide in the opening turn, rated well off the pace while five to six wide, took closer order leaving the backstretch,
sped by the leaders nearing the quarter pole, and was kept to task. CALI CONQUEST fanned four wide in the first turn, sat just off the pace in striking
position, moved up alongside LANNY MAC at the three-eighths pole to compete for the lead but was snubbed by DON'T STOP DREAMIN, and lacked the
kicked
that
was
needed.

LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR reserved off the early pacesetters, lacked running room leaving the backstretch then dropped back, angled out and offered a late

was fractious in the gate, set the pace from the two path, was overtaken and gave way.

OKI broke alertly, pressed the pace alongside MR MIEZIE, fought hard through the stretch to gain a narrow lead, and ultimately withstood a late charge from
the previously mentioned rival to secure the win. MR MIEZIE contested the early pace, was overtaken into the stretch, made a final push, and narrowly fell
short after a determined effort. KITTY HOUSE hustled hard early, maintained a strong position from the three-path, lacked the needed finishing kick, and
held for show. FED BOY closed late and missed out on third. MYSTIC SALLY was four to five wide leaving the backstretch, and offered a mild bid. BLUE
QUILL offered little. ALLURING ALI was outrun throughout. HOLY MOSES was fractious in the gate then hopped at the start, and trailed.

Footnotes
DRAMATIC FLAIR was wide into the backstretch, rallied four wide into the stretch and won the nod after a crowded dash to the finish. SMOKIN JOY
contested the early pace, dropped back nearing the final turn, rallied inside into the stretch, and was denied by the slimmest of margins despite a strong late
push to the finish. BURNING UP emerged the leader leaving the chute, contended the pace outside of SMOKIN JOY, gained a short advantage at the
quarter pole, and was caught deep stretch from between foes. TENDER LOVE raced at the back of the pack early, and closed gradually. PARZANNI
stalked the dueling pacesetters while five wide, was roused at the quarter pole, and retreated. ALBERTA chased inside and faded. SPOT ON JOLEE was
five to six wide early, and offered little. WICKED WIZZY no contention.
