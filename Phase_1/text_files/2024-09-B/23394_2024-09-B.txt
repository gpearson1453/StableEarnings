TIN BADGE sped to the lead at the start and lead the way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, took on the challenge of WOKE UP IN LOVE
late, dug in gamely and held on. WOKE UP IN LOVE was off slow at the start then steadily advanced into closer contention, sustained a three wide bid into
the lane, reached striking distance of TIN BADGE in late stages, dug in gamely but failed to get by in time. TOSKA'S RULER tracked in contention into the
turn, cut the corner and hustled up along the rail in upper stretch, was no match for clear top pair in late stages but kept on and secured a share. STAR OF
MINE pressed the pace in early stages, chased in contention around the turn then flattened out in the lane. LUCKY LOUIE raced in the back of the field and
failed to move into contentin. TAP THE BRAKES raced off the early pace and had no response when called upon.

CLASSIC CASH tracked the pace along the inside through early stages, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, vied outside of JADA through the
lane, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away in final stages. JADA sped to the lead at the start and set the pace by a clear margin up the
backstretch, took on the challenge from CLASSIC CASH at the head of the lane, fought back gamely from the inside, held a slight edge then got overtaken
late. STELLA BELLA raced in contention around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn, sustained
bid into stretch run and secured a share. OVERQUALIFIED was forwardly placed around the first turn then steadily weakened off the early leaders, hustled
along three wide around the far turn, kept under a ride into the lane and failed to threaten. CANADIAN JANE was reserved racing in the back, hustled up
around the far turn, came under a drive near the inside at the head of the lane and failed to respond.

OBVIOUSLY TOO dueled inside of MISTER SHARPIE up the backstretch and took on the added challenge of JUPITER MISSION at the quarter pole, cut
the corner and shook free, kept on with response under firm handling and held in final strides. JUPITER MISSION tracked the embattled pair up the
backstretch, moved up to race in aim at the quarter pole, flattened a bit off the leader turning for home then was set down under under right handed
encouragement, closed gamely but could not get by the winner in time. LUCKY'S SECRET tracked the top trio through early stages, hustled along four wide
into upper stretch and finished with good response. MISTER SHARPIE dueled outside of OBVIOUSLY TOO from the onset, continued to battle around the
turn then came up empty in upper stretch. HEIR (FR) was not too far back in early stages, hustled along three wide around the turn, kept under a ride two
wide in the lane and failed to threaten. RIDING THE TRAIN raced in the back, saved ground and steadily faded.

ANCHORS AND SPURS attended the pace three wide in early stages, took over the lead approaching the midway point around the turn, widened to a clear
advantage then held late over fast gaining stable-mate. AMERICAN SUE settled through early stages then picked up the pace late on the turn, hustled
along four wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under strong handling, finished fast to the wire and just missed. BREAKFASTRUN vied two wide
through early stages, was no match when ANCHORS AND SPURS took over mid-way around the turn, ran on three wide into the lane and secured a share.
SOPHIE'S STAR raced in the back, saved ground entering the lane and improved position without threatening. WUMPMUG was ridden along off the top
flight in the early going, lost ground on rivals, came wide into upper stretch and never threatened. CAN'T MAKE ME pressed the early pace, chased in
contention around the turn then tired in the drive.

STAY FABULOUS was forwardly placed racing three wide, dueled with rival around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, widened advantage and
kept to task. BIG TIPPA rated off the embattled top flight late late on the backstretch, hustled up three paths wide around the turn, sustained bid into the
lane and cleared second best. GODDESS OF WAR raced off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and gained show. MS I
SPEIGHT raced in contention for the lead just past the half mile marker, lost ground on the leaders but ran on two wide around the turn, took the inside path
in the lane and had no late kick. BREATHTAKING FOLLY raced in rage four deep just past the half, dueled with the eventual winner around the turn then
gave way. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY raced off the early pace saving ground, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. LAZY N
LUCKY raced in the back, saved ground and had no response when called upon. AZTEC EMPRESS led the way in the opening quarter, got overtaken
entering the turn and retreated.
