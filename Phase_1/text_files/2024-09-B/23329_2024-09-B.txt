BIGDADDYSBOY stalked the pace behind a wall of horses on the turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch, swept to the lead near the sixteenth pole
and drew out. DREAM RIVER set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and finished willingly. BOLD HONOR stumbled leaving the
starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and rallied. BOX N BEN , four deep chasing the pace to the stretch, gave way.
GABRIEL SEVEN prompted the pace outside DREAM RIVER and gave way in upper stretch. AIM FOR THE CORK chased the pace in the three path, gave
way and was eased the final furlong.

Footnotes
T C NEIGH broke sharply, rated kindly two wide tracking the leader, responded when given her cue soon into the lane, wrested command outside
LENAMAGNETTA leaving the three sixteenths, spurted away past mid stretch then held firm under left handed encouragement. ROMANTIC STORY broke
outward brushing with a rival, corrected and edged up outside a foe to stalk, shifted out three to four wide under pressure in upper stretch and finished
gamely to steadily bridge the gap. IN HER CUPS rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out near the three sixteenths, pursued between runners past
mid stretch, kept on with effort and held the show. ASKNOTWHATYOUCANDO , taken to rate off the rail, eased out with some run nearing the lane,
straightened and chased between rivals past mid stretch then churned on to the finish. LENAMAGNETTA sped clear early, set the pace towards the inner
rail, ceded to the winner leaving the three sixteenths and weakened late. RYE SMILE drafted back off the early pace while saving ground, moved up while
saving ground in upper stretch then steadied when lacking room from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker. DIVINE SPIRIT drifted in at the break, raced
three wide and faded. SURPRISINGLY SWEET was squeezed back soon after the break, regrouped and raced between horses into the turn, dropped
inside around the turn, remained inside through the stretch but came up empty. HATEFUL , brushed at the break, raced between rivals mid turn then failed
to drum up a stretch run. HOT DANCE , pinched back at the break, circled four wide making a mild run nearing the lane, failed to sustain and faded through
the final furlong.

PREPAREFORTAKEOFF disputed the pace two wide between rivals into the turn, wrested command to outside of PERPETUAL PRAISE near the quarter
pole, kicked away under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on eagerly and was taken in hand through the final strides. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY broke on
top despite a stumble, raced in close attendance three wide and between foes past the half, was pushed along pursuing three wide past the quarter pole,
stayed on with good effort through the final furlong and saved the place. OUT OF LUCK , off the pace, moved up two wide between runners leaving the
quarter pole, altered out five wide past the three sixteenths, straightened and churned on. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL , towards the inside, came up empty.
PERPETUAL PRAISE rushed up to the inside a trio of foes and poked a head in front after a furlong, set a pressured pace towards the inner rail, ceded to
the winner after a half mile, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then weakened. AFLEET DIVA steadied when rank leaving the gate, raced wide mid turn and
failed to menace. MARTHA'S BANNER , four deep forcing the early pace, failed to kick on approaching the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BISHOP MEADE showed speed along the inner rail, battled with EDELWEISS and determinedly prevailed. EDELWEISS engaged the winner leaving the
turn and just missed in a game effort. IMPERIAL BRUT came in and bumped FLATBED FORD after bobbling at the break, circled the turn three wide,
swung to the five path at the head of the stretch and was no threat. FLATBED FORD , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path
between horses around the turn, moved to the four path entering the stretch and failed to menace. GRAY CHARLES bumped FLATBED FORD when
bearing out at the break, stayed along the inner rail and was outrun. PINT GLASS chased the early pace outside horses and faltered in upper stretch.
BURNING MUNNY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, faltered in upper stretch.

head of the lane, altered out to about the seven path past the three sixteenths, finished up well while on her left lead and nabbed the place to the outside of
NEXT GIRL. NEXT GIRL , bumped with an outer rival at the start, was taken to rate off the inside, circled four wide with momentum into the stretch, moved
up to be the closest pursuer past mid stretch, kept on willingly but was out kicked for second. ATLAS STRONG settled between runners early, dropped in
some leaving the far turn and gained, eased back out to be two wide chasing in upper stretch but lacked a solid finish. SHINE ON MOON , brushed at the
start, gained a forward spot saving ground into the first turn, was lightly steadied when drafting back near the three eighths, steadied again nearing the
quarter pole, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a closing punch. VIENNESE WALTZ , unhurried early, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled out for
the drive and passed tiring rival. MAJOR HOULIHAN , jostled then steadied soon after the break, rated off the inside, raced three wide into the far turn,

Footnotes
DAZE sped to the early lead, moved to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail, was asked in upper stretch and pulled away while kept
to her business. HIYA LOVE raced outside the winner and willingly chased her around the turn. QUEEN'S WREATH stumbled leaving the starting gate,
turned for home in the three path, raced inside horses and passed tired ones. ITSAMONSTAMASH bore in leaving the starting gate, chased the pace in the
two path on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and weakened. MORE BUBBLES , never a factor, passed tired rivals. SOUPER UPGRADE , a forward
factor along the inner rail, gave way in the stretch. NICK'S NOTION , three deep on the turn, floated wide in upper stretch and faltered. GO ROUND ,
steadied when shuffled back leaving the starting gate, was outrun and turned for home along the inner rail.

Footnotes
INCISIVE KITTEN , with the pace three wide outside a pair of rivals, moved to challenge past the five sixteenths, took over leaving the three sixteenths,
shifted in a bit when clearing near mid stretch, corrected, kept on under right handed asks inside the sixteenth pole and held sway. LAUGHING FIT , in
range under rating and off the inside, took closer order between runners nearing the stretch, worked outward near mid stretch, finished gamely but was kept
at bay. MINARI , rated close up while saving ground, eased for the drive, was stalled a bit near mid stretch, found room between rivals late and finished with
good energy. INDEPENDENCE WAY , forwardly placed three wide outside a rival, fanned five wide into the lane, straightened and moved up some in mid
stretch but failed to seriously sustain. DROPPING LEMONS prompted the pace two wide outside LOVE SAGA, moved to apply more pressure after six
furlongs, sparred between runners into the lane, bumped with LOVE SAGA near mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. LOVE SAGA cleared early then
dropped in to set the pace, was joined near the five sixteenths, battled inside rivals past the three sixteenths, bumped with DROPPING LEMONS soon after
and weakened late. HAVE A CHANCE , off slowly after acting up a bit in the gate, trailed early while about four wide, angled towards the inside for the drive
and had belated action. SULTRY SKY rated behind foes heading to the half, angled four to five wide entering the lane but came up empty. BANDBOX
LEGACY saved ground under some early rating, came under a ride past the three eighths, eased out nearing the lane and faded. AUDIBLY lagged back
four wide, failed to go on under a ride leaving the three eighths, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R lacked speed, swung out near the three eighths pole, was five deep entering the stretch, swept to command under the whip approaching the
eighth pole then drew off. EXCELLORATOR chased the pace down the backstretch, gained the lead in the two path leaving the far turn, finished willingly but
was no match for the winner. VANCE SCHOLARS came out then bobbled soon after the break, was a forward factor along the inner rail, moved to the two
path turning for home and finished well. BOSS LOGIC , four wide on both turns, lacked a rally. BOB MARCO rushed up five wide entering the first turn, was
taken to the inner rail approaching the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn and tired. WHELEN SPRINGS chased the pace, was well positioned in the
three path leaving the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
U KNOW WHEN U KNOW steadied between rivals in the opening furlong, regrouped and dropped in to settled off the embattled leaders, worked outward to
advance four wide into the stretch, closed in under pressure and engaged SOUPER AMUSING nearing the furlong grounds, dueled on a slim lead near the
sixteenth marker then dug in between foes to prevail. MUN MUN CAN RUN , bumped at the break, was taken to rate then drafted back while saving ground
into the turn, gathered momentum past the three eighths and angled four wide into the lane, shifted further out near mid stretch, closed gamely outside the
winner and finished on even terms with SOUPER AMUSING. SOUPER AMUSING broke alertly, dropped in towards the inner rail and got engaged in a
spirited duel with GEM RUNNER, carried that battle around the turn and into the lane, got the better of that one then was soon taken on by the winner from
her outside, dug in to spar past the sixteenth pole, continued valiantly to the wire and wound up in a dead heat for second with MUN MUN CAN RUN. HIGH
BREEZE (FR) , reluctant to load, broke slowly and towards the inside then steadied when put in tight soon after, regrouped and raced well back into the
turn, saved ground around the turn, continued inside through the lane, finished well to gain and kept on nicely through the gallop out. MINDFUL ANGEL
rated off the duelers while saving ground, gained past the three eighths, tipped out to pursue in upper stretch but came up empty late. GEM RUNNER
quickly joined SOUPER AMUSING from her outside, dueled outside that one into and around the turn, stayed on past the three sixteenths, failed to go on
between foes near the furlong grounds and weakened. CURL N ROD , five wide off the duel, lacked a rally. SMILINGONTHEINSIDE broke outward
bumping a foe, corrected then was shuffled back a bit while saving ground towards the inside, raced well back into the stretch then offered some late
interest. IMPETUS ECHO (GB) chased the duelers while outside a rival, gained while angling three wide into the stretch, failed to go on leaving the three
sixteenths and weakened.
