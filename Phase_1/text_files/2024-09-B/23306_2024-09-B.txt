Footnotes
SYNERGISM set the pace racing with a clear lead, was pressured on the turn, responded when roused entering the stretch, dug in gamely outside of
MONA L, drifted in at the gap, then dueled to the wire and narrowly prevailed. MONA L was fractious loading, pulled early on the inside, then tracked nicely
on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, drifted in at the gap, then dueled to the wire and just missed. ZENITH was off slowly and steadied, raced
off the pace, chased on the turn and rallied mildly inside for third. FEEL THE BOLT trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into
the lane and lacked a rally. SWEET AND FEISTY raced off the pace, moved up between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. QUIZ WHIZ stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. A Jockey Objection by the rider of MONA L against the winner
was dismissed.

Footnotes
LOOK SHARP vied in the two path into the turn, shook free from inside rival in upper stretch, remained clear under a stout drive. WEMBY chased the pace
from the rail, under a serious ride nearing the quarter pole, inched his way into contention in upper stretch, but was out kicked to the wire. CLEVER TIGER
tracked the pace into the turn, bid three then four wide leaving the quarter pole, bested the rest and finished willingly to the wire, never a threat to the top
pair. TEAM TRAVIS broke a step behind the field, chased in the two path into the turn, saved ground around the bend, and had no response late. DUBAI
FIRE vied inside into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, and gave way to the wire. MR RAMIREZ raced off the pace and three wide into the turn,
under a drive leaving the three eighths marker, came up empty. LOVE ME ARCHIE lacked speed away from the gate, trailed into the turn, and never
threatened.
