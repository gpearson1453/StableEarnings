Footnotes
CHECKSFORCHARLIE pressed the pace along the inside, shifted out on the turn, bid between horses, assumed command and drew off. SEA OF INDY
was never far off the pace, dropped inside, advanced on the tur, closed steadily and got up late for place while no threat to the winner. POQUITO LADY
pressed the pace towardst the outside, rallied four wide on the turn, went widest in the drive, bid, hung late and held for show. TOMMY'S UP was sent to the
front, led to the turn, fell back, went evenly late and lost position. CHARLIE THYME pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, stayed close and lacked the
needed late rally. INDIAN RIDER was not a factor. TRUST PACO P broke slowly, trailed the field and was not urged.

Footnotes
BRAZEN NOW pressed the pace, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. HOGMANAY (IRE) pressed the pace along the
inside, awaited room on the turn, bid willingly to duel, led late and was outfinished in a good effort. POOF HE'S GONE set a pressured pace, responded
when challenged to duel, hung late and settled for show. MY DAD IS THIRSTY was slow early, steadily advanced along the inside, bid willingly and didn't
have enough late. PULPITS FOX raced in close towards the outside, swung wide leaving the turn and flattened out. NEW MEXICO JEREMY showed speed
to the turn and gave way. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) trailed the field.
