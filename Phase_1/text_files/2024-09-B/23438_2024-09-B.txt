Footnotes
SQUALOTORO was allowed to settle early from along the rail, stalked the pacesetters, responded gamely when asked and won driving. DR. DAVE
prompted the early pace, moved up alongside STONE CARVER to challenge the lead, dueled in the final turn, gained the advantage at the head of the lane
and was rundown. NORTHERN JEWEL trailed the field early, and closed belatedly. STONE CARVER vied for the early lead, set a pressured pace from just
off the rail, dueled in the final turn inside of DR. DAVE, was unable to move on into the lane, and gave way. LINCHPIN STORM failed to threaten. ALL RUN
offered little.

Footnotes
PUMP THE BRAKES broke alertly, contended the lead early, showed the way through the backstretch, held good margins entering the lane, was asked
once into the stretch but wasn't under any threat and was comfortably ridden out. WYE CROSS trailed early, advanced quickly outside in the final turn, and
rallied belatedly to earn second. JUMEIRAH COAST saved inside, was roused at the head of the stretch, rallied inside and missed. ROCK CHALK was five
wide into the opening turn, angled to the rail, chased the leader into the stretch and was caught. JULIUS THE GREAT contested the early pace while two
wide, and had nothing left in reserve late. SMARTY RIVER PANTS tracked four wide, and faded. MONEY MUNCHER tracked the pacesetters, and was
through early.

Footnotes
KAUAI DAN stalked inside, waited entering the final turn, roused when the rail opened up, and drew away. FOUR O SIX CREED shifted out leaving the
chute then angled to the rail, shifted outside when entering the last turn, and rallied late for place. TORIADOR was bumped leaving the chute, set the pace,
drifted wide in the final turn, and flattened out. POINT TO THE STARS saved early, lodged a bid then steadied into the final turn, and closed well.
READYTOTAPNSING stalked the pacesetters while three wide, and gave way. IT'S A FACT was not a factor. TOOL TIME drifted in bumping into
TORIADOR leaving the chute, prompted the pace, and stopped.

Footnotes
CASSANO was unhurried early from the three path, was asked to quicken and got by in time. WORKIN FOR THE MAN hustled away, set the early pace
from the rail, responded to a challenge from THUNDER GOLD, was under pressure through the stretch and was rundown. THUNDER GOLD pressed the
early pace while two to three wide, battled on through the stretch and was outkicked. RISING STRONG reserved off the early pacesetters, and bid
belatedly. ISABELLE ANNE tracked four to five wide, and lacked a closing response. STRATEGIC DECISION lacked a serious bid. PASSAGE trailed the
field, and showed some interest late. DA BOSS showed little. PADDY'S SPEEDSTER flashed early speed and tired. TRUE ALYBYE offered little.

Footnotes
HE'S A SAINT waited inside leaving the backstretch, found running room in the final turn along the rail, and won driving. PACHECO steadied in traffic early,
angled out sharply at the head of the lane, and closed gamely. BARAK settled three to four wide while in range of the leaders, and rallied belatedly to get up
for second. SILVERFOOT was four to five wide in the backstretch, rallied five wide into the stretch, and yielded late. MENDELJOHN (IRE) bumped leaving
the gate, stalked the early pace while two wide, moved up alongside MY BOY CHRISTIAN, and came up empty for the drive. DOC COPE saved ground
inside, and lacked the rally needed. MY BOY CHRISTIAN set the early pace, was under attack at the head of the lane and weakened. TRAPEZE failed to
threaten. CAPE'S LEGACY bumped at the start, was three wide into the opening turn, and was done early. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by
the rider of PACHECO against the rider HE'S A SAINT alleging interference away from the gate was not allowed.
