GILLIGAN away alertly, set all the pace and edged clear late under right handed encouragement. BOURBON OVER ICE was bumped at the start, saved
ground and finished second best. ROGER MCQUEEN never far back, finished best of the rest in the three path. THE RED MAN broke inward bumping
AWESOME ENOUGH into BOURBON OVER ICE at the start, raced outside and went evenly. KOSCIUSZKO pressed the pace two wide into the stretch
then faded. STAY THIRSTY AMIGO was no factor. AWESOME ENOUGH was bumped at the start, offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then came up
empty.

GREEK BOUTIQUE prompted the pace three then two wide into the turn, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace and
drew off under a hand ride to win going away. MOBIL ENSIGN stalked the early pace, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, had a mild late rally
and finished second best. IAMAMASON set a pressured pace along the rail until mid turn then was outfinished. PRAISE N GLORY trailed down the
backstretch and found her best stride late in the four path. PEEKABOO MOM well placed, failed to respond. DAH FUH bobbled at the start and was no
factor. PLAY BALL SUSIE was no threat. COUNT ON ME was through early. NOT JUST WILLOW was outrun.

DA JOURNEYGIRL hopped at the start, was hustled along to stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through deep stretch under left handed urging and
was along in time. QADIRA set the pace into the stretch, drifted out to the four path under left handed urging near the furlong marker and just missed
hanging on. MALI BALI never far back, finished with good courage five wide. PANOLA never far back, moved up along the rail into the turn, shifted out to
the four path past the three sixteenths pole, dropped back inside when the leader drifted out and finished determinedly. NOT OVER YET chased the early
pace along the inside then faded. LUNA PRIMAVERA checked between horses near the half mile marker then trailed.

Footnotes
BIG TRUCK trailed outside, circled his field under right handed urging through the stretch in the seven path and got up in the final stride. RED CHILI
PEPPER chased the pace along the inside into the turn, angled out past the quarter pole, drifted to the six path at the top of the stretch, rallied to make the
lead late and just missed hanging on. ZAKARIA broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker then was outfinished.
AUTHENTIC COWTOWN was fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. ROMANTIC COWBOY had speed into the turn
then weakened.
