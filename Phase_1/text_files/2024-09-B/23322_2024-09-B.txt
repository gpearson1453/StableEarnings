Footnotes
BAILAMOS was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside on the turn, came three wide off the bend and made a bid, went on even terms for
command by the sixteenth marker and edged clear to prove best under stiff drive. SECRET SATURDAY chased the pace and bulled his way between rivals
exchanging bumps with SUNSHINE JOHNNY from the half mile marker to the three eighths marker, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then
slowly gained in the lane but needed more. JEDI'S WAY set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn and then dug in determinedly nearing
the furlong marker, was headed by the sixteenth marker and was out-kicked. MITOLE'S WISH chased the pace on the inside and faded. TOADY HOPPER
was reluctant to load, settled three wide early, outside move on the turn to be six wide by the quarter pole, then lugged in thru the lane under steady right
handed crop. SUNSHINE JOHNNY chased the pace four wide, then exchanged bumps by the half mile marker and continued for about a furlong, then
weakened. SAGAMOOSE pressed the pace three wide and then stalked the pace three to four wide by the quarter pole and then was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
THEA'S THEME dueled for the early lead to the outside of CROSSTALK,, made a two wide bid to dispose of that rival and shake clear, then widened the
margin off the bend to be well clear by the furlong marker, then was tiring late but lasted to prove best under a drive. HAPPY TAPPY TIM was rated along
two wide, moved up between rivals leaving the three eighths marker, then checked by the five sixteenths when it appeared that OLIVE KAT came in a tad to
launch a move, then regrouped and came four wide off the bend and closed well to just miss late. OLIVE KAT tracked the early pace and made a three wide
move on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong, held show award. ILLUSION OF HOPE tracked the pace on the inside, eased off the rail on the turn to
move by the weakening CROSSTALK, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no kick. TESTED POSITIVE was bumped at the start, then was outrun
early and passed the tiring rivals. CROSSTALK dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. JAMESTOWN ROAD was settled early, three to four wide
on the turn and was not a threat.

three to four wide, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide off the turn but had no late kick. HONORABLE CHILL was five wide into the first

leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong. PINK ROSE was settled back early and lacked the needed winning rally. HUSHEMUP was settled early
on the inside and dropped back. DELIGHTFUL DIXIE chased the early pace two wide and then moved to the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN PASS TIME was settled early on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn, went on even terms for command nearing the furlong marker
and drew clear leaving the marker and then maintained a clear advantage to the wire to prove best. DOUBLE NICKEL was settled early between rivals,
swung out five wide leaving the turn and finished well to gain the place award. HEAVY EQUIPMENT rushed up the inside to duel for command then made a
bid on the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final furlong, bested
rest. I WANNA ROCK was settled early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole, came seven wide off the turn and had a mild late rally. CAPITAN GEORGE
tracked the early pace and was on the inside on the turn and weakened. JAKNAVA was settled early on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and
had no rally. OFFICE CORRUPTION dueled for the lead three to two wide and then was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HANKSDIVININGROD was allowed to settle along the inside, advanced on the inside on the far turn, made a two wide bid leaving the turn to take over, then
drew off to prove much the best under mild left handed crop urging '. BEAN MACHINE was reserved early three to two wide, then dropped to the inside on
the far turn, waited by the quarter pole, cut the corner leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. HOMER JONES was settled early two
wide, then saved ground on the far turn, came three wide off the turn and ran on to hold the show award. RAPTURE BAY was reserved on the inside,
advanced on the far turn and came two wide off the turn, then was blocked and had to steady nearing the furlong marker and then lacked the needed late
kick. TAKE THE PLEDGE was settled back early in between rivals, came six wide off the turn and improved position. BOLD LICORICE chased the pace
three to two wide, came four wide off the turn and weakened. AMERICAN WAR HERO was settled back early on the inside and lacked a serious rally.
MISSION MIKE was settled back on the outside, came wide into the lane and had no rally. K'S STORM READY chased the pace two wide and tired. SIR
MENDEL chased the pace four to three wide and tired. A G DIAMOND sprinted clear and opened up a huge lead on the backstretch, then was headed in
upper stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MEXICAN SUGAR was off a step slow, reserved towards the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole, swung out six wide leaving the turn, angled out
farther in the lane and closed full of run to get up in time under a drive. SWEET SUMMER LOVE tracked the early pace three to two wide, between rivals
nearing the quarter pole, then came five wide off the bend and made a bid to lead late but was caught late to just fail. DARK DUTCHESS was settled early
and saved ground on the turn, was boxed on the turn and waited leaving the turn, then was blocked nearing the furlong marker, split rivals leaving the
sixteenth marker and got the show award late. PESADILLA CHANEL tracked the pace along the inside and cut the corner leaving the turn to make a bid but
could not sustain that bid losing the show award late. LITA was off a step slow, chased the pace on the outside and four wide on the turn, came six wide off
the bend and ran on but needed more. RECKLESS KELLY pressed the pace in between rivals and came three wide off the turn but faded late. LEGEND OF
LIGHT was reserved early, swung wide leaving the turn and had no rally. LITTLE HOT MESS chased the pace in between rivals, shuffled back on the turn,
came seven wide leaving the turn and faded. CHALICE pressed the pace three to four wide and then was empty inn the drive. FOREST FUEL set a
pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
BUBBLING UP pressed the early pace two wide in hand, made a bid to shake clear by the three eighths marker, then was headed and dueled for the lead
on the inside, shook clear leaving the turn and then drew off to prove much the best under a drive. CODE NAME WILLOW was away alertly then rated on
the outside, made a four wide move on the turn and dueled with the winner nearing the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for that rival in the final
furlong while clearly second best. TACTICAL JOKE was rated along the inside early, then made a mild bid two wide on the turn, came into the lane on the
inside but weakened, bested rest. BOLD BOSS set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. SPICY K stumbled at the break, was far back early, four
wide into the lane and was not a factor. X GENE stalked the pace three wide and then was empty. PER RULING 2024-16835 FROM HISA, SPICY K WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH TO UNPLACED FOR EXCESSIVE CROP USE.

NORTHWOODS off to a slow start trailed the field to the quarter pole, bid five wide in upper stretch, racing on his left lead fought hard to draw even with the
leader, and went clear under a drive. MORALES LITTLE KID set the pace from the start, unchallenged leaving the quarter pole, weakened in upper stretch,
was caught in side the sixteenth pole, and held the place. GRAND BEY chased the pace from the two path, came under a drive leaving the quarter pole,
and flattened out to the wire. JACK CLOUD slow into stride, under a drive around the turn, never threatened through the stretch.
