Footnotes
TIZ DASHING was last to commence but broke with the rest of the field, settled under some urging on the outside, was roused while four wide on the turn,
rallied outside in upper stretch, moved in while gaining fast on the leaders coming to the eighth-pole, dueled outside of the runner-up while finished very
strongly in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. HIT THAT REVIEW (IRE) moved in while settling towards the rear, went around the
turn in the two path, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the three path then moved further out, rallied inside of the winner and
gained fast, came in while shadowed in by that foe near the eighth-pole, dueled with good energy in the final furlong and just missed while well clear for the
place. NOD TO TRAN settled into stride, saved ground early on the turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend, swung out to the five path into upper
stretch, swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and earned the show. MY MAN MAGOO chased the leading trio on the outside, moved
in near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive in upper stretch, bumped with a foe near the furlong marker and
tired. REPLEVIN showed speed on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, swapped
to the proper lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, was forced in when being swallowed up by the top two near the furlong marker then bumped lightly with a
rival and weakened. LUCAS'S MISCHIEF showed speed between horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn, battled under a drive
while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch then swapped to the proper lead, bumped with foes while carried in some and being passed quickly by
the top two near the furlong marker and also weakened. DEVIL OF RAMADI showed speed under urging while inside of two opponents, vied along the rail
on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
DEBATE broke a step slow, angled in at the rear of the field, was urged along while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, moved to the four path
while gaining outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the seven path, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late and
prevail. TWO FOR CHARGING settled off the pace, began to climb into kickback near the five-eighths pole, was urged while continuing to climb until early
on the turn, raced in the three path while leveling out some on that bend, swung into the six path entering the stretch, rallied on the inside of the winner,
closed fast to get the lead for several strides inside the sixteenth-pole but was denied while clear for the place. HEARD ON THESTREET jostled with foes
on both sides entering the main-track, jostled repeatedly with WATASHA while between horses on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn,
gained to take the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the show. PARKERNESS moved in
while going to the front then showed the way, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, fought into the final furlong and tired.
ARREBATO dropped off the pace then was put to urging, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. WATASHA jostled repeatedly with HEARD ON
THESTREET while between foes on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and capitulated. MR. SWAGGER was
hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path and failed to threaten. BADLANDS RULER jostled with a rival
entering the main-track, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the four path, remained on his inside lead until near the furlong
marker then swapped to the proper lead and faltered.

JUST KATHERINE broke out at the start brushing BRAGANZA, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take narrow command inside the
eighth pole, dug in gamely to hold sway to the finish. BRAGANZA got brushed at the start by JUST KATHERINE, who broke outwards, chased four then two
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to be on near even terms for command inside the
eighth pole, then got repelled to the wire. EVERYONELOVESLINDA chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to the finish to procure the show
honors. DREAM CONCERT five wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. OLGA ISABEL showed the way from the four path down the
backstretch before tucking to the inside into the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and
yielded inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. MY KENTUCKY GIRL broke out at the start carrying out EVERYONELOVESLINDA briefly,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went four to five wide at the top of the stretch and was eased
home to the end.

Footnotes
REFLEXIVITY (IRE) was bumped at the start, showed speed on the outside, dropped from the two path to the rail while inside of a rival on the turn, was
asked near the quarter-pole then shook off that foe when set down in upper stretch, responded well under the crop in the final furlong and proved much the
best under strong urging. MISS BOURBON settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted to the three then four path late on that
bend, was roused near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and was second best. JUSTHEART
was away awkwardly, settled towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, swung out to the five path into upper stretch and improved to just get the
show. MAGIC EIGHT BALL tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three then two path on the turn, lost
touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and tired then was just caught for the show. RIVER TAY (IRE) moved out while settling towards the
rear, went around most of the turn in the three then four path, shifted to the five then six path late on that bend and lacked the needed response. TURRIGA
broke out and bumped with an opponent, showed speed on the inside of the winner, dropped off the pace near the seven-sixteenths, chased inside to the
two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three path and came up empty. SHAMAN PRINCESS bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed
just off the pace, dropped back some near the seven-sixteenths pole, was roused while saving ground on the turn and failed to respond. AMY'S LIGHT
angled in while off the pace near the five-eighths pole, moved from the three path to the five path late on the turn and failed to threaten. VALENTINE GIFT
was rated off the pace, came under some urging in the two then three path on the turn, dropped back while not being asked for her best into upper stretch,
raced in hand behind horses inside the three-sixteenths and failed to impact while not urged through the drive. RAININGATTHEBEACH bumped with a rival
while last to commence, was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path late on the turn and was no factor.

DONEGAL SURGES broke very alertly, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths,
dropped from the two path to the inside on the far turn, chased the vanguard into upper stretch, angled out outside the furlong marker, rallied to the lead into
final sixteenth then moved clear under good handling. MAMA'S GOLD established a forward position early, raced in the three path on the first turn,
prompted the pace on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, battled
outside of PENTATHLON into the final furlong, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken by the winner while able to get the place. PENTATHLON went
to the front, showed the way on the inside while inside of a rival, was asked late on the far turn, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole, fought on
with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then weakened but was clear for the show. PIRATE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
roused in the two then three path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY was taken in hand early, tucked into the three
path into the first turn, was rated in the second flight, came under urging near the half-mile pole, chased in the three path on the far turn,turned into the
stretch in the four path, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SUN THUNDER went around the first turn in the three then four path, settled on the
outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased in the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and was used up. JACKSON
HEIGHTS was taken up in tight between horses after the start, angled in quickly at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the
backstretch, was urged along with five furlongs to run, went around the far turn in the four then five path and failed to threaten. PADDINGTON was away
awkwardly, dropped well back early, raced in the two path on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the three then
four path, remained on his inside lead in the drive and was no factor. DIGITAL OPS went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed towards the
front, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch and retreated. FROMANOTHAMUTHA was moving around when the gate latch was sprung and
broke near the back, shifted from the four path to the five path early on the first turn, settled off the pace, angled in near the five-eighths pole, raced inside to
the two path on the far turn and failed to respond.

NO MO CANDY lunged at the break getting away a half a beat slow and was hustled to establish the front, showed the way in hand along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and gamely repelled the challenge to inch away inside the
sixteenth marker and prevail. DANCING DEAN bobbled and was bumped between foes and pinched back at the start conceding four lengths to the front,
saved ground near the rear of the field through to the far turn when tipped out two then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to
six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish to secure the place honors. PRETTY ANA broke in at the start, tracked the leader just off the
inside in closest aim coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid to challenge for command
just outside the eighth pole, then got rebuffed inside that station and was then nailed on the wire for the place honors while clear for the show. ELLE EST
FORTE bobbled at the start and conceded four to five lengths to the front, settled just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. VINO ROUGE three wide through the first turn, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOLD LIGHTNING three
then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SASSY
PRINCESS four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered no kick. DETERMINED LILLY broke out at the start bumping DANCING DEAN in tandem with TOY COLLECTOR, tracked the pace along the inside
forwardly placed, got eased off near the nine-sixteenths when GOLD LIGHTNING tucked in to the outside and faded dropping back to last through the far
turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and was under a light drive when empty. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK tracked the front just off the inside and then
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. TOY COLLECTOR broke in at the
start bumping DANCING DEAN in concert with DETERMINED LILLY, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to
four wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
PAST TENSE settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, slipped through inside of a rival near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path into
the stretch, rallied to get the lead just inside the furlong marker then moved clear under a strong hand-ride, swapped back to her inside lead late and
prevailed. PHILLY'S FINEST bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was placed under a vigorous hold while up close early, steadied while rank under
restraint into the first turn, dropped from the three path to the two path on that bend, was reserved off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn,
dropped to the rail while asked coming to the quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and willingly earned the place.
TRUE MYTH bumped with foes on both sides at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the outside near the back, was asked in the three
then four path on the far turn and improved to just get the show. SALE LEASEBACK (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the
turns and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. AMERICAN KESTREL inherited the lead under snug restraint when nobody else was
interested in the front, tugged on the bit in the two to three path on the first turn, moved in early on the backstretch, showed the way under restraint, was let
out in the two path on far turn, came under a right-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead when
switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner at that point and weakened then just missed the superfecta. CAPO
DONNA moved in nearing the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, was reserved off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the far
turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) traveled around the first turn in the two path,
was reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole and failed to rally. EXOTIC CAT saved ground while reserved
near the back, moved off the rail late on the turn then was roused and failed to threaten. JENAS MERCY broke out and bumped with a foe, was taken under
a very strong hold early, raced in the two path on the first turn, was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and
capitulated. WILD IRIS went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the far turn, dropped back
into the stretch and had nothing left. BAM BAM was bumped at the start then forced soundly into another foe, steadied off heels early, went five wide on the
first turn, dropped to the rear on the backstretch and was pulled up then transported off the course via equine ambulance.
