Footnotes
UNAUDITED vied inside of DEVIL'S SHADOW around the first turn, continued on equal terms up the backstretch, shook clear three furlongs from home
while still unleashed, came two wide into stretch, roused for more, had plenty left in reserve and drew off. CARGO PANTS tracked the embattled pair
around the first turn and up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the final turn, sustained bid into stretch run and cleared second best. DEVIL'S
SHADOW vied outside of UNAUDITED around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not move on with eventual winner entering the final turn,
continued to chase two wide into stretch and ran along for a share. CAN'T BE CAUGHT was unhurried through early stages, hustled up along the inside on
the final turn, ran on into upper stretch then came up empty and retreated. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

MEDICINE TAIL vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free approaching the quarter pole, turned back the inside bid from LATE FOR LUNCH near the
furlong marker, fought on gamely and held late over fast gaining runner up. OCEAN OF STORMS was reserved and raced well off the pace up the
backstretch, swung five wide into action entering upper stretch, closed willingly along the outside but was too late to reach the winner. LATE FOR LUNCH
vied for the lead in the opening quarter then sat off the top pair around the turn, launched a rebid along the inside at the head of the lane, advanced into
striking distance a furlong out then failed to sustain bid and flattened out. COST BASIS raced in range up the backstretch, came under right handed
pressure three wide at the head of the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. HIDE THE DEMON was forwardly placed along the rail in opening
stages then weakened off the top flight, shifted out four wide entering the head of the lane, came under right handed pressure and lacked a needed rally.
TRIPULANTE vied for the lead up the backstretch and into the turn, could not move on with eventual winner approaching the quarter pole and faded in the

YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW saved ground around the first turn then tipped out aa couple paths and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, moved up three
paths wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, took over the lead at the head of the lane and finished going away. GREY STORM pressed the pace
leaving the first turn and continued to apply pressure to EL ROJO VIVO up the backstretch, forced the issue into the far turn, was no match when the winner
took over at the head of the lane, ran on and finished second best. EL ROJO VIVO came under pressure leaving the first turn and continued with a slim lead
over GREY STORM up the backstretch, held a slim lead under pressure with the added challenge of YOURINTHEARMYNOW at the quarter pole, got
collared by the winner at the head of the lane, kept on and cleared the rest. DINNER AT CRUMPIES raced in the back up the backstretch, came three wide
into upper stretch and never threatened. ROCKSTAR RED settled off the early pace, failed to advance when called upon around the final turn and had no
response in the lane. DARYL'S BOLT was forwardly placed around the first turn then weakened upon entering the backstretch and failed to move back into
contention.

Footnotes
BRUMBODOPPELGANGER sped to the lead at the start and continued on top around the turn, widened advantage upper stretch and continued clear,
handily. JUST BARB drifted in sharply at the start then was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, sustained bid into the lane and cleared second
best. VICTORIAN SECRET raced in contention then got in tight and steadied along the rail around the turn, quickly dropped back, made a rebid at the head
of the lane and cleared a share. MORA HOPPERTUNITY broke out at the start and came away a step slow, was ridden racing off the top trio into the turn,
hustled along two wide into upper stretch and failed to kick on. SMILING BONITA was off a step slow at the start, roused forward and raced off the top pair
around the turn then weakened in the lane. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
