Footnotes
A CASE OF YOU well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in and got through inside the leader into the stretch,
edged ahead, then drew off and was kept to the task. VERBAL GEYSER (FR) led in the early going, was rated inside the leader, angled out down the
backstretch, gained a short lead on the two path through the second turn, then was no match for the winner and held the place. GOOGLY EYES well placed
and off the rail, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong, holding the show.
AZTEC PRINCESS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share.
CRIMSON PRINCESS well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded the
final furlong. PATH TO VICTORY was no factor. HOUSE OF MELODY set the pace off the rail, shook clear down the backstretch, then faded into the
stretch.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S TREASURE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. BEADS tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled four wide for clear racing room, made a steady gain, edged up for
the place and missed the win. PURR FACTOR well placed, moved to position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
could not match strides with that one, weakened late and held the show. MIDNIGHT FAME loose behind the gate, was unsettled once loaded, looped up
three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. LOVE RESTRAINED stalked the pace on the outside and faded
through the turn.

Footnotes
PHONE EATS FIRST broke in at the start, moving up quickly to the well placed outside, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, dueled with that one and edged ahead in the final strides. KATHLYNS PHALANX sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, dueled with the winner and was outfinished by that one. BANANA PUDDING never far back, moved up
while angling out through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, evened and gained the show. SWEET LILIBET broke out at the start, moved up quickly
to stalk the pace outside, lost some position steadying on the two path, then flattened in the lane. STARCRY tracked the pace, lost some position on the two
path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. NOBLE DISGUISE bumped by both sides at the start, steadied,
clipped heels, stumbling after the start, then was no factor. UPTOWN CAT was never involved. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF
STARCRY AGAINST THE RIDER OF SWEET LILIBET FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SHY DA RUNNER stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, dueled with the leader, edged
ahead of that one, then edged up for the win in the final strides. LEONARD'S LEGACY tracked the pace, raced boxed through the turn, got through inside
the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead inside the furlong marker, then was outfinished. FACE DOWN well placed and outside, moved
up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then could not threaten and held the show. LOOKIN TO EXCEL set the pace just off the rail,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, dueled, then weakened late and held a share. JOHN DUTTON passed tiring rivals, outside. HARBOR OF
GOLD never far back, lost some position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded. WILLIE WANDO was no factor.

GRAEL never far back, moved up while angling out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong
marker and held. CALL THE BALL mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
BACKDOORPARTY lost his path at the start and was allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, angled widest in the stretch, closed fast
and gained the show. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a
share. COUPLES THERAPY well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then had no rally.
SPERANZAS WILL unsettled in the gate, was rated close up, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. OSBIN sprinted to clear lead
pulling off the rail, then faded in the lane. UP FOR THE CHANCE fractious in the gate, was no factor.

Footnotes
FAMOUS FINAL SCENE allowed to settle, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drove clear late. TIZ WICKED STRONG never far back, moved up down the backstretch, gained a short lead on the two path through the second
turn, then was no match late, while clearly best of the rest. FROZEN FOUR broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up two and three wide through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. ADIOS ASHWOOD well placed and outside, stalked the leader down the
backstretch, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. BIANCA rated inside, inherited the
lead, then lost some ground through the second turn and had no stretch rally. MALIBU KNIGHT set the early pace off the rail, bolted and fell over the
outside fence. A ATEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
