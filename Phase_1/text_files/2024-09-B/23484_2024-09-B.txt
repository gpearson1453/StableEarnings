WAYS AND MEANS came away in good order, disputed the pace while loosely between horses then outside of a rival late on the backstretch, vied in the
two path on the turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and powered away under a strong hand-ride to prove much the
best. NIC'S STYLE drifted in at the start but broke in front, showed speed on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths pole, battled under the crop in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. STERLING SILVER was carried in
at the start and last into stride, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while best of the rest. HOT FUDGE broke out at the start, showed speed on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the turn
and tired. PACIFIC ROSE broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two then three path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
came up empty.

runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. CLASSIC MARK broke out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, made a bid in the
six then five path on the turn, dueled with the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. HIGH HEAT broke alertly then was well placed just
off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path while asked near the five-sixteenths pole, pursued the top two in the stretch and narrowly earned the show.

missed the show. ROCK THE WEEKEND chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five then four wide on the turn, came six wide into

the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive, rallied up the inside to take command just outside the sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to
prevail. FRIZZANTE coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside in the three path between foes down the backstretch before advancing
tucked to the two path through the turn, dueled with the leader through the bend coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, seized command with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat and was caught nearing the sixteenth marker, ran on clear for the place honors. AZ
U CHASE ME brushed the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. WILLINTORISKITALL coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the
inside under pressure from a pair of rivals latched on to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and had one of those foes advance and dueled through the
turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded the front at the three-sixteenths, then weakened
in the late stages. UNCORRELATED prompted the pace four wide outside the top pair, tucked three wide into the turn and was shaken off and gave chase
coming under urging with three furlongs remaining, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. MASTERWORK chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, tired. UNION EXPRESS broke out at the start bumping
OFFICER DERICK, chased three then two wide quickly growing detached at the tail of the field, came under a drive at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OFFICER DERICK got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, chased five then

Footnotes
BOURBON DAY coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch, advanced on the
leader to take over with three furlongs to run, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and surged clear under a
drive to prevail. HAMILTON'S WAY chased along the inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. PANDAGATE three wide through the first turn, chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened to the finish. RUNNIN' RAY hustled from the gate, showed
the way in hand just off the inside, came under urging when under pressure the initial time near the seven-sixteenths, yielded the front with three furlongs to
go, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CLASSIC CREATION brushed the off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide
growing quickly detached from the rest of the field, went five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
