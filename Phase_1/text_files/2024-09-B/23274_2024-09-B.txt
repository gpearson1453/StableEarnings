KICHI KITSU sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won under strong handling. DRIVEN FOR SUCCESS chased
the winner near the inside through the turn, shifted out to the six path at the top of the stretch and finished well clear for second. OUT MY DEAR unhurried
early, passed tiring rivals through deep stretch along the inside. PANAMANIAC chased the winner two wide into the stretch then weakened. HIGH FIRE was
fractious in the gate and never threatened. TRULY INCLUSIVE settled three wide, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack turning for home then flattened
out.

HIGH TOLE was fractious in the gate, prompted the pace along the inside past the seven sixteenths pole, made the lead, widened into the stretch under left
handed urging and won as much the best. SLEW CROWN stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch and held on for second.
SIP'N' SPEED unhurried early, altered course to the six path at the top of the stretch then closed rapidly to just miss second. DREAMING OF WAR broke in
front, set a pressured pace two wide for a little over a quarter mile, had speed into the stretch then weakened. MISS LITTLE BIT had speed two wide into
the turn then gave way. JENN SWEET JENN was no factor. JEMEL ducked out at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VERNON'S BEST set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out under left handed urging from the four path to the eight path through the
final stages bumping the runner up and just lasted. STRIKE PLATE pressured the winner two wide into the stretch, was carried out to the middle of the
racetrack, bumped late by the winner and just missed in a game effort. FORMYBOYS with the second flight, was carried out to the six path nearing the top
of the stretch, altered course inward to the four path and finished best of rest. DON'T TIZ MAX failed to menace. COLORFUL LAD stalked the pace along
the inside into the stretch then faded. HIDDEN HEART had brief speed three wide. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF
STRIKE PLATE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED VERNON'S BEST AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

MAJESTIC FLAG never far back, responded with a rapid move three wide in upper stretch to make the lead before the furlong marker, drifted inward at the
eighth pole while under a hand ride, was righted and drew away late under left handed urging. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY stalked the pace along the rail into the
stretch, checked at the eighth pole, shifted out to the four path and came on again to gain second. HITSVILLE never far back, finished with good courage in
the five path. ROAD TO STARDOM failed to menace. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD brushed the gate at the start, prompted the pace two wide into the turn
then gradually weakened. WITHOUT OBJECTION rushed to the lead, set the pace in the two path into the stretch, checked inside the winner at the furlong
marker then lost momentum. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
