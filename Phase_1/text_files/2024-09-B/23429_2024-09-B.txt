Footnotes
FEAR OF UNION saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled to to be four-wide coming to the quarter pole, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and
quickly drew clear. SEVEN TAYLORS vied with STRADIVARIAN for the lead from along the outside, took the lead from that one between calls in the stretch
but was unable to resist the winner but held on well for second in a good effort. LEBOMBO was unhurried early, moved up two-wide between horses on the
turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. STRADIVARIAN vied with SEVEN TAYLORS for the lead from along the inside into the stretch and
weakened late. SOUND OF VICTORY settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
ROSENOW was off a step slow then saved ground and was not a factor. TRAP LINE tracked the pace for five furlongs while three-wide and gave way, then
was found to have bled.

Footnotes
FOREVER HOME was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to challenge SUMMER OF MISCHIEF nearing the eighth pole and prevailed
under strong handling. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF bobbled at the start then quickly recovered to set the pace, responded when challenged by FOREVER
HOME nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist that one in the late stages in a game effort. MAZOKU was reserved of the early pace, moved up
four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. SEQUIN LADY was allowed to settle while racing two-wide on the turn but lacked the needed
late response. SAVE THE BEES was close-up while racing along the inside and tired after a half mile. A NEW PEACE was unhurried early, rallied five-wide
into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. ANN KOR steadied shortly after the start from between horses then dropped back, came six-wide into the
stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HIGH FASHION KATE came in at the start then prompted TENENBAUM while racing two-wide, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and
quickly drew clear. DARK FURY was reserved off the early pace, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. GOURMET was pinched back at the
start then was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CANDY CRAZE was allowed to settle while saving ground,
swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and finished in a late rally. TENENBAUM saved ground setting the pace to near the eighth pole and weakened.
KRICKLE was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out to be three-wide nearing the eighth pole but lacked a rally. SASSY WALKER dropped back
early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved her position. RED HOT JEANIE settled in the middle of the field while saved ground and failed to
seriously threaten. EDGE OF TOWN was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SCRUPULOUS broke out then was allowed
to settle and failed to menace.

Footnotes
AMBER CASCADE saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be five-wide coming to the quarter pole and finished fast to be up in the final
seventy yards. TWEETSTER was close-up while racing two-wide, lacked room when in traffic nearing the three-eighths pole, came six-wide into the stretch
and closed strongly. PEIGNOIR was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist
the top two late in a game effort. RED RIVER MAGIC saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened slightly late. STARINA saved ground
while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and was gaining slightly late. YES TO CHAMPAGNE saved ground tracking the pace, slipped
through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. LETSTALKABOUTME was reserved off the pace, came two-wide into the
stretch and was not a factor. CURL GIRL settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MIDSUMMER MARCH
prompted the issue for six furlongs while two-wide and tired. PLAYBACK dropped back and trailed.

Footnotes
BOURBON'S FAULT broke out then stalked CRUSHED IT while racing two-wide, ran that one down to take the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly
drew clear. HANGIN IN THERE steadied and brushed with ATLANTIC CAT early, then was unhurried, rallied three-wide into the stretch and finished
strongly. DEPUTY MISCHIEF was off a step slow then was unhurried, came six-wide into the stretch and rallied late. NEON NIGHTS was forwardly placed
while saving ground, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. CAFE RACER settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into
the stretch and lacked a rally. HOLSTER was allowed to settle, came two-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. CRUSHED IT sprinted clear
early then saved ground setting the pace to near the eighth pole and gave way readily when headed. VARVATOS was prominent early while racing
two-wide and weakened. ATLANTIC CAT brushed with HANGIN IN THERE early then raced in the middle of the pack for a half mile and tired. THE
JOCKEY OF HANGIN IN THERE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAIN BOURBON'S FAULT IN REGARDS TO THE START OF THE RACE BUT AFYTER
