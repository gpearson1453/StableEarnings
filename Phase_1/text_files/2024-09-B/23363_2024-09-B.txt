Footnotes
RASHMI was away alertly to lead in the beginning, rated kindly to sit behind the front pair on the rail in the early going, was forced to move in to keep
forward position at the three furlong pole, vied for the front with rivals on both sides at the quarter pole, was coaxed for more to spurt away from the field in
upper stretch and powerfully opened up under a hand ride for the win at the finish line. JUST MAGNIFICENT settled near the rear on the fence in the early
stages, began to pick up rivals inside at the quarter pole lengthening stride, shifted out for clear run five wide at the top of the lane and was full of run to just
get up to best the rest at the finish line outside. ENGLISH JUBILEE was unhurried to trail in the first turn, continued to gallop along co-trailing outside with
four furlongs from home, started to mount a rally three wide around foes at the three eighths pole, angled out four wide gaining on horses straightening for
home and was just outfinished between rivals for the runners up share. SILENT AND SINFUL took this field into the first turn while on the fence, was
relegated to a prompting role on the inside at the half mile marker, opened up to regain the lead when the other speed foe called it a day at the three furlong
pole, was collared outside by a couple of runners at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and faded late to settle on the fringes in
the end. UNDER AGREEMENT (FR) broke out on the start, settled on the rail in the third tier into the first of two turns, closed the gap, saving ground on the
fence in the far turn to sit behind the embattled trio turning for home but could only finished up one paced inside foes in the lane. EMPIRE'S TREAT stalked
in the third flight on the outside into the first turn, made an early move three deep improving outside down the backstretch, bid for the lead three wide at the
quarter pole, could not sustain the rally by upper stretch and yielded in the four path at the furlong marker. FROGINAPOND tracked outside in the second
flight beside the eventual winner, could not make any impression when the pace quickened on the final bend and lacked a rally in the stretch drive. BIG
DRAMA DIVA was brushed inside to begin, prompted the pace while eager outside into the first turn, had a slim lead outside at the half, could not keep up
with the leaders with three eighths remaining, backed away abruptly around the final turn and galloped home crossing the wire.

Footnotes
NO TIME assumed command with a slim lead between foes at the start under a snug hold, was moving smoothly up top while slowing the pace down
running around the turn and had more to offer in the two path for the stretch drive to hold off all challengers at the finish line by a comfortable but diminishing
margin. AFLEET FLATTER forced the issue on the rail in the beginning, was reined back to track behind the frontrunner throughout the turn, shifted out for a
clear path to challenge three wide turning for home and chased the winner in vain while narrowing the advantage at the wire. KEYTOTHEPARK hopped
slightly on the break, settled in the third flight between foes down the back straight, galloped along under a good rhythm while on hold with three eighths left
to run, rallied seven wide outside rivals in upper stretch, was gaining gradually at the wire but had to settle for a non-threatening third at the finish. TIZ HER
MONEY kept a close eye on the front threesome, watching on the rail through the early parts of the race, skimmed the fence straightening out for the drive
and finished up willingly for a minor role on the rail in the end. ARISTELLA was unhurried near the back of the pack between horses in the early stages of
the race, shifted out five wide behind rivals looking for a seam at the top of the lane, found a clear path going seven wide at the furlong pole and when clear,
came with a good late kick. ORIENT BEACH was under a tight hold between foes just behind the front trio in the early going, had a little bit of traffic
problems between runners trying to find a seam in the four path straightening out for home and could only finish up one paced in the stretch running.
SERENADING KITTEN veered out on the break to stalk near the rear on the fence, took the short way around through the turn keeping pace with rivals but
could not get involved in the drive to the wire. SPUN AROUND prompted the pace three deep down the backstretch, continued to hound the pacesetter on
the outside flank around the bend, was in the thick of things four wide turning for home but wilted with runners on either side at the furlong pole. LADY IZZY
had a stalking position three deep close to the rear along the backside, made little improvement three wide through the turn and had no rally to give seven
wide in the run down the stretch. SALMIAKKI was outside runners tracking the front three down the backside, offered a mild run three wide outside at the
three-furlong pole to be in range angling out to the six path for the drive but needed more late, giving way between runners at the furlong marker. CRIMSON
SEA stalked in the third flight while three deep on the outside, made little headway still going three wide around the bend, angled out seven wide for the
drive but failed to make a presence down the lane. SNATCHED was bumped by the inside rival on the break, trailed throughout and could not play a role in
the stretch running.

Footnotes
RHAENYS was in a good spot on the fence tracking the front pair in the backstretch, kept pace while waiting for the cue to go around the bend, angled off
the dueling leaders three wide in the stretch, took control outside with seventy yards from the line and just had enough left to hold off the late closer for the
score. TANDHONEYWITHANE traded blows with the outside foe at the start, stalked near the back of the field down the back straight, moved well on the
fence passing runners through the turn, gathered moment shifting out three wide turning for home, was checked briefly losing its path in upper stretch and
was resilient in the lane, closing smartly late to just miss getting up for the win. SEVEN P R C chased the pacesetter along the backside outside, edged
closer to the leader to bid outside in midturn, poked his head in front briefly between rivals in the two path at the furlong pole. could not find another gear late
to fend off the charge from the winner and faded to settle for a clear third in the end. MEAN TO ME was pushed out on the break, tracked three wide on the
outside along the backside, sat just outside in the three path behind the embattled duo at the quarter pole, was in the hunt four wide turning for home and
finished up evenly in the lane to be a fringe player at the wire. SWEET PASSIONS travelled on the rail in mid-division in the early going, shifted out while
under a ride in the two path with a quarter mile left to run, angled out some more to be six wide with a chance for a share of the prize at the top of the
stretch, was on the wrong lead under left-handed encouragement in the lane and lacked a finish to the wire. POCKET PAIR broke in, exchanging bumps
with another foe on the start to be ahead of only one rival down the backside, made no progression while two wide through the turn and showed some
interest to pass tired ones in the stretch drive. TABEI stumbled and veered out badly on the break, recovered quickly to seize command inside along the
backstretch, was hounded outside by a rival midway on the turn, fought on stubbornly on the rail until the sixteenth pole, had no more to give and retreated
in deep stretch. TOP OF D MOUNTAIN travelled in mid-pack between foes in the beginning, was scrubbed on three wide at the quarter pole making little
gain, angled out seven wide in upper stretch but failed to fire driving to the wire. J M R TACITA settled three deep in midfield, was hard ridden three wide at
the three furlong pole making no impact through the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch run. SIL'S GAMBLE was bumped from the inside forcing
others out at the start, trailed throughout and failed to menace in the stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #3 TANDHONEYWITHANE AGAINST #6

Footnotes
WHISPER NOT (GB) was taken a strong hold of heading to the first turn taking back off the leaders and shifting in to track in behind inside just off the rail,
bided time on the far turn, came out past the quarter pole turning for home, struck the lead near the furlong marker and drew clear. FIGHTER IN THE WIN
broke well, set the early pace but was then prompted and pressured by an outside foe, regained the lead and set the pace shadowed by that one, drifted out
a bit leaving the far turn, kept on well to hold second while not able to kick on with the winner. BREAKING ALONE was brushed at the start, stalked outside
in behind the leaders three wide early then wider up the backstretch, advanced some four to six wide on the far turn, kept on in the stretch but missed place.
STEAK AND CHEESE prompted the pace from outside, was mostly three to four wide throughout, bid at the five-sixteenths, floated wider for the drive,
drifted a bit in the stretch and was outkicked. ELUSIVE KNIGHT brushed runners lightly at the start, angled in early, saved ground off the pace near the rail,
was under urging coming to the quarter pole, came out in the stretch, sought to advance between runners where room was lacking and had to steady late.
MEHLEK unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung ten wide into upper stretch and passed rivals. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS was encouraged from the start
while being guided off the rail, raced four to five wide on the far turn, came out further for the drive, needed more. JIM'S HOPE was lightly bumped at the
start, raced outside toward the back, was three wide through the far turn before coming out, failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF ELUSIVE KNIGHT AGAINST BOTH BREAKING ALONE AND STEAK AND CHEESE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

AND ONE MORE TIME vied between runners down the backstretch, hounded the pace outside at the half, shifted out four wide between foes taking closer
order grinding between horses at the furlong pole and found another gear late to inch away for the gutsy win at the wire. VIXEN prompted the pace three
deep along the backstretch, was reined back a touch to track the top two rivals three wide around the bend, angled out six wide having clear run turning for
home, moved in to duel up front outside at the furlong pole, dug in tenaciously late but was just outkicked in the final few strides before the finish line.
NITROGEN assumed the lead inside down the backside, continued to dictate terms up front while shadowed on the outside by the winner throughout the
turn, fought on courageously clinging onto the lead in the stretch with rivals closing in and just gave way grudgingly to the stablemates late to settle for a
clear third. ITALIAN SOIREE tracked the lead threesome while outside a rival down the back straight, kept pace with the front three runners between horses
in the turn, angled four wide just behind the embattled trio straightening out for the drive, shifted out further in the six path with an eighth to go and won the
minor battle to settle on the fringes at the wire. READY TO BATTLE was brushed outside to be near the back of the field in the beginning, took closer order
smartly on the fence by the half, shifted out five wide at the top of the lane, drifted in under right-handed encouragement at the furlong marker and just
missed for a small piece of the prize. ANNASCAUL had a good position on the rail tracking the top three in the early going, sat patiently behind the
frontrunner on the fence throughout the turn waiting for the cue, skimmed the fence turning for home in range of the contesting leaders and was willingly in
the lane but lost the duel for a minor role in the end. READY FOR CANDY was ahead of one runner down the backside, made little advance three wide with
rivals on both sides around the turn, shifted out eight wide straightening for the wire and passed some tired horses in the stretch. MOUNTAIN BREEZE
(IRE) travelled in mid-division four deep down the back straight, was shuffled back four wide at the half to be near the rear on the turn, put in a mild rally
around foes with three furlongs from the wire, angled out in the seven-path turning for home but was only one paced in the stretch running. WILL REIGN
was brushed inside to begin, stalked under a snug hold close to the back of the pack down the backstretch, kept pace in the two path between runners
around the bend, could not find more for the drive and evened out at the furlong marker. THREAD settled three deep near the back of the pack along the
backstretch, could see the field while saving ground through the turn and offered little run on the fence down the lane. ARCTIC VELOCITY settled in
mid-pack between runners in the early stages, could not keep up with rivals with three furlongs to go, backed away through the field in the six path turning
for home and was empty for the stretch drive.

FASHIONABLY FAB settled off the pace racing off the rail in the two to three path, steadily advanced inside foes but still off the fence on the far turn and
without being asked, found room past the quarter pole as a rival shifted out and was thereupon put to stout urging, responded by shooting through inside
and angled out at the top of the stretch to be four wide and with the lead in upper stretch, moved clear and was kept busy to the wire. ELYSIAN FIELD
settled well back inside but just off the fence, dropped back a bit heading up the backstretch, steadily advanced two wide on the far turn, came out a bit for
the drive, kicked on well to get just off the winner inside the furlong grounds but could make no headway late. BLUEBERRY FIELDS was in a bit tight after
the start, settled toward the rear off the inside in the two to three path, was still far back coming to the quarter pole and then put to urging still near but off the
inside, found room in upper stretch and rallied well to surge for show honors late. SOLO ALBUM was urged at the start, moved forward to the lead, set the
pace from off the rail shadowed by a foe, weakened in the stretch. LIBBAN brushed a rival lightly at the start but was still prominent early, eased off the
leaders tracking inside saving ground early, was guided off the fence, came out further past the quarter pole, came to the top of the stretch fiver wide and
under a strong drive but could only go evenly thereafter. FOREVER DIXIE was taken back and angled in early bringing up the rear, moved out and was
forced five to six wide on the far turn, came out a bit further at the top of the stretch, waited a bit in behind runners then altered course inward and kicked on
well the final furlong. BATUCADA was brushed then checked soon after the start, raced off the inside and caught up with runners near mid-pack three to
four deep leaving the first turn and up the backstretch, bided time still well back in the rear half of the field on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch to
improve. SAND AND SEA brushed a rival at the start, was forwardly-positioned but in tight three wide between runners entering the first turn, continued to
race up close in the second flight through the far turn, faltered and faded in the lane. SABATINI was coaxed forward staling from outside four to five wide in
the second flight, floated eight wide leaving the far turn, weakened in the stretch. METAPHYSICAL raced inside a foe but well-removed from the rail in the
four path into the first turn and off the leaders, made a mild advance on the far turn while fanning nine wide, failed to rally in the stretch. RO TOWN
shadowed the pacesetter from outside about three wide, continued the pursuit three to five wide on the far turn when ridden strongly from the
five-sixteenths, drifted a bit into upper stretch, came up empty. AFFIRMATIVE LADY was in tight between runners entering the first turn in the second flight,
dropped back steadily, came out for the drive and failed to rally. EPHRATA (GB) was caught five wide in the early going, continued well back and off the
inside, failed to menace. ROSIE'S ALIBI tracked from inside, was ridden three furlongs out but had no response and retreated.

FULL COUNT FELICIA broke sharp to be loose on the lead under a snug hold setting a soft opening quarter, increased the advantage by many setting a
brisk second fraction split down the backside, continued to roll along still moving very strongly through the far turn, ran them off their feet with a commanding
lead turning for home and won comfortably at the wire but by a diminishing margin in the end. MOIRA had a stalking trip on the rail ahead of one rival in the
early stages, started to lengthen stride when rallying outside at the half mile marker, moved in to bid for the runners up share four wide outside at the three
sixteenths marker, kept on closing relentlessly to the wire with a valiant effort but was second best to the stablemate on this day. FEV ROVER (IRE) was
content to sit behind the frontrunner on the fence in the first bend, patiently found her stride sitting second while the leader was freewheeling down the
backside, was urged for more midway on the turn but could not reel in the winner, dueled for the secondary award inside at the top of the lane, could not
continue on for that share and settled for a distant but clear third at the wire. BLUSH (IRE) was off a step slow, breaking in, to trail into the first of two turns,
was unhurried seeing the stretched-out pack along the backstretch, saved ground hugging the rail on the far turn, moved in on the fence in upper stretch to
win battle for a small piece of the prize, continued to run on end late but could not improve position in deep stretch. BLUE ROSE CEN (IRE) tracked the
pacesetter while outside of a rival on the first turn, settled in the third flight with the field stringing out down the backside, could not quicken with the leaders
in the final turn, dueled outside for a minor share in upper stretch but yielded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO was outside three wide in the group at the back of the pack in the beginning, improved steadily three deep down the backstretch, made a
bold move circling four wide at the three-furlong pole, pounced to the lead with five sixteenths from home, opened up in upper stretch and won by a
comfortable margin in the end. LOOSE WIRE was part of the trio at the rear between runners in the first turn, co-trailed on the outside at the half, started to
get into gear reaching for more ground at the three-furlong pole, shifted out four wide for the drive then angled out some more to be six wide gaining speed
late and surged in deep stretch to best the rest when crossing the finish line. MAAKWA was hustled to take command from the start, dictated the pace while
unopposed along the backside, offered no resistance when the winner went past outside midway on the far turn, stubbornly tried to stay on down the lane
and almost held on late for the place share. FROSTED OVER travelled in mid-pack on the rail in the first of two turns, took closer order between foes while
two wide along the backside, advanced three wide on the far bend to be in the hunt for a share in the five path turning for home and finished up evenly to
settle on the fringes. MIGHTY HEART stalked on the third flight on the outside, moved in on the leader when urged three wide between horses midway on
the far turn, was in the mix four wide in upper stretch for a share, could not carry on and flattened out by the sixteenth pole. J P HELLISH was situated
inside a runner in the third tier in the early parts of the route race, could not quicken with others moving outside at the three eighths marker and yielded on
the fence in the last furlong. DAY TRIPPER travelled in the middle of the pack outside foes into the first bend, made little headway three deep on the outside
down the backside, under a vigorous ride three wide could not make an impression around the final turn and was not a factor down the lane. VOLCANIC
had a tracking spot just behind the pacesetter in the early stages of the race, was roused but offered no response three furlongs out, was engulfed quickly
thereafter at the five sixteenths pole and could not play a role in the stretch running. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE travelled on the rail near the rear with two
others, co-trailed on the fence at the half, was hard ridden while still at the back of the pack at the quarter pole, emptied out in upper stretch and cantered
across the finish line.

Footnotes
NEW CENTURY (GB) broke a step slowly, was a bit hard to control outside at the rear early then settled down racing off the inside into the turn, angled
eight wide turning into upper stretch, rallied widest, was bumped past the furlong marker but took control and drove clear. AL QUDRA (IRE) settled toward
the back off the inside, was mostly in the two to four path into and on the turn biding time, shifted seven wide turning for home, launched a rally between
foes, was carried out a bit by the drifting leader and bumped the eventual winner to the outside past the eighth pole then was bumped by the inside runner
soon after, edged past the latter but was no match for the former while clearly second best. DREAM ON was forwardly-positioned tracking from inside,
saved ground on the turn biding time, bid up the rail turning for home and spurted clear, drifted out in mid-stretch then continued outwardly bumping a rival
near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished but best of the rest. FIRST RESORT was bumped at the break but still close to the leaders early, was taken
back off those under a hold, continued to drop back up the backstretch settling off the rail, moved out three to four wide and advanced between runners in
upper stretch, ran on but needed more. CAIRO CAPER stalked from outside, was five wide late on the turn and six wide in upper stretch while within range
but lacked the needed late kick. WINTERBERRY stalked up close just off the leader racing just a touch rank early, came into upper stretch five wide and
weakened. FORTY N FIVE was up close chasing in behind the leaders off the fence, ridden along coming to the five-sixteenths, shifted nearer the rail in
upper stretch and failed to rally. SPECIAL SESSION was unhurried at the back, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail for the drive, failed to menace.
GROOT got away well, soon moved clear and shifted in some, set the pace, faltered and faded. COOLCOLLECTED bumped a rival at the start, was off the
leaders and off the inside part of the course, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
WIN FOR THE MONEY shifted in early and was well-rated off the pace, saved ground through the turn, put to urging in upper stretch and bid up the inside
taking the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) moved quickly to the fore to set the pace from off the rail, drifted out a path
leaving the turn still in front, fought on but was no match for the winner and held place from BIG ROCK (FR), who broke just a step slowly and lacked early
speed despite encouragement, shifted in and brought up the rear near but off the rail, continued in the two to three path on the turn, angled six wide near
the three-sixteenths, finished well under strong urging despite drifting about to narrowly miss second. NAVAL POWER (GB) was prominent pressing inside
briefly in the early going then taken back off the leader to track in behind and inside, asked for more at the five-sixteenths with room inside turning for home,
was guided out four wide at the three-sixteenths still within range but could only kick on evenly. PLAYMEA TUNE moved forward inside then was reined in
to settle down mid-pack tracking in behind, switched out off the inside, shifted out further to be five wide coming past the five-sixteenths and in range of the
leaders, floated out seven to eight deep for the drive and ran on but needed more. MY BOY PRINCE bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled outside
toward the rear, swung eight to nine wide for the stretch run and carried on evenly. SECRET RESERVE stalked up close to the leader, went three to four
wide on the turn, weakened. NIAGARA SKYLINE settled off the pace, advanced outside four wide on the turn reaching striking distance coming to the top of
the stretch, could not sustain the effort and flattened out.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN broke out on the start having a slim lead while hounded inside down the backstretch, finally cleared to the rail at the seven
sixteenths marker, opened up briefly into the turn, was headed again on the outside by the pesky early speed foe by the quarter pole, sharply opened up
when roused in upper stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish line. REMUDA was unhurried to trail in the early going, continued to see the
field on the rail throughout the turn, skimmed the fence gathering speed turning for home, was full of run at the eighth pole, closing in late but it wasn't
enough at the wire. WAR BOMBER (IRE) tracked the front duo while outside of a runner along the backside, was roused keeping pace with the leaders
throughout the turn, shifted four wide for the stretch run, determinedly fought on down the lane and won the tight photo for the show money. IRONSTONE
settled in the third flight outside a rival down the backside, was scrubbed on four wide at the quarter pole for more, shifted out to the six path at the top of the
stretch and finished up with intent to almost close in and get the show money. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) stalked on the fence in the third flight in the early
stages of the race, picked up the bit three wide inside a foe when nudged at the quarter pole, angled out five wide for the drive and finished up mildly
between but could not pose a threat late. LAST AMERICAN EXIT had a tracking position on the rail behind the lead duo down the back straight, came under
a ride chasing the front pair around the bend but to no avail and flattened out between foes in the three-path at the sixteenth pole. ROCKCREST pressed
the pace inside down the backstretch, was reined back with seven sixteenths to go, re-engaged on the outside by the quarter pole, was repelled by the
winner in upper stretch, fought the good fight but wilted in the last sixteenth.

Footnotes
DUN DRUM had a tracking position on the outside down the backstretch, moved in confidently three wide with rivals on both sides with five sixteenths from
the wire, dueled up top inside in the four path through the stretch, was unyielding late and prevailed at the wire by a slim margin. WICKED DJANGO stalked
in the third flight four wide in the first bend, ranged up three wide outside through the back straight, closed in four wide to bid for the lead at the quarter pole,
shifted out five wide battling for the lead in the stretch but was denied at the wire in a photo. JUNIPERO SERRA co-trailed on the outside in the first bend,
began to pick up runners on the outside four deep at the half, kept on coming when angling out six wide turning for home, could not reel in the front pair late
but did close in smartly in the final seventy yards for third money. SOUPED UP pressed the issue in the early parts of the race, poked his head in front with
three eighths to go, had a short-lived lead when collared outside at the quarter pole, was no match for the top two with an eighth remaining and did dig in
late to hold for a minor placing at the wire. SOUTH BEND travelled on the rail near the rear along the backside, began to edge closer when shifting out off a
tiring foe midpoint on the final turn, angled outside to the seven path in upper stretch, closed in smartly, gaining on rivals late but could not pose a threat at
the finish line. GRANDSON co-trailed on the inside into the first turn, settled at the rear still with a half mile to run, shifted out to commence a run by the
quarter pole, swung out widest in the nine path having a clear lane to uncork his run, was flying home late but ran out of ground when just getting its best
stride. COOL KISS was close to the back of the pack in the two path down the backside, was roused two wide on the far turn between horses by could not
pass any rivals, shifted inside to the rail for the run down the lane and finished up with good late energy in deep stretch. KAUKOKAIPUU was tracking the
front pair inside a rival in the early going, came under a ride but was going the wrong direction on the fence midway on the final turn, shifted out four wide for
the drive but weakened in the two path with a furlong left to run. WENTRU travelled in midfield in the three path, made little progress on the outside down
the backstretch, was three wide outside foes on the final turn but could not get into gear, angled out in the eight-path straightening up for the drive but failed
to menace down the lane. MR. WHO was away quickly on the front end inside, on the rail in the early going, lost the lead to an outside foe at the
three-furlong pole, fought on the fence until upper stretch and faltered inside horses at the furlong marker.
