Footnotes
MARK DID IT stalked from the two and three paths, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod leaving the five sixteenths, dueled clear
midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold of the stretch challenge of I AM THAT I AM, who was rated close toward the inside and launched a
three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and relented in the duel through the stretch. SHARP SHOT rated the
pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was met past the five sixteenths, remained a factor nearest the rail on the far turn
but flattened stride in the lane. UNCLE WATER FLOW settled back in the two and three paths early on, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little more. TRANSFER THE FUNDS rated just off the pace, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. WELLING saved ground, picked up the chase past the half mile pole and
raced at the rail on the far turn, then weakened leaving the turn. MAKE WAY was shuffled back leaving the gate then stalked the early pace from the three
and four paths, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn and was eased in the lane.

ADIOS MEISTER was bumped outward and into Wac Is Fast leaving the gate but took quick control to show the way, came under pressure toward the
quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and further extended her lead under steady handling. COWGIRL NATION stalked inside, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and just lasted for second. WAC IS FAST was bumped leaving the gate then saved ground on the first
turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, improved five wide on the far turn, finished well and just missed second. SWAN raced in the three
path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. MALTESE ROSE settled off the rail
the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little in
the lane. RAPID MISS TAPIT showed little response leaving the first turn. BANANA SPLIT ducked out and made contact with Adios Meister leaving the

only flagged in the lane. SAFFRON raced in the four path the opening turn and gave chase into the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in to
take second past the eighth pole then flattened later yards. IHEARTRAINACOMN raced inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out entering the stretch and finished evenly to improve her position. FOXY SISTA stalked off the rail the first
turn, chased the winner leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. ROMAN CANDLE was never a factor.

Footnotes
After being a bit hesitant to load, SILVER MOON ROAD took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. DESERT RULER raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. GOLDEN APPEAL raced in the four path the first turn,
moved to the outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and came along to
take third later yards. SUBJECT TO CHANGE stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn then flattened in the lane. ELVIRUS angled in and stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the quarter,
rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened in the lane. MYSTIFIED raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch.
