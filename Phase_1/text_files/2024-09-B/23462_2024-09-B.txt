Footnotes
COUPERIN was away alertly to set a slow pressured pace along the inside, then was headed on the turn by JERSEY PERFECTION, turned back that bid
nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear to prove best under a drive. JERSEY PERFECTION pressed the winner three wide early, made a bid three wide
on the turn to duel for command, but could not match strides with the winner off the turn while keeping on to be clearly second best. RASCALLY REBEL
tracked the early pace two wide, then was in between rivals by the half mile marker, then inside on the far turn and lacked the needed winning bid while
besting the rest. ASCRIBE was rated three to four wide early, then was between rivals by the half mile marker and on the far turn and weakened. THE
COLORA KID lost the iron at the start, raced seven wide into the first turn while trying to get boot back in the iron, then once back in chased the pace and
advanced on the outside to stalked the pace on the outside by the half mile marker, then chased the pace by the quarter pole and tired. THENAME OF
THEGAME chased the pace on the inside and tired.

AWESOME FLAY pressed the early pace three wide, then went up to vie for command by the half mile marker, made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear
by the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best while being ridden out. JUMP FOR THE WIN was four wide into the first turn, chased
the pace on the outside, three wide on the far turn, came five wide off the bend and finished willingly to be second best while no match for the winner.

Footnotes
VINGATIVA trailed the field around the first turn, leisurely strolled along down the backside , accelerated quickly through traffic around the far turn, shifted
out seven deep for the stretch drive, engaged inside rival in upper stretch, wore that one down and kicked clear to the wire. CARROLL GIRL dogged the
pace setter from the two path, always close up into the far turn, inched her way into the lead leaving the quarter pole, battled through upper stretch with
outside rival, stayed on well to secure the place. PRINCIPIA raced just off the early pace around the first turn, tracked the pace from the two path into the far
turn, shifted three wide making her bid leaving the quarter pole, finished evenly through the stretch. NINETEENAMENDMENT set a pressure pace along the
inside around the first turn and down the backside, still under pressure leaving the quarter pole, gave way through the stretch. MARTYNAS' JOY tracked the
pace from the inside, saved ground into the far turn asked to quicken leaving the quarter pole, came up empty. TRULY GRATEFUL off to a slow start and
wide around the first turn, raced well off the pace and off the rail into the far turn, four wide and losing ground around the second bend, was eased through
the lane.
