Footnotes
BLOW SUM SMOKE showed speed then settled back along the inside early, steadied going to the turn along the rail, angled out late in the bend to come
five wide into the stretch and rallied clear under steady handling. GAME TO PLAY showed speed three or four wide, moved out further late in the turn then
could not handle the winner the final furlong. COZZOLANI moved four wide in the turn to make a mild bid nearing the lane but lacked a final closing run.
QUEEN OF THE ICE angled out to come six wide into the lane but had no rally. LOVESAFLYIN showed speed between rivals early to contest the lead and
gave way in the lane.

FLOOR IT made the pace on a short lead inside rivals, shook clear going to the far tur4n and drew off in the lane under mild urging. HANGIN' TUFF tracked
the winner three or four wide to make a mild bid going up the backstretch then could not go with that one in the lane. FREEDOM FLASH saved ground
early, angled three wide to move up in the far turn, came back in for the drive and made a mild run while clearly best of the others. HUMOR ME PLEASE
broke in the air and lagged well back early then passed beaten ones in the lane. RIVERSPORT stalked the pace three or four wide and weakened in the
lane. RING TAILED TOOTER tracked the pace from three wide and tired.

Footnotes
DANCIN ROCKET tracked the early leaders three or four wide to bid into the turn, showed in front coming to the furlong grounds and held safe to the end.
RED CHEEKS contested the early lead inside a rival, was joined by the winner in the turn, held stubbornly to the end and just missed. BERRYVILLE
BULLET stalked the pace four and five wide, rallied in the lane and closed ground but came up short late. DO IT LIKE KEVIN saved ground and rallied up
the rail in the lane to come short in the blanket finish. NOBLE CONNECTION moved three wide but lacked a solid closing bid. R VOO'S TABOO contested
the early lead three wide and weakened into the lane. W F JAZZ CAT was along the inside and weakened into the lane.
