Footnotes
LIGHT THE TORCH sprinted out for the lead, took the rail, set the pace, maintained her advantage, and got the win. GOSHAKI GOSHAKI stalked the early
speed from the four path, launched a bid at the quarter pole, closed well gaining on the leader but fell short by a stride or two finishing with a game second.
BALALA stalked the speed from the rail, saved ground, closed well, briefly switched paths in deep stretch to meet another rival who was closing fast and just
missed. BELLA MENDY raced mid pack in the three path, raced in between rivals, maintained that position through out but had no late kick. CAJUN PRIME
raced in the middle of the field on the rail, shuffled back a bit, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, saved ground, had the inside advantage entering the
upper stretch, had a clear shot up the rail, battled down the stretch with an outside foe, gained ground on the early leaders but did not have enough to get
there. CHINA BLUE broke sharp, then settled in the middle of the pack off of the speed, raced six wide down the back stretch, shifted out into the eight path
in the upper stretch, finished even. STAR GAME raced from off of the pace, was five and six wide, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground
through the turn, then had none left for the stretch. SATURN'S GHOST vied for the lead in the early stages, settled into a stalking position, raced three wide,
then faded. DADDY'S QUEEN raced off of the pace in the four path, was in between rivals, advanced, shifted in to the two path, made a late run but had too
much to do. MY EMMY AWARD was off a step slow, raced in the three path, then shifted into the five path, but showed little. SURPRISE COCO was off a
step slow,, trailed, briefly ran along the rail inside of horses then stopped. THERE WAS A STEWARTS OBJECTION AND A RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL, THE
RIDER OF SATUM'S GHOST LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST BALALA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER A STEWARTS
REVIEW THEREWAS NO ACTION TAKEN.

DARLING DARLEY vied for the lead, took back into mid pack, dropped onto the rail, launched a bid at the half mile pole, gained ground through the turn,
was encouraged with a left handed crop and ducked out a bit at the top of the lane, was quickly corrected, was cued and responded well easily over coming
the early leader and drawing off to win by many. THANK THE ACADEMY raced five wide and mid pack, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained
ground through the turn on the outside, had her sight set on the two front runners and ran at them closing fast, drew next to the rival running second, battled
to get past that one, edged clear but the eventual winner had an unsurmountable lead leaving THANK THE ACADAMY with second place. ANONYMOUS
SOURCE raced four wide, started out mid pack, launched a bid at the the half mile marker, was in full stride racing through the turn, finished flat in the
stretch. NIGHTSABER (GB) vied for the lead, raced on the rail while attending to the pace, saved ground through then stopped after the eighth mile pole.
NAA DUDETTE was off a step slow, trailed early then passed tired ones. LTE STARK WINTER was never involved. NELIDA stalked the pace in the three
path, was forwardly placed racing just off of the early leader, then faded in the stretch.

PREVENT vied for the lead, was forced to shift out into the four path in the first turn, settled back and stalked that rival who took the lead, then ran down that
leader in the stretch, collaring him late, getting back for the aggressive move in the first turn and taking the win. THEMANUPFRONT sent out of the gates on
the outside, vied for the lead, dropped over to the rail in the first turn forcing another foe to shift into the four path, took the lead set the pace, led the race
into deep stretch all the while under pressure from a stalking rival, was collared and settled for second place today. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE stalked the
speed, saved ground and raced on the rail, improved through the turn, gained ground, was cued at the quarter pole and responded well closing fast with the
inside advantage, just missing. CUBAN THUNDER (IRE) raced off of the pace, launched a bid at the three eights pole, shifted out six wide and circled the
field, was ready to challenged for the lead in the upper stretch but failed to switch leads and finished flat. PET MAT stalked in the three path, raced in
between rivals, launched a bid at the three eights pole, emerged out from in between rivals, gained ground, split horses entering the upper stretch, then had
nothing left to close with. SALVATTORE PRINCE raced off of the pace, stayed to the inside in the two and three paths, launched a bid at the half mile pole,
mildly gained late. JADES JAY vied for the lead, steadied early, was never involved after that. THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION. THE RIDER OF

leader, raced in the three path, chased the leader into the stretch held off the rest and was second best. WIN N YOUR IN stalked the leader while racing in
the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch, finished even. GLORY GLORY raced
mid pack, stayed in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole then flattened out. DON'T FOOL WITH ME was off in the middle of the field, raced
three wide, was able to be consistent and maintained position through out. BEE A QUEEN showed little. SLEW DIVA was off a step slow and was never a
threat.

Footnotes
LORENZ (BRZ) trailed the field early, launched a bid at the half mile pole, was given the cue at the quarter pole, shifted into the five path in the upper
stretch, and LORENZ responded willing, flying down the stretch catching up and surpassing the field in a perfectly timed race hitting the wire with his nose in
front. AWESOME BOURBON sprinted out in front of the rest and took the rail, set the pace, led all the way until the last sixteenth of a mile when a fast
closing rival drew beside, engaged in a battle lasting until they hit the wire where AWESOME BOURBON was a nose behind getting second. PORTOFINO
vied for the lead, raced on the rail and stalked the leader, maintained that position. BRAWN raced mid pack in the three path, launched a bid at the five
sixteenth pole, improved position, gained ground, entered the upper stretch and had no late kick. VLADISLAV raced off of the pace, three wide, made a late
bid but it wasn't enough. GRAND DAVID raced mid pack, stayed on the rail, maintained that position through the turn, was surrounded by horses, tried to
get out in the turn, had to be steadied and was through after that.

Footnotes
ALL CLASS vied for the lead, raced five wide, settled into a stalking position, pressured the pace, took over at the half mile pole, willingly set more
reasonable fractions, drifted out a bit in deep stretch, was threatened by an inside competitor, was grabbed up and re focused, encouraged, came back and
took the win,. ADIOS BABE was off and racing in the middle of the field, saved ground and raced on the rail, improved position, launched a bid at the three
eighths pole, gained as he traveled on the rail through the turn, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch, was asked and responded well, closed in on the
leader, shifted into the three path, had running room and stretched his stride out, passed a drifting leader for a stride, then was nailed at the wire just
missing. STAR OF SATURN raced off of the pace, saved ground and raced on the rail through out, was slowly but surely gaining with every stride, was able
to pass the speed horses in the stretch but couldn't pass the other closers. ALESS QUEEN was off mid pack, raced four wide, launched a bid at the three
eighths pole and was able to maintain that position through out. AMY THE BUTCHER was racing in the middle of the field, traveled in the three path,
launched a bid and gained ground after the three eighths pole, shifted out six wide in the upper stretch, closed making a slight gain late. JULEE'S LEGACY
stalked the front runner, raced on the rail, got the lead, set wickedly fast fractions, then tired. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA vied for the lead, raced four side,
settled in and stalked the leaders, advanced after the half, launched a bid at the three eighths, but to no avail. KIKILOVE trailed.

Footnotes
RATED BY MERIT stalked the front runner, traveled in the three path, patiently waited for his cue, pressured the pace through the turn was finally asked at
the quarter pole and he happily responded tracking four wide in the upper stretch and pulling away, once he was loose on the led he was gone, tying the
stakes track record with ease. NEOEQUOS vied for the lead, raced on the rail as he set an extremely fast pressured pace, could not sustain the bid all the
way to the wire and was caught but ran second to a stakes recorder holder. CLASSIC OF COURSE stalked the pace from the rail, launched a bid at the five
sixteenth pole, had the inside advantage but was no match. JUST RELAX mid pack, improved and stalked, raced in the four path, put in a late bid gaining
late position. CANDYCRUMBS off pace, raced three wide, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, but had no kick. LAWLER trailed in the early goings,
tracked six wide, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled on the outside through the turn, made a mild late bid but it was too little too late for todays
win. ZIZKA never got involved. I'MBIGGERTHANILOOK trailed.

Footnotes
NOBLE TIGER vied for the lead, raced on the rail, managed the pace through out, was cued at the quarter pole, willingly shifted into another gear with
plenty left, maintained the lead to the wire getting the win. REMERTON was away alertly, raced along the rail, settled into a stalking position, stalked the
leader for the entire race, finishing second. HIGHLAND PEAK raced mid pack, saved ground racing on the rail, was in tight, had to repeatedly ask
HIGHLAND PEAK to relax, then didn't have enough to finish. DIKEMBE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground by racing on the rail, shifted over into
the two path, raced in between rivals, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, bumped an outside rival several times in the upper stretch finished a dull
fourth. MIDNIGHT MAESTRO stalked the front runner from the three path, pressured the pace, started to fall back at the three eighths pole, bumped an
inside rival in the upper stretch had little after that. HIGH PRINCE trailed early on, raced on the rail stayed in contact with the field and mildly gained late.
CUSTODIAN was racing mid pack and in the four path, swung out widest in the turn entering the upper stretch, had no rally. GO GO SANTI raced off of the
pace, four wide, launched a bid at the half mile marker, gained ground but had no impact.
