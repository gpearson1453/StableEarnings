Footnotes
KOSARI shared the command from the outside of BOTTLE CAPS to the top of the stretch then edged away and won going away. BOTTLE CAPS shared
the command from the inside of KOSARI to the top of the stretch and was clearly second best. KING OF SWING chased the leaders throughout and stayed
on for the show. TIPSY TIGER was slightly unsettled in the gate then showed no early speed but improved position late. NAUGHTY WORDS was void of
the early speed and passed tiring rival. JBA DADDY'S ANCHOR chased the leaders and tired. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CRESSONS LIL CHARM went to the brief early lead then pressed the pace to the half mile marker, settled off the pace and made a rebid in mid stretch to
drive past the leader for the win. GRACIE'S A TIGER vied for the early lead from two wide then took over at the nine sixteenths, drew clear around the turn
but tired late and was a clear second. LAYAWAY chased the top two and stayed on for the show. GUARDING ELK CAMP trailed the field to the top of the
stretch then made a late stretch run to improve position but not enough for the show. MELODY ROSE raced in the middle of the pack and made a mild bid
on the turn to pass the tiring rival. OUR CLOVER GAL saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
RED FROST went to an early clear lead and fended off the challenged at the half mile marker to draw clear to prove best. KAE GAE prompted the early
pace from three wide then moved to engage the leader at the half mile marker but couldn't collar, pressed the leader around the turn before weakening but
stayed on to be second best. FREEDOM FLASH showed no early speed and trailed the field to the quarter pole, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch to
make the late run for the show. ATHENS MOON stalked the pace from the inside and made a mild bid on the turn but was empty in the stretch. LETS
ROCK N STROLL tracked the leaders through the turn but failed to menace.
