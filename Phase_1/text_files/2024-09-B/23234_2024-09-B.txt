Footnotes
PURSUE tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed smartly two out from the rail to be up in time. JUST
JIMMY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of
NEIGHBOR in the run down the backside and through the final turn, took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. NEIGHBOR
broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of JUST JIMMY through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, and fought on determinedly one out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. GUNFIGHTER stalked the
contested early pace from the back of a compact field while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide
approaching the final turn, loomed a threat leaving the turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the stretch drive. BIG UNION appeared to still be in the
hands of the assistant starter as the gates opened, BIG UNION hopped in the air and tossed his head before racing into a tracking trip one out from the rail
through the stretch the first time, maintained his position into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

TEXAS HUMOR away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to finish on even terms with CARLA'S HONOR. CARLA'S HONOR broke sharply and tracked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the leader three wide approaching the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the
lane, and closed three wide in the drive to finish on even terms with TEXAS HUMOR. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY angled in entering the first turn to save ground
and assume a stalking trip at the rail into the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive
to garner a share. WALKINTHEWALK settled off the early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the
final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. BAKZONE was slow into stride while dropping well behind the field in the run to the
first turn, continued to bide her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out
from the rail in the stretch drive. STAR FINALITY away alertly and sprinted to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, was quickly overtaken
entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

SET TO SHINE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn,
shifted four wide into the lane, and closed willingly to be up in time. FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive and just failed to
last. CASCADE BILLY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the
final turn, continued to battle for the lead through the final turn from the outside of FINDING WAYS, and fought on gamely two wide in the drive to just miss.
FLORIDA GATOR settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to take up the chase midway down the
backside, continued one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished five wide in deep stretch but needed more. PAY MY WAY settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, saved ground while launching his bid entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the
drive. TIME TICKER unhurried early while dropping well behind the field while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, bided his time at the back of
the pack in the run down the backstretch, and failed to make a serious late impact. BURNLEY away well and tracked the leaders into the first turn while
racing two out from the rail, steadily dropped back in the run down the backstretch, and was eased over the final furlong.

BUTTONWOOD TREE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of FRANKIE MACHINE entering the stretch the first time, continued to force
the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the turn, and inched clear late. FRANKIE
MACHINE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of BUTTONWOOD
TREE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and battled gamely through the
lane at the rail to hold the place. ERLICH away well and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly three out from the rail in the drive to garner a
share. BROKE AN BROKEN stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, bided his time while under snug restraint
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive. ARTISTIC JEWLER
stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, continued to
save ground through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. TEX HANLEY tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final
furlong. FAMILY BIZ settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued three wide in the run down the
backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid. ROOKIE YEAR unhurried early and trailed the field into the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

BUNNY away alertly and tracked the pacesetter while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her tracking trip in the run down
the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail through the final turn, eased off the rail entering the lane, and wore down a stubborn AIR FORCE in the
closing strides to prevail. AIR FORCE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the lane the first time, controlled the pace in the run
down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and just failed to last while proving clearly second best. INFINITE PATIENCE away
well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch,
battled for the lead two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished late while finishing two out from the rail to garner a share. ABOVE AVERAGE
stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backstretch to loom
a threat entering the final turn, continued three wide through the final turn, but hung slightly in the late stages. CLASS CODE stalked the pacesetter from
along the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced from between rivals midway down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed
more when called upon. MATSQUI unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

APPREHEND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of
SETTECENTO in the run down the backside, got the better of his pace rival leaving the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. SETTECENTO
tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, but battled determinedly two wide in the drive to hold the place. PHANTOM RIDE
away alertly and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, moved into a tracking trip for the run down the backside,
launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to get up for a share. SPACE away well and stalked the
pacesetter from just off the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained his trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. AT ATTENTION settled off the early pace while racing one
out from the rail through the stretch the first time, bided his time in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide
in the drive while unable to threaten late. SUNBIRD settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, was in tight
quarters through the lane the first time, remained in tight quarters in the run down the backstretch and into the turn, and failed to mount a serious late bid.
LUCKY FORCE settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the lane the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, and needed more when called upon.

SELF SERVING stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched his move three wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. FOREIGN PROTOCOL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. FOOT
SOLDIER broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and
finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. EYE BE SEEING YOU away well and stalked the early pace while racing three wide into the
backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive. PADDY D'ORO settled off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, continued two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive in an even
effort. ANOTHER GUINNESS settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, saved ground through the
final turn, and finished evenly in the lane. BARNEY GOOGLE through his head in the opening strides while making contact with his rider, was always well
back and failed to make a serious impact. SLEW'S DA BOSS lagged well back in the early going while racing two wide into the backside, was always well
back and never menaced. RING OF KERRY settled mid pack into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, but steadily retreated on the way to the
final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
