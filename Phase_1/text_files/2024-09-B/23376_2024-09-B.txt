Footnotes
BABY BOAT raced five wide while stalking the early leaders, stayed right off of the leaders until the upper stretch where he was asked and he responded
well talking the lead and then drawing off to win handily. TAUNTING stalked the early leaders in the two path, shifted into the six path in the upper stretch,
drifted back into the two path coming down the lane, was no match for the winner but was able to out finish the rest getting up for place. NOTIPTONI vied for
the lead, raced in the three and four paths, pressured the pace and co led, moved up beside the leader and into the lead position after the quarter pole, was
joined by an out side competitor traveling into the upper stretch, raced in between foes and battled until the eighth pole, then tired. FRONTIER MARSHAL
was off a step slow, trailed while racing in the three and four paths, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted outside and circled the field through the
turn, shifted out widest in the upper stretch, kept closing well but had left to much to do. SNEAKY FEET raced off of the pace, trailed, traveled six wide and
showed little. RUMBLING raced mid pack early on, maintained that position through out the first half mile, stayed out in the six path then faded. MARK MY
MEMORY stepped off away from the gate in the lead, raced three wide until the turn, then saved ground and raced on the rail, was joined by other
competitors in the turn and tired on the rail in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE had the lead through the first turn, raced on the rail, took back and let another out side rival set the pace, stalked that rival, launched a
bid at the five sixteenth pole, collared the leader at the quarter pole, was showing the way under pressure from another closing rival, raced in between rivals
briefly, actually lost the lead for a stride, then was hand ridden out from between those rivals and recaptured the lead putting away from the rest and getting
a well deserved win. CANTSTEALMYTHUNDER raced off of the pace in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field through the
turn, pressured the leader down the stretch, drew next to the leader and engaged in a three way battle, briefly had the lead then lost it finishing second.
WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR vied for the lead, took the lead on the back side, shifted down to the rail through the turn, was joined by two other competitors at
the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, gave a good effort then tired late. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS stalked the pace setters from the rail, was threatening to
run up on heels with the pace being so slow, was asked to relax, then shuffled back, wound up trailing and never got involved after that. WHERE'D THE
DAY GO showed little.

WHERE'S THE WINE was off and racing in a stalking position,, saved ground by racing on the rail, rated well down the back side, was patient in the first
half of the stretch, shifted out from behind the early leader at the eighth pole, was asked and responded well easily running past the leader, taking the lead,
getting the win. DATAW ISLAND vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, saved ground, was collared near the eighth pole, battled briefly but was no
match for the winner, definitely second best. DEAL'EM AND WEEP stalked the leader while racing in the four path, raced behind the leaders and in between
the stalkers, shifted out in the stretch and closed well, following the eventual winner. BAH HUMBUG was on the bit early, did not want to rate, finally agreed
to stalk the leader, raced in the four and five paths, was given rein and asked to go at the five sixteenth pole, however, the leader also quickened their pace,
leaving BAH HUMBUG chasing instead of stalking, then had no late kick in the stretch. CHIQUITA REINA raced off of the pace in the four path,, moved
down to the rail in the stretch but lacked a late rally. I'M A COOKIE LOVER was stalking the leader in the six path was almost on the lead, then fell back at
the three eighths pole. COLLIE WRAYS KITTY raced on the rail, in the middle of the pack but was never a threat.
