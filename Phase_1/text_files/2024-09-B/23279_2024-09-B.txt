Footnotes
COOLTHING rated between horses, waited for room behind the second flight on the bend, split rivals three wide leaving the turn, fanned out further into the
lane, rallied under steady urging and swept past FAITH HOPE N LOVE with sixty yards to go. FAITH HOPE N LOVE broke on top, sprinted away from the
rest but wore down along the rail the last furlong. COALY in the second flight between rivals, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the wire.
SOMETHINTOBELIEVEN hesitated then was bumped and forced in at the break, saved ground and passed a couple tired foes the final eighth. HOT
T'MATER a bit awkward at the start, soon raced in the second flight from outside for a half mile, floated out some leaving the bend and gave way for the
drive. STORMY ATTACK bore in at the start, bumping SOMETHINTOBELIEVEN, was an early factor, had the rail on the turn, floated out as he began to
fade leaving the turn then continued to give way through the stretch.

Footnotes
DIAMONDONICE rated from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the bend, angled in some entering the lane, continued his rally under urging and got
up in the final strides. RUN THE TABLE set a pressured pace between rivals, moved clear and stayed just off the inside through the turn, lacked the extra
needed in the waning yards but proved easily second best. STANCE vied for the lead outside RUN THE TABLE on the backstretch, retreated three wide on
the bend, angled outside DIAMONDONICE at the top of the stretch, did not have a late bid but caught the tiring TRUIST for third. TRUIST well placed from
inside for a half mile, began to wear down in the lane. SPAN raced in contention between rivals, faded two wide on the turn, fanned out further for the
stretch run, angled outside STANCE upper stretch and only made up minor ground in the late going. BEST MAN SPEECH soon trailed, was hustled along
but showed little.

Footnotes
NOT TO BE DENIED was kept close from inside, swung outside TENSE entering the stretch, took the lead just inside the last sixteenth and began to draw
off. TENSE broke on top, set the pace while very wide, angled in to be just off the rail through the turn then slowly wore down deep stretch. ROCK THE
BIRDHOUSE settled in midpack while just off the inside, picked up her pace on the bend, fanned out behind NOT TO BE DENIED into the lane, rallied
belatedly inside the last furlong, angled out for a clear path in the waning yards, came up short for the place but was clearly best of the others. MIDNIGHT
SOCIETY was forced to stay wide as she pressed TENSE from outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, floated out further into the stretch
and flattened out for the drive. WAR COLORS was away slowly and not a factor in a wide trip. BUMPER GIRL hesitated at the start and was never a factor
in a ground-saving trip. JULIAISON also hesitated then was bumped at the break, ran three to four wide and failed to menace. MUD HUT hesitated as well
then broke outward, bumping JULIAISON, chased from between rivals then faded from inside on the bend.

HIGHTAILING IT vied for the lead inside BLAZE BEAUTY from the start, was jostled briefly by the latter midway on the backstretch, roused on the bend,
fought through the lane and prevailed. BLAZE BEAUTY angled in some as she shared the lead from outside, jostled briefly with HIGHTAILING IT midway
on the backstretch, battled gamely through the stretch, did not have enough late but was easily second best. TILL chased from outside, was widest through
the turn, had no stretch bid, collapsed after the race, was revived and transported off the track via equine ambulance. SKIP THE FORMALITY moved
outside BLAZE BEAUTY early on, stayed in path three taking the bend, was empty for the stretch run and allowed to coast to the finish.

Footnotes
GRAYHOP broke slowly and inward, bumping BLEEDING BLUE, was settled off the rail, gradually angled out through the bend to advance, angled seven
wide at the top of the lane, lugged in some upper stretch, gradually lugged in after entering the final furlong as he fought for the lead, bumped DRAGGING
MAIN, separated briefly, started lugging in through the waning yards, brushed the latter again, separated again then got the nod at the wire. DRAGGING
MAIN chased the early speed from off the inside, advanced along the rail on the turn, angled out five wide for a clear path at the top of the stretch, drifted
out a bit to be just inside GRAYHOP soon after, battled for the lead inside the last eighth, was bumped with a sixteenth to go, crowded again and brushed
with only yards left and lost the photo by the narrowest of margins. EIGHT MAY vied for the lead from between horses, edged ahead three wide on the turn,
floated out some into the lane, flattened out inside the last furlong but was easily best of the rest. RED ROIL bumped leaving the chute, chased running
widest, was four wide taking the bend, forced to fan to path eight into the stretch, altered in with a furlong to go and improved position between tired ones
without threatening. KRUELESS drifted out some shortly after the start, was prominent between rivals on the backstretch, retreated some three wide on the
turn, angled inside BLEEDING BLUE upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. BLEEDING BLUE also broke somewhat slowly then was bumped,
hustled up to contest the pace from inside, began to yield leaving the turn, drifted out some entering the stretch and continued to fade. LELAND JOHN
disputed the pace between horses on the backstretch, also began to yield leaving the bend, was forced out to path sixth into the stretch and quickly gave
way. C C RITHMS altered out some to avoid KRUELESS leaving the chute, bumped RED ROIL, displayed early speed from outside, began to fade four
wide before finishing a half mile, was forced out to the middle of the track entering the stretch and also quickly faded. The rider of DRAGGING MAIN lodged
an objection claiming interference from GRAYHOP inside the last furlong. After their review, the stewards disqualified GRAYHOP for that interference and
placed him second

GO MADI GO was without early speed, though urged along leaving the chute, angled outside midway on the backstretch, lost ground three then four wide
through the bend, was forced out some upper stretch, gradually altered out to stay clear of AROSE FOR LYLA as she rallied inside the final furlong and got
up in the final strides. WILDCAT BOBBIE hustled from the gate, was crowded and bumped a couple times leaving the chute, settled back and taken to the
outside, roused just off the inside on the turn, engaged SAY CHEESE inside the last eighth, edged ahead of that one near the wire but was outfinished in a
game effort. SAY CHEESE gradually angled in after the break, bumped a couple times with WILDCAT BOBBIE, moved clear before finishing the first
furlong, came off the rail slightly entering the stretch, was challenged inside the final furlong, battled gamely but did not have enough left in the waning
yards. AROSE FOR LYLA rated just off the inside, closed the gap some on the turn, altered outside WILDCAT BOBBIE at the top of the lane, started drifting
out under left-handed pressure after entering the last eighth, steadily narrowed the distance from the leaders while still floating out in the late going and
came up short at the wire. RONAN chased from inside and also rallied belatedly the last furlong.

PAYNT BY LETTERS advanced from outside on the backstretch, was three wide taking the second turn, engaged TROY OUNCE from outside in the lane,
brushed repeatedly with that one as he fought on the front end and shook free nearing the wire. IRISH DECLARATION settled off the rail, stayed in path
three through the second bend, was forced to alter out six wide for a clear path upper stretch, made a strong move the final furlong, was too late but caught
TROY OUNCE for second. TROY OUNCE hustled early to contest the pace, was caught in tight quarters between horses midway on the backstretch,
moved ahead two wide on the second turn, was challenged from outside upper stretch, brushed repeatedly as he dueled to keep the lead, forced in slightly
inside the final sixteenth and yielded. SEMINOLE BEACH was steadied while boxed in behind the leaders on the first turn, waited for room on the
backstretch, got through four wide on the second bend, improved his position, drifted out some under left-handed pressure at the top of the stretch and also
found best stride too late between horses in the late going. ARROW STRIKE displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up while along the rail on the
second turn and ran evenly from inside through the stretch. AVIANO settled early, advanced just off the rail on the second turn, altered out four wide for a
clear path after straightening for the stretch run and also rallied belatedly from between rivals. CREPE YARNS raced in contention from outside, did not
keep up after a half mile, followed SEMINOLE BEACH through the second turn, gradually altered out as the latter came out upper stretch, kept a straight
path the final furlong and showed a willingness to run late as well. EURO SUPRISE contested the pace between horses on the backstretch, sustained a
severe hind leg injury into the second turn, fell, was humanely euthanized and taken off the track via the equine ambulance. There was a stewards' inquiry
into EURO SUPRISE'S fall but no action was taken after their review.
