SHADOWLESS was well placed while five wide into the turn, rallied on the turn to take command in mid stretch under a strong drive then was much the best
in the end. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL vied for the lead while inside into the turn, was in a long sustained drive but weakened while holding the place safe in the
end. LAPIS LAZULI chased the early pace while inside on backstretch and turn, was blocked behind a wall of horses turning for home, angled to the inside
and slipped through making a bid but was no menace in late stretch. TIGER DAD vied for the lead while two wide on backstretch and turn, was hard used
then gave way in late stretch. ABSOLUTE CHAOS vied for the lead while four wide into the turn, was hard sued on the turn then faltered. TEE BURNS vied
for the lead while three wide into the turn, was used up then stopped in late stretch.
