LUCCA'S LEGACY set the pace to the second turn, responded when set down and held driving. CONNECTER stalked the pace, shifted to the rail on the
second turn, could not impact the winner but got the nod for second. WE GOT SWAG pressed the winner to the second turn, was outkicked in the drive and
nailed late for the place. GATO NEGRO was outsprinted to the backstretch, raced off the rail and lacked a closing response. MIDNIGHT DADDY had no
speed and was never a threat. LONGFORD was always outrun.

RODEO ROSE hesitated at the start and lost about three lengths to begin, pushed up to track the leaders, saved ground on the far turn then rallied inside in
the drive and was along in time. PAID IN GOLD disputed the pace while in the two path on both turns, responded into the stretch but could not stall the
winner. TRUE FRIEND dueled outside PAID IN GOLD to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then also battled in the drive but was bested.
SHERRYS BABY chased the pace, was off the rail to the stretch then lacked the needed late response.
