Footnotes
MISSIONSNINETYNINE set a pressured pace through the backstretch and contested the edge two deep on the turn, edged clear into the lane and was
steadily handled to hold on. YABBA DABBA DUDE pressured the pace inside and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, eased to the
outside of the winner leaving the turn and finished well. MY BLUE EYES gave close chase through the backstretch, remained in range in the three path on
the turn but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. E J'S REVENGE gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. MACY'S
BOY saved ground. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Missionsninetynine for alleged interference through the turn,
lodged by the rider of Yabba Dabba Dude.

Footnotes
BACHELORETTE stalked from the three path, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide past the quarter, dueled clear into
the stretch and held well with steady handling. GONE WITH THE WYN stalked inside, was pinched back at the rail leaving the three eighths pole but picked
up the chase toward the five sixteenths, raced close at the rail on the far turn but dropped back into the lane and settled for second. UPTOWN CHARLY
GIRL saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn and came along to take third inside
the eighth pole. LITTLE BABY GIRL rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but flattened in the four path on the far turn.
SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. FROSTY MAYA was bumped leaving the gate
then took over while tapering to the inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead past the quarter pole and gave way
midway on the far turn. BECCA BELLE veered out leaving the gate and made contact with Frosty Maya, settled in the four path on the first turn and never
factored.

Footnotes
VALHALLA'S PALACE stalked from the four path the first turn, started his bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn
and dug in determinedly to edge out the game stretch effort of GREATANDGOOD, who was rated close inside on the first turn and gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, contested at a slim disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding. MY BOY CLYDE
raced well back toward the inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail into the far turn but angled to the
seven path through the turn and came along for third later yards. TIME TO CHOOSE raced two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, but flattened stride mid-stretch. KING OF LUCK rounded the first turn in the three path, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. REVEREND JACK saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out into the lane and showed little more. RAISE A RUCKUS stalked from
the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms into the far turn, raced off the rail through the turn then
weakened in the lane. TAKE YOUR TIME rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was met at the rail toward
the quarter pole, remained a factor through the far turn but weakened into the lane. SCARE DEM rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed
little response through the backstretch.

BELLA MELA took a quick lead while angling to the inside and rated the pace, was pressured leaving the five sixteenths pole and ran clear midway on the
turn, then kept alert with a vigorous hand ride. DEBT RELIEF engaged in close chase through the backstretch and contested the turn two deep, drifted into
the lane but dueled through the stretch for second. DREAMY SONDE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. ARGAN chased inside, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHAMPAGNE PLEASE gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the four path and weakened in the lane. NONESUCH GIRL became edgy in the gate then lunged at the break and never factored.
UNCONSCIOUS MIND gave chase to no avail.

Footnotes
STRIVE FOR STRIDE settled back in the two and three paths then eased out with a bid into the backstretch and improved steadily, raced in the four path on
the far turn, dug in to take over inside the sixteenth pole and held on well. MOON FALL settled back off the rail, eased out and gave chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CHANGE YOUR LUCK took the lead into the first
turn and rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and
flattened later yards. GRUMPY'S BUDDY raced well back in the three and four paths, gave chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path and passed some rivals. EISELE stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase toward the nine sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the
far turn. AIR MEDAL raced in the five path the first turn and could only improve his position. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY saved early ground racing well off the
pace and showed little response through the backstretch. STRONG LIL KOKORO was unprepared for the break and saved early ground. LEG UP rated
close inside through the front stretch then faded through the backstretch. MY BUDDY FRANK stalked from the three and four paths then faded into the far
turn.
