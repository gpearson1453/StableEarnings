STAY ZAPPY stalked the top pair outside a rival, patiently handled three, four, then five wide on the turn, reeled in the top pair under coaxing at the eighth
pole, cleared shortly after, drifted in from right handed urging at the sixteenth pole and held safely in the end. UNIFIED A. P. tracked the leaders from off the
rail, entered the turn in the four path, exited the bend six wide, summoned a mild rally to gain second but could not threaten the winner. O C RHAPSODY
broke in slightly, dueled from outside to the turn, kept the pressure on around the bend, drifted in and bumped rival at the eighth pole, weakened in deep
stretch but was able to edge rival for the show. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY dueled from inside, inched ahead on the turn, led from off the rail into the stretch,
failed to shake loose from O C RHAPSODY at the top of the lane, resisted to midstretch, overtaken by the winner while getting bumped by O C RHAPSODY
at the eighth pole, then lost third while weakening late. BETTER B WORTH IT broke through the gate and was able to pulled up shortly after, brought back
around and reloaded, broke a step slow when brushing the gate, stalked from inside, asked right handed leaving the bend, tired and was eased late and
walked off.

Footnotes
FIBONACCIS RIDE sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead, coaxed along a bit off the rail around the bend, held a diminished lead late on the bend,
kicked away again in upper stretch and padded the margin under steady handling through the final furlong. APPLE VALLEY GIRL chased two wide into the
turn, three wide into the lane, was no match for the winner in the lane but churned on to best the rest. LESS IS MORE brushed the gate then got bumped
hard from outside at the start, tracked two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane, drifted inward midstretch and gained third.
GOBERNADORA ELY broke out, chased in the three path leaving the backstretch, angled five wide around the turn and weakened. ON TIME TAM
stumbled leaving the gate, chased from inside and weakened down the lane. MRAZEK'S OLD DREAM veered in and bumped LESS IS MORE at the start,
trailed three wide into the turn, four wide into the lane and lacked a response when called upon.

COLLECTMYTHOUGHTS sped clear and set the pace in hand up the backstretch, drew away around the bend, drifted four wide leaving the turn, asked
right handed midstretch and was kept busy while powering away to the wire. SEEKING QUALITY off slow in the beginning, trailed in the three path to the
turn, moved into the two path and passed a rival, then angled out at the five-sixteenths pole and offered a mild rally to overtake JANE KENDEIGH for
second. JANE KENDEIGH stalked off the rail, was closest in pursuit while angling over to the rail around the bend, chased well out of range into the final
furlong and lost second late. HIGH FLYING GRACIE chased from inside, lost ground around the turn, saved ground to the stretch, angled out the lane and
weakened. NOBLE RUNNER chased between rivals into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. HALLELUJAH HIGH settled outside then
moved in and went between rivals, traveled three deep into the far turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and weakened. GIANIS GIRL coaxed along early,
chased outside rivals up the backstretch, went four deep into the turn, dropped back to last around the bend, remained wide to the stretch and had little left
for the drive.

DISCREPANCY stalked the speed from off the rail, bid three deep on the turn, took over at the top of the stretch, disposed of inner rival and drew off.
RESPECT THE CROWN came away awkwardly in the hind-quarters then bumped with outer rival, moved up widest in the early going, chased in the six
path entering the turn, moved over to the four path around the bend and finished willingly for second. PRINCESS MAGIC took control early, vied between
foes on the turn, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane and flattened to third. SWEET LIL' DARLIN raced up close on the inside, challenged into the
turn, fought inside a pair of rivals around the bend, could not kick on with the leaders into the lane and weakened. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST stalked between
rivals five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path, steered back out midstretch and weakened. RIPPIN A WAY turned her head and bumped inner
rival in the beginning, trailed out wide then angled in for the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION
THE HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

WRONG TURN CUPID bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure from outer rival while racing off the rail, cleared three wide into
the turn, moved into the two path then eased back out to show the way four wide into the lane, continued clear to the eighth pole under urging, challenged
with a sixteenth remaining and held on. ROCK N ROLL SONG chased in the five path into and around the bend, drew closer into the final furlong, put in a
late bid but could not get by the winner. DANCE KID sat off the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, kept to task through the lane and gained the
show. SUGAR SUGAR broke in and bumped the winner, stalked wide up the backstretch, navigated the turn six wide and lacked a bid. BONITA LEONA
antsy, stumbled leaving the gate, traveled outside a rival at the back, remained two wide to the stretch and failed to menace. LOVELY COLLEEN pressed
the pace from outside up the backstretch, could not keep touch with the leader into the turn, chased four wide around the bend and tired.

KNOWN IDEA set the pace inside rivals rivals from off the rail early, drew clear at the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted out in the lane, challenged by
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR at the eighth pole and held that rival at the bay. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR stalked the pace from inside into the turn, chased two wide
leaving the turn, bid inside KNOWN IDEA at the eighth pole and lacked the needed late punch in the final moments. RHINO raced up close outside the top
pair, chased four then five wide around the turn, followed within striking distance through the lane but finished evenly late. CRYPTO RIDE tracked wide up
the backstretch, moved from the five path to the four path around the bend, tipped out approaching the stretch, altered a bit in upper stretch and could not
produce a bid. EREBUS stumbled badly leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, moved to the rail and saved ground while making progress around the
bend but could not threaten in the stretch run. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME pressed from outside up the backstretch, chased the leader from the three path
into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. DANZING REBEL tracked off the rail, lost ground while moving to the two path around the bend,
tipped back out and came four wide into the stretch, then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
MCCLUSKY crowded between rivals at the start, coaxed into range off the rail, chased three wide into the turn, spun five wide into the lane, moved out to
rally widest, dueled with OCASEK late and dug in for the upset. OCASEK raced up close four deep, closest in pursuit through the turn, floated five wide into
the lane, took over in upper stretch, carried short lead into the final furlong, dueled with MCCLUSKY late and yielded grudgingly in the end. CANDY'S
WILDCAT showed the way early inside rivals, cleared leaving the backstretch, led two wide through the turn, drifted leaving the bend, lost command in
upper stretch, stayed on into the final furlong and flattened to third. KISSMEYOUFOOL tracked inside then moved off the rail, traveled two to three wide
around the bend and churned on for a minor award. NOTCH coaxed to the gate while dropping back, asked right handed early, went two wide around the
bend and improved position. CHIRAG raced up close three deep between rivals, chased three then four wide around the bend and weakened in the stretch
run. NATURAL CAT stalked widest up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, dropped back to last on the turn, angled six wide into the lane, drifted
inward in the lane and failed to menace. CHURCHMEISTER pressed between in the opening stages, chased after the pacesetter leaving the backstretch,
dropped back on the inside on the turn, tired down the lane, eased in the final furlong and walked off.
