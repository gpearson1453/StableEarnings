Footnotes
PANYARD TAP travelled in mid-division four wide on the first turn, improved two wide outside foes along the backside, edged closer measuring the
embattled duo around the final turn, pounced four wide turning for home and drew off when encouraged right-handed at the furlong marker for the win.
SCREEN LEGEND tossed its head on the break to be ahead of only the other poor starter down the back straight, began to smartly pick up foes three wide
midway on the final bend, shifted out four wide gathering momentum in upper stretch and burst between horses smartly in the two-path at the sixteenth pole
to best the rest at the wire. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN tracked outside while going six wide entering the first turn, prompted the pace outside down the
backside, moved in to bid two wide at the quarter pole, dueled stubbornly with runners on both sides in upper stretch up top but faded at the sixteenth pole
for to settle for the show money. QUESTION MARK seized command on the fence in the early stages, was headed outside by the quarter pole, fought on
inside rivals clinging to the lead in upper stretch, could not continue on up top in the lane and yielded on the fence in the final sixteenth of a mile. SEATTLE
STINGER travelled two wide in midfield on the first turn, continued to be in the middle of things along the backside, kept pace with rivals on the far turn and
lacked a rally in the stretch. HURRICANE DESHAMBO was squeezed and had to be checked between foes to trail in the beginning, stalked near the back
of the pack down the back straight, closed the margin on the fence by the quarter pole, angled four wide for the drive but made little presence down the
lane. JAVA POWER was nestled on the fence just behind the pacesetter, settled on the rail in the third tier along the backside, was going the wrong way
through the far turn and could not play a role in the stretch running. HIGHLAND ROCKY stalked near the rear on the rail, trailed the field at the half, could
not make any progress around the final bend but did manage to pass a straggler inside in deep stretch. TROPICAL GETAWAY forced the issue between
rivals into the first turn, tracked in the second flight outside along the backstretch, was hard ridden on the fence at the quarter pole but could not keep up to
the lead trio and emptied out in the two-path turning for home.

Footnotes
ZEENA SWIFT took control right from the start, opened up at will around the turn and was kept to the task in the stretch to improve the margin of victory
when crossing the finish line. SILENT PATSY broke out at the start, sat behind the pacesetter on the fence down the back straight, began to inch closer for
the runners up share around the turn and chased in vain down the stretch while holding safe for the place share. ALL MY TOMORROWS was pinched
between runners on the start to co-trail inside down the backside, began to pick up foes smartly when bursting between horses at the half mounting a rally,
had to wait behind a wall of runners at the quarter pole, found a seam three wide turning for home and finished up willingly to be a clear third in the end.
SAVE THE DATE tracked the front pair three deep in the early going, kept pace four wide going around rivals throughout the turn and surged late in deep
stretch to just get up for a minor role. PRINCESSONAMISSION was knocked sideways by the inside rival on the break, recovered to watch the duo outside
down the backstretch, was in the mix three wide between foes in the second group battling for the place share around the bend, dueled four wide between
horses down the lane for third money but needed more late when stalling in deep stretch. SCAT HUMOR was three deep close to the back of the pack down
the backstretch, made little impression around the turn, angled five wide for clear run driving to the wire but failed to fire in the stretch running. POWAQA
was unhurried to co-trail on the outside in the beginning, continued to see the field around the turn, offered a mild run at the quarter pole and passed some
tired foes in the lane. SCORED hounded the pace outside down the back straight, was scrubbed on three eighths from the wire but could not keep up with
the frontrunning winner around the turn and retreated between horses at the quarter pole. RENDEZVOUS travelled on the rail in the third flight stalking early
on, dropped back on the fence at the half mile marker and could not recover to pose a threat on rivals in the stretch running. LADY WITH ATTITUDE settled
three deep outside foes in the third flight down the backstretch, made little headway three wide around the bend and emptied out by upper stretch.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL was unprepared at the start tossing the head then hopping and breaking several lengths slowly, unhurriedly brought up the rear,
advanced on the leaders on the far turn fanning six wide into upper stretch, took aim, was put to steady urging, got up late. UMNEYAAT broke just a
half-step slowly, settled last but one, switched out off the inside, advanced three wide entering the far turn moving out five deep by the quarter pole, struck
the lead in upper stretch, was outfinished but second best. TEXT ME UP tracked inside a runner but off the rail mid-pack, shifted out four wide coming past
the quarter pole, made a mild bid between runners in upper stretch but was outkicked. AWILDAS TREASURE shifted in early, was reserved under a hold
racing mid-pack, swung three wide at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. SYSTEMATIC broke in the air, was forwardly-positioned staling outside three to
four wide, bid past the five-sixteenths taking a narrow brief lead, lacked the needed late kick. LADY IN RED pressed two to three wide, took a narrow brief
lead past the three-eighths, weakened. DELPHIA set the pace inside shadowed by a runner, faded.

Footnotes
LADIES RUM was pushed out six wide heading into the first turn to settle in midfield into the backstretch inside a rival, was urged, picking up the bit two
wide between foes with three eighths from home, moved in closer through the turn and determinedly wore down the leader in the lane to take command in
the last sixteenth for the score. AMI'S GIRL was jostled between rivals at the start to trail in the beginning, advanced sharply three deep outside foes down
the backside to sit just behind the pacesetter at the half, circled outside while in hand to easily take the lead with five sixteenths to go, opened up at the top
of the lane but just could not fend off the winner in deep stretch. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F was in tight between horses on the break, had a tracking role
between foes while two wide in the early stages, could not quicken with the outside flow of runners at the three furlong pole, was shuffled back a few
positions around the final turn and showed good resiliency to re-rally down the stretch in the four path outside foes to close back in for third money at the
wire. SIX FOR A NINE travelled in the three path near the rear, was ahead of only one rival going into the backstretch, improved outside at the half, rallied
three wide midturn and still in the three path was in range for a piece of the prize turning for home but had to settle on the fringes in the end. MADAM
GWEN settled near the rear on the rail at the start, was relegated to last down the backstretch, shifted just outside going around a weakening foe with three
eighths remaining, angled out widest in the seven path straightening for the drive and finished up with purpose but was on the losing end of a three-way duel
for the show award. MOTORIN' MAGGIE had control on the fence in the first turn, continued to set the pace while unchallenged along the back straight,
offered no response when collared outside three furlongs out and wilted on the rail turning for home. STORMY OCEAN broke in and had to be checked at
the start, settled in the second flight three wide outside keeping a close eye on the leader in the first bend, vied between horses down the backstretch just
behind the pacesetter, was roused midway on the turn but could not keep up with others and backed up on the fence in upper stretch. BRIT was a bit eager
chasing the frontrunner on the fence in the first turn, then was checked on the rail when in tight entering the backstretch to be shuffled back a few positions
along the backside, trailed the field at the three eighths marker and had no finish to offer in the drive to the line.

Footnotes
DREAMS AND SCHEMES tracked inside just off the inside mid-pack early, moved out on the far turn advancing four wide, struck the lead nearing the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. AGILE DANCER settled off the pace inside, moved out near the five-sixteenths and was four wide coming past the quarter
pole then under urging, was in contention in the stretch but no match for the winner while securing the place. FABELMAN broke out just a bit and a half-step
slowly, settled at the rear, swung out a few paths beginning to gain turning for home, was guided out eight wide in upper stretch and rallied strongly
thereafter but too late. SUGAR IT'S ELI was caught three to four wide early, took closer order past the half up the backstretch, was within range into the far
turn, went evenly in the stretch and needed more. VICTORY TOWN made a swift early move up the backstretch taking the lead past the half and outside
the seven-sixteenths, was clear into the far turn, overtaken in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SILVER SMOKE was urged forward and clear on
the first turn, set the early pace, was overtaken up the backstretch, continued one-paced thereafter. FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN settled off the leaders in the
two to three path early, went three to four wide on the far turn, failed to menace. SPEEDY PAL got away alertly and was prominent heading into the first turn
saving ground, ceded the lead content to track up close, faced traffic late up the backstretch and into the far turn getting shuffled back a bit, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SPIDER BELLE was allowed to settle at the back of the pack, three deep along the backside, began to mount a rally, lengthening stride three wide in
midturn, loomed a threat in the five path at the top of the lane and under a patient ride had more for the drive to pull away when asked in the final sixteenth
outside for the win. KAVALA stalked near the rear inside down the backstretch, was on hold in last on the fence with five sixteenths remaining, found a path
three wide and was full of run in mid-stretch to get up just before the finish line to capture the runners up share. HELLO FRIENDS was under a snug hold
having a slim lead outside down the backstretch, continued up front while shadowed on both sides still dictating terms around the turn, stubbornly fought on,
clinging to the lead with challengers trying to close in by upper stretch, gave way grudgingly to the winner outside in the last sixteenth and just missed
saving the place share just before the wire. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE had a rail trip, watching the engaged pair down the backside, was in hand waiting
behind a quartet of runners in the two path through the turn, tried to angle out but lacked running room in the four path in upper stretch, had a clear seam
when shifted out six wide at the furlong marker and was gaining steadily late but ran out of room when the wire came up first. CLEOMENES travelled
between runners in the second flight down the back straight. moved in to press the pace three wide between runners around the bend, was in the hunt four
wide straightening out for the drive but could not match strides with runners late and flattened out at the sixteenth pole. NORTHERN RUBY forced the issue
inside in the early stages of the race, briefly poked her head in front at the half, continued to be in the fray on the fence at the top of the lane, could not find
another gear late and folded on the fence with a sixteenth left to run. ANTIGONE tracked in the second flight three deep outside foes along the backside,
took closer order four wide around horses to be in the conversation up top midway on the turn, was fanned out when giving way six wide turning for home
and had nothing more to give by upper stretch.

HAPPY VALENTINE was quite content to sit just outside the frontrunner in the early parts of the race, cruised around boldly outside to bid for the lead at the
quarter pole, drew off with mild urging with a furlong to go and under a ride late was kept to the task to win by a diminishing margin at the finish line.
BLAMELESS GHOST was brushed outside on the start, tracked the front two while tucked in on the rail in the early going, was in range just behind the
contesting leaders in upper stretch inside a rival, edged closer through the lane but did not have enough to threaten the winner at the finish line.
FORTYFIVESEVENTY was bumped by the outside runner on the break, recouped to settle all alone in midfield, rating kindly entering the backstretch,
waited to move maintaining position at the half, was roused right-handed at the top of the lane in the four path, found her best stride late and was running on
end sharply in deep stretch. SILENT SKY was in a good position, tracking the lead duo outside in the second flight for the early parts of this two-turn race,
continued to measure the top two around the far turn, had a chance three wide when straightening out for the drive, could not find another gear late and
stalled in the final sixteenth to settle for a minor role in the end. COZY CURLIN KITTEN veered in and had to be taken up briefly to trail at the start,
continued at the rear seeing the field down the back straight, shifted out in the five path in last turning for home and finished up with very good late energy in
deep stretch. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY seized the lead on the rail into the first turn, set the pace while shadowed outside by the eventual winner down the
backstretch, was collared outside at the quarter pole, fought on tenaciously until the furlong marker before giving way up front, had no more to offer in deep
stretch and faded on the rail to lose a few placings late. FOXY DIVA stalked near the rear outside in the beginning, made no progression outside horses
down the backside, angled out four wide for the drive but could not get involved in the drive to the wire. DOMER ALLURE was brushed inside on the break,
settled near the back, ahead of only the poor starter in the early going, closed the gap while inside down the backstretch. ran evenly on the rail saving
ground on the final turn and retreated on the fence in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
SIGIRIYA was reluctant to load prior to the start, had a good spot three wide on the outside watching the lead twosome down the backside, was nudged
with five sixteenths to go moving closer to the pacesetter around the turn, kept chipping away while four wide between runners, narrowing the margin down
the lane and under a well-timed stretch run, got up and held off the late closer in deep stretch to prevail at the finish line. SLOANS SKY was all alone, ahead
of only the two poor starters down the backstretch, shifted outside to commence a run three wide picking up runners smartly at the quarter pole, was full of
run in the six-path moving in on the leaders straightening out for home, inched closer with every stride to the wire but just missed with a final late surge for
the win. MOET MONET took up the chase outside in mid-backstretch, edged away for the lead two wide with three furlongs to go, was very game holding off
runners while in the two-path in upper stretch, dug in down the lane but just got weary in deep stretch to finish up a clear third in the end. MISS WATERLOO
travelled in the three path in mid-division along the backside, improved going around runners three wide throughout the turn, loomed a presence in the five
path turning or home, could not sustain the rally at the furlong pole between foes and evened out in deep stretch to be a fringe player at the wire.
MAGNETIZE settled near the rear in the beginning, made an early move at the five eighths marker to advance quickly down the backstretch to watch the
contesting duo between runners at the half, was hard ridden but could not advance anymore on the leaders by the quarter pole and finished up one paced
in the stretch. WAR VOW had a poor start being bumped to trail in the early going, caught up to a rival to co-trail outside with three furlongs from home,
angled five wide for the stretch drive and had a good late rally outside to pass a few runners through the stretch. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER had a good
spot on the rail just behind the engaged duo down the back straight, could not accelerate with others making a move outside around the bend, lost positions
through the turn and failed to menace in the stretch drive. CLASSIC GLORY was away slowly to be close the back of the pack inside along the backstretch,
co-trailed on the inside with three eighths to run and could only find a little interest in the lane to pass a stopping foe in the last sixteenth. A STING FOR
LOVE was away alertly to have the lead in the beginning, was headed outside at the three furlong marker, tried to keep up with runners but to no avail while
on the rail through the turn and wilted on the fence not switching leads by mid-stretch.
