Footnotes
SWEET SASH stalked in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kicked
clear of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. BUBBLES UP bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path, moved up under coaxing
midway around the turn, and rallied from the three path down the stretch to get up for place. IN TIMING showed the way in the two path, was coaxed while
floating out to the four path at the top of the lane, but yielded in the final sixteenth to show. LILY BIRD prompted the pace in the three path, came under
coaxing midway around the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. LOVING GAZE (IRE) raced off the pace in the two path,
steadied early around the turn, then again midway around the turn, and made no impact. GOLDEN VALLEY bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in
the three path but never threatened. ALIA'S FAITH had a slow start, chased along the rail but appeared to take an awkward step midway around the turn,
and gaveway.

Footnotes
NEW BABY exchanged brushes with BELLY DANCE leaving the chute, made progress in the two path around the turn, angled to the rail leaving the quarter
pole, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out under right-handed urging into the path of SHILOH nearing the sixteenth pole, continued to drift out and dug
in to hold off HOLY KINGDOM in the final yards. HOLY KINGDOM raced in range outside, bid in the four path around the turn, vied outside of a pair through
midstretch, was lightly bumped near the sixteenth pole, kept on well and just missed. LACE CURTAIN bumped at the start, raced off the pace five wide and
was along for the show. BELLY DANCE exchanged brushes with NEW BABY leaving the chute, saved ground off the pace and improved position in the
lane. SHILOH disputed the pace three wide between foes, battled on between the top two finishers through midstretch, was shut off by a drifting out NEW
BABY and forced to take up nearing the sixteenth pole and was eased from there. VANISHING WISH set the pace along the rail and retreated after a half.
MRS. CASH MAN bumped with LACE CURTAIN at the start, pressed the pace four wide and faltered in the lane. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF SHILOH AGAINST BOTH NEW BABY AND HOLY KINGDOM, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NEW BABY FROM FIRST AND
PLACED HER FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE.

Footnotes
SAINT CLOUD set the pace in the two path, drifted out a bit in the lane and dug in to hold safe late. MR TYSON tracked the pace in the four path, steadily
gained through the lane and just missed. INCANTO (IRE) broke sharply but lacked early speed under some urging, raced off the pace in the four path,
lugged in through the stretch and finished strongly to gain the show. GALLANT KNIGHT stalked the pace in the two path, had aim in upper stretch but was
one-paced through the lane. STONE COLD FLEX saved ground and failed to menace. LET'S GO LIAM played no factor while racing four wide. SNEAKY
SNEAKY was off a bit slowly, raced off the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. HERECOMESDAPEACH chased the pace inside and retreated through
the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT AND VIOLENT stalked in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three path around the far turn, bid while swinging from the five path into the
lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and held sway. BANDERO steadied at the start but was held up in the four path early, was driven into the far
turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on his left lead for place. HEY RIVER set the pace in the two path, received a right handed
cue midway around the far turn, kept on while floating out to the four path at the top of the lane, but was edged out by an outer pair in the final furlong to
show. BELLY OF JELLY prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn, and finished evenly from the two path in the
stretch. FLATTER ME raced in the midpack from the three path but made no impact. FORTY FLASH tracked in the five path, bid in the four path midway
around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and faded. EUPHORIA STAR hopped at the start, chased in the six path and did not
factor. ROWDY JESS raced off the pace inside and never threatened. ENSIGN SKIP raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
LOU had a slow start, raced wellback in the four path, was driven in the six path around the turn, rallied from the five path turning into the lane, and drew
past an inner pair late. ASTIN STYLE vied for the lead in the three path, came under a ride along the rail passing the three-eighths pole, bumped with an
outer foe turning into the stretch, dug in to fight off that foe, but got caught another late charging outer rival late to place. IRON HAND dueled for the lead in
the five path, was cued in the two path midway around the turn, bumped with an inner foe entering the lane, and ran on, but hung late to show. EXCUSES
raced off the pace inside, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, but made no impact. WIN WITH FAITH broke in at the start, trailed in the three path,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but failed to bid. TO THE MAX stalked in the four path but faded in the stretch. BLUFF tracked in the two
path but weakened in the stretch. WHISKY RESERVE chased in the four path but never threatened. FIT TO FIRE hopped at the start, raced off the pace in
the three path and never menaced from the five path down the lane.

Footnotes
BELTS 'N BROOKS settled off the duel while racing three wide, came four wide into the lane, closed outside and was up late. MORGAN POINT saved
ground off the pace, made progress at the rail around the turn, angled three wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, gained on the
pacesetters, reached even terms between foes past the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner. BEASTLY SPEED engaged in a protracted duel
inside of POWER HUMOR, exchanged several brushes with that foe on the turn and in the stretch, had the rider lose the crop near the sixteenth pole, won
the duel but was unable to fend off the top two finishers in the late yards. POWER HUMOR dueled two wide, exchanged several brushes on the turn and in
the stretch, vied to the sixteenth pole and weakened between rivals late. MAJOR KING failed to menace while racing four wide. GO BILLY GO played no
factor while racing five wide. BLACK FURY was pinched back at the start, gave chase four wide and lacked a closing bid. HOLIDAY FANTASY bumped at
the start, raced in range two wide and lacked a response.

BOLD LOOKER had an awkward start, raced off the pace in the seven path, came under right handed encouragement in the five path midway around the
turn, took aim in the six path at the top of the lane, and drew past an inner trio in the final sixteenth. FIRST TEAM tracked in the five path, bid three wide
passing the quarter, and ran on for place. CADRON SETTLEMENT bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was roused to bid
between foes in the two path midway around the turn, and kept on for show. CAJUN FOOL vied for the lead in the five path, took command and was roused
while angling to the rail passing the three-eighths pole, dug in in upper stretch, but yielded late. SUMMER STORM STRIC trailed in the six path early and
made no impact. POSEIDONS MYTH bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, but was no factor. UNEQUIVOCALLY bumped between foes at the start, prompted the pace in the two path but faded in the stretch. BIG TOBY
chased in the three path but never threatened in the six path down the lane. GALIPAN dueled for the lead in the three path but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
ANDREA set the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, drew clear nearing the far turn, angled to the rail entering the bend, extended the advantage
approaching the quarter pole, drew off under a drive in upper stretch and widened while geared down late. WHATINTHELITERAL saved ground in range,
could not gain on the winner but finished willingly at the rail in the lane to be a clear second. KIP THE DISTANCE pressed the winner two wide, could not
match strides nearing the quarter pole but stayed on well enough to secure the show. MISS MARY NELL raced off the pace two wide and improved position
in the lane. BRENNA failed to menace while racing four wide. MOM'S MARTINI was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and faltered in the
stretch. VALIANT KISS played no factor while racing three wide. GARUDA stumbled at the start, gave chase four wide and came up empty in the lane. DEL
ROSARIO threw her head at the start, saved ground well back and never reached contention. SOUPER ZONDA broke awkwardly and bumped MOM'S
MARTINI, raced five wide and played no further factor.

Footnotes
RAPSCALLION had a slow start and trailed in the three path turning into the backstretch, advanced under a drive rounding the far turn, rallied to lead
passing the eighth pole, and held sway. DIXIE PREACH rated in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, ran on to bid passing the eighth pole, but was
denied by an inner foe to place. DYNAMIC EMPIRE set the pace in the two path, lost the lead along the inside going into the far turn, tipped out to the three
path passing the eighth pole, and chased on to hold show. CAJUN'S CHOICE chased in the two path, angled out to the five path turning into the stretch, but
flattened. MAX FORWARD SPEED bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was driven in the two path around the far turn, but faded
from the four path in the stretch. FORTHELOVEOFART prompted the pace in the three path, took command from the two path entering the far turn, was
cued midway around the far turn, but gaveway along the inside at the eighth pole. FIRST SHOT FIRED bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the
pace inside early and never threatened. VADUZ tracked in the five path but weakened.
