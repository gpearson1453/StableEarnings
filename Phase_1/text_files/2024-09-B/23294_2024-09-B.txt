Footnotes
STASHU was rated along and two to three wide on the turn, four wide by the quarter pole, made a bid to go on even terms by the furlong marker and drove
clear to prove best. HOFF stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to take over leaving the quarter pole, then was headed by
the winner by the furlong marker and could not go with that rival while staying on to be clearly second best. CAPTAIN FANCY was settled early, four wide by
the quarter pole and made a bid but needed more while besting the rest. STORM THE STREETS tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the final
furlong. MALACHI was settled back early, two wide by the quarter pole, moved out and started to unwind, then angled in by the furlong marker and
improved late. CUTLASS KING was reserved early, moved out and came five wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. EL OSO lunged inwardly and
brushed the inner stall door upon leaving the gate, lacked speed along the inside, saved ground before swinging to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to
menace. BOURBON STATE was off very slow and ten lengths last, then saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. BAYTOWN BULLEIT chased the
pace on the inside and tired. COASTERTOTHEMOON failed to respond. SO GRAND set the early pace while racing off the inside, three wide on the turn
and gave way in the drive. BEGFORFORGIVENESS bobbled at the break and was off slowly, then was not a factor.

Footnotes
UNHIDDEN GEM (IRE) was well rated early on the outside, came four wide by the quarter pole, made a bid and slowly edged clear by the sixteenth marker
and then held off the late charge from RIPASSARE late to prevail under a drive. RIPASSARE was allowed to settle early, came five wide by the quarter pole
and closed well late but was too late, good effort. MORINGA was bumped at the start and pushed out, then was reserved early, two wide on the turn, moved
in nearing the three sixteenths and rallied well up the inside to gain the show award late. FROM SCRATCH broke out and bumped a rival at the start, then
tracked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front nearing the furlong marker and battled on but faded late losing
the show award on the wire. MO ATTITUDE was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn, moved out in the lane and had a mild late rally under
hand urging. RUNAWAY KITTEN was bumped at the start and then checked hard and had to take up after the break, then recovered and got into stride on
the outside on the turn, six wide by the quarter pole and advanced but had no late gain. ZAPPERA was reserved on the inside, moved out in the lane and
had a belated rally. MATERIAL WITNESS set the pace while clear and in the two path, remained clear off the turn but was headed nearing the furlong
marker and faltered. STAR WATCH was outrun early, four wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. JERSEYS PARADE was settled back early, six
wide by the quarter pole and was not a factor. KIMBERLINA chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BLOODY COLORS WAVE was bumped at the
break, chased the pace and was in between rivals on the turn then stopped.

quarter pole, then was sent down nearing the furlong marker and held well to prove best, driving. LUCKY MISCHIEF was well rated early, moved out and
made a six wide bid by the quarter pole, then finished gamely but could not get by the winner, good effort. COALMOON was reserved early, two to three
wide on the turn, four wide by the quarter pole, then rallied well on the inside. HIGH LIMIT was reserved early three wide, advanced on the turn and moved
out to be seven wide by the five sixteenths to make a bid, then lugged in by the furlong marker and flattened out. REVERSE MERGER was settled early on
the inside on the turn, angled out by the quarter pole, then had a belated rally. POWER OF WILL chased the pace and made a mild three wide bid off the
turn but weakened. TIZ A SHOWDOWN chased the pace on the inside and weakened. COLLECTIVE CHOICE was off slowly and failed to menace.

thew quarter pole, then gained command but was then engaged with the winner by the furlong marker and dug in gamely to fight on but could not go with
that rival late while being second best. STRIKINGLY SPUN was rated along early towards the inside, then came four wide off the bend and made a bid but
needed more kick late, held show award. WATCH THIS BIRDIE was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn,

LIMITED LIABILITY set the pace while racing off the inside, was well handled while in the three to two path and clear, then was sent down leaving the turn
and drew off by the quarter pole and then was wrapped up the final sixteenth of a mile to prove much the best. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) was off a step
slow, settled back early while on the inside, made a middle move on the inside to be in contention on the far turn, was boxed by the three eighths marker
and then tipped out two wide leaving the turn and chased the winner home while no match for that rival but clearly second best. CYBER NINJA was settled
early on the inside to the two path, then offered no rally while getting up for the show award. SIX MINUS was well placed along the inside, made a three
wide bid on the far turn by the three eighths marker but could not sustain that bid while losing the show award late. DUVET DAY (IRE) was settled early two
wide and lacked a rally while besting the rest. CONGLOMERATE chased the early pace two wide for a mile and then tired. FAMILIAR DREAMS (GB) was
off slowly, then moved up to track the early pace four wide, then stalked the pace three wide and then stopped leaving the three eighths marker.
