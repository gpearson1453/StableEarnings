TAP IT UP tracked close up on the inside, waited two wide passing the quarter pole, rallied inside in the stretch run, surged in deep stretch and prevailed in
the final yards. QUEEN TAPITURE chased four wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained a short lead, drifted out a bit in midstretch
and dug in gamely to the finish. THE FURMANATOR dueled two wide for the lead, dueled inside rivals on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held
well for third. TAPIT'S GIRL raced close up between rivals, then three wide on the turn and rallied mildly in the lane. MOVING IN STEREO was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace with an inside trip and lacked a rally. SANSA ARIEL dueled inside for the early lead, then chased on the turn and weakened.
PARISIAN VIBE lunged and was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn and closed mildly inside in the stretch.
AWESOMENEWYEAR raced five wide leaving the chute, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. OSCAR GAZE raced off the

Footnotes
IRISH MEADOW was outrun early, raced three wide on the backside, moved up quickly on the far turn, split rivals turning for home, rallied to the front,
pulled away under some urging and was ridden out. CRAFTY DON raced three wide early, settled nicely off the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the far
turn, dueled into the stretch and came up second best. PRINS FIRE dueled inside from the outset in a prolonged battle, dueled on the far turn, dug in
through the lane and held third. PREDICTED dueled two wide for command, dueled on the backside and far turn, then tired. TEPEU raced two wide off the
pace and failed to threaten. BALANTYNE was bumped at the start and steadied, outrun early on the inside, chased inside on the turn and failed to rally.
BRASSTOWN stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside and failed to respond. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH stumbled and bumped a rival at the start,
was outrun early while two wide and never factored.
