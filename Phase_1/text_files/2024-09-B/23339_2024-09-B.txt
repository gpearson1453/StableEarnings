hand urging was able to prevail on the wire. PICKFORD unhurried to far turn, rallied on in the stretch run too late. MAJOR SPARKS was slow into stride
from the gate, unhurried and trailed to far turn, rallied in earnest through the final furlong to close the gap with a rush. DEVILS RED pressed pace between
horses to far turn, weakened in the drive. ONE LUCKY DAY with leaders three wide to the stretch, emptied out final eighth. SMOKEY LEE inside speed,
