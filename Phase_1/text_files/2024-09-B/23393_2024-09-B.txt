I DON'T SEE COLORS alternated for the lead outside, shook clear nearing the quarter pole and widened driving. DISTURBED trailed early, swung wide
and closed with good late energy. ROCKET DRAGON forced the pace between rivals early and continued gamely for the show. TOP OF THE STREET
moved close up inside then flattened out in the stretch. MR SANDMAN dropped back wide, bid into the stretch then faded. SMOKIN HOLIDAY hustled to
narrow advantage inside, dueled through the turn then faltered. MANOLITO flashed speed then stopped badly losing contact with his field.

outside to the stretch and weakened. MIKEY'S SONG trailed for half mile then passed rivals without menacing. MARY'S REWARD urged to the front inside,
dueled then faltered. ALMA BRILHA dropped back early and was always outrun. HOP ON ME chased outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
MR. ANTONELLI stalking the dueling leaders outside, bid to the front at the quarter pole and eagerly pulled away. THE MONOPOLY MAN angled out early,
moved wide on the turn and stretch and was up for the place. BRONX BOYS outrun early, moved inside on the turn then angled out in the stretch. BIG Z
OG alternated for the advantage between rivals and gave way in the stretch. BET THE LINE dropped back outside and was never in contention. UNCLE
WINCHESTER bumped about early, lagged far behind and was always outrun. WHISKEYROMEOSIERRA dueled along the rail to midway on the turn and
stopped.

Footnotes
SUMMARY JUDGMENT stalked the pacesetters, moved easily to the front into the far turn and pulled away under moderate coaxing. FLASHNDYNAMITE
well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch but proved second best. BOSS LIKE BETH moved close up inside and continued well while no
threat. AYEARTOREMEMBER chased off the pace outside, moved very wide on the final turn. UNADULTERATED dropped back three wide then passed
fading rivals. AMATERASU trailed for half mile inside then rallied mildly outside. GANGSTER RAP chased in midpack and lacked a response. LAMASCO
set pressured pace inside then was finished midway on the final turn. IRIE EMPRESS dropped back early and weakened steadily.
