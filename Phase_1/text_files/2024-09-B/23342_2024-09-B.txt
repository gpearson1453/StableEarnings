AMERICAN BLAZE was four wide leaving the opening turn, moved up closer nearing the seven sixteenth then fanned three wide, drifted out in the final turn,
rallied steadily outside and prevailed. AL REICHERT stalked the pace in the three path, drove up between foes in the far turn, struck the led into the stretch,
and was caught late. COOLWIND was five wide into the opening turn, trailed in the final turn, launched an all out bid along the rail and was outfinished.
NICE GUY EDDIE broke alertly then crossed over on the field quickly into the opening turn, contended the pace inside of GLAVA, and weakened in the final
sixteenth. GABBYSONHOLIDAY was under a snug hold in the backstretch while four to five wide, and tired. GLAVA fanned three wide in the opening turn,
then pressed the pace under a strong hold, and gave way.

SOLO RING crowded at the start, tracked four to five wide, advanced outside in the final turn, and won going away. COMMON KNOWLEDGE attended the
early pace then took back, tracked three wide, drove four wide in the final turn, and closed belatedly. BARE BACK JACK was five to six wide early, and
rallied late to earn show. RUMOHR REIGNS prompted the pace from the rail, dueled in the far turn, disposed to rival but came up empty for the drive and
finished on the wire with TUCKER TIME. TUCKER TIME rated well off the pace, rallied late finishing up at the same time as RUMOHR REIGNS. JEFF FA

SMART PLAY unsettled in the gate, contested the pace while four wide, moved clear approaching the final turn, and was kept to task. BRODY'S PAL
tracked five wide, was asked to quicken in the final turn, battled through the stretch and held under a drive. H K RAPPER unhurried early, shifted outside in
the far turn, rallied determinedly outside of BRODY'S PAL but was unable to get by. FLASHFORDANI saved ground and lacked closing response.
ZICATELA set the early pace, was overtaken and retreated along the rail. SILVERFOOT offered little. THESHACK sat in range and tired.

Footnotes
NO MORE LIES sat just off the early pace while three wide, gained a slim advantage at the quarter pole, turned back a challenge from NASAS PRINCESS
and held firm to the wire. NASAS PRINCESS tracked the pacesetters four to five wide, swung out at the head of the lane setting her sights on NO MORE
LIES, rallied outside but was unable to get by late. POCKETFULOFDREAMS trailed the field, shifted outside, then drifted in through the stretch while
closing, and was along for show honours. AH TOUCHE chased four wide, and closed gradually in the stretch. SOLAR FORCE hurried away then chased six
wide, and flattened in the stretch. SEATTLE STING showed little. BIZ BABE vied for the early lead inside, and stopped in the stretch. ABSOLUTE
PLEASURE lacked bid. TANGO FOR THE SOUL outrun throughout.
