Footnotes
MAGGIE'S FAYE showed good speed from the start, dueled with BRONZE'S FLOWER to the backstretch, then took command at that point, led the field
through the turn and into the stretch and was able to hold off a late charge from TOUGH TO CATCH to prevail. TOUGH TO CATCH allowed to settle behind
the pace from the start, went wide into the first turn and remained there for the backstretch run, angled to the rail before the last turn, started to run on from
the three-sixteenths, made a nice late turn in the final stages but came up short. BRONZE'S FLOWER was hustled determindely from the break to get
forward position, dueled with MAGGIE'S FAYE for the early lead then ceded to that one down the backstretch, chased to the stretch but had little to offer at
that point and was passed for the place. LOVELY BRIDE went three wide into the first turn, tracked the pace from a few lengths back held position to the
stretch but lacked a rally. MALIBU MARCIA became rank and hard to handle after the break, went four wide and was last into the first turn, dropped back
steadily through the early stages and was eased before the stretch and galloped to the wire well behind the rest.

Footnotes
CITY OF CHAMPIONS came away well and showed good speed without being asked, settled mid-pack tracking the pacesetting pair, was put into a drive
from the seven-sixteenths pole, began to gain on the leaders, tipped out three wide into the stretch then wore down SEIGE THE DAY to prevail despite
racing on the left lead through the final furlong. SEIGE THE DAY showed good speed from the outside post and was sent to the lead, then dueled to the
outside of RUNAWAY WYWY to the far turn, put that foe away before the furlong marker, finished well but could not hold back the winner in the final yards.
QUICK INTRO hopped in the air at the start spotting the rest a head start, tracked well behind the pace, then launched a bid from the quarter pole, went
three wide through the last turn and four wide into the stretch and was gaining late but ran out of time. RUNAWAY WYWY was hustled from the gate to get
forward position, dueled inside of SEIGE THE DAY to the stretch, then weakened and had little to offer in the stretch. RAY OF THE SEA was pushed on
from the start but unable to contest the pace, settled near the rear of the field, started to lose touch with the field down the backstretch and was not a factor
from that point.

MISSED CALL allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position passing the finish for the first time, chased outside of rivals through the backstretch
run, loomed three to four wide nearing the furlong marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command past the sixteenth-marker and gamely held for
the win. BIG FLAME allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground and improved position into the second turn, waited for racing room at the furlong
marker, angled out into upper stretch, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure the place honors. WARRENS
WORLD off a step slowly, recovered and tracked the loose pacesetter into the first turn, made an inside move passing the wire for the first time and disputed
the pace into the second turn, took command with a quarter mile to go, dug in and led into upper stretch, was overtaken in the final strides for the win and
place and held safely for the show. GORDY'S BOY away in good order, took back off of the moderate early pace, was well placed while outside of runners
heading to the second turn, chased two to three wide into the backstretch run, swung four to five wide for the stretch drive and needed more in the final
sixteenth. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground through the stretch for
the first time and was well placed into the second turn, waited behind runners at the furlong marker, continued to race in tight into the stretch and was
outkicked in the final sixteenth. PRIME TIME PORTA hustled to assume early command, sprinted to a clear lead, set a contested pace two wide into the
second turn, vied between rivals nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the stretch drive. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) took back off of the
moderate early pace, trailed passing the wire for the first time, maintained a wide trip through the backstretch run and into the far turn and could not muster
a late response.

DR. FLASH DANCER came away well and went for the lead without really being asked, opened up a couple of lengths on the backstretch run, maintained
the margin through the last turn and finished well holding all at bay to the finish. ROJO PEQUENO came away well but opted to sit off the developing pace
duel, was content to sit mid-pack to the far turn, waited along the rail for some racing room then got a seam to run through into the stretch, finished well but
could not reel in the winner. CONEJO MALO was hustled from the gate but unable to contest the early pace, was pushed from the half-mile marker and
advanced on the pacesetters down the backstretch, bid three wide into the stretch, and finished well but ran out of time. FORD FLYER lacked early speed,
went two wide into the first turn then went into a drive passing the half-mile marker, was making a good run through the final turn the got in tight quarters
turning for home, recovered and finished with some interest but could not make an impact late. SIX HOT GRANDS broke out and bumped with DR FLASH
DANCER after the break, had to regroup and was last and three wide into the first turn, continued to trail down the backstretch and through the far turn and
managed to pass one late. MONSIEUR broke then was content to stalk DR FLASH DANCER through the early stages, chased that one to the far turn,
came under heavy pressure from the three-sixteenths pole but did not respond, and had little to offer late and faded.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN assumed command away from the start, set a contested pace outside of an inner rival along the first turn, was well handled while
setting disputed fractions along the backstretch run, shook free nearing the second turn and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was set down into
upper stretch, kept to task through the lane and held safely in the final stages. AIRKITA asked for early speed and prominent away from the start, contested
the pace inside of BLUEBERRY MUFFIN entering the first turn, disputed the pace from the inside through the backstretch run, lost position nearing the
second turn and chased BLUEBERRY MUFFIN heading to the furlong marker, was outkicked in the stretch drive and just held for a share of the place
honors. JULIET'S KITCHEN stumbled sharply at the start and was away slowly, allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, split
runners into the backstretch run and was roused with a quarter mile left, well placed approaching the second turn, rallied at the furlong marker and tipped
two wide into upper stretch, could not reel in the winner into the final sixteenth and got up for a share of second. SPANISH CHANNEL tracked the early
pace from the outside, was well placed while two wide into the first turn, stalked the leading pair heading to the quarter pole, chased between runners
approaching the furlong grounds, closed in the stretch drive and just missed for the minor awards. HARBOR DEAREST bobbled at the start and was off a
bit slowly, was allowed to settle and raced three wide into the first turn, ran in pursuit while widest through the backstretch run, chased three to four wide
nearing the furlong marker, rallied five wide into the stretch, showed good late interest but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. MORO FIRST
CLASS took back off of the early pace, got caught a bit in tight into the first turn and checked between rivals, chased three wide along the backstretch and
could not muster a late rally. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA settled just off of the early pace, tracked the leaders from an inside position into the first turn, was
outrun through the backstretch and lacked a response in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY was last away then allowed to settle near the rear of the field, was kept in striking distance through the early stages then started a
bid after passing the quarter pole, navigated between horses through the last turn then came three wide into the stretch, responded to steady handling and
was up in the last jump. RINGTONE settled inside, moved up under some restraint down the backstretch the second time, launched a bid from the quarter
pole inside through the last turn, tipped two wide for the stretch run and battled under left handed urging but was outfinished by the winner in the final jump.
JUNIORS KITTY hustled to the front and gained the early lead with CRAZY STORM and MIGHT RULER pressing the issue from the inside and outside
respectively, slipped away from those two through the first turn and was left alone to set the pace, led the field around the course the second time and had a
clear lead at the top of the stretch the weakened in the last sixteenth. MR MAKUNOUCHI was outrun and dropped well off he pace through the early going,
regained contact with the field with about a half-mile to go, started a forward move from the quarter pole on the rail but was stuck behind horses, had clear
run down the stretch but could not summon the needed response and finished evenly. CRAZY STORM hustled from the break and vied inside for the early
lead, then pulled back and stalked JUNIORS KITTY, remained close to the far turn then started to weaken near the three-sixteenths pole and flattened in
the stretch. MIGHTY RULER broke well and was pushed to contest the pace three wide early, became rank going into the first turn, continued to race close
up but three wide through the second turn then started to drop off the pace down the backstretch and was not persevered with down the stretch when
hopelessly behind.

Footnotes
DANZ TILL TEN tracked the early pace from between runners, stalked two to three wide into the stretch for the first time, made a middle move and gained
command heading into the second turn, set the pace while clear along the backstretch, kept to task while chased by WINTER SOLDIER nearing the furlong
grounds, found another gear in upper stretch and drew away in the late stages as much the best. WINTER SOLDIER asked for speed leaving the start,
stalked the early pace from the inside, was well placed into the stretch for the first time, chased two wide into the second turn, ran in pursuit of DANZ TILL
TEN with a quarter mile to go, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and was a clear second. CARDINAL TRICK tracked the early pace from the
second flight, was caught three to four wide along the first turn, saved ground into the second turn, got caught a bit in tight nearing the furlong marker, tipped
two wide into upper stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final sixteenth and got up for third. BESKAR hustled to be forwardly placed in the early
stages, assumed command along the first turn and showed the way through the stretch for the first time, lost the lead into the second turn, chased from the
inside through the backstretch run, faded in the final furlong and was outfinished for third in deep stretch. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke alertly and sped to
the early lead, lost the lead to BESKAR along the first turn, went four then three wide the first time through the stretch, lost ground along the second turn,
could not muster a late response and gave way. APLOMBADO broke in air at the start and spotted the field to begin, trailed through the early stages, was
able to pass a tired runner in the final quarter mile but did not factor. CORAZON DE LUCIA took back off of the modest early pace, saved ground passing
the wire for the first time and did not make an impact in the late stages.

Footnotes
MUCINO hesitated a bit at the start but was quickly sent forward to contest the early pace, joined DRUIDIC before the first bend, then took a short lead
heading down the backstretch for the first time and slowed down the pace while uncontested, maintained the margin for the second lap then started to
quicken with six furlongs to run, easily repelled the first challenge from SEA OF LIBERTY with about a half-mile to run then held DRUIDIC at bay down the
stretch for the final time and won clear. DRUIDIC was sent from the break, dueled briefly through the first turn with MUCINO then ceded the lead to that foe
and dropped back to a stalking position for a lap and a half, lost some ground the second time around then launched a bid with a little over a quarter mile to
run, loomed a threat near the eighth pole but could not reel in the winner down the stretch in a good effort. HONOS MAN was content to race at the back of
the field for over a mile then launched a sustained bid with three furlongs to run, loomed boldly with a three wide bid around the last turn and finished well
but was outfinished by the top pair in the final sixteenth. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) bided time near the rear of the field with only HONOS MAN behind,
waited until a half-mile left to run then responded when set down, went two to three wide through the last turn and finished willingly but left with too much
ground to make up. SEA OF LIBERTY raced close up in the third position early then was first to make a run at MUCINO after about seven furlongs had
been run, was lapped on that one the second time past the grandstand then came under a stiff drive down the backstretch then started to fade and was not
a factor down the stretch. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was content to track mid-pack while saving ground for the whole journey, started to have trouble
maintaining position as the pace picked up on the last lap, dropped back to last heading down the backstretch for the final time, responded when put into a
stiff drive from the half-mile marker, made a mild run but was outrun in the late stages. ENOS SLAUGHTER rated kindly mostly under cover in the two path
for two trips around the oval, began to lose ground with about a half-mile to run, made a mild run under a stiff drive but found the distance too taxing and did
not have the needed late kick. MOUNT PELLIAR allowed to settle into stride, went two deep through the first turn, got to the rail for the run down the
backstretch the first time, tipped out to the three path while advancing to race close to the pace but three to four wide for the second lap then was still racing
two to three wide starting the last lap, did not quicken with the pace and started to drop out of it with a half-mile to run despite being put into a stiff drive, was
last going into the last turn followed the field to the wire for the last time.
