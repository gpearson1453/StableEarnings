Footnotes
GERLIN'S EMPIRE leaned out at the start before being floated back in, tracked from midpack inside of rivals while a path off of the inner railing, tipped out
to the four path to take aim outside of the leaders in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and gradually drove past. ITWILLBEFUN broke a step
slow, tugged forward inside of rivals to achieve stalking position down the backstretch, tipped outside of the top pair while racing strongly in the bid turning
for home, bid outside of the leader in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage while taking light contact from that one as an outer rival menaced at the sixteenth
pole, but was bested by that wider challenger late. WISCONSIN GAL set the pace inside of a prompting rival, disposed of that one entering the lane before
meeting an outer challenge shortly after, dug in to cling to an advantage through midstretch, but shifted out and brushed her counterpart while getting
headed at the sixteenth pole and yielded to the top pair late. GOOD TEMPER bumped with an inner rival leaving the gate before being floated inwardly and
forced to check shortly after, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn, altered course out to the five path at the three furlong pole, tucked back to the
three path nearing the lane, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. EZ TREE ATES broke slowly, raced at the rear in the two path,
shifted out to the five path to advance position in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer rival for fourth late. CAROLINA SMOKESHOW prompted outside
of the leader, vied turning for home, but yielded between rivals entering the lane and faded. MACLEAN'S LULLABY pressed three deep into the turn, but
faded in the four path with three furlongs to go, got floated to the six path entering the lane and continue to weaken. MY CHERRY PIE bobbled at the start,
raced off of the pace in the four to five path and failed to factor. TECTONIC chased from midpack in the three path and between horses, but weakened
around the turn.

CLASSY'N CONNECTED rated unhurried along the inside, saved ground turning for home, encountered traffic entering the lane, remained buried behind
rivals through upper stretch, smoothly tipped out five wide for clear sailing leaving the furlong grounds and swept past well in hand. CHA CHA CHUKKA
broke a touch outwardly at the start, tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, bid in upper stretch, wrestled a brief advantage with a sixteenth to
go but was swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder shortly after and pulled clear of the rest. LOW COUNTRY MAGIC broke through the gate pre-race, pressed
outside of the leader and from the three path, vied between horses into midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole and lasted for
show. SACRED SAINT broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace inside of a prompting rival while a touch off of the inner rail, dug in to cling to an
advantage through upper stretch but was bested by outer rivals at the sixteenth pole and gave way. WITS AND WAGERS brushed with rivals on both sides
at the start, pursued two wide and between horses, exchanged shoulders with an inner rival approaching the far turn, chased among foes around that bend,
encountered traffic behind foes in upper stretch, got floated six wide while getting outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, then ran on late to miss
show. EAST SHORE stalked along the inside, got keen leaving the first turn, remained unsettled down the backstretch, exchanged shoulders with an outer
foe approaching the far turn, chased before attempting to take aim inside of the leader coming to midstretch, but lacked room in the final furlong, steadied
once stymied at the sixteenth pole and gave way. STERLING LUCK broke a beat slow, raced at the rear three wide, trailed under urging in the four path
around the far turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
AWESOME AARON took contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked from the two path while close up to the leading quartet around the turn, tipped to
the five path to take aim in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. NABOKOV vied two wide and between horses, sparred in the
three path among foes into the lane, inched briefly clear coming to the furlong grounds, but was collared by an outer bidder at the juncture and got bested in
the late stages. PRINCIP saved ground off of the pace, slipped through inside of foes to gain show at the three sixteenths pole, and chased the top pair
home to prove best of the rest. G T FIVE HUNDRED prompted four deep into and around the turn, but gave way entering the lane in the five path, yet kept
on mildly to regain a minor share. ZOOMBIE was antsy in the starting gate then broke slow, raced at the rear three wide, swung to the seven path into the
lane and failed to factor. FIT TO FLY bobbled a bit and brushed an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead inside of a trio of rivals, spun for home a path off
of the inside and weakened between horses in upper stretch. I GOT NO MUNNY laid off of the pace two wide, then faded between horses turning for home.
GLOBAL STAGE vied three wide and between horses, sustained the battle entering the lane in the four path, but faltered between horses reaching the
furlong grounds and was eased late.

Footnotes
PERFECT MAGIC veered inwardly, bumped and bothered a group of inner rivals at the start, vied two wide, drew clear in upper stretch and held sway.
TROUBLESHOOTING vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, got bested by that one in upper stretch, dug in to hold place in the final furlong, shook
free of an outer bidder in the final sixteenth then lasted from a late on-charging foe at the wire. KRAKEN broke slowly and steadied back to avoid more
trouble from outer rivals at the start, trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the five path into upper stretch, rallied with a good late kick outside of
rivals in the closing stages but missed place at the wire. ZAT'S THE ONE was bumped and bothered by outer rivals and forced to bump an inner foe at the
start, stalked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, shifted three wide to take aim between horses in upper stretch, vied for place
while chasing the clear leader in midstretch, but was turned away from place at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. SPICED UP prompted three deep into
and around the turn, chased floated four wide while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, delayed changing over until the sixteenth pole, but continued to
yield. RIDDLER was bumped by an outer rival and forced inwardly at the start, resented kickback behind rivals and dropped back approaching the turn,
raced off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. SAVING HEART was soundly bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe and got wiped out at the
start, lacked speed in the three path, swung out to the seven path into the lane and made little impact. GOLDEN GOAL chased from midpack in the three to
two path and tired.

Footnotes
ARTHUR stalked the embattled leading pair from the four path, took aim on the newly clear leader in upper stretch, ranged up to bid leaving the furlong
grounds and edged past. LEND IT TEWMEY dueled for the lead with an outer rival whlie remaining a path off of the inside around the turn, drew clear of
that one in upper stretch as a wider bidder loomed a danger, got collared by that one leaving the furlong grounds and was bested shortly after. TAP THE
CANDY pursued from midpack in the four path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and ran on willingly while hanging on his left lead. REWIRE
tracked along the inside saving ground around the turn, then chased along the rail through the lane without offering a bid. HASKELLED broke slowly, raced
off of the pace in the three to two path, altered out at the furlong grounds and failed to menace. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN dueled for the lead with an inner
rival while taking the turn in the three path, then faded in upper stretch. REDHILL trailed along the inside and improved position. EL MIC TIESUN lacked
speed in the three path and got outrun. MERLOTTI broke outwardly, pursued from the five to six path and tired.

Footnotes
BOOK'EM showed the way along the inside, then drew off in upper stretch and opened up under a drive. FLASH WEAR leaned out at the start, tracked
tucking to the inside into the turn, chased the clearing leader from the two path into the lane, gained place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds and was
second best. KEYANA was bumped by an outer rival and took back at the start, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, crept closer to pursue
within striking range nearing the lane, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch and gave way. DARK THIRTY broke a step slow, saved ground off
of the pace, then improved inside of rivals to reach fourth passing the furlong grounds. SPLIT SUCCESS hopped and spotted the rest multiple lengths at the
start, lacked speed along the inside while behind rivals around the turn, shifted to the three path to move between horses entering upper stretch, shifted out
to the five path and brushed a foe at the furlong grounds, then ran on mildly. HER HOLY NAME chased from midpack along the inside, then two wide
leaving the quarter pole and failed to menace. GLOBAL QUEEN laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out five to six wide in upper stretch and failed to factor.
TEGWAR pursued from midpack in the three path, chased in the four to five path in upper stretch, took contact from an inner rival at the furlong grounds and
yielded. VERY COSMOPOLITAN floated out and brushed an outer rival soon after the start, pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, faded
between horses with five sixteenths to go and weakened. BOUJI IS A WORD lacked speed in the five path, bore wide while trailing into the turn, recovered
back down to the two path turning for home and made little impact. LOCAL ELECTION bumped an inner rival before taking contact from another inner foe at
the start, pursued from midpack in the five path but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
FORGE IN FIRE vied three wide into the turn, drew off turning for home and held safely. CAT ON TIME trailed early on, advanced in the five to six path
around the turn, rallied to narrow the clear leader's margin in the final furlong but was second best. SAGITTARIUS bumped with an inner rival at the start,
tracked in the two path, shifted out while vying for place into the final furlong, but got outkicked shortly after. GOD OF WINE stalked in the four to three path,
chased in the four path in upper stretch, yielded place between bidders at the furlong grounds yet held fourth. MO RHODES leaned into an outer rival at the
start and was last away, raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted in and bumped a rival passing the three sixteenths pole, then failed to threaten.
PATCH O'BRIEN saved ground off of the pace, was bumped by an outer rival passing the three sixteenths pole and failed to factor. CRUSADING tracked in
the five to four path, then back to the five path in upper stretch before fading. MR MCGREGOR tugged to rush forward among foes and vie two wide and
between horses down the backstretch, proved no match for his outer counterpart turning for home then faltered between horses in midstretch. TWIRLING
TROILLET vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, but weakened nearing the three furlong pole and was done early.
