Footnotes
CHURCH KEY took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, drew off to a long lead leaving the half mile pole, raced in the five path on the far
turn then held on under steady stretch handling. TIMEISGOLDEN saved ground racing well back from early contention, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dueled for second mid-stretch and closed the gap on the winner later yards. BONNIE BLUETOOTH
raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then flattened stride mid-stretch. ABIDALE settled
off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little further. GOLD
TIME VIXEN saved ground well back on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and passed rivals in the three path on the far turn,
but showed little more. WOODSONG'S CASTLE raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SO RED THE
ROSE raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SHERIFF'S KID raced off the rail the first turn and never
