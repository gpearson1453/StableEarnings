caught late. GO LEE ANN GO veered in and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the

LEGALLY REDDY raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three
path and dueled to the wire to get up for the win. JOSH'S DRAMA saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far bend and dug in gamely in the lane to just miss. CROSS THE CAUSEWAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening half mile, began a bid while saving ground around the far turn and chased on in the stretch. GOT GHOSTED saved ground early, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished evenly. COWBOY CAUSE raced off
the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. MR. COUGAR
raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path and was empty in the lane.
DAVID'S FAITH raced in the three path around the first bend, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and
tired in the stretch.

BIG PRODUCER raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend
and held off a closer to the finish. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN saved ground early, trailed well behind the field racing up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path coming around the far bend and gained ground late. FURTHER EVIDENCE raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the two path and dueled in the lane to narrowly miss. PEARCY ROAD raced off the pace in the
three path through the opening half mile, came around the second turn still in the three path and made up some ground in the stretch while never truly
threatening. BRAGGADOCIOUS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path and showed no kick. SPEAKING LOUD raced in the two path early,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. GIPSY CHIEF (GB) saved
ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dropped back quickly headed into the far turn, tired and was eased across the wire.
