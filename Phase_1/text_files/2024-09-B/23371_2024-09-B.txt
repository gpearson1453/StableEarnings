Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION pulled to the lead with the rider taking firm hold, opened up a little more on the turn and came into the stretch with the rider still
confident, was set down at the three-sixteenths pole and had plenty in reserve to hold off A ROUSING BABE in the stretch. A ROUSING BABE was allowed
to settle, then advanced three wide on the turn, finished well but under steady handling but could not get to the winner while well clear of the next horse.
PRETTY THIRSTY hustled out of the gate and vied inside of three contesting the early lead, then was left alone to deal with MORNING ADDICTION after
passing the half-mile marker, came into the stretch and finished willingly under a stiff drive but was outfinished by the top pair. LADY'S SERMON broke best
but had to be ridden to keep up with the pace, dropped a few lengths back, was kept in a drive and did not have the needed response in the lane. SWIFT
NONNI broke well and vied for the lead for about a furlong, then dropped off the pace, remained close to the stretch then was out-kicked in the late stages.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR tracked the solid early pace from between rivals, was well placed into the turn and stalked PANDA PEAK two to three wide nearing
the quarter marker, made a quick move into the stretch, gained command at the furlong marker and drew away in the final sixteenth. PANDA PEAK broke
alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms heading to the half-mile, showed the way into the turn and carved out decent fractions nearing the
quarter marker, was overtaken by HOLLYWOOD RUMOR approaching the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and
was a clear second. I'M A RISQUE GIRL raced close up to the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and was shuffled back a bit nearing the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch, needed more in the final furlong and outfinished SAHARA SUE for third. SAHARA SUE tracked the
solid early pace three wide and between runners, gained ground nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, could not sustain her run into
the final furlong and just missed for third. SWEET LAYLA RAE unhurried in the early stages, was guided two wide into the turn and did not factor in the
stretch drive. TIA SUZI chased the solid early pace four deep heading to the half-mile marker, lost position into the turn, ran in pursuit three wide nearing the
quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
BROADWAY TIGER took a light bump from VELOCIOUS a few strides out of the gate, then exchanged light bumps again before the three furlong marker,
launched a rally three wide on the turn, ran down LUSMA while racing on the wrong lead to mid-stretch then drew off late as much the best in this one.
LUSMA broke sharply, showed good speed but was getting out down the backstretch, ended up in the three of four path, went three wide through the turn,
drifted wider into the stretch, responded when challenged by BROADWAY TIGER at the top of the lane, continued to lug out and proved no match in the
later stages while holding second. CLARINA hit the right side of the gate at the break and came out a little awkwardly, was still up close in the early stages
then had to check less than a furlong in when LUSMA took the path, lost some ground and moved to the inside, saved ground through the turn, launched a
mild bid from the three furlong marker then flattened out and finished evenly in the stretch. VELOCIOUS broke outward at the start, made light contact with
BROADWAY TIGER in the initial stages, pressed the pacesetter two wide then made contact with the same foe again two or three times at the start of the
turn, came under a ride near the five-sixteenths pole and was no threat in the later stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into
the turn and showed the way to the quarter pole, kept to task and dug in into upper stretch, held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, met the bid of THE
GREAT HAYNES in deep stretch and lasted at the finish for a determined win. THE GREAT HAYNES crowded an inner rival away from the start, raced
close up to the moderate early pace and tracked three deep nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground into the turn and stalked SUPERSONIC FLYER
three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was set down for the drive and chased SUPERSONIC FLYER into the final sixteenth, rallied in deep stretch and
just missed for the win at the finish, while holding for second. BOURBON GLAZE got squeezed at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered to track the
moderate early pace heading to the half-mile marker, was guided four to five nearing the quarter marker, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, finished
well in the final sixteenth and missed for the win and place, while getting up in time to secure show honors. A DIME FOR ME was shuffled back leaving the
start and was away slowly, allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch, was gaining in the late
stages but could not reel in the leaders. CANAM GAL raced close up to the moderate early pace, went two to three wide and between rivals along the turn,
chased SUPERSONIC FLYER into the stretch, could not muster a final response and weakened. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TOM'S TREASURE broke well, seized the lead right from the start, held all at bay through the turn and drew off as much the best. PARTHENA broke well
and pressed three wide to the turn, move into a clear second at the quarter pole, ran on willingly through the stretch under left handed urging but was no
match for the winner. MAX'S MAXINE tracked close up to turn, then lost ground as the top pair put distance on the rest of the field, came under a ride from
the three furlong marker, moved into the third position and finished evenly, with a distance back to the next one. DANCING NURSE was slow into stride,
tracked behind the field about three wide, was kept to task and able to pass a couple late but was otherwise never involved in the final outcome. AMMARA
lacked any early speed, raced near the back of the field, struggled to keep on on the turn, drifted three to four wide turning into the stretch and was not a
factor in the late stages. JEANNER chased TOM'S TREASURE from a length or two behind through the early stages, began to weaken near the quarter
pole and had little to offer down the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
KEEP MOVIN' ON settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from the inside along the backstretch
run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, tipped four wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, closed determinedly in the stretch, came
within aim of DOO WOP DON into the final sixteenth, wore down that game foe in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a gallant win. DOO WOP
DON settled away from the start, got caught four to five wide along the first turn, tracked the modest pace through the backstretch run, was well placed
approaching the second turn and loomed three to two wide nearing the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and led to the furlong marker, kept to
task and dug in into the final sixteenth, battled gamely into deep stretch and was nailed for the win at the finish, while besting the rest. WE CAN forwardly
placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three to four wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run, made an outside move and
vied for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, battled into the second turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, overtaken by DOO WOP DON into
upper stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch drive and was well clear of the rest for third. NIGHT PROOF broke alertly, vied for the early lead
then ceded the front to ROARING TIGER, stalked the pace two to three wide and between runners into the first turn, attended to the pace between rivals
into the backstretch run, lost position approaching the second turn, chased to the quarter marker and faded in the stretch drive. NOLDE a step slow away
from the start, settled two to three wide into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the far turn and could not muster
a response in the stretch drive. ROARING TIGER hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early going and assumed command into the first turn,
set moderate fractions into the backstretch run, set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile, battled inside of WE CAN into the far turn and lost the lead
nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BREVE was allowed to settle from the start then content to track the pace from the back of the tightly bunched field, responded when cued to go on
approaching the seven-sixteenths marker, moved into contention three wide through the far turn, slipped inside of stablemate SUNGLASSES (GB) at the
head of the stretch and finished strong under steady handling to win clear. SUNGLASSES (GB) broke a beat slow then was pushed to get to the lead, won
the race to the first turn then was put in under stout restraint, fought the rider a bit passing the thirteen-sixteenths pole, was left alone to dictate the pace, led
the field to the far turn still under wraps, was let loose on the far turn held the lead through the turn then floated out about three wide into the stretch, began
to shorten strides before the furlong pole but stayed on and just held the place. MASTERY KAT broke alertly, was allowed to settle into stride but got caught
three wide on the first turn, tracked close while three wide in the compact field down the backstretch, quickened on cue passing the seven-sixteenths pole,
advanced into contention three wide on the far turn the four wide into the stretch, had some trouble changing leads at the head of the stretch ran on, just
missing second while clear of the rest. POKER ALICE showed good speed from the break without being prompted, stalked the pacesetter two wide to the
half-mile marker, was under pressure to step up the pace but lacked a response and was not a factor in the late stages. LADY GOOD TROUBLE was
roused from the break to get forward position then tracked close up while saving ground along the rail, began to struggle to keep up with the pace before the
three furlong pole, dropped to last and had little to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ'S HARBOR broke alertly, ceded the early lead to GARRY JOHN, stalked outside of that runner heading to the half-mile marker, attended to the pace
three wide into the turn, chased GARRY JOHN into the stretch, made contact twice with that rival inside of the sixteenth-marker, took command in deep
stretch, edged away in the late stages to prove best. GARRY JOHN showed good early speed, assumed command away from the start, set a decent pace
heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn while off of the rail, led into the stretch, made contact twice with TIZ'S HARBOR into the final
sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch, was a clear second. SWIFT STEPHAN a step slow away from the start, rushed up in the
early stages, was forwardly placed heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide along the turn, was well placed at the quarter pole, could not find the
needed response in the stretch drive, held for third at the finish. SOUTHERN TORNADO settled off of the decent early pace while never far back, ran in
pursuit four to five wide approaching the quarter marker, finished evenly in the stretch drive, just missed for third. ACCIDENTAL GENIUS allowed to settle,
raced outside of rivals into the turn, went three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, showed good late interest but
could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. MAGILLIGAN forwardly placed away from the start, lost position nearing the half-mile marker, was guided two
wide into the turn, could not muster a late response. SALTYBISCUIT was void of early speed, trailed into the turn, did not threaten in the stretch drive. EL
DIAMANTE NEGRO raced close up to the decent early pace, chased three to four wide along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch, dropped back.
NO ORDINARY TIGER chased the decent early pace from between rivals, saved ground into the turn, lost position at the quarter pole, tired in the stretch
drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
