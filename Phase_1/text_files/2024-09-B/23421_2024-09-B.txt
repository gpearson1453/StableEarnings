Footnotes
BENEVOLENCE set a pressured early pace near the inside down the backstretch, kicked clear into the upper stretch and widened its margin while being
kept to task. AIRFORCE LIGHTNING settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and rallied for the place position. REIGN
CHAMPAGNE slight bump at the break, forced six wide around the first turn, raced three wide around the far turn under strong urging and weakened a bit
through the drive. BISA sent from the outside, raced four wide into the first turn, raced off the early pace setters, advanced from the inside nearing the
quarter pole and flattened out. LADY RILEY bumped at the start, raced four wide around the first turn, raced mid pack down the backstretch and tired while
unable to sustain a bid. CITY COCKTAILS prompt the three deep from the outside of Benevolence and stopped. MERCY OTIS bumped start, forwardly
placed to stalk the top pair and was done early.

DECK OF CARDS showed good early foot to control the early pace, dueled through the far turn, headed nearing the eighth pole, dug in and prevailed in a
determined run all out pressure. PUNCHY GIRL prompt the early leader from the outside two deep, dueled with Deck of Cards through the far turn, led
nearing the eighth pole and missed in a game effort. PENS STREET was off slow, raced off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch, slowly
closed in on the top pair and finished willingly to the wire. CHIQUITA MOSCA lag early on to trail, hard ridden through the far turn, raced five wide near the
three sixteenths pole and closed in mildly to improve position. WINDY BAY tracked the top pair from the inside and weakened through the drive. BIG DIG
settled off the early going and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SARANAC LAKE set his own uncontested early pace, roused briefly inside the three sixteenths pole and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride.
NO SHOW raced six deep around the first turn, settled near the back early on, ridden three wide around the far turn and moved up but was no match for the
winner. BENET tracked the early leader three deep and kept on to secure the show placing. TIZ SALTY raced five wide around the first turn, unhurried early
on, ridden along from the inside past the five sixteenths pole and moved up mildly to improve position. TWO LUCYS settled off the early going, raced four
wide around the far turn and was even with no closing run. ELODINE raced mid pack in the early stages, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch and
never threatened. DAME MAUDE CHARDIN raced in tight between horses soon after the break, stalked the pace between rivals early to race close up and
faded to race far back. GATHER THE FACTS was up close early racing from the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
CONNIVE was off a bit slow, rushed up from the outside two deep to prompt Queen Clancy from the outside, cleared off near the three sixteenths pole and
widened its lead under steady pressure. QUEEN CLANCY set a pressured pace along the inside, held the place position through the drive but was no
match for the winner. DIA ESTELAR (ARG) tracked the early pair racing in hand, saved ground nearing the quarter pole, angled out four to five wide and
flattened out in the drive. AVALON GIRL was off slowly, raced near the back early on, hard ridden into the far turn, was six deep into the upper stretch,
shifted in through the drive and never was a serious threat. YO LEVEN stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
PIPELINE sped to the lead strides out of the gate and crossed over to the inside around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around
the final turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, dug in under firm handling in the final furlong, turned back the bid from BENDOG and finished clear.
BENDOOG was forwardly placed around the first turn and continued just off the leader through the backstretch, hustled along trying to reach PIPELINE
around the final turn, sustained bid into stretch run, dug in under left handed pressure, raced in close range out then flattened off of eventual winner and
held place. GUNOE was allowed to settle in the early going then began to pick up the pace late on the backstretch, came four wide into upper stretch,
steadily edged up closer on the second place finisher and cleared the rest. HAYES STRIKE was reserved and raced in then back through early stages,
saved ground around the final turn, angled out two to three wide upper stretch, gained position then angled back to the inside and improved without
threatening the top trio. OSCAR ECLIPSE raced in range two paths wide around the first turn then flattened and lost position in the backstretch, hustled
along three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SALUTE THE STARS was forwardly placed around the first turn, tracked the top pair through the
backstretch, hustled along three wide in contention around the final turn then faded in the lane. MIDNIGHT WEST settled off the early pace, saved ground
and came under a ride into stretch, failed to respond and retreated.

Footnotes
MISS PEABODY held a slim lead in opening stages and continued to set a pressured pace around the turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch, came
under left handed pressure, came out a couple paths, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away. THE BIG CALHOUNA was a bit keen wanting to do more
while being rated in early stages, tracked three wide around the turn, given cue four wide at the head of the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but
edged up closer and nipped foe to take place. HOUSE OF MAGIC was allowed to settle off the early pace, picked up the tempo mid-way around the turn,
swung six paths wide into upper stretch, finished with good response and got nipped for place. SISTER ELLA raced up close in opening stages between
foes then edged back entering the turn, launched a two wide bid entering upper stretch, tipped three wide, ran on and got nipped for show. SHE'S
SPLENDID saved ground tracking just off mid-pack around the turn, angled out and hustled along three then two wide, showed interest but needed more for
impact. END OF INNOCENCE raced in range in the opening quarter, continued in contention around the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and gave
way. THREE POLKS pressed the pace in opening stages, continued up close around the turn, ran on two wide into the stretch run then came up empty late.
GOLDBLOODED raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. CALL ME PENNY briefly gained closer contention around the turn then gave way.
