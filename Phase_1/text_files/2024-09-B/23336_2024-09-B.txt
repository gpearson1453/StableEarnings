WEST OF ME vied four across to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and widened while ridden out. KARAOKE HERO vied three wide between horses to the
turn, fell back, was no match for the winner and clearly best of the rest. ROADSWITCHER was never far back, offered a mild bid near the inside and was
along for show while no threat to the top two. MOONSHINE MISCHIEF vied inside, fell back entering the turn and had no further response. CLEVER IT vied
between horses and stopped into the turn. GOLDEN GATO settled off the pace, raced outside and lacked a stretch response. GONE GREY was rank, fell
far back and trailed.

BODIE GOT GOLD bumped at the start, was never far back, raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up
in the final strides. MILK IT bumped at the start, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew away for a clear lead, led to the final strides, was outclosed and just
lasted for place. LET HIM BE raced close to the pace along the inside, closed steadily, was in traffic late, surged between horses and got up near the wire
for show. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire and lost positon late. HENRY ON THE RUN lagged
early, raced outside, went widest in the drive and finished well. I THINK I'M HERE lagged early, raced inside, put in a steady effort and failed to menace.
DELBERT TOO trailed the field, saved ground and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PROBATE vied between horses, drew clear on the turn, was under pressure late and held under steady urging. I'MAGAMBLER vied three across, fell back
on the turn, came again to narrow the gap and didn't have enough late. EFFORT N RESULTS raced close to the pace, closed inside, hung late and settled
for show. DADDY WHAT IF was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and finished well. WHERES BRAYDEN was crowded at the start, raced close
to the pace, failed to rally and did not threaten. SPINNING BLACK vied inside, dropped back into the turn and stopped. SUNSCREEN was outrun in an even
effort.
