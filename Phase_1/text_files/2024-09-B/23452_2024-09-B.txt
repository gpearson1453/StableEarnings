Footnotes
GUINEVERE sent easily to the front, well rated to far turn, dug in, cleared. ROSARIO'S PRAYER no speed from down inside to far turn angled out, grinded
on late. STARLIGHT LOVE never far back outside to far turn, kept on stretch, weakened for third spot. MINT DRIVEN raced back to far turn, shifted widest
into stretch to improve under stout handling to the wire. VEGAS LOVE good position from inside early, angled out stretch no kick. UMEBOSHI raced along
evenly with no response when needed from far turn. STAY FAITHFUL had a staggered start from the gate, rushed outside while pressing the winner to the
half with nothing left and faltered from inside. MOLLY'S ROSE had a tardy start could not keep up throughout while wide throughout. PEACOCK ROAD
inside run first turn while in tight and checked back hard with no chance thereafter.
