Footnotes
HYPER ANGEL had a good spot, watching the contesting pair at the five-furlong pole, began to move in sharply when nudged at the three eighths marker,
pounced three wide straightening out for the stretch run, battled outside up front down the lane and edged clear in the last seventy yards. SECRET SOUL
broke inwards on the start, travelled three deep close to the back in the early stages, began to lengthen stride going around horses at the half, angled out to
be four wide for the drive, found another gear when encouraged left-handed with an eighth to run and closed in smartly to capture the runners up share right
on the finish line. HERETHEREVERYWHERE prompted the pace outside in the beginning, edged away for the lead by the half, was collared outside by the
winner at the top of the stretch dueled stubbornly until the sixteenth pole and gave way late to just get caught for the place share at the wire. DANCING IN
RIO was nestled on the rail, watching the front trio down the back straight, continued to settle on the fence in the third flight around the bend, had to wait
behind a tiring foe when turning for home, angled to the rail with three sixteenths to run and finished with good energy late for a minor share. NO VISOR had
position on the fence close to the rear in the early going, saved ground while trailing throughout the turn, angled out four wide in the lane and finished up
mildly between horses in the final sixteenth of a mile. NO MALARKEY settled near the back of the pack down the back straight, made no headway on the
fence around the turn, shifted out to the six path by the quarter pole and passed a couple of weary runners in mid-stretch. SINFUL FORESTER travelled in
midfield outside a rival, took closer order through the turn to be in the thick of things four wide in upper stretch but had nothing more to offer in the final
furlong. PICKFORD SWEET settled close to the back in the two path between horses, made no progression around the bend and could not get involved,
running seven wide down the lane. CAN'T BUY CLASS was pinched on the break to trail down the backside, rallied smartly three wide around foes at the
half to be in range of the leaders in the five path straightening out for the drive, could not sustain the run and stalled in the seven path by the furlong marker.
STORMY RALEIGH was under a snug hold on the lead down the back straight, had a chasing role on the rail throughout the turn and retreated quickly in
the two path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MRS. C rated kindly in hand with runners on both sides travelling in mid-pack in the early stages, moved in smartly four wide at the top of the lane and
finished up the best, to be going away for the win in deep stretch. QUEST TO BE PROUD broke in on the start, loped along four deep near the rear in the
backstretch, circled four wide around foes at the quarter pole, was full of run in the six path in the stretch drive and got up just at the line to nail second
money. BLUE SPIRIT pressed the pace inside in the beginning, battled on the fence, head-to-head for the lead in the turn, gamely fought back on the fence
down the stretch and just missed saving the runners up share at the wire. DUVAL STREET was ahead of only the troubled starter down the backstretch,
improved to sit just behind the lead duo on the rail at the half, waited for running room inside around the bend and closed in late three wide between foes but
was on the losing end of a three-way photo for the place share. ROYAL RIBBON broke out, then was bumped on the start, travelled three deep, watching
the engaged pair down the back straight, tracked three wide outside foes on the turn, was in range in the five-path turning for home but lacked a finishing bid
in the lane. MARDENE had slim lead on the outside when entering the backside, dueled up top outside throughout the turn, was clinging onto the lead in the
four path between rivals in upper stretch but faltered with a furlong left to run. ALL FOR HONOR was away poorly to spot the field many lengths along the
backstretch, could not close the gap around the bend and did not factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
MASTER SPY had a slim lead on the outside at the start, cleared to the rail for the lead by the half, improved the margin up front through the turn moving
well, opened up to a commanding lead in upper stretch and coasted home for the dominant win. COMMANDER JOE settled near the rear between foes in
the early going, kept pace while two wide outside a rival on the turn, shifted out four wide by the quarter pole, reaching for more ground, was full of run in the
five path turning for home and closed in strongly to best the rest at the finish line behind the going away winner. YORKVILLE was situated close to the back
of the pack three deep down the back straight, rallied smartly outside, three wide with three furlongs remaining, angled out in the four path with a chance for
a piece of the prize straightening out for home and fought on stubbornly outside to win the three way photo for the show money. SUNSPEAR broke out on
the start, travelled with runners on both sides in mid-division in the early stages of the race, dueled for the show award four wide between foes down the
stretch but settled on the fringes in the end. FASCINATION STREET was hard held, vying between runners up front at the start, had a tracking role inside at
the half, settled on the fence in the third flight through the turn, battled for the show award in the three path in the stretch but lost that position by a nod at
the finish line. CANTUCCI was in the mix up top on the rail in the beginning, was shuffled back under a snug hold at the half, could not improve when only
ahead of one rival around the bend and could not get involved in the drive to the wire. LUCYS CHILD veered in at the start to trail in the backstretch, lost
ground while still seeing the field in the turn and found a little interest in the stretch to pass weakening runners down the lane. TOWN'S WARRIOR tracked
outside in the beginning, chased in vain through the turn and in upper stretch, hold no more to offer by the furlong marker and stopped abruptly in the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
PRINCESS OF STORM got away well but was allowed to settle off the leaders, raced off the inside into and on the turn, swung six wide turning into upper
stretch with aim and momentum, drifted out late under left-handed urging while striking the lead near the sixteenth pole and inching away late. MOST
LIKELY pressed the pace in hand, edged closer and forced the issue from the nine-sixteenths early on the turn, took charge about the five-sixteenths and
kicked clear past the quarter pole, was outfinished but second best. YLIVOIMAINEN settled inside off the leaders, moved out four to five wide past the
three-eighths, drifted about in the stretch placing another rival in tight quarters late. DOADSTER set a pressured pace inside, dueled through the turn,
weakened in the stretch. MOHAYMEN DIAMOND lacked early speed, shifted in and saved ground on the turn, improved. AWE INSPIRED stalked from
outside mostly three to four wide, steadied sharply in late stretch lacking room. EMPOWER was ridden along by the half racing off the inside and off the
leaders, was not a factor. DOUBLE RIDE was in just a bit tight early but gained forward position tracking inside, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AWE INSPIRED AGAINST YLIVOIMAINEN ALLEGING INTERFERNECE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD NAD PLACED SIXTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
TAVALINE was patiently reined back to have a tracking role just outside the frontrunner down the back straight, starred to move in closer at the three
eighths marker, bid for the lead, posing the main threat in the three path at the top of the lane and pulled away with ease in the final furlong for the win.
CLASSY IMAGE was near the rear, nested on the rail at the half mile marker, was nudged and started to go past rivals outside midway on the turn, burst
between rivals six wide turning for home extending her stride nicely and closed in strongly to be second best at the finish line. SILVER BULLET LADY
tracked between horses down the backside, was roused on the fence at the three eighths marker but could not go with the top two around the bend, angled
out four wide for the stretch drive, kept trying to the wire to be in second for a moment in deep stretch but had to settle for third money in the end when
caught at the wire. MAXIMUM FIFTY broke sharp for the lead at the start, cleared to the rail up top by the half, rolled along setting the pace throughout the
turn, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch, fought on for a furlong inside but then faded on the fence in the final seventy yards to settle on the
fringes. NOVEL was trailing between horses at the half mile marker, improved with runners on both sides to be in midfield around the turn, shifted out to the
four path for the stretch run but lacked a rally in the drive to the wire. I'M A BOURBON GIRL tracked on the rail down the backstretch, was steadied sharply
on the fence going into the turn, made no headway on the turn to be in last by the quarter pole and could only pass a tired one in the stretch.
MINEDANDREFINED broke inwards and was checked on the start to trail in the beginning, made an early move going three wide, advancing around foes at
the seven sixteenths pole, closed the gap three wide circling around the bend, was fanned plus drifted out to be nine wide at the top of the lane and came
up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
WEEHAWKEN settled off the leading pair stalking from off the inside, fanned out five wide turning into upper stretch, bid a furlong out and drove clear.
WICKED MERCURY was well-placed in behind the leaders not too far off, moved out from inside about the three-eighths, was six wide into upper stretch,
kept on for place but was not a threat to the winner. BOLT ENOREE settled off the inside and mid-pack racing mostly in the three to four path through the
turn and stretch, rallied inside foes in mid-stretch but needed more late and was outfinished for second. VEERY pressed the pace from outside three to four
wide, led about the five-sixteenths till mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick. AWASEF chased from outside the second flight racing three to four wide,
swung six wide into upper stretch, drifted out then in, ran on. MY SUNNY VALENTINE settled into stride well back early, swung out turning for home then
angled out further to be seven deep in upper stretch, finished well to be gaining late outside but was not enough. VERI GIZMO was outpaced early racing
toward the back off the inside, shifted in nearer the rail in the stretch and improved position. GREAVETTE set the pace from off the rail shadowed by an
outside foe, was well-back of the new leaders by mid-stretch wrapped up through the final sixteenth. SHE MAKES A POINT broke outwardly and steadied
just slightly, was outpaced lacking early speed and never near enough to threaten. ROYAL BLUSH swung eight wide into upper stretch and failed to rally.
ANTENNA raced toward the back off the inside, was not a factor.

Footnotes
NEVER SILENT had a slim lead while pressured inside by a rival down the backside, continued to have a head in front outside travelling smoothly around
the turn, spurted away when just only coaxed for more in upper stretch and was kept to the task to win comfortably at the wire. SECRET LOAD co-trailed on
the inside at the half, kept pace with rivals while on the inside, taking the shortest way around the bend, angled out three wide for the drive, shifted back in
finding a rail path in mid-stretch and rallied up the fence to get up for the place share. MAGICAL TRICK co-trailed on the outside with a half mile left to run,
rallied three wide, going around horses midway on the turn, angled out five wide for the drive to the wire and was gaining gradually in the lane to capture
third money in the end. MIRAMICHI forced the issue on the rail from the onset, battled inside up front throughout the turn, could not match strides with the
winner when they turned for home and faded in the two path between horses at the sixteenth pole for a minor role. PRIMA was in the middle of the pack
between runners down the backstretch, closed the gap on the embattled leaders with five sixteenths to go, shifted out to the four-path dueling for a share of
the prize but yielded between rivals in the final sixteenth of a mile. ANITA MARGARITA was three deep on the outside in the middle of the pack in the early
going, took closer order to track two wide outside a runner around the bend, angled out four wide turning for home but made little presence running down
the lane. FAITHFUL CREEK travelled on the rail in midfield with four furlongs remaining, was roused but was backing away on the fence through the turn
and failed to menace in the stretch running.

BAIL US OUT was outside a rival in mid- division into the first turn, galloped along, finding his stride to be between runners in the trailing trio down the
backstretch, was ready to run but was on hold in the two path behind tired foes at the quarter pole, shifted out finding a seam five wide in the drive to have a
full head of steam in upper stretch and exploded past many rivals at the furlong marker to get up for the win late. MCAVOY settled on the rail in midfield in
the beginning, advanced smartly on the fence down the backstretch, was on hold, sitting on the rail waiting for the cue in the far turn, burst up the inside
skimming the fence turning for home, took control poking his head in front with a sixteenth to go but was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. FRIENDLY
GHOST had a good position, watching the engaged duo into the first turn, was nudged along to keep up at the half mile behind the lead pair, moved in
closer three wide by the quarter pole to be in the mix up top turning for home and finished up evenly in the stretch to stay on for the show award. EXUDE
co-trailed on the inside going into the first turn, narrowed the margin on the contesting leaders down the backstretch, shifted out four wide at the top of the
stretch and picked up the dueling early leaders who were empty late to get up for a minor share in the end. RUNAWAY CHARLIE dueled right from the start
on the rail, kept fighting up front on the fence down the back straight, never wavered inside still fighting on the lead inside around the final turn and ran out of
steam in the two path with a sixteenth left to run. CAUSIN' MAYHEM battled outside with a fellow rival outside in the early stages of the race, continued to
throw it down around the far turn, had no more to offer by mid-stretch in the three-path between horses and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile.
LUCKY ROMANCE co-trailed on the outside in the first bend, was relegated to last by the half mile marker in the backstretch, saved ground around the final
turn but could not get involved on the fence when straightening out, running to the wire. AMERICAN DECISION was off a step slow on the break, tracked
outside in the first turn, stalked outside in the third flight outside foes down the backside, was hard ridden three wide at the three-furlong pole but was going
the wrong way around the far turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LAC MACAZA had an ideal trip when all alone, watching from a distance the front duo dueling up front quickly down the backstretch, began to reel in the
embattled pair at the half, went right on by with ease three wide turning for home and was kept to the task to hold off all challengers down the stretch.
STANLEY HOUSE was on the outside in the middle of the pack in the early going, had a good turn of foot, following the eventual winner through the final
turn, angled out six wide chasing the winner down the entire stretch, drifted out late under left-handed encouragement clinging to the place share but did
save second money at the finish line. PALAZZI was allowed to settle into stride near the rear into the backstretch, galloped along in a good rhythm while in
last with five eighths to go, still could see the field but was gathering momentum at the quarter pole, angled out widest in the eight path for clear running
room at the top of the stretch, closed in smartly outside runners late but was checked nearing the wire to just miss getting up for the place share. SPINZAR
broke out and was off slow to trail at the start, was eager while in last entering the backstretch, began to pass runners with five furlongs to go, continued to
rally three wide closing the gap outside around the far turn, angled out seven wide straightening for the drive to be in range for a piece of the prize, shifted in
a few paths at the eight pole driving to the line and finished up evenly late for a minor share. DANCIN IN DA'NILE was unhurried to be ahead of a couple of
runners down the backside, made little impact in the two path through the far turn, closed the gap at the top of the lane looking for a seam while in the six
path behind runners in upper stretch, shifted inwards to be three wide at the furlong marker, battling in the mix for a small share between rivals but needed
more late to be a threat at the wire. EYES ON THE KING had the lead getting to the rail in the beginning, was pressed outside down the backstretch,
continued to have a slim advantage while still being hounded by the outside foe around the far turn, could not find more turning for home and tired in the two
path at the furlong marker. COLLECTIVE FORCE travelled inside runners in mid-division along the backside, was urged on the fence but could not quicken
with others making a move around the final bend and lacked a stretch rally three wide down the lane. STONE AGE (IRE) was hard used battling for the lead
outside down the backstretch and throughout the far turn, angled out in the four path for the drive to the line, had nothing left to give and was engulfed by
runners by mid-stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #12 PALAZZI AGAINST #6 STANLEY HOUSE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS

Footnotes
MY CASH FACTOR stalked in the third flight inside a rival down the backstretch, was roused four wide midturn, went eight wide when forced out at the top
of the stretch, found her best stride late and closed in strongly in the last eighth to get up for the win in the final few jumps. FANNY M dueled inside for the
lead down the backstretch. continued to set the pace while shadowed outside throughout the turn, put away the early speed foe to open up with a furlong
from home but could not fend off the surging winner in the final seventy yards. WEGOTTATALK battled outside up front in the early stages, had no more to
offer up top in the two path with a furlong remaining, began to get leg weary late but did hang on to save the show award at the wire. PROUD MISCHIEF
had a slow start to begin, settled near the rear ahead of only the other poor starter down the back straight, closed the gap three wide by the quarter pole,
rallied on the fence with a furlong to go and just missed getting up for third at the wire. ROSE OF SHARON travelled outside foes in midfield in the backside,
made a mild run four wide moving closer at the three-furlong pole to sit just behind the dueling pair three wide outside foes with two furlongs to go, was
pushed out as well in the seven-path entering the stretch and could only finish up evenly down the lane. HELANA broke out on the start, tracked the top two
down the backstretch, kept pace while between runners in the second tier around the bend, was pushed out six wide by an insider rival at the top of the
stretch and then faded with runners on both sides when checked losing her path in deep stretch. CLOSING APPEAL was away slowly to trail down the
backstretch, caught up to the field three wide outside at the quarter pole, swung out while being floated eleven wide for the stretch running and could not
recover to factor in the stretch running outside. SCARY BOO settled near the rear outside down the backstretch, progressed smartly on the rail through the
turn to track the front two by the quarter pole, angled out sharply four wide causing a chain reaction of outside runners being pushed out turning for home,
dueled for third money in the lane but flattened out between runners at the furlong marker.
