SANDRINHA LOVE settled nicely from the gate, just off leaders to the turn, ran on into stretch outside and cleared off to the wire and held sway under
steady urging. DELANEY'S GRACE bit tardy from the gate, unhurried to the turn, ran on into stretch in mild traffic for the place spot. HULAH JAY off rail trip
throughout, out gamed for the place spot wrong lead. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS dueled between horses to the turn, could not keep up in stretch. LITURGIA
no speed throughput and never factored. ZERO CLICK brief inside speed, gave way readily into the turn and stretch. WICKED HEART through early from
inside and dropped far back.

J W RUCKUS rated off leaders to the turn, ran on to grind along and get up at the wire under good handling. TOPPING reared badly from gate, lost best
chance, rallied along and came on for place spot while probably best today. D'MONEY HONEY speed between horses battled to deep stretch even terms
for third. BEACH FRONT broke sharp outside just off leaders outside even terms for third. JAHEZ lagged back to the turn with a mild outside gain in the
stretch. FRISCO LINE no speed to the stretch, closed gap mildly to the wire. GREENSFELDER saved ground to no avail throughout. MOONLIGHT JOKER
slow into stride from inside rushed up, blocked into turn no gain.
