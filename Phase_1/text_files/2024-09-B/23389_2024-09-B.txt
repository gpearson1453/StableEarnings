GAL stalked the winner early, made a bid inside on the second turn then was outfinished while besting the others. INTRUSIVE was outsprinted early but
saved ground to the backstretch, moved up to briefly challenge for the lead but was outkicked by the winner on the second turn and weakened.
SUMTHINTOTALKABOUT was four wide to the backstretch, settled in the two path but lacked a closing response. ZEPHYR CAT tracked the pace early,
dropped back nearing the second turn and tired.

HAKUNUI had the best speed, set the pace, was challenged on the second turn, gamely dug in late and held by a nostril. SOCAL RED was three wide,
pushed along to the second turn to join the winner three wide, dueled that one in the drive and just missed. BEDROCK stalked the pace early, bid leaving
the quarter pole, dueled two wide and between rivals to the stretch then was outfinished to the line. HADLEES HONOR was chasing the pace to the quarter
pole, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE had no speed and was never a threat.

the pace to the quarter pole, bid three wide then eased to the rail into the stretch, could not impact the winner but was along for second. TRIBUNAL LOVE
stalked the pace for three furlongs, bid three wide on the far turn then lacked a late response, finished evenly and gave up second. DIVERSIFUL trailed to
the quarter pole, was three wide on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. RAY OF THE SEA had no speed and was never a threat. AUTISM
WARRIOR chased the pace from the rail for three furlongs then weakened.

DISTINCTIVE DEB went right to the front, set all the pace, kicked away and held driving. TEASPOON OF PEPPER pressed the winner throughout while
two wide then was the best of the rest. CLIPPERVILE GIRL got outsprinted, saved ground but could not threaten the top two. TEN THE SMART WAY was
awkward to start, recovered but was packed out four wide to the backstretch, eased in and saved ground to the stretch but did not threaten. MO
SUGAFOOT chased the pace to the second turn then was three wide and finished evenly. VISION OF THE KAT had no speed and was never a factor.
NOMI LACKEE was always outrun.

DERBY BOY was on the pace from the outset, pushed away then responded when set down and held on late. PRIME TIME PORTA chased the pace, was
rallying two wide to the stretch then continued to respond but was too late. LORD OF LIGHT had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then bested the
others. TAVERNELLE had no speed, came three wide on the second turn but lacked a late bid. CHINOOK BEND bumped REAL THIRSTY at the start,
tracked for three furlongs then weakened. LONGFORD saved ground to no avail. REAL THIRSTY broke slow then was bumped by CHINOOK BEND,
trailed to the second turn and was never a threat. PUTDADDYINACADDY was carried out five wide by CHANCELLORS BOOM to the backstretch, was
three wide to the stretch and came up empty. CHANCELLORS BOOM had brief speed then lugged out on the first turn and gave way.

LUKA GRAZIE got outsprinted early then settled for a half mile, bid two wide on the final bend but could not get to CONNECTER late. ANTICIPATED had
no speed, saved ground on the final two bends but lacked the needed late response. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was also well placed outside the winner for
three furlongs, was fanned four wide to the backstretch the second time then got oukicked to the stretch and did not rally. CORAZON DE LUCIA had no
speed, was three or four wide throughout and came up empty. SIMONSITO had good speed, dueled outside the runnerup for a half mile then tired.
