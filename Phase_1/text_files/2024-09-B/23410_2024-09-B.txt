closed under strong urging, got a head in front near the eighth pole and held off the late charge of I GET STORMED to be all out at the wire. I GET

outclosed and held for show. WHY FOR vied to late stretch and yielded grudgingly. WILEO PROCEED saved ground , closed willingly, was in range and
hung late. STORMY DAME was never far back, raced near the inside and lacked a late response. STAY BY THE BEACH pressed the pace to the turn and
