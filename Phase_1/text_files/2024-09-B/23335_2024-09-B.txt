Footnotes
LEGAL ATTACK (GB) was part of the mix up front going four deep on the outside down the backstretch, picked up the bit when roused with three furlongs
out to seize command by the five sixteenths marker, battled outside with the relentless inside foe down the lane and just prevailed at the wire. SOUPER
RUSH vied three wide between runners for the lead down the backside, was roused on the rail bidding for the lead inside midpoint on the turn, fought on
stubbornly inside, bobbing heads for the lead to the wire but was denied by a slim margin at the finish line. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE was hustled early on for
position down the backside, had a good spot sitting just behind the embattled foursome at the half, was roused with five sixteenths to go outside keeping
pace with the front duo, chased the leaders home making some gain in the lane and did finish up determinedly to be a clear third in the end. HE'S FULLY
LOADED stalked near the rear in the beginning, started to reach for more ground midturn, swung out widest in the seven-path gathering more speed
straightening out for the drive and closed in well, never switching leads down the stretch to settle on the fringes. HARDWARE GAP was unhurried to trail in
the early stages of the race, swung out six wide at the top of the lane still in last and closed in smartly to pass a few rivals in deep stretch. BANKER'S
HOURS had a slim lead on the rail down the backside, was shuffled back on the fence with three furlongs to go, shifted out to the four path for the drive,
dueled briefly for the minor share in the lane but levelled off in deep stretch. THE PREDICAMENT pressed the issue in the two-path with three other rivals
up front down the back straight, could not quicken with the top two finishers who separated themselves midway on the turn and had nothing left to offer
when flattening out two wide in mid-stretch. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN travelled in midfield along the backside, made a brief run three wide around foes at the
three eighths marker taking closer order around the bend, could not sustain the rally turning for home and folded five wide between runners in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TWO GHOSTS was quite content to be all alone watching the pacesetter in the early parts of the race, was forced to move in two wide keeping forward
position at the three eighths marker, edged closer on the outside throughout the turn, bid for the lead outside with an eighth remaining and inched away for
the score in the final seventy yards. HEMLO GOLD loped along on the lead into the first turn, increased the advantage up top by mid-backstretch, continued
to move well setting pace around the far bend, was headed outside by the winner at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards.
SECRET THREAT could see the field while just off the fence in the first turn, co-trailed inside down the backstretch, started to mount a rally, splitting foes
with three furlongs from home, shifted out four wide for the stretch run, was gaining on the top pair late but could not get there in time and settled for a clear
third in the end. PAT'S GAMBLE tracked the top two on the rail, moved in sharply on the fence three furlongs out, was repelled but the front duo around the
far turn and was one paced in the two path running evenly down the lane to settle on the fringes. COOLER MAN settled near the rear on the outside to
begin, took closer order while running four deep outside rivals down the back straight, made a brief run when circling around horses three wide midway on
the final turn, angled out five wide to be in range at the top of the lane and could only finish up gradually to pose no threat at the wire. UPTOWN LIGHTS
travelled on the rail inside a foe in the third tier in the early stages of the race, was roused midway on the far turn, offered little response to be in last with a
quarter mile to run and failed to fire on the fence in the stretch running. BODE'S TIPSY bobbled on the start, stalked on the outside in the third flight into the
first turn, closed the gap along the backstretch, was scrubbed on with three furlongs left to run making little impact on the final bend and lacked a rally in the
stretch but was not beaten all that much in the end.

NORTH WARDEN assumed command, clearing from the outside to set the soft pace on the rail into the first turn, continued to gallop along up front going
slowly down the backstretch, was let out a notch when nudged holding onto the lead with an outside rival closing in under a drive though the far turn trying to
get in front, opened up mildly when roused turning for home and was kept to the task to have just enough left late to hold safe at the finish line.
PATROLMAN sat all alone in midfield in the early stages, waited to move in the third flight on the rail with five sixteenths remaining, skimmed the fence at
the top of the stretch and had a good rail rally down the lane but just did not have enough late to get to the frontrunning winner at the wire. MY MUNNINGS
MODEL was nestled on the rail, sitting behind the pacesetter, continued to watch the frontrunners heels down the backside, shifted out four wide to pose a
threat turning for home, won the duel for the show award but was not match for the top two in deep stretch. PET SOUNDS had a tracking role outside in the
first turn, moved closer to force the pace outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden but could not get his head in front travelling around the final bend,
chased in vain straightening out for home and faded in the last sixteenth for a minor role. CALUSA DONNIE was off slow to see the field in the early going,
made an early move advancing three wide outside horses down the backside to track the front pair by the half, was urged two wide at the quarter pole but
could not quicken with the leaders, lost its path four wide when weakening in upper stretch and failed to menace in the drive. SMART ALMASTY broke in to
begin, stalked near the rear just off the fence into the first turn, made little improvement three deep outside down the backstretch, kept pace when running
outside a rival in the third tier on the far turn, shifted out in the five-path for the drive but could not get into contention down the lane. TAX INCLUDED
stalked close to the back on the rail, made little progression inside foes down the back straight, came under a ride but was losing ground to the field with
three furlongs to go and was not a presence in the drive to the finish line.

ISSANO dueled inside a runner but off the fence, was headed by that one entering the turn, retook the lead at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear turning into
upper stretch, held safe under moderate urging. WETIKO got away well, settled off the dueling leaders stalking from outside, drifted about in the stretch,
was no threat to the winner but held the place. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE was very lightly bumped at the start, gained forward position tracking inside foes just
off the rail, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, was carried out a bit late and missed second. SPEEDY BULLEIT chased from between runners about three
wide into and on the turn, swung seven wide leaving that bend, failed to rally. HANLAN moved out up the backstretch, was caught four then five wide on the
turn, swung eight deep turning for home, failed to rally. FROST BITTEN dueled outside the winner, took a narrow advantage from the seven-sixteenths to
the five-sixteenths, gave way in the stretch. GINGER'S HOLIDAY bumped a rival just lightly at the start, chased from inside, was never a threat. TRUE
SHOT lacked early speed racing off the inside, was not a factor.

Footnotes
KATHERINE'S GEM had an ideal set up, alone watching the front two down the backstretch, continued to measure the lead duo around the turn, began to
lengthen stride in the six path by the quarter pole, had a full head of steam with a furlong to go and wore down the leader in the final few strides for the win.
WELL ACTUALLY was away alertly at the start to have a brief lead inside, quickly was reined in to shift outside watching the loose frontrunner along the
backside, began to close in smartly in hand with three furlongs to go, cruised outside to the lead in the four path with two furlongs left. was asked while
clinging onto the lead at the furlong marker, kept trying to the finish line but was caught nearing the wire. O WOW was brushed inside at the start to trail
down the backside, began to pick up runners inside at the half, shifted outside three wide to pass another couple of runners with five sixteenths to go and
finished up willingly to be a distant third at the finish line. NORMA NO stalked near the rear four deep on the outside of horses down the backside, offered a
mild rally passing runners three wide on the turn, drifted inwards driving down the lane and finished with interest to be a fringe player in the end. SPEEDY
ESSA broke out on the start, travelled inside rivals in midfield along the backside, saved ground but made no impact around the turn and was one paced on
the fence in the stretch running. LULU'S LULLABY travelled in mid-pack on the outside, was roused but was going the wrong way to be last through the turn
and finished up slightly to pass the struggling early leader in deep stretch. SILENT TRIBUTE was hustled for the lead inside down the backstretch,
continued to freewheel up top on the turn, was collared outside three furlongs from home, offered no resistance giving way by the quarter pole inside and
backed through the field in the stretch drive.

GO GIFFEN broke outwardly steadying slightly, settled toward the back racing off the inside, came out seven wide for the stretch run, took aim, rallied to the
fore inside the final furlong and drew clear. GOOD AS GONE broke sharply, ceded the early advantage content to track in behind inside, saved ground on
or just off the rail, was encouraged along by the five-sixteenths, was guided out further leaving the turn to be four wide at the top of the stretch and under
more stout urging with aim on the leader, took a narrow brief lead near the eighth pole but was soon overtaken, secured the place. SHARP FLAME was
lightly bumped at the start, stalked mid-pack outside while caught mostly five wide through both turns, needed more. BRAVO KATE bumped with rivals and
was squeezed back at the start, settled at the rear, swung six wide into upper stretch, was not a serious threat but finished well to improve in the stretch.
LOOKIN TO CONQUER broke inwardly brushing a rival, was coaxed to the front and clear shifting in to the two path, set the pace from off the rail, came up
empty. KID GIZMO bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground throughout improving into upper stretch, lacked any late kick. NIKITA'S GEM stalked in
good position racing mostly four wide, dropped back in upper stretch and was guided out a bit but failed to rally. TWISTED ROMANCE was bumped at the
start, tried to hop the tracks in the course a sixteenth from the wire the first time, steadied slightly soon after but still maintained forward position stalking
three wide, was within range till engulfed by foes nearing the quarter pole, steadied slightly at that juncture when in tight and was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND SOCIETY had a tracking role between foes at the half, poked his head in front at the three eighths marker, spurted away from rivals in upper
stretch in the three path and just held on by a narrow margin at the finish line. MANNIX (IRE) was unhurried, trailing between rivals down the back straight,
made an early move three wide getting a better forward position at the half, kept pace in the second flight outside around the turn, moved in to loom a
menacing presence five wide turning for home and closed in determinedly with horses on both sides but could not get there in time. LIFE IS HARD broke
out, hitting the gate causing the rider to lose his right iron at the start, settled into stride finally when four deep near the back of the pack at the half, was hard
ridden rallying around horses four wide at the quarter pole, posed a threat in the six path outside runners at the top of the stretch and was gaining to the wire
but did not have enough late. MIGHTY SEA tracked three deep on the outside by the half, moved closer to flank the pacesetter three wide at the
three-furlong pole, was in the thick of things four wide between foes in upper stretch, could not go on with others late and faded at the sixteenth pole for a
minor share. GHOUL (BRZ) travelled in mid-division along the backside, was in tight for a moment when the field bunched up midway down the backstretch,
tracked in the second tier two wide between runners watching the lead trio on the turn, was in range just behind the winner in the three path straightening
out for the drive but evened out in the final furlong. RACE FOR PINKS tracked on the rail at the start, was steadied sharply on the fence at the nine
sixteenths marker to be next to last down the backside, angled out seven wide finding a clear path at the top of the lane and finished up with interest,
gaining on rivals in deep stretch. SHADY EMPIRE was brushed outside on the break, pressed the early pace in the two path between runners, was then
nestled on the rail sitting just behind the frontrunner entering the bend, could not quicken with others outside throughout the turn and lacked a rally in stretch
drive. STYLISH GENT broke sharp angling in for the lead to get to the fence by the half mile marker, was headed outside with three eighths remaining,
battled on inside until the quarter pole, had nothing more to offer and retreated in the two path by mid-stretch. FORESTER HUMOR broke in at the start,
settled near the rear on the rail down the backside, had to be taken hold of when coming up quickly on a troubled rival at the nine sixteenths pole, could not
get involved running around the bend, was floated out eight wide for the drive and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
FANORE (IRE) was under a snug hold on the outside tracking the contesting pair down the backstretch, was roused when pushed out five wide by a runner
at the quarter pole, kept coming in the six path at the top of the lane and was relentless to the finish line to get up right on the final jump at the wire under a
very determined ride. BRITISH ARTILLERY settled in midfield inside rivals, was on hold between horses with seven sixteenths from home, made a bold
move splitting foes in the two path midway on the far turn to have the lead three wide turning for home and just could not fend off the winner who timed the
late surge perfectly to get the nod at the finish line. TUNECHI travelled on the inside close to the back of the pack in the first turn, improved on the fence
down the backside, commenced a rally three wide midway on the final turn, angled out four wide picking up the bit in upper stretch, was running on end late
but was just outkicked by the winner outside nearing the finish line. DIOMEDES tracked three wide on the outside in the first of two turns, moved in to press
the pace on the outside along the backstretch, poked his head in front between foes by the quarter pole, battled inside down the lane up top until the deep
stretch and faded in the final seventy yards to settle on the fringes. DARE TO BE KING was allowed to settle to trail in the early stages, mounted a rally
swinging out widest in the eight path straightening out for the drive and found his best stride late closing smartly in deep stretch. JO DADDY was a little
headstrong, fighting the rider early on, settled down to track on the rail in the second group down the back straight, kept pace taking the shortest way around
in the turn, had a chance for a piece of the prize two wide turning for home but lacked a rally in the stretch and could not play a role late. HEY CUE stumbled
badly, going to his knees on the break, was then allowed to gather himself stalking in the third flight outside down the backstretch, was forced out by an
inside rival to be five wide at the quarter pole and had no finish to offer in the drive to the wire. PLAY THE DOTS was bumped inside to begin, stalked near
the rear inside in the early parts of the race, made no improvement four wide outside runners through the far turn and could not be a factor in the stretch
running. JAGGERSGOTAGUN was off a step slow on the break, recovered to take this field two wide into the first turn up top, continued on the lead while
hounded outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden fighting inside still dueling up front around the final bend, could not find more late and folded on the
fence at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
DANCIN' DEPUTY settled in the two path in mid-division with a half mile left to run, edge closer while in hand with three eighths remaining, burst inside a
tiring rival at the quarter to pose the main threat in upper stretch and tenaciously wore down the leader in the last jump to get up in time for the win. HE
SHOOTS HE WINS was hustled on the rail for the lead down the backside, comfortably rolled along up top through the turn, opened up mildly in the two
path in upper stretch, began to get leg weary on the wrong lead at the furlong marker and just missed holding on for the win being caught by the winner just
at the finish line. HARPER CITY travelled three wide with runners on both sides four furlongs from the wire in midfield down the backside, was bumped by
an inside rival to be pushed out five wide at the quarter pole, kept on coming to be full of run with a furlong to go and closed in sharply to capture the show
money at the finish line. ONTARIO HOLIDAY travelled four deep in mid-pack at the half, kept pace while going four wide outside foes trying to circle rivals
around the turn, angled out widest in the eight path straightening out for the drive and finished up willingly for a minor share in the end. PRINCE SUSSEX
settled on the rail in mid-pack, was under a ride making little progress on the turn, skimmed the fence turning for home while others chose the overland
route, dueled for the show award with an eighth left to go, drifted out under left-handed encouragement and faded in deep stretch. HEAT MERCHANT
travelled on the fence near the rear in the early going, began to reach for more ground inside with three furlongs remaining, shifted out looking for a seam in
the four path at the quarter pole, was full of run with a furlong to go, lost his path and momentum with a sixteenth left to run and could not recover in time to
pose a threat late. IMPERIAL STAR was forced out on the break, kept a close eye while outside, watching the lead dup down the backstretch, was scrubbed
three wide midturn but could not close the gap around the bend, angled out six wide for the drive but gave way between horses at the furlong marker.
CONDITIONAL trailed the field after the start, passed a rival inside with three furlongs from the line, saved all the ground through the turn but could not get
involved in the final furlong on the fence. COMPUTER HACKER lunged on the break, stalked near the back having one rival beaten along the backside, was
in last with three furlongs to go and lost touch with the field by the quarter pole. SILVER PISTOL broke out on the start, chased the frontrunner down the
backside, was hard ridden but could not narrow the margin on the pacesetter through the turn, was engulfed by runners in the four path turning for home
and stopped at the furlong marker.
