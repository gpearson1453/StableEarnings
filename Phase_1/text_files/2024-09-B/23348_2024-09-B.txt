NATIONS DREAM rated between horses, was roused two wide on the bend, shook off SOMNUS with a sixteenth left and was gradually drawing off.
SOMNUS broke alertly, set a pressured pace between NATIONS DREAM and CROWN ROYAL KID, gained the rail into the turn, was headed from outside
midstretch, slowly yielded but was unchallenged for second. SPEIGHTIEMAN commenced his bid between rivals into the bend, moved clear for third while
three wide, was no match for the top pair when set down for the drive but proved clearly best of the others. GUN IT AND RUN IT an early contender from
outside, began to yield four wide on the turn. CROWN ROYAL KID pressed the early speed from inside but gave way with three furlongs to go.

SCRAPPY PATCH without early speed, gradually angled in after a quarter mile, got through from along the rail into the lane, vied for the lead inside the last
eighth and slowly edged ahead inside the final sixteenth. MISS MIA vied for the lead outside rivals from the beginning, edged ahead three wide on the bend,
battled in the stretch but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. SCAPITURE chased from outside, advanced widest through the turn and continued to
rally as she gradually drifted out the final furlong. BROOKE'S ALL IN vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the bend, floated out behind
MISS MIA entering the stretch, moved outside that one with a furlong to go and finished evenly. HALLIE'S RAINBOW disputed the pace between rivals, was
just off the rail through the turn then gradually wore down inside the last eighth. CAT TALE BREEZE was a factor from outside on the backstretch but faded
four wide on the bend.

WILLOW RIDGE rated off the inside on the backstretch, was roused from along the rail on the bend, hand urged in the lane, edged ahead inside the last
furlong and held sway. AFRICAN WARRIOR vied for the early lead from inside, moved clear nearing the end of two furlongs, lengthened command through
the turn, came into the lane just off the inside, did not have enough left the final eighth but was clearly best of the rest. INSIDE THE CIRCLE made a slight
hop a few strides from the gate, contested pace briefly outside AFRICAN WARRIOR, stayed outside that one entering the stretch, weakened the last furlong
but lasted for the show. JOEY B chased from outside, was just off the rail taking the bend and ran evenly through the lane. WISHY WASHY moved to the
inside early on, steadily faded from the rest, did not respond to urging in the stretch, was eased the last 1/8 and walked off.

REDFIELD was kept close between rivals, three wide through the second turn, rallied to gain the advantage inside the final furlong, slowly lugged in the last
seventy yards but held on. JUSTICEONEMORETIME vied for the lead just outside PETE'S LEGACY from the early going, was challenged from both sides
inside the last eighth and lacked the extra needed through the waning yards. WICKED GUS briefly rank at the start, closed the gap on the rest while toward
the outside on the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, advanced just off the rail on the second bend, fanned outside REDFIELD entering the lane and
found best stride too late. PETE'S LEGACY contested the pace from inside from the beginning but gradually wore down the final furlong. SOLOMON
VANDY raced in contention from outside for six furlongs then began to wear down.

Footnotes
KING DOODLE was sent to contest the pace inside GALLANT BUCK but well off the rail, moved clear from path three on the turn, floated out some into the
stretch then steadily lengthened command under urging to prove much the best. SWISS GUARD in contention from outside, commenced his bid widest on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved clear for second then could only hold his position late. MKAR THE FAST a bit awkward and somewhat slow
at the start, progressed just off or along the rail, took over third midstretch then leveled off. TONYS MORNING LINE chased from inside, fanned out some
into the lane, angled to the outside upper stretch and failed to have a significant late bid. GALLANT BUCK displayed early speed just outside KING
DOODLE, was forced to keep outside that one into the bend, began to yield before finishing a half mile, moved to the inside leaving the turn and continued
to fade. VIOLENZA D'ORO soon trailed, swung widest into the stretch, altered in for a clear path inside the last furlong but had little to offer.

WILDWOOD RUBEN stalked the early speed three wide, was let out on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch then drew off under a drive inside the last
eighth. LOOKIN FOR BALA was sent to press SWAGGY GEORGE from just outside, went for the lead after a quarter mile, could not hold back
WILDWOOD RUBEN in the stretch but proved clearly best of the others. SWAGGY GEORGE set a pressured pace from inside but began to yield before
finishing a half mile. DUST DANCER made a slight lunge from the gate, advanced to contention four wide, was widest taking the turn and had no stretch
bid. KARAYEL soon trailed, moved toward the inside after two furlongs, saved ground taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ROAD GAME rated between rivals, advanced four wide on the turn, angled in some leaving the bend, responded to urging upper stretch to gain the
advantage near the eighth pole then drew off with the final furlong. SUPER SILVER had a bit awkward and hesitant start, progressed widest, was just
outside ROAD GAME through the turn, took over second inside the last eighth then could only hold his position late. MAPACHE G left the gate slowly and
with a small hop, was settled inside, picked up his pace on the bend, fanned four wide into the lane, surged the final furlong and gained third with less than
thirty yards left. NOT AGAIN JACKIE a step slow at the break, was hustled up to race in the second flight while just off the inside, caught in tight quarters
briefly between ARGYBARGY BUCK and ROAD GAME early in the turn, came into the stretch behind LIMA ZULU, gained a clear path three wide inside the
last furlong but finished evenly. LIMA ZULU vied for the lead outside ARGYBARGY BUCK, moved into the bend, took the rail, came off the inside some
entering the lane, was challenged from outside and flattened out between horses inside the final furlong. MODAZZLE hesitated at the start, was hustled up
to contention from between horses, moved to the inside after a quarter mile, faded along the rail on the turn and had no significant stretch bid.
ARGYBARGY BUCK was also a step slow at the start, hustled up to dispute the pace inside LIMA ZULU, began to yield after two furlongs and was steadied
several times as he tried to get out while in traffic through the bend. R H SMOAKEM was a brief contender between rivals but faded four wide on the turn.
