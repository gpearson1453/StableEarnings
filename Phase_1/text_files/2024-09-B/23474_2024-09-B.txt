Footnotes
AVIATOR GUI brushed the near side stall at the start when breaking inwards, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, strode
green in the turn from that station through to the five-sixteenths when switching leads, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to issue a challenge inside the final furlong, had the leader come out to look him in the eye a sixteenth from home and was up in the final jumps to
the finish. CYCLONE STATE broke out at the start, established the front and spurted away in hand along the inside, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole, came under growing threat to the outside and was brought out to look his main danger in the eye and
was caught in the final strides to the wire. HANDS OF TIME chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN broke out and hit the off side stall at the start, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no headway. THUNDER ROLL coaxed from the
gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TAPIT TRICE was slow into stride and dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was
urged inside to the two path on the far turn, climbed behind a foe near the five-sixteenths pole then shifted to the three path, turned into upper stretch under
the crop, pursued the runner-up into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and got up late to prevail. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING showed speed
on the inside of MASQUEPARADE, was taken back off the pace while moving from the two path to the three path on the first turn, was carried out leaving
that bend, tracked outside on the backstretch, moved in near the five-eighths pole then back out before the half-mile pole, gained to make a bid in the three
to four path on the far turn, took the lead just inside the three-eighths pole then moved clear at the five-sixteenths pole, was put to the crop into upper
stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth but shortened stride and was caught while far clear for second. CRUPI raced in the four path on
the first turn, settled off the pace, moved out while dropping to the rear under urging around the nine-sixteenths pole, was urged along in the four to five path
on the far turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole and tired. MASQUEPARADE showed speed on the outside
of a rival, moved clear in the two path on the first turn, floated out entering the backstretch, showed the way off the inside, vied in the two path on the far
turn, lost the lead to the runner-up just inside the three-eighths pole and faded.

MIGHTY ATLAS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch
and advanced getting placed in tight by the leader TWO'S A CROWD near the three-sixteenths before taking command inside that station, then edged away
under a drive kept busy to the finish. SHADOW DRAGON got bumped at the start by LEFTEMBEHIND, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. BOURBON CHASE coaxed from the start, chased five paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch and kept
on to secure the show honors. TWO'S A CROWD established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, got collared inside the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish.
LEFTEMBEHIND broke in at the start bumping SHADOW DRAGON, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and came up empty. NEURAL NETWORK coaxed from the gate, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch in the closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under urging with five-sixteenths
to go, swung four to five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. WILD BANKER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, tired.

FAR BRIDGE was taken under restraint early then reserved while inside to the two path, moved closer late on the backstretch, was shuffled back behind the
stopping pacesetter at the three-eighths pole, moved around at that foe after losing position then was roused in the two path outside the five-sixteenths pole,
rallied into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead inside of two foes inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the finish and proved best
under a strong hand-ride. WAR LIKE GODDESS dropped to the rear, settled at the back while saving ground, moved off the rail down the backstretch,
advanced closer with a half-mile to run, was asked in the three path on the final turn, rallied outside to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths pole, took a
short lead outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner inside that marker, moved in closer to that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, fought to
the finish and missed while clear for the place. SILVER KNOTT (GB) tracked the pace on the outside while racing in the two path around the first two turns,
stalked outside on the backstretch, took the lead with three furlongs to run then dropped to the rail while moving clear on the final turn, came under the crop
in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened but was well clear for the show. EMMANUEL was taken in hand early then
rated on the inside, moved off the rail near the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back in the two path on the final turn then moved to the rail late on that bend
and had nothing left. GET SMOKIN went to the front, showed the way while inside on the turns, was headed with three furlongs to run and stopped.

the final furlong. LINDA'S JEWEL coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths under

Footnotes
NINA KAY was hustled from gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch then took over,
shook clear near the furlong marker and held under steady urging. DISCO STAR was urged along off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, dropped
from the two path to the rail on the turn, slipped through inside of a foe outside the furlong marker and finished willingly to just get the place. HIGHER
FORCE moved out while urged along on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, shifted from the three path to the five path on the turn, turned into
upper stretch in the six path and also finished willingly but just missed the place while clear for the show. GRACEFUL WARRIOR was hustled from the gate,
pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, gained a brief lead near the three-sixteenths pole then lost the advantage to the winner,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SILSBEE was in tight at the start, moved up while urged along, angled from the rail to the four path on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. MISS C BANKER was away alertly, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along
the rail under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, was headed near the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. PAWTUCKETSHUFFLE
broke in at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, came into the stretch in the two path then moved further out and was no
factor. I HEARD SOMETHINGS broke a step slow, was ridden along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the four path and was no factor. RUN DON'T
WALK broke in then was hustled, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path and retreated.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT showed speed on the outside of a rival then moved to a solo lead, vied inside of a foe while in the two path on the turn, responded well
when set down near the quarter-pole then kicked clear in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. MAGICAL WAYS settled off the
pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked in good striking range at the five-sixteenths pole, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and
was second best. WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased inside on the
turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. CREATE TROUBLE angled out early then was rated just off the
pace, gained to make a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the four then three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. ASSUME
NOTHING was well placed early, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was put to the crop
inside the three-eighths pole, came out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. O P FIRECRACKER broke a step slow, angled in at the rear,
moved out near the nine-sixteenths, gained in the four path on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths pole, chased into the stretch and
capitulated.

Footnotes
ZULU KINGDOM (IRE) a bit rank when under restraint into the first turn, settled tracking the front along the inside patiently handled until set down angled
four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, briefly edged clear before digging in under threat to the inside to
gamely prevail on the wire. NOBLE CONFESSOR tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and offered up a good finish to threaten for it all late but was ultimately staved off. EARLY
ADOPTER (GB) settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got roused tipped three wide into upper stretch, was under a drive and rallying when
forced to check sharply a furlong out loosely between foes as SMOOTH BREEZE came out shying under a left handed crop, got re-engaged by the rider
and showed good courage to keep on and secure the show honors over a pair at the finish. SMOOTH BREEZE broke out at the start bumping the stumbling
FULLY AUTHORIZED, raced four then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader
before being tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive prominent to the eighth pole and shied out under a left handed crop at that station forcing EARLY ADOPTER to check, then weakened in the late
stages and was nailed for the show honors by that same rival. FLYING MOHAWK broke out a step at the start, showed the way in hand along the inside
patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in
the late stages. WITHOUT CAUTION broke a half a beat slow, saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, got set down continuing along the
inside into upper stretch and tired. CONCORD GREEN settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. FULLY AUTHORIZED stumbled at the start and was bumped by SMOOTH BREEZE breaking
outwards, raced three wide through the first turn, continued three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under a drive from the
seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.
