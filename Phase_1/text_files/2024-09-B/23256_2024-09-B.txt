Footnotes
TIRUPATI opened a clear lead on the first turn, settled setting a well rated pace down the backstretch to be under mild pressure while well in hand, repelled
challengers nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear again and was unthreatened late a convincing winner. KAKE'S TAP DANCER tracked the pacesetter from
the rail for a half, was held up slightly at the seven-sixteenths off the winner's heels, continued to be in striking distance turning for home and rallied up the
fence to take the place spot without gaining on the winner. DEAD SEXY stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied to loom turning for home,
was no match for the winner and battled gamely down the lane for the runner-up position only to be denied late in the drive. LEARNING TO FLY resreved in
mid-pack just off the pace while racing three wide from between rivals on the backstretch, angled out turning for home and mounted a mild bid in the lane.
DIRTY GOLD bumped at the start by inside rival, moved to contention on the far turn, lacked a closing kick while wandering through the lane. KEEP IT
SWEET raced wide on the first turn, continued to be five wide on the backstretch and passed weaker rivals coming home without impact. BOSSY KATE
prompted the pace to the far turn, made a bid to challenge the pacesetter on the final bend and gave way in the lane. VANA BRIGHT chased the pace to be
mid-field for a half and steadily faded from contention. SECESSIONIST was not a factor.

KISSTHEMOON pressed the pace from two wide to the far turn, took control nearing the quarter pole, pulled clear in upper stretch and widened down the
lane facing no challenges. ASCRIBE tracked the leaders from three wide in the second pair down the backside, lsot position on the turn to be at the rear of
the field turning for home, rallied in mid-stretch splitting rivals and closed willingly to be up for the place. PATIENT CAPITAL stalked the pace from the fence
on the inside of the second pairing, rallied on the turn up the fence, lacked room when the hole clsode, was taken up slightly while waiting off heels, angled
four wide turning for home to commence a rally and finsihed evenly down the lane lacking a closing kick. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE unhurried in the early
going to trail after a half, made an early bid circling four wide into the turn to loom on bend and flattened out in the stretch unable to sustain the rally.
INSPIRED IRISH hustled to the lead away from the gate, set a pressured pace for three-quarters and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
DULCE KIARA pressed the pace from two wide through the turn, took a short lead in mid-stretch, drifted out down the lane, responded when challenged late
in the stretch and prevailed at the wire. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER worked to the rail early on, tracked the leaders from the fence on the turn, tipped out
splitting rivals turning for home and closed well to engage the winner in deep stretch battling to the wire and just missed on the bob. GOLDEN CAN stalked
the pace from between rivals on the turn and rallied willingly through the lane unable to keep pace with the top pair. THEODORA GRACE reserved off the
pace to midway on the turn, circled five wide turning for home and finished with good interest belatedly. NO EASY ANSWER trailed to upper stretch and
rallied mildly by tiring rivals. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY dueled from the rail on the lead through the turn, dug-in gamely in upper stretch while tiring and
weakened inside the eighth pole. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR bumped hard when sandwiched between rivals leaving the gate to be at the rear of the field,
rushedup on the outside to contend on the turn and dropped to the rear of the pack down the lane having been used up early.

Footnotes
ARISTOCRATIC broke alertly to take command while well in hand early, set a well rated pace under pressure on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and
held the runner-up safe late in the lane. PACO THE TACO MAN pressed the pace down the backside, loomed up two wide turning for home, was repelled in
upper stretch and dug-in willingly to challenge again late. SHOOT THEMESSENGER tracked the leaders while reserved off the pace through the turn and
rallied mildly to be along for the show in the lane. VESELSKY stalked the pace throughout and lacked a closing rally going evenly. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND
broke wide leaving the gate, trailed and was outrun.

Footnotes
PARADISE WINS reserved off the pace along the rail in the first turn, drifted out to be three wide down the backside while in traffic, lost position when
steadied in traffic into the final turn, waited patiently on the bend for racing room, swung seven wide at the head of the lane and closed fast to be up in time.
WINNING STREEP stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, rallied on the turn to engage the leaders turning for home, took the lead in
mid-stretch and was caught in the final strides. GATHERED tracked the leaders from the fence to be well placed on the final bend, angled to the clear and
mounted a stretch rally that came up just short in a good effort. CANADIAN BEAR rated in mid pack for the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide on
the far turn to be prominent at the top of the stretch and kept-on through the lane. MOON CACHE set a pressured pace from the fence under constant
pressure and weakened in upper stretch. SOCIAL LOVE unhurried for the first half mile to be near the rear of the field, made a steady advance around the
final bend while forced six wide and make a mild late bid through the stretch. SEGER SONGS was well placed in contention down the backside from
between rivals and failed to respond lacking a closing rally when called upon. BOYS GO TO JUPITER had a rail trip while never posing a threat. GRAND
EMPRESS dueled on the pace from two wide taking a brief lead on the far turn and gave way in the stretch. LADY CATALINA trailed down the backside,
made a bid from five wide on the turn, was fanned out to the ten path turning for home, weakened and was eased.

Footnotes
MOLLY OF STRATFORD came out at the break, pressed the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter at the quarter pole,
took command in upper stretch and drew off through the lane convincingly. SOUTH PACIFIC, steadied in tight quarters at the start, made a steady advance
to contention circling five wide on the turn and kept grinding through the lane to be second best in a good effort. STORM RATE set a pressured pace
through the turn, responded when challenged turning for home, was unable to go with the winner while chasing willingly, and weakened late in the lane.
KAPATUDE reserved off the pace in mid-pack along the rail to be well placed, tipped out 3w splitting rivals turning for home and finished with a mild
non-threatening bid. JUST THE THING raced in mid-pack throughout and improved position in the stretch. VELVET VIXEN was slow early to be near the
rear of the field, saved ground on the turn without impact. BLUE TRILLION bobbled at the start, tracked the leaders from four wide and flattened out midway
on the bend. ANY FOOLS GOLD trailed and passed tiring rivals in the lane. SKIP THRU DA FIRE hustled early to keep pace midway on the turn and lacked
a closing bid dropping out as no threat. ICED MOCHA broke alertly to be on the lead early, raced in contention to the quarter pole and came up empty for
the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

GREAT IDEA rated off the leaders down the backside in mid-field, rallied on the turn splitting rivals to be four wide turning for home, took command in
mid-stretch, bobbled inside the eighth poleand continued on unfazed to be a convincing winner. WORA reserved off the pace to midway on the bend, angled
five wide at the top of the lane and showed good late energy rallying down the lane to gain the place. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE unhurried in the early going
to be held off the pace and rallied belatedly in the lane to be along for the show. WATCH OUT WORLD moved up after the first fifty yards to take command,
set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, shook off the presser, battled to hold off the closers to midway down the lane and was outkicked in the drive.
SHAPE NOTE away sharply to lead early, settled along the fence to be just off the leader pressing and steadily faded from contention lacking a closing kick.
BENNY HAVENS dropped out the back of the pack shortly away from the gate to trail and showed some late interest without impact. NIELSON tracked the
leaders into the turn, rallied to loom up at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch unable to sustain the rally. HAPPY JAUNT chased the pack to the far turn
and never posed a threat. SURPRISE HELLO stalked the pace fro three wide to the head of the lane and gave way.

CIRCLE P stalked the pace fo the turn, rallied four wide to take command turning for home, drew away and was never threatened in the lane. SUPER
ACCELERATE tracked the leader from the fence saving ground, tipped out three wide chasing the winner dwon the lane and finished willingly as second
best. PLAY LIKE A RAVEN trailed early, split rivals turning for home to mount a mild bid in the lane and be along for the show. JOHN HALL trailed to the top
of the lane while still within striking distance and rallied passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GUARDIAN PRINCE set the pace under mild pressure to the turn,
responded when challenged on the turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. HE'S ORIENTATE showed speed
for the first three-eighths and steadily faded to the rear of the field.

Footnotes
BREAKWATER reserved of fthe pacealong the rail well in hand down the backside, waited patiently on the far turn for racing room, angled to the clear six
wide and closed well to be going away. AWESOME STRIKE tracked the leaders while caught four wide the entire way, rallied to engage the leader in upper
stretch, took a brief lead inside the eighth pole and was out-finished late in a good effort. MAX SWAGGER set the pace while well rated under mild pressure
through the final bend, drifted three wide turning for home, dropped in to the rail impeded CONTEMPT who was rallying up the fence, dug-in gamely through
the lane responding well and was outkicked late. HARD TRAVELER trailed down the backstretch, rallied turning for home when angled five wide and
showed good interest with a belated rally. CONTEMPT prompted the pace to the far turn, lost position on the bend, rallied cutting the corner at the head of
the lane, was checked sharply when MAX SWAGGER drifted into his path along the rail in upper stretch, and kept on through the lane having lost all
momentum. GANADO stalked the pace down the backside, made a two wide bid to challenge at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. CASSIUS failed
to menace. ALOHA MAN raced mid-pack to the far turn and dropped out as a non-factor. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of
CONTEMPT, MAX SWAGGER was disqualified and placed fifth for a contemptuous run in the stretch.
