Footnotes
MY MAGIC WAND established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside under pressure from FASHION VICTIM to
the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. FASHION VICTIM pressed
the pace of the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. CITATIONAL bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to the finish. BACK TO GRIDLOCK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside briefly and then just off the inside, advanced under coaxing
tipped three wide at the three-eighths and bid through the latter portion of the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong.
REFUSE TO LOSE bobbled at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
trailed.

Footnotes
TYPHOON FURY settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, shook two
foes outside the sixteenth-pole and drew clear under strong urging. INFLATION NATION (IRE) chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn,
gained to make a bid in upper stretch, battled with two foes into the final furlong, lost touch with the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match
but showed good courage to just get the place. BUCKORTWO was urged along in the back half of the field, moved from the two path to the four path on the
turn, gained while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. RAGING was
bumped at the start and forced out, showed speed on the outside of three rivals, vied three wide on the turn, battled with a duo under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened then was caught for the trifecta. BAIE LONGUE climbed some near the five-eighths pole, settled off the pace, was roused while
moving from the rail to the three path on the turn and lacked the needed response. FORWARD MOVE was ridden along at the rear, raced inside to the two
path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three path and failed to threaten. MUSICAL MAESTRO broke out and bobbled then bumped soundly with a
foe, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out in the final furlong and failed to threaten. TETA'S
TROTTER showed speed between horses, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground while shuffled back behind MUAZARAH on the
turn, came through inside that foe while roused near the five-sixteenths pole, moved off the rail in upper stretch and came up empty. ROYAL KING disputed
the pace on the inside of opponents, vied along the rail on the turn and gave way. CONNIVING was bumped hard at the start, raced on the outside under
urging, dropped from the five path to the three path early on the turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and was no factor. IRISH TENOR broke out and
bumped with a foe then was hustled, chased the pace then dropped back outside the half-mile pole, fell further back while in the four then five path on the
turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. MUAZARAH disputed the pace between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, came up empty in
mostly the two path on the turn, was guided out in upper stretch and also faltered then was eased but walked off.

under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, dug in under threat from flanking
challengers and inched away in the late stages to prevail. MASTER OF ARMS broke out at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, tipped five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home and was just up for the place honors on the wire. SQUIRE
CREEK brushed the off side stall at the start under coaxing and broke on top despite it, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing
near the five-sixteenths when under threat to the outside, took the inside route into upper stretch and was displaced from command straightened away, ran

Footnotes
TONY O was hustled from the gate then taken in hand after leaving the chute, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was roused near the quarter-pole
then shifted three wide into upper stretch, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, battled gamely to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong
urging. CATTANI stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, drew even with the leader near the half-mile pole, was asked in the two path on the far
turn, gained a short lead around the quarter-pole, battled under a drive with multiple foes in the stretch, fought determinedly to the finish and just missed
while able to get a share of second. SWEET TONE was hustled from the gate, moved in after leaving the chute, rounded the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, traveled three wide on the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid in
the final furlong but just missed while able to get a share of the place. CHARMING JIM lost his footing at the start and was last to commence, bobbled while
moving from the two path to the three path on the first turn, settled near the back, went around the far turn in the three then four path, came seven wide into
upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and gained while improving position then just missed the trifecta. LANDAUER raced in the two path
on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, waited behind traffic inside the three-sixteenths pole then altered out in
the final furlong and gained with late energy to just miss the superfecta. JUDGE RULES angled in after leaving the chute, was reserved while saving
ground, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out a bit more while chasing the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed kick.
MAKEYOURMOMENT bumped with a rival at the start, settled just off the pace in the two path while between foes, was asked on the far turn, swung four
wide into upper stretch, chased the leaders in the drive and also lacked the needed kick. ROHAN bumped with an opponent at the start, was taken in hand
early then moved out before the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside without the benefit of the cover, moved closer with a half-mile
to run, was roused four wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed response. CAN'T
STAND DISCO went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole and gave way. FELINE
TREASURE was taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside without cover, came under urging
near the three-eighths pole, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch and capitulated.

FINAL VERDICT chased just off the inside patiently handled, continued in the two path into upper stretch, got roused when taking command
three-sixteenths from home and edged away to the finish to prevail. CIGARETTE BOAT hustled from the gate, knocked heads briefly with ALEXIS ZORBA
before easing off, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner
home clear of the rest. DANCING RINCA got bumped at the start by ROUGH DRAFT breaking outwards and then got forced to steady by CIGARETTE
BOAT crossing in front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) broke out at the start and was corrected, knocked heads briefly before establishing sole command to show the way in hand just
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to run
and weakened in the late stages. ROUGH DRAFT broke out at the start bumping DANCING RINCA, chased along the inside and then tipped out two then
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. VINSANITY broke out at the start
brushing BEZOS, chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. TOXIC GRAY got steadied at the start when CIGARETTE BOAT crossed in front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BEZOS got brushed at the start by VINSANITY, chased just off the inside
down the backstretch, tipped briefly three wide before heading four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered three wide into
upper stretch backing away and was eased home through to the finish.

quarter-pole, kicked clear in the two path into upper stretch, remained clear under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was put to a right-handed crop
late and just held. SOVEREIGNTY was well placed just off the pace in third position, stalked while inside to the two path on the turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the outside into the final sixteenth, gained with large strides late and just missed
while clear for the place. CLASSICIST pressed the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path under urging on the turn,
lost touch with the winner in the three path into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, kept on to the finish and easily secured the show. LAIRD
OF MAGNOLIA leaned in then brushed the gate and was off slow, settled well off the pace, moved in outside the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in
the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and failed to threaten. BURN NOTICE moved in while ridden along well off the pace, traveled around
the turn in the two path and never reached contention. PIRANDELLO dropped well off the pace while ridden along, moved from the two path to the rail early
on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and was no factor.

HUSH OF A STORM saved ground while reserved towards the rear, moved to the two path near the five-sixteenths pole, was roused outside the
quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch, moved out a bit more around the three-sixteenths pole then rallied on the outside, closed well while
swapping leads back and forth to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with two foes to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
DAKOTA GOLD went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace while given some cover, was removed from cover near the five-eighths pole
then made a middle move on the outside, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the
final furlong, made a bid between horses outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with two rivals to the finish and missed while just able to get the place. JERRY
THE NIPPER established a forward position early, raced in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two path
on the far turn, dropped back some in upper stretch, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled
with the top two to the finish and just missed the place while able to get the show. CITY MAN was taken under restraint early, raced in the three path on the
first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path while between horses, was asked near the quarter-pole then chased the leader, moved
in near the furlong marker, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole but was out-kicked. SARATOGA FLASH went to the front, dropped from the two path to
the rail on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, vied inside while asked on the far turn, spun a bit off the rail into upper stretch, led under a
drive until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken. CABLE READY reared while very fractious in the gate then was backed out and deemed fit to run
by the state veterinarian before being re-loaded, left the gate under urging then was taken in hand, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was asked
near the quarter-pole, chased inside into the final furlong, was taken up in tight against the rail while being out-kicked at the sixteenth-pole then brushed the
rail and weakened. KAZ SUGAR BANK was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off
the pace, went two then three wide while roused on the far turn and lacked the needed response.

PORTRAIT OF ADDIE broke a half a beat slow and shied out behind KATERINA RISTOVA being taken briefly in hand due to pressure from SOUL
SECRET and BOURBON BLANKET to her inside, settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went
eight wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside to issue a challenge inside the final furlong, collared the leader inside the sixteenth marker and just got
the nod on the wire to score. ACOUSTICAT settled tracking the front just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out and rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug in under threat and just lost the bob on the line.
KATERINA RISTOVA raced three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, advanced nearing the far turn and
pressed the issue from the seven-sixteenths knocking heads through the bend and seizing command just outside the quarter pole, swung two to three wide
into upper stretch, edged away under a drive straightened away, shied out under a left handed crop two paths a furlong out, then shied in when corrected
with a right handed crop and was caught a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the show honors at the finish. MEZCALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure from the aforementioned foe seven-sixteenths from home and was placed to coaxing in response
with five-sixteenths remaining, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to the finish. ON A SUMMER DAY four
then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and stayed
on one paced to the end. LOTUS PETAL lunged and was bumped solidly between foes who each broke her way at the start, chased along the inside
patiently handled until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, then offered no kick. IL SUO ORO five then four wide through the first turn, chased four
then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SOUL SECRET got bumped at
the start by BOURBON BLANKET, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. BOURBON BLANKET broke out at the start bumping SOUL SECRET, got out six wide into the first turn and steadily tucked to be three wide when
entering the backstretch, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. OLIVIA'S WISH broke in at the start bumping LOTUS PETAL solidly in tandem with MITOLETA, came under hustling and chased
three then two wide, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. MITOLETA veered out at the start bumping
LOTUS PETAL solidly in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch and folded.
