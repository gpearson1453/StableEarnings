FLYIN BY saved ground setting the pace, turned back a bid from HOLY TUTTA BELLA at the quarter pole and won drawing clear. HOLY TUTTA BELLA
tracked FLYIN BY while racing two-wide, moved up to offer a bid at the quarter pole but was unable to match strides with that one during the drive while
holding on for second. NAN ELIZABETH dropped back early, rallied four-wide into the stretch then angled further out nearing the eighth pole and was
gaining late. TEAM CONCEPT saved ground while being unhurried and finished in a mild rally. IN THE VAULT saved ground while being reserved off the
pace, drifted out to be five-wide at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. TIZ A TIGER was allowed to settle early then was carried out six-wide by IN THE
VAULT nearing the quarter pole and failed to menace.

ALICESHOUSEOFHEART saved ground while being reserved early, slipped through entering the stretch, caught CHROME'S BEST COPY at the eighth
pole and prevailed over that one in a stiff drive. CHROME'S BEST COPY set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail, responded when
challenged nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely during the drive for second. FAST TRACK saved ground while being close-up early, angled out to be
three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly in a good effort. DREWY was allowed to settle, moved up closer while five-wide nearing the
quarter pole and then weakened during the late stages. FOREST ACCLAMATION ducked in sharply behind her field at the start then was unhurried while

the pace racing removed from the inside rail and held on well for second when headed. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP saved ground while being close-up early,
angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. BIKINI NATION prompted the issue while three-wide on the turn, came
four-wide into the stretch then angled in nearing the sixteenth pole but lacked a rally.. SETTLER'S COVE was forwardly placed while racing five-wide on the
turn and went evenly. SHELBY SHORTSTOP was allowed to settle, rallied six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. JIM'S JET was
prominently placed to the stretch racing two-wide and weakened. ASK ALICE was allowed to settle early, rallied four-wide into the stretch but was not a
factor. LASSIE CAT raced in the middle of the field for three furlongs while three-wide and gave way.
