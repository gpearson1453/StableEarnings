Footnotes
CATO'S LADY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and dueled to the wire to hold the win. TALES
OF MAKENNA raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to
just miss. CHILD PROOF led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, dug in in upper stretch and gave way in
the final furlong. FAT AND FURIOUS raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and
improved position from there. BRAHMS IS WHO tracked the leader on the inside through the early going, came around the bend in the two path and was
outkicked in the lane. FOXGLOVE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and faded in the stretch.
