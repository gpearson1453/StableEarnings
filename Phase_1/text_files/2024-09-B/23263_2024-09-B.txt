Footnotes
I HAVE AN IDEA took command inside from the start, slowed the wind aided pace down along the backside, continued up front unopposed around the final
bend and had more in reserve in the stretch running to comfortably hold safe at the wire. MAGIC MODIE chased the frontrunner right from the get-go, tried
to reel in the winner at the quarter pole but could not narrow the margin turning for home, did not waver in the stretch and determinedly kept on going to best
the rest at the finish line. CHICAGO TYPHOON travelled on the outside in mid-division in the early going, tracked the front two in the third flight between
horses in the two path through the turn, dropped back a touch by the quarter pole and re-rallied smartly when splitting runners with a sixteenth remaining to
get up late for the show award. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY was nested on the rail in midfield down the backside, took the shortest way around on the far turn
waiting for the cue to go, skimmed the fence to move in on the rail dueling for the place share in upper stretch inside, shifted out in the two path late losing
some run and was caught late to settle for a minor share in the end. TAKE CHANCES stalked, ahead of only one runner down the back straight, made an
early move four wide trying to circle around rivals in the final bend, was in range of the leader four wide turning for home, could not sustain the rally and
stalled with a furlong left to go. WILD QUEENIE was unhurried to trail in the early stages of the race, could not make any headway around the final bend,
angled outside in the six path for clear running room but could only pass a tired runner outside late. SECRET GIZMO travelled in hand just behind, watching
the top two along the backside, kept pace while three wide between foes on the far turn, could not keep up with others starting a move by the quarter pole
and retreated by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
QUITE READY shadowed the pace under a snug hold in the beginning, was part of the foursome, three wide between foes watching the pacesetter around
the turn, emerged from the chasing pack to take closer order with three eighths to go, angled out three wide for the drive moving in, shifted to the rail with a
sixteenth to go collaring the leader and edged away late for the score. MAD DOG N JOE pulled the rider to the lead down the backstretch, was unopposed,
freewheeling up top throughout the turn, angled four wide straightening out for home holding onto the lead, began to get a little leg weary at the furlong
marker, could not fend off the winner anymore by the sixteenth pole but did dig in to save the place share at the wire. SOULMATE trailed four deep along
the back straight, kept pace while travelling four wide outside runners throughout the turn, was in the thick of things in the five path at the top of the lane and
was gaining gradually in deep stretch to almost get up for second money at the wire. TOLD IT ALL settled on the rail in the second flight in the turn, dropped
back to last inside on the rail with three furlongs to run, shifted just outside for the stretch run in the two path, angled out some more off runners to be four
wide at the eighth pole and finished up mildly between horses to be a fringe player. TOP OF THE CHARTS tracked with runners on both sides while running
two wide down the backside, was tucked in behind the leader, saving ground around the turn to be in the mix for a share at the quarter pole beside the
eventual winner but could not find more late and yielded on the rail with a sixteenth to go. GALVASTON settled near the rear down the back straight,
co-trailed behind the pack around the bend, followed the leader four wide at the top of the lane but lacked a finish in the stretch drive. PRIMO TOUCH broke
with the field but then was slow into stride to be at the back of the pack early, was rushed up down the backstretch to be four wide tracking outside around
the turn, could not maintain forward position five wide at the five sixteenths pole, was in tight turning for home, checked slightly and could not be a factor in
the stretch running.

Footnotes
MY BOY BRUCE broke out on the start, was under restraint near the back outside in the early going, was turned loose with seven sixteenths to go, quickly
moved in outside through the turn to bid for the lead two wide at the quarter pole, opened up in mid-stretch when urged right-handed and was kept to the
task for the win but by a quickly diminishing margin at the finish line. GLINTINDADDYSEYE co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, had little to offer seeing
the field around the turn, swung out six wide gathering speed for the stretch run and rallied strongly late to make it interesting at the wire but had to settle for
the runners up share in the end. ZONE CONTROL was content to be alone, sitting behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, when closing the gap
coming up the leader had to be checked in tight quarters with two furlongs remaining, shifted off the dueling top pair in the four-path turning for home and
finished up willingly to be a distant third in the end. SOUPER STRIDER settled in midfield down the back straight, could not match strides with the top three
around the bend, angled five wide in upper stretch but could not get involved driving to the finish line. AFLEET PRINCE veered in on the break, was eager
while setting the pace along the backside, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter pole and wilted on the fence with a sixteenth left to run.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TEST bore out about twelve paths at the start spotting the field roughly nine or ten lengths, advanced between foes early on the turn then closer
still to the leader late on that bend, bid at the quarter pole, dueled for a bit then edged away late under steady handling while much the best. COMMANDER
WORSLEY forced the pace from outside, moved clear entering the turn, was engaged by an outside runner at the top of the stretch, dueled with that one
just off the fence but was only second best. GEE POWER angled in early, saved ground on the turn first on then just off the rail, kept on inside runners to
get show honors. AUDAX MINOR settled off the pace racing three to five wide, needed more. THREE O EIGHT shifted in and made an early move between
runners to get within range of the leader stalking that one, came out in the stretch, was outkicked for minor awards. MAD CHATTER was mid-pack inside
racing a bit rank and hard to control near the half-mile marker, shifted out soon after, was five wide leaving the turn, failed to rally. OK SPEEDY dwelt at the
start spotting the field about seven to eight lengths, was caught outside four to six wide on the turn racing toward the back and was never near enough to
threaten. BAPTIST BILLY pressed inside early, dropped back, saved ground, failed to menace.

Footnotes
TAPIT KISSIT WINIT travelled four deep in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, patiently kept pace on the fence throughout the turn, shifted out for
the drive three wide in upper stretch with momentum, swept on past the leader with a quick turn of foot under only mild urging and was going away for the
win at the finish line. WAGSTAFF pressed the pace between foes down the back straight, chased the pacesetter two or three wide around the bend,
determinedly was closing in while between foes at the furlong marker and got up for the place share just before the finish line. CRUCIAL TAUNT seized
command from the onset, opened up on rivals through the turn, began to get leg weary inside with a furlong left to run and faded in deep stretch to be a
clear third in the end. MISS MITOLE prompted three deep outside down the back straight, bore out badly on the turn but did show some gumption to recover
to be a fringe player at the wire. DILWAALA was ahead of only the poor starter with the field strung out down the backstretch, made little progression while
saving ground around the bend, battled for a minor share inside down the lane but just came up short at the wire. SPRINGER tossed its head right when the
gate opened up, was steadied sharply on the break, trailed by many down the backside and could not recover to be involved. STEWRADS INQUIRY

Footnotes
SPANSIVE pressed the pace from the outset, moved to the lead past the five-sixteenths, kicked clear when asked, held safe. CREVALLE D'ORO settled off
the pace, advanced four wide outside on the turn, took aim making steady gain on the leader in tehestretch but could not reach that one while clearly
second best. AHA MOMENT set the pace pressured by the eventual winner, came out a bit in the stretch, was no match for the top ones but held show.
READY FOR SHIRL stalked from outside mostly three to four wide, was in range coming into upper stretch but went evenly. GILD THE LILY settled off the
pace, saved ground, improved inside. LITERATE bumped with a foe at the start, chased from between runners, came out five wide, ran on. SARATOGA
VISION unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung six to seven wide, ran on mildly. MI CORAZON tracked from inside, came out a couple paths on the turn,
failed to rally. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, chased from between runners in the second flight, dropped back, shifted out,
was never a threat.

Footnotes
THE NEW MAYBE was unhurried to co-trail on the outside in the beginning, made a quick move four deep at the seven sixteenths marker to swoop around
runners to bid for the lead by the quarter pole, opened up on rivals just inside the furlong marker and had no challengers when crossing the finish line.
DREAM JEREEM forced the issue on the rail down the backstretch, waited behind the leaders on the turn, took a couple of awkward steps on the fence with
five sixteenths to run, shifted out to be three wide gaining at the quart pole and finished up smartly to be a non-threatening second at the wire. MISTER
HOLDEN tugged the rider to the early lead, prompted the pace outside at the half, vied between in the two path up top around the bend, dueled in upper
stretch with the winner but faded in the last sixteenth to be a clear third. PROUD RONIN tracked outside in the second flight, edged closer three wide with
the eventual winner on his outside through the turn, had no more to offer by the quarter pole and was one paced in the five path down the lane to settle for a
minor role. SPARKLET co-trailed on the inside in the early going, was in last around the turn, swung out widest in the eight path for the drive but could not
get into contention driving to the wire. ROAR OF THE CROWD travelled on the rail in the second tier down the backstretch, was shuffled back on the fence
with three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide turning for home but could not get involved down the stretch. IF YOU INSIST pressed the issue to
begin, poked his head in front for a moment between foes at the half, maintained a slim lead while hounded outside by rivals around the bend, was collared
outside at the quarter pole and folded on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HURRICANE CLAIR stalked the pacesetter from outside, took closer order leaving the turn, put a short head in front at the quarter pole but met a
determined competitor, dueled nearly the length of the stretch then edged away late. STORMCAST quickly took charge, set the pace inside in the clear but
under restraint, was headed at the top of the stretch, dug in and dueled till late before yielding grudgingly. SACCHARINE settled outside at the rear, moved
out from three to five wide while advancing on the turn, fought on for show honors in deep stretch. MY GIRL DELLA stalked from outside the second flight,
was mostly three to four wide on the turn, dueled in the stretch but was outfinished for third. A LITTLE FRISKY was held up between runners two to three
wide at the rear, ran on in the stretch. VUCCHELLA tracked up close inside on or just off the rail, lacked the needed late kick. QUALITY PRESENCE shifted
in early, saved ground inside, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PEJA DU took control on the rail from the onset, opened up on the field around the first turn, was unchallenged while up top dictating terms along the
backside and kept on going in the stretch with no challengers in sight at the wire. SAILOR'S PASSION trailed into the first turn, advanced on the fence along
the backstretch, made a smart move on the rail with three eighths to run improving position around the far turn, skimmed the fence turning for home and
closed in to best the rest. A ROSE FOR RAVEN had a tracking position inside rivals down the backstretch, moved in closer to chase the frontrunning winner
on the final turn, posed no threat for the win by upper stretch, dueled for the place share to the wire but just lost out in deep stretch. CLASSY WHISPER
tracked outside down the back straight, was scrubbed on three wide going the wrong way at the three furlong pole and determinedly resurged inside foes by
mid-stretch to get up to settle on the fringes in the end. MEDIA SENSATION was situated in midfield in the two path in the early stages of the race, was hard
ridden making no headway midway around the far turn but did show some run to pass a couple of tired foes outside down the stretch. AVOMAN travelled
four wide close to the back of the pack into the first turn, stalked in the two path making no improvement down the backside, offered a brief run three wide
around the turn to be in range in five wide at the top of the lane but had nothing more to offer in the stretch drive. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was content to
watch the pacesetter between foes down the backside, tried to keep pace being urged with runners on both sides through the far turn but had no more to
give and weakened in the two path in upper stretch. TOO MUCH TALK travelled five wide outside near the rear into the first of two turns, settled four deep
along the backside but made no progress, continued the overland journey in the five path outside foes making no impact in the final bend and emptied out in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN LAD was four deep in mid-division down the backstretch, began to start a run, edging closer midway on the turn, angled out six wide grinding
between horses closing in by mid-stretch, found another gear with runners on both sides with a furlong from the wire and prevailed in the long stretch drive
to just get the nod at the finish line with that gritty performance. ARABIAN PRINCE travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail, started to mount a rally
shifted out, three wide passing foes at the three-furlong pole, angled out eight wide picking up speed in upper stretch, but was denied by the winner in a
lengthy stretch battle in the final furlong. THE GREAT OZ broke in on the start, settled in mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, kept an even
pace while on the rail throughout the turn, began to reach for more ground in the four path in upper stretch while dueled for the place share and finished up
willingly late to capture the show money. FOREST BUZZ chased the speedy pacesetter down the back straight, caught up to the leader to poke his head in
front outside with three furlongs remaining, opened up mildly with three sixteenths from the prize but faded on the rail in the final seventy yards to settle on
the fringes. PAINTTHETOWNSILVER stalked three deep ahead of a few rivals down the backside, narrowed the margin but could not improve position
through the turn, angled out in the nine path for the drive, found his best stride late and closed in smartly in deep stretch. SOUPER DORMY was forced in
on the break bumping the inside runner, tracked the lead duo three deep down the backstretch, settled outside in the third tier around the turn, made a quick
move to be in the hunt four wide at the quarter pole, could not continue the rally and stalled between foes at the furlong pole. MOON LANDING was pinched
between rivals on the break, settled close to the back of the pack in the beginning, saved ground on the fence keeping pace on the turn, tried to rally on the
rail at the quarter pole, shifted outside in the five path at the eighth pole and finished up one paced in deep stretch. PENNER ASH (IRE) stalked near the
rear, ahead of one rival for the early parts of the race, angled out four wide for the drive to the wire but failed to menace in the stretch running. READY
SHAKESPEARE trailed in the early stages of the race and showed a little interest to pass some tired ones in the final furlong. ROYAL QUALITY broke out to
begin, settled on the rail watching the front pair in the beginning, tracked inside in the third flight around the bend but failed to fire, having no finish in the
lane two wide down the stretch. THERE'S NO JOE was knocked off stride by the outside rival on the break, recovered while hustled for better forward
position down the backstretch to keep a close eye on the front two down the backstretch, moved in through the turn to loom three wide with five sixteenths
from the wire, angled out seven wide for the stretch run but faltered between horses at the three sixteenths marker. BOLD RELOAD broke in on the start,
took control setting a swift pace with the wind along the backside, dueled inside losing the lead with three furlongs to go and had no more to give, backing
away on the fence through the field in mid-stretch.
