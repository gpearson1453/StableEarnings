MISS DE BUY stalked the pace three or four wide and lacked a closing bid. MAGIC IN A HAT was not a threat racing out from the rail. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS
dueled on the early lead outside the winner and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
KENHEDOIT rallied four and five wide in the turn, bid six wide turning for home to move clear and drew off under steady handling. MR. BIG SHOT forced
the pace outside BUMPY GAME early then continued willingly but could not go with the winner while just saving the place. P R WHY NOT dropped back
early three wide, angled out in the lane and rallied to just miss the place. PAISANO JIM just off the leaders three wide early, remained in reach but lacked a
final closing bid. BUMPY GAME showed speed from three wide to late in the turn and weakened. PICKELJUICE was just off the pace four wide to the lane
and weakened. TIZ BRIGHTER was along the inside early and dropped back through the turn.
