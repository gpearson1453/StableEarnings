Footnotes
RAZZLE RED perfect position to far turn, angled out full of run and cleared off under steady handling to the wire. KATE'S CONCERTO inside speed
between horses, led to stretch, outkicked late. JUNOESQUE saved ground to far turn with no speed, steadied stretch showed. HALCYON DAYS ran up first
turn outside angled in backstretch, ran on even wide. RAISON D'AMOUR raced along evenly throughout with no response when needed. JOIA RARA
pressed pace off rail to far turn, leveled off from far turn. AUNTJOBUSINESS saved ground to no avail. JOYFUL CROWN (IRE) never reached contention
throughout. DON'T TOUCH ME (IRE) close up off rail throughout, gave in grudgingly in late stretch. KITTEN'S TEMPER never menaced with an off rail trip.
