Footnotes
LADIDA sat off a busy first flight up the backstretch off the inside, tipped out four wide when moving on that group late in the turn, outside bid, edged clear
and held sway under firm handling. NO FAKE also settled behind the leaders early while along the rail inside the winner, moved off the inside far turn,
angled out and was five wide into the stretch, rallied but could not get to the aforementioned victress late, clearly second best. SKY BUY with the pace on
the outside in the run up the backstretch, vied up front four wide through the turn, vied through upper stretch inside the winner, could not match that one or
the runner up late, saved the show. RED RIVER SUSI back off the pace while well out in the strip up the backstretch, five wide into the lane, carried seven
wide into the stretch, finished up mildly to be gaining for the show. KENTUCKY REIGN vied up front while in the two path and between horses, began to
weaken late in the turn, continued to fade through the lane. TIZ D AMAZIN LADY failed to make much of an impact while racing off the inside. CHARLIZE
CHUB broke with the field, fell back in the three path the opening quarter, asked along midway on the turn, failed to respond while being fanned six wide into
the stretch. ROSEMARY POTATOES with the pace while three wide and between horses, weakened late in the turn. PINK SUNSET off a step slow, trailed
most of the way to be always outrun. FACE IT ALONE moved up to flash early speed along the inside, was finished after three furlongs while remaining
closest to the rail.

Footnotes
VODKATINI off the early pace outside, four wide into the first turn, closer before a half, reeled in the leader from the outside late in the final turn, quickly
clear into the lane, extended that advantage to the wire under token urging to win ridden out. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL gained command soon after the start,
showed the way through the first turn off the inside, attempted to rate through a somewhat lively set of early fractions, clear into the far turn, offered little
resistance to the winner late in that bend, stayed on to narrowly hold the place. ALWAYS CONNECTED broke well, allowed the runner up to go while racing
inside, continued in even fashion up the backstretch, moved out around a tiring rival far turn, came three wide for the drive, late bid for the place, outkicked.
MY BOSS LADY void of speed while racing off the inside, continued to race back, improved slightly in the drive after the issue had been decided while never
a threat. SHE SO COOL remained back while toward the inside in lacking a rally. NURSE RACHETT moved up to race closest to the runner up through the
first turn, chased that one up the backstretch then stopped in the far turn.

Footnotes
PASSING BAYOU broke out to bother outer foes, forwardly placed from the start, dueled into and through the turn, shook off that rival late in the bend,
came three wide for the drive, shrugged off a mild bid from the runner up nearing the furlong grounds, clear again late under firm handling. REECE'S
DRAMA lacked early foot while off the inside, improved inside of rivals turning for home, kept coming to be up for the place, not a serious threat to the
winner. QUICK RECOVERY broke sharp, relinquished the advantage to the two leaders before a quarter, moved closer four wide and outside the winner
turning for home, angled to the inside, remained in a challenging position past the furlong marker then could do little more, caught late for the place.
STELLA D'AMORE one paced behind the leaders just off the inside early, angled out four wide turning for home, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing
punch. SPIN THE MOON back off the pace toward the inside early, angled out and came five wide for the drive, also lacked a serious closing kick. IMA
SILVER LADY bothered and pushed out at the start, raced outside, five wide into the lane, remained back. LIZZIESLUCKYPENNY bothered at the start
when the winner broke out, was used some to move with that one to the front, dueled into the turn outside that same rival, gave way late in the bend and
continued to back up through the stretch, jogged across.

Footnotes
SECRET ZIPPER broke running, set the pace while off the inside, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, extended that advantage while in hand turning
for home while remaining in the three path, roused when the runner up moved closer upper stretch, fully extended late to hold that rival safe. P J'S SONG
void of early foot, steady advance, three wide exiting the final turn when closest to the winner, continued to slowly close the gap past the furlong marker,
could not get close enough to seriously challenge that rival in the run to the wire, clearly second best. CARENTAN within striking distance while racing
toward the inside, remained forward through the final turn and into the stretch, lacked a winning response in the drive. GANADO lacked speed toward the
rail, continued one paced throughout, improved position only slightly. HYTECK PRINCE stumbled at the start, raced back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while not posing a serious threat. ZIHUATANEJO moved up after the start to press the winner from the outside into and through the first turn, continued to
apply pressure up the backstretch, gave way far turn. SAISIR LE JOUR fell back to trail after the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
SOUPER ROYAL MOON away in good order from the outside, cleared in the first turn, rated in showing the way up the backstretch in the two path through
some modest fractions, extended that advantage bit through the final bend, maintained daylight past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up
safe late. LAW OF THE JUNGLE void of early foot, began to move closer through some traffic before a half, swung out five wide when being called on for
some run late in the final turn, managed to slowly be getting to that rival late. DURKIN'S CALL behind the second flight while toward the inside, steered out
and raced with that ground while four wide behind the winner exiting the final bend, went mildly to the wire to gain the show, not a threat to the top pair.
SECRETARY AT WAR bobbled at the start, recovered to race in the second flight while racing closest to the inside, stayed on contend for the show, missed
that position while gaining the nod for the fourth spot. VISUAL ARTIST in the second group while between horses, remained within striking distance late in
the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do nothing with that one, faltered in the late going to lose a couple of positions. BAHAMA
CHANNEL four wide first turn, raced in the second flight up the backstretch, between horses and inside the runner up turning into the stretch, had little left
for the run to the wire. GIVE IT A GO fell back to trail before a half to be outrun. CHIEF ALPHA was never involved, fell further back stretch to be well
beaten.

TWO BY TWO behind the pace, asked for some run second turn in the three path, closer into the lane, challenged outside the leader nearing the furlong
marker, spirited duel to the wire, finally wore that foe down while fully extended to be narrowly up at the wire. COLLECTION DAY forwardly placed while
three wide through the first turn, vied while between horses second turn, gained the advantage into the lane, joined by the winner from the outside
approaching midstretch, proved very stubborn to the wire to narrowly miss. CURLINGTON off a step slow, continued to lag in racing well back up the
backstretch, began to wind up far turn, came four wide when advancing into the stretch, angled in but could not get to the top pair. KOBLA MAS also off a
step slow, trailed well back while five wide onto the backstretch, continued void of any early speed, four to five wide through the final bend, remained widest
through the drive to improve position. STYNER set or forced the pace while off the inside, continued to vie far turn closest to the rail, had little left for the
stretch run. MY DANNY BOY away in good order, pace factor inside for five furlongs, began to give way far turn, continued to fade. COLLECT FROM IKE
four wide when off the pace through the first turn, advanced with an outside middle move to vie three wide into the far turn, commenced to weaken midway
on the bend and also continued to retreat through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER CONSTITUTION back off the pace while outside, fanned six wide when moving closer turning into the stretch, steered in, challenged inside the
leader and was up late under clever handling. TIE BREAKER closest to the dueling leaders up the backstretch and into the turn, collared that pair three wide
entering the stretch, showed the way past the furlong when exhibiting good mettle, gave ground reluctantly to the winner late in a solid effort. PISTOL OR
SHOTGUN void of speed for three furlongs, came five wide for the drive, roused, responded and finished up willingly to be coming too late while widest of
the first flight at the wire. STRIKING SPEED lacked speed, advanced behind the runner up out of the turn in the four path, raced right off that one with a
furlong to run, lacked the needed closing punch. BARGAINING POWER broke well from the outside to briefly help show the way early, fell back off the other
speed, reengaged that one into the turn, dueled on the outside then gave way in the drive. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND broke well while widest, cleared to the
inside, dueled into and through most of the turn, faltered in the drive. ZAVA finished early, fell further and further back, jogged in.

Footnotes
KELLY'S PARTY GIRL was off to a slow start, four then five wide around the turn, bid between runners upper stretch, in an all out battle to the wire,
prevailed under a strong drive. STEPHANIE MY LOVE off the duel and three wide into the turn, bid between leaving the quarter pole, fought on gamely to
the wire. OUT OF LUCK off to a very slow start, trailed the field leaving the quarter pole, shifted out nine deep in upper stretch, rallied to the wire. HAPPY
TAPPY TIM off duel and between runners, bid leaving the three eighths pole, under a head of steam was steadied nearing the quarter pole, regained
momentum when blocked nearing the furlong marker, quickly angled inside and finished willingly to the wire. BETWEEN DREAMS raced off the pace and
inside, ground saving trip around the bend, battled inside through the stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN HEART raced mid pack and off
the duel, urged along around the turn, between runners under a drive in the lane, leveled off late. R AVERIE LYNN dueled outside to the quarter pole, under
pressure from both sides weakened through the stretch. LARAMORE dueled inside to the quarter pole, lost ground leaving the quarter pole, and gave way
through the lane.
