RUMOURS FLY settled off the early leaders, moved up on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch proved best.
FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch but was
outfinished. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER was unhurried early and had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. BETKA
set the pace but chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. SILENT WARNING was in touch early but lost ground
on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TAPROOM stalked the early leader, took command on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SUPER HONEY
TIMBER was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. MAIKEN THE VIKING settled off
the pace and moved up on the far turn but needed more in deep stretch. BEYOND OSCAR was unhurried early and roused on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch was all out. IMPECCABLE TIMING was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. SPECTACULAR FORCE was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. DAISYCREST
was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but had no rally. FULCRA was in mid pack and was a factor on the far turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch weakened. WICKEN CENTS tracked the early leaders from the outside and had a good position on the far turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch faded. J M R SWEET ESME set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
