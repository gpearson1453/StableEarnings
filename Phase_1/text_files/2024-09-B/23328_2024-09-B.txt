Footnotes
DR RENDEZVOUS angled in early and rated the pace inside, kept the edge over MY BUDDY DUANE leaving the seven sixteenths pole, cleared that one at
the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. The latter was bumped off stride early then stalked the winner from the three path, challenged
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back off the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. EXCLUSIVE ORIGINAL was forced inward and
checked off the inside flank of Dog Town Allen and made contact with My Buddy Duane then settled off the rail, moved to the outside into the backstretch
and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and dug in to hold third. WHY WINCHILL WHY raced well back saving
early ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. MALEKES MAGIC
settled inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride. SWISS LEGACY rated
close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and flattened in the lane. RIDE THE BRAND was
unprepared for the start and raced three wide the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then
weakened. ASTRAYAL raced inside the first turn, showed little response and rounded the far turn about the six path. COLONIAL ROAD raced in the five
path the first turn and was not a factor. DOG TOWN ALLEN was forced in shortly after the start, rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn.

raced at the rail on the turn then kept on the bit through the lane. BOLD ROCK ducked sharply in leaving the gate then engaged in close early chase, raced
off the rail on the turn and settled for second best. BOLD DESERT broke a step slow then picked up the chase, raced two deep on the turn and came along
for third later yards. SWIFT WATERS chased, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. FORBIDDEN SPIRIT broke sharply and had a
brief early lead, gave close chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded near the rail on the turn. MY FATHER'S SON broke a step slow then gave
chase to no avail. SAPPHIRUS broke a step slow and never factored. LEMMEHOLDWHATYAGOT saved ground.

dueled clear toward mid-stretch and was steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. MOVING PICTURES rated a short lead inside, kept the advantage
over Always Gambling from the half mile pole, was met at the rail nearing the quarter and dug in from that point, but dropped back mid-stretch and had to
settled for second best. BURTON WAY raced in the five path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. ROAD SLEW rated close, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the
rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. PERSONABLE came away awkwardly and scraped the stall gate, raced in the six path the first turn, left the
turn outside and rounded the far turn in the five path. MOON FALL settled back in the three path and never factored. ON A WHIM stalked off the rail the first
turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch.

yards and dueled clear nearing the wire. HOPPING HENRY chased through the backstretch and raced close off the rail on the turn, altered course from
behind rivals mid-stretch and finished well to take second under the wire. FURREAL pressured the pace through the backstretch and contested even terms
two deep on the turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened stride late and was nipped from second under the wire. GOLDEN KEY set a
pressured pace inside, contested even terms at the rail on the turn, was met entering the stretch and flattened stride late. MATH MAN MARCO chased
through the backstretch, steadied off the inside flank of Youthinkthatsfunny in the four path past the quarter pole then weakened leaving the turn.
AMIDSHIPS saved ground. FIBER STRONG was unprepared then lunged leaving the gate, chased outside and raced in the five path on the turn. COLT
ROCK gave chase and rounded the turn in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
TIZ VINNO stalked from the four path the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dug in
determinedly leaving the turn and inched clear nearing the wire. CELTIC REVIVAL rated the pace off the rail, kept the edge over Tiz Vinno leaving the three
eighths pole and came under pressure past the five sixteenths, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dueled gamely to mid-stretch before
ceding; reluctantly. THE MONEY MACHINE settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three
path on the far turn and dug in to hold third. VINO DOLCE saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. SISTER SPIRIT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. WAVERLEY rated close inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn toward the outside and
showed little response. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.
