Footnotes
PALS WILD LIBERTY broke out at the start and was off slowly, rushed up and chased the pace two wide along the turn, made a quick move to vie for the
lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command and drew away under hand urging in the late stages. TOMMY'S UP chased the early pace from the
inside, angled three wide into upper stretch, was no match for his stablemate in deep stretch and ran on to secure second. WALEN LILLY hustled away
from the start, disputed the early pace outside of DREAMINGFORAFEATURE, vied for the lead into the stretch, could not match strides with the top two in
deep stretch and held for third. LIKA DAGGER checked on the run into the turn, chased the pace heading to the top of the stretch, gained ground into the
lane, could not sustain that run in the late stages and flattened out. DREAMINGFORAFEATURE contested the early pace from the inside, battled into the
stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and faded. BILLS STREAKIN got squeezed at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace from the
outside entering the turn, came four wide into the stretch and could not muster a late rally.

Footnotes
MISTER WU rated nicely off of the early pace while never far back, stalked four wide along the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command and
kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held in a drive at the wire. MICKEYS TRAIL lacked early speed and
trailed into the turn, swung widest into upper stretch, closed well in the late stages, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in in the
final strides and bested the rest. BEETHOVEN J pressed the early pace three wide and between rivals, chased MISTER WU into upper stretch, was
outkicked in the final sixteenth and was a clear third. J M BIG BOY tracked the early pace from the inside, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran evenly
to the furlong marker, lacked a final response and finished evenly. EVERYBODY KNOWS chased the early pace from the second flight, was well placed
while three to four wide nearing the top of the lane, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. RECKLESS HOT ROD prominent away
from the start, pressed the early pace inside of rivals heading into the turn, disputed the decent pace along the turn and took a narrow lead nearing the
quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. GRAND MARKING hustled away from the start, went up and contested the
decent early pace two wide and between rivals, pressed between rivals heading to the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the late
stages.

Footnotes
OTTOMAN EMPIRE hustled away from the start, stalked the early pace from the outside and was well placed approaching the turn, vied for the lead into
upper stretch, took command and dug in into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held well for the win in the late stages.
INDIAN NIGHTS bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to track the early pace from between rivals, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel in OTTOMAN EMPIRE and was second best.
LET THERE BE PEACE settled off of the early pace, raced wide along the turn and came five to six wide into the stretch, briefly steadied into upper stretch,
could not muster the needed late response but stayed on into deep stretch and got up for third. ABETEMARCO hustled away from the start, disputed the
early pace outside of STORMIN ATTILA approaching the turn, took command along the bend and set the pace off of the rail nearing the quarter marker, met
the bid of OTTOMAN EMPIRE into upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth, yielded in deep stretch and was outfinished for
third. AARON WHO raced close up to the early pace, tracked three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response at mid-stretch and tired in the
drive. STOREY'S FURY broke out then was bumped at the start and was off slowly, raced on a hold in the early stages, trailed into the turn and did not
factor in the stretch. STORMIN ATTILA showed good early speed away from the start, disputed the pace from the inside heading to the turn, lost position
nearing the quarter pole and faded in the stretch drive.

way into the stretch, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth and held sway. ZAPPIN chased the early pace from the outside, was guided four to
five wide nearing the quarter marker, closed in the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides for second. MARQUEE'S STORM stalked the pace three

wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked the needed late response. EMMYS SILVER bobbled at the start, lacked early speed
and trailed into the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. JASMINE BABY hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly,
rushed up and tracked the early pace from the inside, saved ground to the quarter marker, shifted four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace past the

Footnotes
MONIKER prominent away from the start, disputed the early pace between rivals heading to the turn, set contested fractions nearing the quarter pole,
battled a stubborn LEAVE THEM BEHIND into the stretch, repelled that rival into the final sixteenth and determinedly kept to task in deep stretch.
AMERICAN SOLO allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and closed
willingly into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and got up in time for second. LEAVE THEM BEHIND forwardly placed away
from the start, pressed the solid early pace four then three wide nearing the turn, contested the pace outside of MONIKER nearing the quarter pole, battled
into the stretch and stubbornly pressured MONIKER into the final sixteenth, grudgingly gave way in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while
holding for third. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE raced close up to the solid early pace, chased the leading pair three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. READS PET ZENON took back off of the solid early pace, trailed while three to four wide
nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and mounted a mild late rally. DISTORTED GUY hustled away from the start, assumed early
command and set a contested pace heading to the turn, lost position and chased to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and gave
way. HARRYS CHANCE stumbled at the start then was bumped by an outer rival leaving the break and was off slowly, saved ground into the turn and did
not factor in the stretch drive. SNOW BOOTS tracked the solid early pace from the inside, drifted out and was hard to place into the turn, was outrun to the
quarter pole and did not threaten in the stretch drive. SHAME ON WHISKEY took back off of the solid early pace, tracked three to four wide along the turn
and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
SEXY DEXY broke alertly, vied for the early lead away from the start, ceded the front and stalked the moderate pace three wide heading to the turn, re-bid
at the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command at the furlong marker, dug in under firm urging and edged away in deep stretch to
prove best. TEXAS BAD BOY prominent away from the start, engaged with BLUEGRASS FAITH and disputed the early pace inside of that rival, dueled
through moderate fractions into the turn and gamely battled into upper stretch, lost the lead at the furlong marker but fought on into the final sixteenth, was
outfinished in deep stretch and held well in the end for second. DUBRONSKY tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, was well placed while
two to three wide along the turn, ran evenly into the stretch, closed well in the late stages and just missed for second, while getting up in time for third.
BLUEGRASS FAITH prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead and disputed the pace between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, dueled
TEXAS BAD BOY into the turn and pressed the pace between runners nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, yielded in the final sixteenth and
was outfinished for the minor awards. KIRBY DERBY a bit slow into stride away from the start, tracked the moderate early pace while saving ground,
maintained an inside path into the stretch and mounted a mild late rally. LUCK IN MY EYES settled off of the moderate early pace, tracked between rivals
heading to the turn, raced two to three wide nearing the quarter pole and offered a mild bid in the final furlong. SIR FLATTER broke out at the start and was
off slowly, trailed in the early stages, was guided three to four wide along the turn, swung six wide for the stretch drive and could not muster a late rally.
OFFENSIVE chased the moderate early pace from the outside, went three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly while in pursuit into the
stretch, could not find a late response and tired in the final sixteenth.
