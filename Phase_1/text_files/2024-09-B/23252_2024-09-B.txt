Footnotes
MOONLIGHT VISION was racing mid pack in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground quickly and ran up behind horse,
hesitated a minute looking for room, shifted out into the eight path at the quarter pole, was asked and responded well closing down the stretch, made up
ground even after having to go wide, challenged the front runners nearing the wire, passed rivals with a full head of steam and took the win. WICKED ICE
stalked the pace, traveled in the four path, launched a bid at the three eights pole, shifted into the five path at the five sixteenth pole, split rival entering the
upper stretch, moved back into the two path, was gaining fast, split the front runners late, had a rival to the far outside but could not do any more and
finished a game second. ELYANNA stalked the pace setters from the four path, shifted out six wide at the five sixteenth pole, maintained position, hooked a
fast closing outside runner in late stretch, went with her, raced up between rivals, but could not get the advantage over the rival she went with and settled for
third. ST. JOE JET stalked the pace from the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground, shifted out into the six path at the quarter
pole. PRACTICAL VALE vied for the lead, raced on the outside of two other rivals as she helped set a pressured pace, raced three wide, into the stretch,
then shuffled back. JULIANNA'S RUBY was off a step slow and trailed early, found her stride and started moving after the half, was engaged and hitting on
all cylinders after the three eights pole but had too much to do. BARBARESCO BABY vied for the lead, raced in between rivals as she helped set a
pressured pace, then gave way. LITTLE CARLEY vied for the lead, secured her rail spot, saved ground through out, set a pressured pace as she had two
other rivals trying to lead as well, cut the corner moving into the stretch and came out of the turn near the lead, battled in the lane, faltered late. AIR FORCE
BABE was humped at the start, raced mid pack in the four path, then stopped. FORTUNE DREAMS was off a step slow and was never involved.

IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) inherited the lead, raced on the rail, backed up the pace, sat chilly, cued at the eighth pole, drew off like a big mare for the win.
GREY PRINCESS stalked the winner from the rail, started pushing at the half mile pole, chased down the stretch, was second best. LINNY KATE stalked
the front runner, raced on the rail, improved, shifted to the two path and raced in between rivals, launched a bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the
top two. DUBSTEP was off a step sow, raced four wide, advanced into a stalking position, launched a bid at the quarter pole, was under a drive entering the
upper stretch but to no avail. LALOBA FEROZ trailed while racing in the two path but showed little.

Footnotes
DRINK N WINK stalked a determined front runner form the two path, was given rein at the half mile pole, gained ground, continued to gain through the turn,
drew next to the early leader by the quarter pole, galloped past that rival and led into the stretch, threw his ears up and willingly finished strong gaining the
win. MISTER COOPER raced in the middle of the field, raced on the rail, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, was approaching the early leaders
nearing the upper stretch, shifted into the four path, traveled the whole stretch on his left lead, but still finished second. LAST RUN stalked the front runners,
raced in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, improved position, gained ground, was threatening in upper stretch, caught one, then was
caught himself with nothing left. HE'S A COMMISIONER trailed early on, raced three wide, started moving at the half, launched a bid at the three eighths
pole, shifted eight wide into the upper stretch, but had no late kick. PRINCE DAVID vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace then tired. ICONIC
ROCK raced mid pack, traveled in the four path then faded.

bid and challenged for the lead by the quarter pole, led after the eighth pole, raced the last sixteenth of a mile under no pressure, drawing off for the win.

past the three eighths pole, shook one, hugged the rail and entered the stretch in good position, battled until the eighth pole, lost the winner ,but out finished
the rest for second. GULLFAXI vied for the lead , raced in the two and three path and in between rivals, launched a bid and took the lead just after the
quarter pole but was quickly caught and had to battle in the stretch, battled until the eights pole then gave way to the first two. RED HAIRED GAL raced off
