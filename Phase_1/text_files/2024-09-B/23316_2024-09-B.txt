Footnotes
NON TOXIC prompted the early pace from the inside then took the lead near the half mile marker and drew clear on the turn to prove best. ORO dueled for
the early lead from two wide before being overtaken by NON TOXIC near the half mile marker then continued to match strides inside of ALL MY VICES
while chasing the leader to deep stretch then edged away to be second best. ALL MY VICES dueled for the early lead from three wide but was overtaken by
NON TOXIC before the half mile marker but continued to match strides outside of ORO while chasing the leader to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly.
ILLUSIONED was void of the early speed and trailed the field by many lengths to the top of the stretch then made a late gain for the show.

HARD TO COME BY stalked the pace down the backstretch and saved ground around the turn but lacked running room on the rail near the quarter pole
then swung three wide in upper stretch and cruised to the wire. BIG JACK prompted the pace before engaging the lead and taking a brief lead near the
quarter pole but was overtaken quickly by HARD TO COME BY and chased that on home. ATHENS MOON raced off the pace from three wide through the
turn then tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response and was along for the show. UNCLE JUJU showed good early speed while
saving ground around the turn but was eclipsed at the top of the stretch and tired.

FLYING LADY sprinted to a clear lead to the top of the stretch where she was headed and matched strides with STAND BY TIME but she dug in to come
again and prevail. STAND BY TIME prompted the pace from two wide through the turn then moved to engage the leader and battled down the stretch but
was outkicked in the final yards. FLATTER ME ZEN raced off the pace on the inside but lacked room near the quarter pole and was empty in the stretch
drive. KONA KINLEY stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then dropped back and was outrun.

BRICKBAT was unhurried down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn and ran down the leader in deep stretch to be up in the final
jumps. OREGON COUNTY was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then was asked midway through the turn and slipped
through at the top of the stretch to take the lead near the eighth pole but was denied in the final jumps. PRINCE OF LUCK sprinted away to the lead from
four or five wide down the backstretch, tipped in around the turn but floated out going into the stretch and drifted out in the drive and gave way. BIG BIZ
sprinted away to press the pace from five wide down the backstretch moved in on the turn but was forced back out to race wide in the stretch and tired.
PAYNTER'S BOY was unhurried while saving ground to no avail.
