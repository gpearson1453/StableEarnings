BEAUTY OF THE NILE set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path into the lane, opened up and widened on the field near the eighth pole under a
steady drive. PRINCESA CELINA stalked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane, made a bid for place down the lane while no match for the
winner late. KENDAL GRACE came in and bothered foe down the backstretch while chasing the early pace, raced in the two path into the lane, made a bid
down the lane for place but weakened late in the drive. JUDY ELAINE chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off late in the
stretch run. WICKED FROST chased the pace early from the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. SASSY AND
BOLD was never a threat. LANDY was never a factor. FRANGO ELECTRICO clipped heels and lost the rider down the backstretch, walked off after the
race. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY KENDAL GRACE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERING WITH FRANGO ELECTRICO
ALONG THE BACKSTRETCH.
