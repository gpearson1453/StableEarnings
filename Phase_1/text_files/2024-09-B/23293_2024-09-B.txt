BRITTANYSGLDNFAITH settled inside, bid on the far turn, drew off in the stretch and was kept to task while gearing down late. ITZFOREVER saved
ground, angled four wide at the quarter pole for running room, rallied but was no threat. NO MORE FAKE NEWS saved ground and proved no match.
FOREVER PINK stalked the pace in the two path, bid in the four path at the quarter pole but had no closing bid. TIZ BAYOU bore out at the start, quickly
shot to the lead and went to the two path, then gave way at the quarter pole. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE stalked the pace in the two path but faded in the
stretch. WILDCATJUSTICE was through early. EVIL INTENTIONS hopped at the start, raced in the five wide on the far turn and faded. NO TRUST was not
a factor. UNBRIDLED TALENT stalked the pace in the three path and gave way at the three-eighths pole.
