a steady gain and drew off late. HURRICANE DUDE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin while unchallenged, then was no
match the final sixteenth and held the place. WHISKEY OR WINE well placed and off the rail, moved up into the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch and had a mild late gain. HOLLYWOOD HERO unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the
stretch, drifted in and evened out. TORREFACTOR void of speed, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. MY DUDE BILLY well placed, steadily lost ground. SHADY BOY was no factor.

THE CONNECTOR led in the early going, rated close up, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, angled out, made a steady
gain and edged up in the final strides. ENJOY THE MUSIC well placed, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, closed
willingly and edged up in the final strides for the place. STANHOPE sprinted away in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the final yards, then
weakened and held the show. GUACO stumbled at the start, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a
share. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, then closed well late, missing a share.

Footnotes
HE'S ON THE FLY stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed well for the
place. EXTRA MEDIUM tracked the pace, angled out and moved to position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then could not sustain the bid and held the show. BEACH HOLIDAY unhurried, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked, waited, got through inside for a share. UNCLE JOCK mid pack, moved up on the two path
through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and evened out the final furong. CREATIVE CHOICE ran evenly. SAMURAI LEGACY set the pace off the
rail, shook clear through the turn, stayed on when challenged, then faded late. MUTTLEY well placed and inside, lost some ground on the two path through
the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
