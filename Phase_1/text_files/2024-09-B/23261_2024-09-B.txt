ORPHAN SANDY vied outside of BOBULINSKI for the lead around the first turn and into early backstretch, shook free to a slim lead near the half mile
marker, led the way under pressure from STUMPY'S LOVE SONG around the far turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch, fought on gamely holding a
slim lead in the final furlong, refused to let rival get by and held firm. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG tracked the top pair around the first turn and into early
backstretch, raced just off ORPHAN SANDY around the far turn, hustled along two wide turning for home, raced in striking distance down the lane, fought
hard but could not get by the game winner. EDGY LOVER was well reserved racing in the back through early stages, picked up the pace three wide around
the final turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane and ran along for a share. BOBULINSKI vied for the lead with the eventual winner around the first turn and
into early backstretch, came up empty near the half mile marker and steadily retreated.

FIVE CHARLIE vied for the lead in opening stages, briefly sat just off rival then moved back up to engage CASH'S PAL for the lead entering the turn,
matched strides past the quarter pole then shook free at the head of the lane, came under pressure from BAXTER in the stretch, fought on gamely and
refused to let stable-mate get by. BAXTER raced in early contention then was ridden along three wide around the turn, moved up to race in striking range of
FIVE CHARLIE in the stretch, dug in with good response but could not get by game winner. HOORAY tracked the early pace along the inside, tipped two
wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest. CASH'S PAL vied with FIVE CHARLIE holding a slight edge soon after the start and around
the turn, could not move on with rival at the head of the lane and retreated. WAGON POWER was not far back racing three wide mid-way around the turn
then faded in the lane. MULTIFACTOR broke inward at the start, raced in range along the inside, flattened around the turn and continued to falter through
the lane.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT COLORS tracked the top pair three wide, vied outside of LIBERTYS HAULEWR around the final turn, continued to battle outside of rival down
the lane, fought gamely and edged ahead late. LIBERTY'S HAULER was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, engaged
OBVIOUSLY TOO for the lead entering the far turn, began to edge away from rival while taking on the challenge of BRILLANT COLORS, drifted out turning
for home, shifted back in, dueled gamely along the inside but failed to get by late and had to settle for clearly second best. SUBURBAN PRINCE rated off
the pace up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn, ran on and secured a share. APOLLO BAY lacked speed and trailed the field, saved
ground and passed a couple faders. OBVIOUSLY TOO set the early pace, vied around the far turn then tired in the drive. FLOOR IT raced in range near the
inside up the backstretch, failed to advance around the far turn and retreated in the lane.
