Footnotes
A SHAWTOWN GIRL was unhurried early, rallied seven-wide into the stretch and finished with a rush to be up in the final sixteenth. KITTY OF WAR was
reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late. BUGGED OUT
raced in the middle of the field early while four-wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole then angled out again nearing the sixteenth pole and finished in a
mild rally. SANDI SUE vied with ADE for the lead while two-wide to the stretch and weakened late. GOLDEN PHILLY was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. VANAKA settled in the middle of the field early, came six-wide into the stretch and went evenly. ADE vied with
SANDI SUE for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired. LONGA GO GO dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to
seriously threaten. UPTOWN MISS hopped at the start then raced two-wide and failed to menace. STRONG DECISION was unhurried early, came
three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SANDY GIRL saved ground tracking the pace and gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
FINGER ROLL was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole then came in nearing the wire and prevailed under
pressure. BALI ROLLING TIDE was allowed to settle early, came two-wide into the stretch, came out to bump with ASPIRING COMEDIAN inside the eighth
pole and finished strongly. ASPIRING COMEDIAN broke in a tangle then was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, came in to bump with BALL
ROLLING TIDE inside the eighth pole then was in tight from between horses nearing the wire and was gaining slightly late. PURE REALIZATION settled in
the middle of the field while racing two-wide, swung out to be five-wide entering the stretch and improved his position late. GRAFT was prominently placed
while racing three-wide, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid but lacked a rally. DIAMOND MESSA prompted the pace while two-wide
to the quarter pole from along the inside and weakened. ARROGANT RIDER saved ground while being unhurried and failed to be a factor. ON THE CHILL
saved ground setting the pressured pace to nearing the quarter pole and tired. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE
STRETCH INVOLVING FINGER ROLL, BALL ROLLING TIDE AND ASPIRING COMEDIAN BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

threes-wide nearing the sixteenth pole and was up with a rush late. REDFIRE was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch then angled out to be
six-wide nearing the sixteenth pole and finished strongly. ERA was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in
a mild rally. QUEEN ROCKET was prominently placed while racing four-wide and finished well in a steady effort. MOST UNUSUAL DAY tracked SAINT
DEVEREAUX while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead entering the stretch and then weakened slightly late. VAI GATTINA was unhurried early,
came seven-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. TARTAN GREEN (IRE) was three-wide while racing in the middle of the pack went evenly. SAINT

Footnotes
LET'S HAVE A PARTY dueled with ENGLISH DADDY from along the outside, shook that one off entering the stretch and gradually increased his
advantage. SKINNY JOEY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. NEVER TILL NOW broke slowly to
get away behind his field then was unhurried, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and rallied late. ENGLISH DADDY dueled with LET'S HAVE A
PARTY to the stretch from along the inside and weakened. RUNNING STATUE was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. GUILTED was in tight from between horses nearing the five-eighths pole and then again nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and
failed to menace. BOBBY ROCKY JAKE saved ground while being allowed to settle but had no response when called upon. BABY ANTONIO bobbled at
the start then dropped back and was not a factor. THE RIDER OF GUILTED LODGED AN INQUIRY AGAINST SKINNY JOEY BUT AFTER VIEWING THE
FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH,

RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW was reserved off the pace, rallied four-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth. A WESTERN YARN stalked the
pace while racing two-wide and finished strongly but was unable to hold off the top one in a game effort. TWO BY TWO was unhurried early, came five-wide
into the stretch and rallied late. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI saved ground setting the pace and held stubbornly during the drive in a steady effort. CLASS
PHOTO was forwardly placed from outset, came three-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. LEGENDAIRE was unhurried early, came two-wide
into the stretch and improved his position. SAISIR LE JOUR settled in the middle of the field and lacked a rally. FATIMA'S BLESSING lacked early speed,
came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. CAP'N DUSTY dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JHIRSCH
was prominent early while three-wide, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a response. TREVESSO settled in the middle of the pack
while three-wide and gave way. SAMYAZA was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, appeared to take a bad step and stumbled nearing the sixteenth
pole the was quickly pulled up and transported off the track via the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
PRINCESS JAVONCIA was in a bit tight inside dropping back along the rail to mid-pack, was off the fence on the far turn, waited briefly at the quarter pole
then angled out seven wide and asked for run, responded to storm to the lead near the eighth pole and draw clear under urging late. DOWNTOWN KATIE
was forced out a bit at the start, taken back and angled in, unhurriedly brought up the rear well back, advanced on the far turn, continued to rally inside
gaining to get within range of the leader but was only second best. A PRIMERA VISTA quickly went to the lead, set the pace from off the rail but shifting in a
bit, was outkicked in the stretch. ONE SILK STOCKING broke out, was caught five then four then three wide in the early going, stalked while up close,
continued three to five wide on the far turn and kept on in the lane but needed more. INANNA'S QUEST was bumped into a rival at the start, had forward
position in the early going two to tthree deep but dropped back racing mid-pack up the backstretch, continued from just off the rail and kept on inside
runners in the stretch. CORINNA was bumped at the start, moved forward racing mid-pack early and off the fence three to four deep, swung eight wide for
the drive, ran on. STERN CHASER bumped a rival at the start, was taken back off the pace tracking inside in behind the leaders, came out for the drive,
failed to rally. PRECIOUS AVARY pressed the pace three deep early, began to weaken turning for home, lugged out in mid-stretch while tiring. PRIYANKA
was forced out a touch at the start, settled in the back half racing outside, steadied on heels near the furlong marker. PURE MAGIC GIRL broke out, angled
in, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
KHOOLZAN vied soon after the start, between runners and pressing the pace around the turn, shifted four wide leaving the quarter pole, battled with outside
rival through the stretch, and shook free very late under a stiff drive. HEAD OF THE CLASS pressed the pace four wide then five wide around the bend,
widest entering the stretch run, fought on gamely outside rival, was out kicked very late to the wire. MATT'S LUCK was off to a very slow start, under a
serious drive around the bend, picked up the tempo through the stretch, and finished willingly to the wire. GOOD AS HE GETS broke a step slow rushed up
to gain position with the lead pack, lost a step rounding the bend, bid inside leaving the quarter pole, in tight nearing the furlong marker and leveled off to the
wire. BE THA JUDGE very fractious at the gate, trailed the field into the turn, finished with interest through the lane. MR LIAM AND ALAN broke very sharp,
took lead around the bend, under pressure from both sides in upper stretch, gave way through the final sixteenth. LITTLE TROUBLE under pressure
between runners while vying for the lead, still under a drive and between around the turn, weakened through the lane. MY LUCKY ACE chased the speed
into the turn, put to task leaving the three eights marker, was unable to sustain bid, and weakened to the wire.
