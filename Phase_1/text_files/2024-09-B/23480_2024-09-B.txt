Footnotes
DARVESH raced off the pace in the second flight around the first turn, chased three wide into the far turn, teed up leaving the three eights pole, continued a
sustained bid into the lane, shifted in nearing the furlong maker then quickly shifted back out around leg weary rival near the sixteenth pole, under a stout
drive was up in time. BALI ROLLING TIDE raced off the pace and along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, angled out and around tiring foe
leaving the quarter pole, shifted back to the inside for the stretch run, and finished gamely to the wire. MAT MATTERS vied in the two path around the first
turn, and down the backside, shook off inside rival around the second bend, went clear in upper stretch, collard by rivals in the final sixteenth tired and
settled for the show. AMANI'S TIGER vied inside in the second flight through the opening half, bid between runners around the far turn, leveled off through
the final furlong. TIO TONY was very slow away from the gate, chased the speed three wide into the far turn, under a drive nearing the quarter pole, had no
late response. SAN ANDRES sent to the front soon after the start, vied inside down the backside and into the far turn, unable to keep pace with leader, gave
way from the quarter pole.
