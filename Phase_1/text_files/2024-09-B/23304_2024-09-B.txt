between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and chased on in the lane. COASTAL WATERS raced in the three
path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and improved position in
the stretch. MARK IN GREELEY chased the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second turn and was
outkicked in the final furlong. SARGE'S SERMON raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the far bend from the four path and weakened in the stretch. CIBERTRUCK raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
came around the far turn still in the four path and made no bid. INESPERADO raced in the three path early, chased the leader on the outside up the

Footnotes
MISS JEOPARDY chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held off a closer
at the wire. DREAM NAP tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the bend, came on again in upper
stretch and gained ground late. MIA BABY raced off the pace on the outside early, was carried out to the six path coming around the bend and improved
position in the lane. O'BABE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the five path, raced into traffic when AMARETTO
DI AMORE drifted into her lane in the stretch and chased on from there. AMARETTO DI AMORE led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way
from the four path coming around the turn, blew the turn coming into the stretch and faded from there while drifting out. SEA LEVEL trailed the field up the
backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
CATRICK saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and held his margin to the finish.
RAMBLINGAMBLINMAN saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the
two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground between horses late. DA GHOST raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the
leader between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the second turn and chased on to the wire. VICTORIOUS VANDA
raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn and
was outkicked late but kept on to the wire. GABRIEL'S LEGEND raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the
four path and improved position in the lane. COMMISSIONER OSCAR raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on
the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and never threatened. WILD TIME saved ground around the first bend, chased the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and weakened in the lane. WHODOESITBETTER hopped up leaving the gate,
raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the three path and was empty from there. RED'S
MR Z trailed well behind the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LADY ASTRID bumped with the horses to both sides and was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader
on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path, began a bid entering the stretch and drew off form there. AUNT ALEX
saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path and improved position in
the lane. MIWOMAN raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far bend still in the three path and improved position
in the stretch. MIZ CALI veered in and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, fought her rider some while
leading the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and weakened in the lane. JEWEL AZUL raced at the back of the pack in
the four path through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the three path and made no bid. DIXIE GIRL TO bumped lightly with the horse to
her inside at the start, recovered to stalk the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path
and tired in the stretch.
