COPPER BO TEN hustled to contest the pace inside to the backstretch, edged away from MISCHIEF MAME nearing the second turn then held driving.
MADAME CAUSEWAY tracked the leaders for three eighths, was outkicked to the stretch but was an easy second. UNBRIDLED VIOLET got outsprinted,
chased to the quarter pole, was two then three wide but weakened in the final furlong. MISCHIEF MAME was used early to battle early with the winner then
got put away by that one into the second turn and gave out. ALY'S NATION had no speed and trailed.

Footnotes
MATTAWA N THAT never far back, bid two wide leaving the quarter pole, responded in the stretch and wore down BOB'S SNIPER late. BOB'S SNIPER set
a pressured pace early, inched away on the backstretch, led into the stretch but could not stall the winner. ANNA'S IRON MAN pressed the pace, was
crowded between horses when SPEEDY TOM drifted in leaving the quarter pole, checked then had a mild bid in the lane. SPEEDY TOM stalked the pace,
drifted inward leaving the quarter pole and crowded ANNA'S IRON MAN the lacked a closing response. POLACCO hopped slightly to begin, had no speed
and was never a threat. The trainer of ANNA'S IROON MAN lodged an objection against MATTAWA N THAT for alleged interference leaving the quarter
pole but it was not allowed by the stewards.

Footnotes
GENERAL THAYER had good speed and contested the pace outside of HASHTAG BAE, edged away from that one on the second turn, dug in through the
drive and held onto a desperate decision. MR MEMPHIS was outsprinted to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then
closed fast but just a hair too late. COUNT ASHER had no speed, settled for three furlongs, bid three wide nearing the furlong marker and found his best
stride late. HASHTAG BAE dueled inside the winner while under pressure from the rider to the quarter pole, saved ground on the far turn but weakened in
the final furlong. BREXTON was also outsprinted early, raced three then four wide, closed the gap to the stretch but finished evenly. OUR EMPIRE had no
speed and was outrun.

JADED SECRETS pushed to the front, set the pace in hand, widened on the final bend and held driving. SHESALILRUNAWAY chased the winner
throughout and saved the place. SAINT HELEN was outsprinted to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. ELLE
VICTOIRE lagged for three furlongs then passed tiring rivals. MIGHTY GYPSY had no speed and was never a threat. LILY PAD LAKE tracked the pace for
three furlongs while off the rail then weakened.
