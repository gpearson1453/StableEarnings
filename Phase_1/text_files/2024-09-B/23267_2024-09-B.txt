Footnotes
CAMDEN HIGH was on the pace from the outset, responded at the furlong marker to edge away into the stretch and held SASSY EINSTEIN safe. SASSY
EINSTEIN was a bit slow to begin and trailed, chased three wide to the stretch and was gaining but too late. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA dueled the winner from
the rail for three furlongs, got outkicked on the far turn and finished evenly. PARTY TIME GAL was outsprinted, saved ground throughout but lacked a
closing response. SUMTHINTOTALKABOUT lugged five wide to the backstretch, continued drifting out on the far turn and came up empty.

POLLO D'ORO was pushed to the front, set all the pace while off the rail then responded in the final furlong to hold. SOCAL RED was fanned four wide to
the backstretch, chased to the second turn, got outkicked by the winner but made a late lunge to grab second by a whisker. NATIONHEART pressed the
winner throughout while saving ground, was also unable to make an impact on that one in the drive and got tagged on the line for the place. MYSTIC
WOOD FORCE stalked the pace three wide, was off the rail on the second turn and lacked a closing response. FOOLISH TO DECEIVE had no speed and
trailed.

SECRET SAGA tracked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then wore down LIVE A GOOD LIFE late. LIVE A GOOD LIFE dueled to
the backstretch, inched to the front to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not stall the winner. MACLEAN'S RHYME settled mid pack,
bid two wide on the far turn then could not impact the top two but held third. WORKDAY had good speed, was outkicked down the backstretch then saved
ground to the stretch and weakened. KEEN JAMES had no speed, and was never a threat. CABALLERANGO chased the pace for three eighths then gave
way. BEER BEGONE had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
RUN SNAPPY had the best speed, sizzled on the front end for a half mile, responded to pressure in the drive and held on determinedly. SOL DEL SUR
veered out at the start then was corrected, eased in and saved ground on both turns then closed late on the rail to grab the place. WESTON hustled but was
outsprinted by the winner, pressed that one two wide to the stretch then made up ground belatedly. but was outkicked for second. BOB'S SNIPER chased
the pace two wide to the far turn then lacked the needed late response. ARIZONA ANDREW gave a dull effort.
