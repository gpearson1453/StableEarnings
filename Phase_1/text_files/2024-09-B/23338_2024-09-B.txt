Footnotes
VEKOMA RIDES stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took over in the five path into upper stretch then kicked clear,
drew away under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then pricked his ears when eased up late. ALIAS bumped with a rival at the start, chased the
pace down the backstretch, dropped back in the three path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, kept on willingly in the final furlong and narrowly earned
the place. MOMENT'S NOTICE stumbled badly at the start then bumped with a foe, moved up under urging then was taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths
pole, remained in hand late on the backstretch, chased while inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the five path, pursued the winner
in the drive and lacked the needed kick then lost the place while able to get the show. PAPA GOLF dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out just inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MCHALE pressed the pace on the outside of
the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked between horses outside the quarter-pole, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the
stretch, swapped to the proper lead at the sixteenth-pole and tired. MATH TUTOR hit the inside of the gate at the start but broke in front, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and faded.
PURE MONEY was urged along off the pace, climbed some near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch in the six path and
had nothing left.

Footnotes
SCHEDULING DUDE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start under coaxing, established the front with five and a half furlongs to go and showed the
way in hand along the inside, slipped away through the latter portion of the turn and continued in the inside route into upper stretch, got roused near the
three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. CHASING COLTON coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best.
GIMME GIMME broke in at the start trading a bump with PANDEMIC HERO, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CLASSIC RUBY coaxed
from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired. PRINCE MONOMOY broke in
brushing the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
PANDEMIC HERO broke out at the start trading a bump with GIMME GIMME, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MONTEBELLO pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path for most of the turn then moved to the four path, turned into the stretch in the five
path, drifted out in pursuit of the leader near the eighth-pole, kept on well while remaining on his inside lead, swapped to the proper lead late and got up well
out in the track to prevail. MAGIA NERA was well placed just off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths
pole, moved to the three path late on the bend, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, took a short lead late but was denied while able to get the
place. NEUSCHWANSTEIN broke in then was hustled, showed the way on the inside of a foe, inched away from that rival in the two path on the turn,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop while clinging to the lead
nearing the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken but clear for the show. MAGNIFICENT MILE broke awkwardly and near the back of the field, established a
good position just off the pace, was asked while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. ANTHRACITE dropped back early then settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path and
failed to rally. WHENLOVETAKESOVER was last to commence, tossed his head multiple times early, chased outside while racing with his head held high,
went around the turn in the four then five path, dropped back in the six path into the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND BLUES broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, moved closer while saving ground on the turn, shifted to the two path late on
that bend, found a sizable opening at the quarter-pole then made a bid inside of rivals in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead while battling with the
runner-up into the final furlong, took over outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted out while moving clear and prevailed. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY raced just off
the pace between horses, chased in the two path for most of the turn then shifted to the three path, gained to make a bid in the four path outside the
quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted in while battling outside the winner outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage inside that marker, was
carried out near the sixteenth-pole and outfinished while well clear for the place. BRONX BOMBER bumped hard with a rival at the start while also making
contact with another foe, settled comfortably off the pace, rallied three then four wide on the turn, gained to make a five wide bid into upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired but just held the show. GUT FEELING settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused after turning into
the stretch and just missed the show. STRONG LIGHT lost his footing slightly at the start then dropped back, raced at the rear of the field, dropped from the
four path to the three path on the turn, came out to the six path into the stretch and was no factor. MASTERMIND moved in while going to the front then
showed the way, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the stretch in the three path, lost the
advantage near the three-sixteenths pole and faded. GOLDINI was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four
path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and had nothing left. PRINCE OF JOY broke in and bumped hard with a rival, moved in while coaxed along
just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and capitulated. LORD CAPTAIN was hustled from the gate, dropped back under urging while climbing some,
saved ground on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BARRICADE stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, increased the pressure on the leader on the far turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms
for the lead, dueled outside in the stretch, brushed with the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under strong urging. VALUATION
METRIC went to the front while placed under a snug hold, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a
drive in upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner, brushed with that opponent near the sixteenth-pole, fought to the finish and just missed while clear for the
place. DAVY CROCKETT was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths pole, shifted
three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and safely secured the show. MORTAL LOCK raced in the three path on the first turn, was rated
on the outside under a tight hold, went three wide on the far turn, was asked late on that bend, chased into upper stretch and weakened. DON'T GHOST
ME bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back between horses early, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged in the
two then three path on the far turn then driven into the stretch in the four path and improved position without threatening. STRATEGIST was taken in hand
early then became keen under restraint, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced inside while asked on the far turn and lacked the
needed response. THARHOM was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused outside the three-eighths pole, raced
inside under urging on the far turn and also lacked the needed response. FLAT TO DA MAT was taken in hand early, raced in the two path on the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, shifted to the three path into the stretch and failed to respond. NO MERLOT veered
out at the start and was off slow, moved in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, moved from the three path to the five path on the
far turn and failed to threaten. DAKTO bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground on
the far turn, came out into the stretch and showed little. WELL SUITED went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back four wide on the
far turn and faltered.

roused at the three-sixteenths and drew off under a light drive and was ridden out to the finish holding clear to the end. FANTASTICAL chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to
secure the place honors in a blanket finish for minor spoils. LESLIE'S HUMOR chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. TOASTED ROLL chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter

pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away and threaded through the traffic of rivals while offering up a mild bid. IMPLOSION

Footnotes
BRITERDAYZAHEAD broke in and bumped with a foe, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well
when asked for his best in upper stretch, drew off while kept to the task into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. MISTER J T
broke out and bumped with a foe, moved up under urging to race just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole,
chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. PIPES AND DRUMS tracked the pace on the outside then in the
three path on the turn, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. PAPA ROCKET broke awkwardly and was off
slow, raced on the outside under urging, went four wide while moving closer on the turn and lacked the needed response. SUPER CHIEF chased the pace
on the outside then in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path and tired. BEACHWALKER bumped with rivals on both sides at the
start then was taken up in tight quarters, raced near the back under urging, went around the turn in the two then three path, turned into the stretch in the six
path and never reached contention. AIR SHOW broke in at the start, dropped back on the outside under urging, angled in near the nine-sixteenths pole,
raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, shifted out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. HONORARY DEGREE hit the
outside of the gate then bumped with a foe while off a bit slow, moved up under urging, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed
response. BOURBON'S HOPE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch in
the three path and came up empty. MILTON THE MONSTER bumped with foes on both sides at the start, dropped back while urged along, went around the
turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the five path and was no factor.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE (IRE) broke a beat slow and lost her lane to rivals, settled tracking the front just off the inside near the rear of the field, remained
patiently handled until tipped three wide nearing the five-sixteenths placed to urging, angled out eight wide into upper stretch, closed well on the outside and
was up in the final seventy yards to the finish and prevailed going away at the end. JUSTDENY tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to be just off
the inside into the final turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying in tandem with
CALDWELL LUVS GOLD to overthrow the leader near the sixteenth marker, got overhauled in tandem with that rival by the top one while running on
willingly to secure the place honors by a nostril. CALDWELL LUVS GOLD tracked the pace along the inside leading the main flight behind a lone spurted
away leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe and seized
narrow command a sixteenth out, got collared with seventy yards to the finish and fought on willing to the end just getting bested for the place honors.
MONT SAINT MICHEL (FR) broke out at the start bumping LADY MARY, tracked the front just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tipped three wide
through the far turn and then four wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LADY
MADONNA coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. MIXOLOGIST tracked the front just off the inside until tucked inside six and a half furlongs from home into
the second turn, remained on hold down the along the rail through to the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and stayed on one paced
through to the finish. AMERICANDREAMMAKER chased two to three wide coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths remaining, swung three then
two wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LADY MARY (GER) lunged at the break and was bumped by MONT SAINT MICHEL, who broke
outwards, saved ground near the rear of the field until tipped three wide with seven-sixteenths to go, went three wide through the far turn and was nudged
four wide when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths by BEAUTIFUL LOVE, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MACANGA
established the front and crossed to the two path into the first turn spurting away on the lead while in hand, pulled on the bit past the stands the first time
and crossed to settle along the rail midway on the second turn while continuing to widen away, remained with a large lead into the far and final turn and
remained patiently handled as the field got busy in behind taking closer order, spun just off the inside into upper stretch roused for the drive, dug in under a
drive under growing threat from a host of challengers, got overwhelmed when a bit leg weary near the sixteenth pole and capitulated, then weakened in the
late stages to the wire. EGYPTIAN CANDY tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
VICTORY DASH went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a
drive and held while kept to the task under a solid hand-ride. FLICKER (GB) raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path, settled at the
rear, was urged while moving from the inside to the two path early on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved in while gaining outside the furlong
marker and finished well to get the place. SALACIOUS went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn,
pursued the winner in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. OUT OF FAVOR (IRE) rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved towards the back, went two then three wide on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TRULLI
WARRIOR was taken up while in tight against the rail nearing the first turn, saved ground while tugging on the bit on that bend, settled near the rear, went
three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted out and failed to threaten. POKER JOKER went around the first turn in the
two path, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty. MANO E MANO settled on the
inside, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. PUJOL went three then two wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. COUNTER
ATTACK went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch
and capitulated. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace between horses, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths,
saved ground on the far turn and had nothing left.
