BOSTON BAY forced the early pace, dueled on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. SAILINGTHEISLANDS was in tight just
after the start, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. DRILLHALL set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on
the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. JOEYBONES was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the three path
at the top of the stretch was no real threat. TIPSY FOX was in touch early but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing
left.

MEKO MAKEE set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. RYE'S MY GUY tracked the early
leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BEER MOSA was in range,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. CHASING BOURBON stalked the early leader from the inside
and was hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MANETKA was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was
not a factor.

Footnotes
GAMBLER'S POSE settled off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. KNOTTY AND NICE
showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the far turn but failed to hold. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and
was up for show. PRINCESS MAYFAIR stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
AWESOME SPIRIT GAL (FR) was in range and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. DIXIE MORNING
was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. AMONG THE ROSES was in touch and
raced evenly from the inside on the far turn but weakened through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON AWESOME SPIRIT GAL (FR)
AGAINST GAMBLER'S POSE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but was caught late. MIMI'S HOLIDAY settled off the pace,
trailed the field on the turn and finished well. HEADING WEST stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch was outfinished. EASY ACCESS set the pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. SO
BREANNA was off slow, chased on the turn and was outrun. KATCHY NAME was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but faded late.

AMAZING SUCCESS settled off the pace, gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up in time. BRADY O'BRADY
was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch finished well. BEND IN THE RIVER set a pressured pace, had
a slim lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. BOUND LUCKY was up close and forced the pace on the turn but from the
five path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. EXCEED tracked the early leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch evened out. HALF LIT was off slow and showed little in a dull effort. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was unhurried early, chased on the turn
and from the nine path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
FRERET was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and proved best. LOADED QUESTION was up close and had the lead
on the turn but failed to hold. TAMANA was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and rallied late. MUSICAL RIDE was in touch and hustled along on the
turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. CHROME'S BIG BREAK was off slow and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch weakened. SPIRIT BELLE showed speed from the inside and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch had nothing left. DIXIERIBSY was in range and roused on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch had no response. J M R GEMMA
forced the early pace but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.
