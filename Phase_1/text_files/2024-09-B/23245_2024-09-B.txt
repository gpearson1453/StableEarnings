SHUG'S ROCKET pressed the pace outside, assumed command into the turn, drew off in the drive and was ridden out. TAZ MARKING set a pressured
pace, was headed into the turn, continued willingly and was no match for the winner. GIMME MONEY bumped at the start, raced mid pack between horses,
was checked on the turn and offered a mild bid to earn show. WATTS lagged early, advanced outside, went eight wide entering the stretch and failed to
rally. SHE MYSTERIOUS broke in and bumped at the start, raced in the back, angled out for the drive and went nine wide entering the stretch. SEA OF
INDY bumped at the start, was never far back, raced outside and lacked a stretch response. GEEBEESBIGBOY bumped at the start, pressed the pace
along the rail and gave way into the turn. LITTLE ROGUE raced in close between horses, bumped and was checked entering the stretch and dropped back.
LIKA DAGGER bumped on both sides at the start, raced in close, bumped into the turn and came up empty in the drive.

down his rivals to get up in the final strides. BRANDYN bumped at the start, stalked the pace, rallied five wide entering the turn, bid willingly to duel, got the
lead late and was caught near the wire. SHUDDER raced three across to the turn, vied to the final strides and yielded grudgingly. DINI DICE was taken
back at the start, dropped inside, advanced along the rail, challenged for the lead into the turn, dueled to mid stretch and faltered. DISTORTED GUY vied
between horses to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. CON SEAL AND KERRY was slow early, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. CRYPTO

Footnotes
RIGHT FOR YOU settled off the pace, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed with a rush under mild urging, got up late and drew clear. ROLL ON
CHARITY brushed at the start, got away well to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel, inched clear, led late, was outclosed and all out for place.
CASUAL ENCOUNTER raced mid pack, rallied four wide into the turn, was taken back, angled out, bid seven wide, found her best stride late and was
gaining ground. AWESOME WALKER pressed the pace along the rail, was steadied into the turn, fell back, came again inside, was shut off near the eighth
pole and finished with good energy. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS raced in close, rallied five wide into the turn, weakened in the drive and faded from
contention. E BAR SCOUT broke in, was void of early speed, went eight wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed rally. COMIC HOT TODDY brushed at
the start, stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled briefly and gave way. RAISE OUR FLAG was not a factor.

Footnotes
OLIVIA TWIST moved up inside to vie, inched clear on the turn and drew off in the drive while kept to task. CORRINA CORRINA was unhurried early, bid
between haorses on the turn, closed inside, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best.. CITYONTHENILE broke in, was taken mid track, vied to
the turn, fell back, continued willingly and was all out for show. LOANA lagged early, went ten wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. BIRDIE CURDY
was slow early and improved position in a wide trip. RANEEM dropped in on the backstretch, stalked inside to the turn and gave way. CHARLEE MAE
pressed the pace while racing outside, bid four wide on the turn to loom a threat and stopped. BOSTON PRINCESS raced in close towards the outside,
rallied on the turn, had nothing left and stopped.
