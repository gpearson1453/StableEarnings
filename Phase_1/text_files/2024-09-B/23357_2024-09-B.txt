Footnotes
BINGING stalked the top pair from off the rail, rounded the bend three then four wide, drew alongside the leader at the quarter pole, cleared shortly after,
kept busy into the final furlong and was in hand nearing the wire. MR. MACHUPICCHU away quickly to take control, dueled from inside up the backstretch,
inched ahead around the bend, was overtaken in upper stretch, stayed on through the lane and held second. RUN ABBOUDY RUN fought for the lead from
outside, kept the pressured on MR. MACHUPICCHU through the turn, could not keep pace at the top of the lane and churned on for a clear third. GREY
POWER broke in, trailed two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and passed a tired rival. HE'ZA TEN broke inward and came away last, sat off
the pace on the inside, chased two wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.

impact on the winner in the lane but stayed on to best the rest. IN WITHOUT KNOCKIN stalked from inside, lost ground on the turn, came off the rail and
entered the lane in the four path and kept on to gain third. SMOOTH AS BUTTER raced up close outside a rival, challenged inside the leader at the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost touch approaching the three furlong marker and weakened down the lane. DIXIE BLAZE tracked two wide into the turn, angled
out and came six wide into the lane, drifted inward midstretch and weakened. PROCEEDTOTHEROUTE trailed up the backstretch, angled in to save

Footnotes
LETTHELIQUORTALK vied inside a pair of rivals, cleared into the turn, led off the rail into the lane, drew away under right handed urging and remained well
clear to the wire. SPIRITIST tracked out of range in the early stages, traveled three then four wide on the turn, tipped out into the lane, rallied for second but
could not get anywhere near the winner. BIG SPLASH traveled near the back off the rail, went three wide around the turn, swung out late on the bend and
into the stretch and was along for third. THE BIG CHEESEOLA stalked three wide into the turn, tipped out and chased five wide into the drive, failed to
produce a bid and lost the show. TOP GUN CLASSIC broke out, dropped back to last, moved inside, came off the rail leaving the bend and passed tired
rivals. BILLY'S BET raced up close on the inside, tipped out into the stretch and faded out of contention. POP D'ORO vied three deep up the backstretch,
chased after the leader three wide on the turn, four wide into the stretch and weakened. THIS IS A JOKE pressed the pace from between early, chased after
the winner between rivals then two to three wide on the turn, tired and eased in the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
DEVIL AMONG US sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail then eased off the fence around the bend and drew off under right
then left handed urging and steady handling. DAMAZIO sat off the pace out wide, advanced four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and bested
the others. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK had to pause early when losing his path briefly, tracked off the rail, bumped with outer rival early on the bend, angled to
the inside, offered a mild response and got up for third. STREET HUMOR chased from inside, angled out on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
weakened. SIPPIN WHISKEY climbed while trailing early, altered wide at the five-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. SPLASHED IN GOLD chased two
wide into the turn, came five wide into the lane and faded. SMILING TONY brushed the gate and rivals at the start, tracked three wide into the turn, shifted
in and impeded foe midway around the bend and weakened down the lane. TAKAMAKAHARA brushed leaving the gate, chased from off the pace, bumped
with inner rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, got impeded by SMILING TONY and clipped heels and unseated the rider on the turn and walked off.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SMILING TONY FROM SEVENTH TO UNPLACED FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING
TAKAMAKAHARA TO CLIP HEELS AND UNSEAT HIS RIDER ON THE TURN.

Footnotes
ROSE DAWSON chased under light coaxing up the backstretch, dueled from outside around the bend, led in the four path turning for home, drifted out
through the lane and held off MIZ CLUBALI late. MIZ CLUBCALI stalked the speed from off the rail, moved into the two path for the turn, angled out and
came five wide into the drive, drifted steadily through the lane while challenging from outside and good not go by. SHAMROCKIN settled well off the rail then
moved into the three path, exited the bend in the five path, steered out in the lane and gained third. ACT OF SERENDIPITY away quickly then stalked off
the rail, went three wide into the turn, angled six wide leaving the bend and lacked the needed response. SATELLITE HEART sent clear from inside, dueled
around the turn, yielded to outer rival and weakened down the lane. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY sat off the pace and moved inside, came off the rail into the
drive and failed to threatened. ROMAN EMPRESS unhurried in the opening stages, went two wide into the turn, angled out late on the bend and could not
make an impact.

Footnotes
MAN O ROSE showed the way under pressure in the two path on the clubhouse turn, cleared outer rival into the backstretch, took pressure again past the
three-eighths pole, put away outer rival at the five-sixteenths marker, led three wide into the lane, drew off when roused in upper stretch, asked right handed
with a furlong remaining, widened in the late stages and was in hand approaching the wire. DONT FIGHT THE FED unhurried from inside then moved into
the two path for the first turn, tracked out of range up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two to three wide, could not make any headway on the winner
down the lane but offered a mild rally to best the rest. COALINGA ROAD tracked four then three wide early, stayed off the rail and came four wide into the
lane and churned on for the show honors. COWBOY MIKE stalked along the inside early, went between rivals past the three-eighths pole to press the pace,
urged along to keep up on the far turn but lost touch with the winner near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane. SHORTMAN got put in tight
between rivals chasing into the first turn, lagged behind up the backstretch and far turn, asked right handed along the inside entering the lane and improved
position. EL REY DORADO prompted the pace from outside in the three path around the first turn, took a stalking position on the backstretch, traveled four
then five wide on the far turn and weakened. FAST DRAW MUNNINGS stalked four then three wide early, remained outside while forwardly placed in the
middle stages, lost ground five then six wide on the far turn and tired in the stretch run.
