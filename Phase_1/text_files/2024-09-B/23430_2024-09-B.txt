Footnotes
BOYD'S BAND tracked the pace two wide, moved out and made a four wide bid on the turn, then came five wide off the bend and grinded in the final furlong
to wear down the leader to get up in time under a drive. ENZO prompted the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid to vie for command on the
outside of a duo, then gained a short advantage and then was confronted by an outside bid by the winner, dug in gamely off the turn and fought on but was
denied late to just miss. HONOR THE CROSS pressed the pace two wide, then vied for the lead in between rivals on the turn, fell back leaving the five
sixteenths, then swung out six wide leaving the turn and was gaining late. ENDLESS REIGN was reserved early, came two wide off the turn and finished
well but was too late. HALF A LEAGUE was settled back early, three wide by the quarter pole but had no significant rally. OPTIMISTIC NATE set a
pressured pace on the inside, then vied for the command on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SYNONYM set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed nearing the quarter pole by TWO THIRTY FIVE, dueled with that rival off the bend but
turned back that bid and drew clear nearing the furlong marker and widened the advantage to prove much the best, driving. SPECTRIER was four wide into
the first turn, chased the pace on the outside, came four wide off the turn and was along for the place award late. TWO THIRTY FIVE stalked the winner
early and made a three wide bid on the far turn to duel for command, but flattened out while drifting out in the lane, lost place award late. ZIPPER ZAPPER
tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. GHOST STALKER chased the pace three wide and tired. LAKE NAKURU was settled back early, three wide
on the far turn, came five wide off the bend and never factored. DADASHEV was four wide into the first turn, reserved early, four wide on the far turn and
came wide off the bend and had no response.

Footnotes
PAPER MANSION set the pace on the inside while clear, was well handled and drew out leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best.
GLOSSAMER was well rated on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and finished willingly on the inside to gain the place award. THAT'S MY CAT
stalked the winner two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and came three wide off the turn but flattened out, lost place award while besting the rest.
LULLABY LAND was settled early and moved off the inside on the first turn to be three to two wide, then came three wide off the far turn and had no kick.
NEVER SO LUCKY (IRE) was reserved early two wide, then saved ground on the far turn, angled out four wide leaving the turn and had no rally. BLONDE
SAMARITAN was settled back early and lacked a rally. BEACHGRASS was four wide into the first turn, reserved three wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
IRISH MEADOW was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn, closed well on the outside and edged clear
late to prove best under a drive. COURT CONTENDER was reserved early, advanced three wide leaving the half mile marker, shifted in and advanced two
wide on the far turn, then was blocked behind a trio nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and made a four wide bid off the bend and was clear by the furlong
marker, but was caught late by the winner while being clearly second best. GRAN RUNNER was reserved early three to four wide, made a three wide bid
nearing the quarter pole to vie for command, but could not sustain that bid and faded in the final furlong, bested rest. TROPHY ROOM tracked the pace and
made a two wide bid on the far turn to vie for the lead by the quarter pole between rivals and then weakened in the drive. BRETT'S WORLD was settled
early three wide, advanced leaving the half mile marker and was in between rivals by the three eighths marker and was ridden along but fell back. RED
DEVOLUTION was intent on setting the pace and did so while clear and going at a fast clip, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
SPIKEZONE set a pressured pace two wide, then made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then drifted out leaving the three sixteenths, then was corrected
with one pop right handed with the crop while drawing off to prove much the best. RUN POPPY was settled early, moved out and advanced three wide by
the quarter pole, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied for the place award while no threat to the winner. TAKE A HINT tracked the early pace and
made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then lugged in leaving the three sixteenths and faded in the final furlong. CATTIVO RAGAZZO tracked the
early pace three wide, then dropped to the inside nearing the quarter pole and weakened. DALINAR pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. REBEL
EMPIRE was settled early, came six wide into the lane and had no rally.

Footnotes
SUSTENANCE broke very sharp, took control of the tempo while in hand, clear around the bend, drifted out slightly in upper stretch, quickly recovered
under a stiff right hand, and remained clear under a drive to the wire. WESLEY THOMAS broke just off the top flight, pressed the pace between runners into
the turn, saved ground around the bend, lost contact with the leader leaving the quarter pole, unable to switch leads churned on through the wire, holding
the place. RUSSIAN HAMMER big hop at the start, unhurried into the turn, took to encouragement between runners leaving the quarter pole, darted inside
leaving the furlong marker, and finished off a strong rally inside to the wire. JAKE BRAKE ALLEY pressed the early pace, bid four wide while chasing
leaving the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and leveled off to the wire. PROM KNIGHT broke in the middle of the pack chased the speed into the
turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole for racing room, put to task in upper stretch, and flattened out through the final sixteenth. INDULGE off to a slow
start, trailed the field to the quarter pole, had no late response. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE started slow along the inside, saved ground around the bend,
weakened through the lane. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE lacked speed away from the gate, wide trip into the turn, bid six wide in upper stretch, and never
threatened.
