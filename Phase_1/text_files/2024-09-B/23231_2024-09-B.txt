Footnotes
SPEEDY OWENS was encouraged to a early clear lead then showed the way in hand from off the rail, was roused at the top of the stretch and maintained
control while kept to task until inside the final sixteenth. CUTADAY prominent just outside SPEEDY OWENS, moved clear for second upper stretch, could
not close the gap on the latter but pulled away for the place. SAYAN broke somewhat slowly and inward, moved up quickly from inside to prompt the early
pace, was boxed in through the bend, ran greenly in the lane but was unchallenged for third. HALF THE BATTLE chased running widest and was not a
factor. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN urged along between rivals leaving the chute, was two then three wide through the turn, angled in upper stretch and had
little to offer. PLAY THE BLUES was an early factor from inside, gave way on the bend, angled out upper stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
CHANEL POINT rated in the second flight from outside, was roused two wide on the bend, floated out to path four into the lane, continued her bid under
intermittent urging and got up in time under a well measured ride. HEAVENLY SCENT broke on top, was quickly clear of the others, let out some on the
turn, lengthened her lead, was asked upper stretch and slowly wore down inside the last eighth. CATTY CRUISE hesitated at the break, altered in for a
clear path early on, was shuffled back at the half mile marker, boxed in while just off the rail through the turn, gained a clear path into the stretch, took over
third, closed the gap belatedly inside the last eighth but proved clearly best of the others. BRIANA HARPER was hustled along and angled outside
HEAVENLY SCENT early on to race in the second flight between rivals but faded three wide on the turn. STARSOVERPARADISE moved to the inside for a
clear path early on, began to yield before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
GOLD OAK rated outside SHORT STRAW in the early going, moved clear two wide when allowed after a quarter mile, widened command under urging in
the stretch, started drifting out with a sixteenth left but held sway. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC in the second flight just off the inside, was roused two wide on the
bend, fanned outside GOLD OAK entering the lane, started gradually drifting out as she moved clear for second upper stretch, held a straight path as she
close in on the leader the final sixteenth, was too late but easily best of the rest. PRINCESS MANDII a step slow at the start, was void of speed though
hustled along from inside, just off the rail through the turn, angled out widest at the top of the stretch and passed tired ones late to catch SHORT STRAW for
third. SHORT STRAW displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with GOLD OAK on the bend and steadily yielded along the rail through the stretch.
GABRIELLA ATTACK raced in the second flight from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up three then four wide taking the turn and had no stretch bid.

COMFORT ME NOW without early speed, commenced his bid along the rail after two furlongs, reached contention on the bend, got through inside rivals
into the stretch, edged ahead upper stretch, moved clear inside the last eighth and maintained control under steady handling. SOUPER FORTUNE moved
to the outside early on, went for the lead three wide on the turn, dueled on the front end upper stretch, was no match for COMFORT ME NOW inside the
final furlong, battled outside LAYTON THE DAY for second and edged ahead of that one in the waning yards. LAYTON THE DAY steadily angled in as he
vied for the lead outside FASTNFURIOUS, moved clear nearing the end of a quarter mile, was just off the rail taking the bend, was challenged from both
sides in the stretch and gradually wore down. TAPIT SAM unruly in the gate, was taken in hand after the start, picked up his pace after two furlong, saved
ground taking the turn and lacked a significant stretch response. FASTNFURIOUS was gradually forced in as he vied for the early lead inside LAYTON THE
DAY, began to yield some midway on the backstretch, was checked briefly as his path narrowed nearing the end of two furlongs then began to fade from
between rivals on the turn.

Footnotes
LAKE MILLS broke alertly, showed the way from inside, drew off when asked in the stretch and proved much the best while ridden out. ST. LOUIE LOUIE
pressed from between horses, the leather on the jockey's right stirrup broke while in close quarters between horses into the bend, his rider sat flat in the
saddle as he moved clear for second while three wide on the turn then held his position under steady urging in the lane. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS
hustled along to stay close just outside LAKE MILLS, dropped back two wide on the turn, had the rail in the stretch, drew away for third then ran evenly the
last eighth. CARL G bumped from the rear at the start, was an early factor from outside, faded on the bend, came into the stretch five wide and had no late
bid. BLUE NORTHER broke a step slow and outward, bumping CARL G,, was a contender from inside on the backstretch but also faded on the turn.
JOYFUL GHOST was soon well back and had no response when urged.

Footnotes
BAR MONEY rated just off the inside, began her bid after a quarter mile, split rivals three wide on the turn, was clear of the rest leaving the bend then
gradually lengthened command under a mild drive in the stretch. PEYTONS HONOR broke on top, contested the pace under early urging, overtaken from
outside on the turn, no match for BAR MONEY when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for second. LUTION prominent from inside on the
backstretch, did not stay close after two furlongs, angled out some on the bend, came into the stretch from path three, lodged a mild bid and caught MADI'S
CIRCLE for third late. MADI'S CIRCLE bumped at the start, was settled well off the inside, lost considerable ground while four to five wide through the turn,
took over third upper stretch but leveled off in the waning yards. PRIMITY prompted the early speed from outside, began to yield four wide on the bend and
flattened out for the stretch run. GREEN GRACE broke outward, bumping MADI'S CIRCLE, disputed the pace from inside but began to fade before finishing
a half mile.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY kept close from inside, rallied in the lane, took the lead along the rail nearing the sixteenth marker, moved clear and held sway. SPICY
DELIGHT chased from inside, advanced just off the rail on the turn, lost some ground fanning outside MAMBA OUT entering the lane, rallied belatedly
inside the final furlong but swept past LICHITA to gain second forty yards out. LICHITA soon had a clear lead, was just off the rail through the bend then
gradually wore down inside the last eighth. TAPICITA hesitated at the break, trailed running widest, progressed just off the rail on the turn and upper stretch,
altered out behind SPICY DELIGHT after entering the final eighth and was closing in for third nearing the wire. MAMBA OUT pressed the early speed from
just outside then wore down between horses in the lane. HOT DAME was a contender from outside for a quarter mile then began to fade. LONG TALL
WOMAN void of speed while just off the inside, improved position three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and gave way.
