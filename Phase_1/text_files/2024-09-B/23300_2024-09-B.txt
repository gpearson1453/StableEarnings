second. KINGDOM DIAMOND never far back, offered a mild bid in the four path in upper stretch then was outfinished for second. RAMBLER pressed the
pace three wide into the turn, checked at the quarter pole and dropped back. SHOWTIME BOY battled with the winner two wide into the turn, drifted out a
bit at the quarter pole and weakened. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF RAMBLER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL

ELKO sprinted up the inside to make the lead nearing the first turn, set the pace along the inside, turned back a strong bid from the runner up on the far turn
and into the stretch, dug in gamely under left handed urging through the final stages and proved best under confident handling. POSITIVELY pressed the
pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, matched stride past the sixteenth pole and was denied. SO
TEMPTING moved up three wide on the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then leveled off. QUICKSTYLE had speed three wide around the
first turn, dropped back then passed tiring rivals late. LIME TREE failed to menace. ZULLY BELLA stalked the pace four then three wide and was through
after a half. ICY RAIN was never close.

LUCKY PENNY ROSE trailed into the stretch, swung out past the middle of the racetrack, circled her field under strong handling and got up in the final
strides. MARKET SUCCESS stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the far turn, matched strides into the stretch, was carried out to the
nine path and just missed in a game effort. MISSION GIRL pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the
stretch, drifted to the eight path and was outfinished. LADY JASPER close up, drifted past mid track entering the stretch and finished evenly. LA ROSA
failed to menace. KERRI'S MIRACLE set a pressured pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was
used up.
