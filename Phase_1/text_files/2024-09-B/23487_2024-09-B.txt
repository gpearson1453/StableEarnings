Footnotes
WINDY WALK pressed two wide, chased the clear leader in upper stretch, drove past that one to bid along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds,
sparred gamely neck and neck with her outer counterpart through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. PENS STREET raced off of the pace along the
inside early on before being sent forward to inch closer inside of rivals approaching the nine sixteenths pole, chased under urging around the turn, shifted
three wide in upper stretch, bid along with an inner WINDY WALK at the furlong grounds, battled gamely with that one through the late stages but just
missed. KIKI KRAZY came out at the start, set the pace along the inside, shook clear of an outer presser in upper stretch, but failed to contain an outer pair
of bidders passing the furlong marker and held show. BIRDIE ROSE stalked three wide, chased four wide in upper stretch and gave way. CHIQUITA
MOSCA trailed in the two path, spun to the five path into upper stretch and moved up between horses. CANT KEEP ME DOWN chased two wide and
between horses into the turn, then drifted out while weakening in upper stretch. LADY JUNE pursued from the four path and tired.

Footnotes
BOURBON SERENGETI set the pace in the two path as an outer pair applied pressure around the turn, shook free of them entering the lane and held firm
from a rail bidder thereafter. MORINGA stalked along the inside, took aim inside of the clearing leader in upper stretch, sustained a bid through the final
furlong but was kept at bay. MO FOR US bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed outside of the top pair and from the four path, failed to sustain
pressure in upper stretch, yielded yet held show. TAPIT QUICK bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, bobbled subtly and checked between horses
in the aftermath, tracked from the four path, pursued five wide in upper stretch and lacked a punch. IMPRACTICAL DIVA shifted out at the start, prompted
between a pair of rivals and from the three path, but faded entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
PARADISE LANE brushed with an outer rival leaving the gate, showed the way along the inside, led in hand around the far turn, drew clear and shifted out
in upper stretch, then inched further away while leaning out in the final furlong. BABY AVERY tracked from the four to three path and between horses
around the first turn, gained place from an inner rival with three furlongs to go, took aim on the well-traveling leader turning for home, but proved no match
for that one and held place. SONHADOR broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace two wide, advanced in the three path and between horses turning for home,
ran on to offer an inside bid for place in the final furlong but was kept at bay. INDY LABEL tracked from the five to four path and outside of foes around the
first turn, but gave way around the far turn. FAZOOLS stalked two wide and between horses, brushed an inner rival while chasing passing the three furlong
pole and faded. CHURNING BERNI brushed with an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, took contact from an outer rival while put to tight rail
quarters leaving the three furlong pole, gave way in the aftermath and failed to factor.

CREATIVE QUALITY set the pace in the two path as an outer rival prompted around the turn, then drove clear in upper stretch. PALACE LIGHTS broke a
step slow, saved ground off of the pace and rallied up the rail to gain place nearing the sixteenth pole. AIR FORCE THUNDER broke out, squarely bumped
an outer foe causing himself to be knocked off balance, chased from midpack in the five path around the turn, took contact from an inner rival entering the
lane in the six path, yet ran on willingly to gain show in the final sixteenth. BEACH BUNNY prompted outside of the eventual winner and from the three path,
failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch and yielded between horses in the final furlong while hanging on her left lead. CHICA ARMA stalked along the
inside, pursued from the three path around the turn, chased in the four path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MYSTICAL FIRE broke slowly but avoided
trouble by doing so, trailed two wide and got outrun. PRINCESS POM POM took firm contact from an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair
and from the four path, was urging along in pursuit around the far turn, brushed an outer rival drifting to the five path entering the lane, then steadied when
put to crowded quarters among foes in upper stretch and faltered.

LOU MAN brushed with an inner rival at the start, checked slightly while reacting poorly to kickback behind foes and lost position with nine sixteenths to go,
raced off of the pace in the five to six path, rallied to bid outside of the leaders at the furlong grounds and drove clear. VSOP chased forwardly in the three
path and between horses into the turn, sustained pursuit entering the lane, shifted inwardly at the furlong grounds, and ran on up the rail to gain place from
outer rivals in the final sixteenth. STUNNING BRUNO brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, moved closer before tipping two wide
and between horses into the turn, stalked turning for home, took aim outside of the top pair entering the lane, bid along with an outer rival at the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked leaving that station and lost place to an inner rival in the final sixteenth. KERNER vied three wide, dueled two wide around the
turn, got outkicked by an outer pair of bidders in midstretch and yielded while hanging on his left lead. MR LEE lagged behind along the inside, moved up
between horses in midstretch and stayed on willingly. HUEVOS D'ORO lacked speed along the inside, took the turn in the three path, entered the lane in
the five path and was no factor. BAYTOWN BEATLE vied two wide and between horses early on, dueled with an outer rival around the turn, got headed
inside of a trio of foes at the furlong grounds and weakened. VADEN stalked four wide and tired. BEGFORFORGIVENESS made little impact from the two
path. BAYTOWN GUVNAH vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals early on, but gave way at the three furlong pole and weakened.

Footnotes
LAURA'S CHARM tracked the top pair from the three path around the turn, ranged up to bid outside of them in upper stretch, drove clear and held sway
from a chaser late. CURRENT CLIMATE lagged behind, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final
sixteenth but needed more. CONNIE K dueled two wide, got surpassed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. AMERICAN STARLET dueled for
the lead with an outer rival around the turn, weakened in upper stretch, was eased in distress late and walked off.

Footnotes
HORACE MANN set the pace in the two path, drew clear entering the lane and held sway under a drive. DUCALE pursued from midpack in the three path,
cut the corner entering the lane, rallied up the rail to gain place at the furlong grounds and was second best. LUGAN KNIGHT stalked along the inside,
tipped to the three path to take aim outside of the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase and lost place to an inner foe in midstretch.
STRETCH RIDE leaned out at the start, stalked from the four path, yielded entering the lane in the five path and kept on for a minor share. SNEAD broke a
step slow and trailed early on, came under a drive into the turn and ran on mildly to miss fourth late. CAN'T HUSH THIS pressed the leader from the three
path, but weakened between horses entering the lane in the four path. BLUE KENTUCKY pursued from the three to four path, drifted out to the seven path
in upper stretch and tired.
