Footnotes
SEA QUEST void of early foot while racing outside, raced four wide through the turn, roused entering the stretch, responded and closes with good energy
while remaining well out in the strip. TUSCAN SAINT broke alertly, cleared and angled to the inside, set all the pace while continuing to save ground, proved
no match for the winner late, clearly second best. DREAMY DEAL off a step slow, trailed well back early as a result, began a moderate advance while
saving ground turn, continued up the rail through the stretch to be along for the show, no threat to the top pair. LARYSLITTLERACER raced back and in the
two path, displayed some modest late interest to improve position a bit, not a serious threat. ATTILA THE SPUN in the second flight while racing in the three
path, gave way in the drive. MOPAC TRAFFIC chased the leader for three furlongs in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY SUNDAE broke out a bit to help tighten up AGAMI, raced with the early pace while well out in the strip, continued three wide when dueling
onto the backstretch, alternated for the advantage the middle half mile, took over into the lane while three to four wide, showed the way past the furlong
marker, then found more late to hold off the runner up in a determined effort while fully extended. STAR'S DREAM settled off the pace toward the inside
early, chased the dueling leaders in the two path into and through the final turn, asked for run into the lane, advanced on the winner steadily but could not
get to that one in the final strides. AGAMI bit tight at the break to be last away, raced four wide and in mid pack into the first turn, one paced in the two path
into and through the final turn, staged a mild rally to annex the show, not a threat to the top pair. SHE'S GONE D'WILD dueled up front closest to the inside,
alternated with the winner until a quarter remained then steadily weakened through the lane. MIDNIGHT TRIP six wide when lacking speed into the first
turn, five wide onto the backstretch when continuing to lack speed, four side second turn, floated out a bit by AVERI EVER AFTER turning for home, lacked
a closing kick. AVERI EVER AFTER back off the pace while just off the rail, angled out to be four wide into the lane, also failed to muster a response.
START WELL broke in and back, continued sluggishly while five wide into the first turn, was still trailing when five wide into the far bend, showed nothing
through the lane.

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM stalked the leader while three wide and in the second flight, continued in the three path turn, set down for the drive, closed with good
resolve the final furlong to kick down the leader and prove best late. BOURBON SPIRIT sprinted clear soon after the start, angled to the inside, set all the
pace, remained clear until late, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. INVARIABLY off a step slow, lacked early foot outside, four wide through
the turn, staged a mild rally to be well clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. STOMPING HOTROD chased the winner in the two path in vain, had little
left for the stretch run. DRAFT CHOICE off a step slow, saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing bid. RARE STRIPE fell back to trail after the start, was
never a factor.

Footnotes
MOKINGS forwardly placed early toward but not on the inside, moved to the inside far turn, steered back out a bit late in that bend when asked for some
run, collared the leader from the outside with a furlong to run and kicked strongly clear. MUCHO BUENO broke out, quickly straightened to show the way
into the first turn while toward but not on the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch a path off the rail, moved closer to the inside when still
clear late in the final turn, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted in midstretch while steadying slightly as that one went by, narrowly saved
the place. PERRINS outrun early off the inside, raced three wide onto the backstretch, continued in the three path through the second bend when beginning
a run, continued to improve through the lane and was getting to the runner up late to just miss the place. GO BROTHER GO four wide into the first turn
when well off the pace, continued to lag, two path through the second bend, found best stride too late through the lane while improving position.
BROADWAY PEARL settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the
stretch. GOBOT remained back throughout in failing to menace. CLASSIC WARRIOR chased the runner up early in the three path, moved closer before a
half, continued to apply pressure into the far turn then gave way midway through that bend while between horses. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
MUCHO BUENO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ONE SHARP TIZ away in good order, pressed the early leader in the two path from along the inside, took over from that one midway on the turn, clear into
the stretch, drew out steadily through the lane under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. SPOONMAN raced back off the pace and the inside, came four
wide for the drive, long drive for the place, narrowly gained that position in game fashion while no threat to the winner. SILVER REDESDALE behind the
pace while off the inside, angled out a bit to be four wide turning for home when called on for run and just inside the runner up, long stretch duel with that
one, outfinished for the runner up position. ASTROLOGY WONOWON set the pace up the backstretch in the three path, briefly dueled outside the winner
turn, proved no match for that one in the drive, steadily weakened in the run to the wire. WILDCATS'S MEOW in mid pack early just off the inside,
proceeded through the turn just off the inside and continued evenly to the finish. MALIBU MONEY three to four wide through the turn when well off the pace,
lacked a serious closing response as well. ARCH OF SWORDS broke back, raced three wide early, moved a bit toward the rail when passing a rival midway
on the bend, not a threat in the drive. RODE BOSS last to leave, was never a factor while saving ground. SIXTEEN DEGREES moved up to a forward
position out of the chute, chased the winner for five furlongs toward the inside, gave way in the drive. JUSTINS SECRET was always outrun while three
wide.

Footnotes
LADY JEOPARDY with the lead pack from the start, prompted the issue up front to the leader's outside, challenged that one second turn, floated out by that
same rival while between foes into the stretch to be four wide, took over, drew clear under steady handling. CERTIFIED GEM forwardly placed outside the
winner, moved to challenge the leader with that one late second turn, floated out five wide turning for home, could not match the victor in the late going,
second best. TINCANDANCE broke in but alertly, showed the way while off the inside, carried the top two out turning for home, proved no match for that
duel to the wire, far clear of the others. BLUSHING BELLE five wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, four wide second turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never dangerous. BERLAINE settled off the pace, had nothing left for the drive. START SINGING was finished after five furlongs.

Footnotes
GARNET JUBILEE broke well, set the pace while toward but not on the inside, continued to show the way two path through the turn, maintained a daylight
advantage past the furlong marker, enough left late to hold the top two safe. COACH SAM P behind the pace toward rail, moved to the two path early turn,
shifted out bit for the drive, roused, showed good late energy to be rapidly closing the gap on the winner. ALL IN GOOD TIME off the pace, three to four
wide into the stretch, rallied down the middle of the course and was also going well at the end to be closing the gap on the winner. MACKAY BOY within
striking distance just off the fence early, dropped to the rail midway on the turn, came up empty for the drive in finishing up evenly. FLASHIN CHIP chased
winner in the three path for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. METRONOME lacked speed, four to five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a
rally. CONNOR TALKSTRASH fell back to trail, never a threat. IBENDLIEDTO mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn, backed up through the
stretch.
