Footnotes
GLOBAL HYSTERIA well placed and between, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged ahead in the final strides. ELUSIVE CHANGE sent from the gate, sprinted clear soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the late
going, then was outfinished and held the place. LAST POST tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room, flattened late and held the show. YANKEE TEA PARTY unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned
four wide into the stretch and edged up for a share. THAT'S JUST GREAT passed tiring rivals, widest. SOUTH OF BIRMINHAM well placed and outside,
lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and faded. NORTHERN WEIGELIA rated inside, steadied for racing
room into the turn, then faded.

Footnotes
GREY CHARMER mid pack and between, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, drifted in while gain
and drew off late. KING NATE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, making a
steady gain, then lacked the needed late kick. AULT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, saved
ground through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. CLEMSON
TIGER well placed and outside, edged ahead down the backstretch, shook clear through the second turn, then weakened late and held a share. JO JO
HANS stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and weakened. SIR
SAHIB unhurried, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. HEIRLOOM KITTEN ran
evenly. ORAZIO mid pack and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded. SIR TERRE was
no factor.

Footnotes
EASY SEVEN well placed and outside, angled in and moved up through the turn, angled around a rival into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead
and held. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE tracked the pace, angled out to the two path through the turn, came through on that path inheriting the lead, then was
no match for the winner the final furlong and held the place. MY JANNET unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and closed for the show. FOLLOW THROUGH mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and
flattened the final furlong. SAVE THE MISCHIEF passed tiring rivals while drifting in. NEXT DOT stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position
two and three wide through the turn, drifted out five wide into the stretch and faded. MAMA LONGLEGS showed little, inside. PRISCILLA'S COVE set the
pace inside, pulled up at the quarter pole and was taken off in the horse ambulance. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE,
