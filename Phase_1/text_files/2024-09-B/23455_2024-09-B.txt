Footnotes
BALTASAR prompted the early pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then shook clear leaving the three sixteenths
and drew out in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. JOHN'S PROMISE prompted the early pace from between rivals, made a bid with the
winner to be dueling for command to the inside of that rival by the quarter pole, but could not match strides with him in the final furlong while saving the
place award. MUNDO MIX set a pressured pace on the inside, then fell back on the turn, angled out four wide leaving the turn and ran on willingly to best
the rest. BRIGHT FORECAST tracked the early pace four wide, three wide on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and had no kick. YO
NESSROUNDONKERN was bumped at the break, settled two wide and lacked the needed bid. NOTION TO TAPIT was off a step slow, reserved on the
inside, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and had no rally. POSITIVELY AWESOME was off slowly, chased the pace three to four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the lane and had no rally. JARLIAN chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

KING OF HOLLYWOOD vied for the lead on the inside while racing off the rail, then set a pressured pace on the backstretch, then was engaged by
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY by the half mile marker and dueled with that foe on the far turn while in the two to three path, came three wide off the turn and dug
in determinedly and held that foe off gamely to prove best under a drive. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY was five wide into the first turn, tracked the early leaders
four wide, then made a early bid on the outside to press the winner by the half mile marker, then was four to three wide on the far turn and dueled for
command, then came four wide off the turn and was out-gamed in the final furlong to just miss. MR MAC QUHAE was off a step slow, settled early on the
inside, made a inside middle move to be well placed along the inside, tracked the dueling leaders on the far turn on the inside but flattened out in the drive.
GREYZER tracked the early pace towards the inside, then was in between rivals and shuffled back nearing the half mile marker, then moved out to be four
wide on the far turn and ridden along to try to get into contention, came five wide off the turn and lacked the needed bid. AWESOME LAUNCH bobbled
slightly at the break, went up to vie for the lead three wide and then fell back on the turn and tired.

lead to the wire under a drive. ST PETE'S PASSION was reserved early towards the inside, came wide into the lane and had a late rally on the outside.
JUST BE HONEST was four wide into the first turn, then went up to press the pace three wide, made a bid on the far turn to gain a short advantage by the

ATOMIC TONE stalked the early pace on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn and drew off leaving the turn, then was hand ridden in before being
wrapped up the final sixty yards. LORD BERRIER was settled early two wide, advanced three to four wide on the turn, then finished well to be clearly
second best. INTREPID'S LEGACY dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead briefly, then was confronted by the winner
and could not go with that rival and faded in the lane, bested rest. WILLOW CREEK ROAD chased the pace on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the
turn and had no rally. LITTLE ROO ROO dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.

CLEVER TIGER vied into the turn, dueled inside around the bend and into upper stretch, battled inside from the furlong marker to the sixteenth pole, and
drew off driving to the wire. SWAY'SINMYDNA vied into the turn, dueled two wide around the bend and into upper stretch, fought with inside rival into deep
stretch, unable to match strides with the winner stayed on well for the place. WEMBY settled inside off the trio of dueling leaders into the turn, checked while
making a bid leaving the three eighths marker, shifted out leaving the quarter pole, was steadily gaining ground on the top pair, when inadvertently swapped
to his left lead in deep stretch, finished willingly to the wire. HAVE NO REGRETS raced off the early pace into the turn, quickened the tempo leaving the
quarter pole while three wide, flattened out to the wire. SOUTHERN PASS TIME chased inside into the turn, bid leaving the three eighths marker, and
weakened through the stretch. GRAND BEY chased the top flight while four then five wide around the turn, under a drive and outside leaving the quarter
pole, came up empty. TEAM TRAVIS sent soon after the start to vie along the inside, under a drive around the bend, lost contact with the lead group, and
gave way to the wire.
