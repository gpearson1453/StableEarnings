URBAN STAR not far back, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing steadily, too control late and surged clear.
REPPAZZ set the early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, met the bid of the winner, dueled briefly, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best.
STAR ANISE chased the early pace, raced three wide though the second turn, drifted out and weakened late. TALES TO TELL was allowed to settle early,
advanced five wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. LA FANTASMA was void of any early speed, raced four wide into the second turn and
offered no late rally. VIRTUAL was taken back early, raced three wide second turn and never fired. GATE SONG was unhurried early from the inside and
was never a factor. MAXS PICK followed the early pace, saved ground and gave way.

INTER MIAMI tracked the early pace, ranged up four wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and edged clear. BAR DOWN EXPRESS was
allowed to settle early, raced six wide through the turn, finished evenly late and was second best. SUNSET TOWN pressed the early pace, went three wide
and gave way. MAGNIFICENT RIDE was void of any speed, raced between rivals into the turn, angled to the inside early stretch and flattened out. CASH
NOW set a pressured early pace from off the rail and weakened. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON was unhurried early, saved ground and faded.

Footnotes
SECRET SATURDAY broke a step slow, forged his own path between runners to be part of the early pace, quickly put away inside rival around the bend,
drew off in upper stretch, kept to task while well clear through the wire. DOUBLE NICKEL tracked off the early pace, bid three wide around the turn, could
not switch leads through the lane, and ground out the place. MITHRIDATES pressed the pace from the two path, asked around the turn, flattened out to the
wire. PORTIS off to a slow start, under a drive and three wide into the turn, had no late response. LILENGTHATCOULD slow into stride, asked to quicken
leaving the three eighths marker, came up empty. DENISTON chased inside into the turn, lost ground leaving the three eights pole, and never threatened.
EGOR OTAY sent soon after the start, vied along the inside into the turn, under outside pressure around the turn, gave way from the quarter pole.
