Footnotes
ROSATO showed the way two wide before moving to the inside into the turn, built a clear advantage nearing the lane and held sway from an outer pursuer
late. BOUTWELL TIME stalked in the three path, came under urging within striking range outside of the top pair into the turn, failed to keep pace with the
leader while gaining place nearing the lane, then slowly narrowed that one's advantage in the final furlong but was second best. PARKING LOT POURS laid
off of the pace two wide, then along the inside around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch and improved position to reach show at the wire.
BLUSHING KAM raced forwardly two wide and between horses, dropped back to chase from midpack into the turn, then stayed on mildly to bid for show
along with an outer rival in the closing stages, but missed. CITIZEN JUDY prompted along the inside, backed off to stalk just off the leader's heels into the
turn, pursued from the two path turning for home, but faded leaving the quarter pole and lost show to an outer pair in the shadow of the wire. GALA ROSE
broke inwardly and was slow to recover, trailed in the two to three path before fanning to the five path entering the lane, but failed to factor. COMBATTANTE
was brushed and bothered by an outer rival leaving the gates, chased from midpack along the inside around the turn and tired. LITTLE BIT O STORM
lacked speed three to two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
CORKAGE FEE stalked outside of the leader along with an outer rival early on, got briefly keen between foes entering the backstretch, settled to press
down the backstretch, bid turning for home, took charge and kicked clear in upper stretch then held sway late. GRACE GIVEN settled off of the pace two
wide, gained four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, sustained progress to reach place in the final furlong, closed in on the clear leader late but
was only second best. PRINCESS KALAMOH showed the way along the inside, clung to an advantage from an outer bidder around the far turn, but proved
no match for that one in upper stretch, tired through the final furlong yet lasted safely for show. PERCEPTIVE pursued from midpack along the inside, but
retreated down the backstretch to race near the rear two wide and between foes around the far turn, shifted out to the five path whlie sustaining stride into
upper stretch and improved position. ROYAL BLOOD pursued two wide, gained show from an outer rival passing the three furlong pole, but lost that position
between horses entering the lane and tired. LUBU broke a step slow, saved ground at the rear, advanced to offer a rail bid for show entering the lane but
flattened out and weakened. OH MACARENA tracked three wide, faded with a half mile to go then faltered between horses passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
PAPA YO led narrowly from a pair of outer vying rivals while remaining a path off of the rail early on, dueled with a single outer foe around the far turn,
shook free entering upper stretch as an outer DR KRINGLE took aim and fended off that bidder through the final furlong. DR KRINGLE rated at the rear in
the three path, advanced between horses around the far turn, tipped to the four path to range up outside of the top pair and take aim entering the lane,
sustained a bid through the final furlong but was kept at bay. ARTWELL vied four wide into the first turn, then three wide while remaining in the four path
around that bend, sparred with a solo inner rival while kept in the three path around the far turn, but yielded while getting outkicked by an outer bidder in
upper stretch, then held show from an inner foe through the late stages. TIVERTON hopped slightly while breaking multiple lengths behind the rest, saved
ground towards the rear early on, trailed around the far turn, entered upper stretch in the three path and moved up. REDHILL prompted two wide and
between horses early on, but was put tight tight quarters and squeezed back among rivals nearing the seven furlong pole, recovered to track the leading trio
from the two path, chased along the inside around the far turn and faded. CRUSADING vied three wide and between horses into the first turn, then just
between a pair of rivals while in the three path leaving that bend, failed to sustain pressure and yielded to those rivals approaching the half mile pole, shifted
to the four path into the far turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
CATMINT laid off of the pace in the two path, got floated four to five wide around the far turn, launched a rally entering the lane, sustained progress to bid
outside of the new leader at the sixteenth pole and drove past in the closing stages. LEXA took back while keen between horses soon after the start, settled
off of the pace in the four path, advanced to gain place tucking to the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, progressed to bid outside of the leader
at the furlong grounds, led into the final sixteenth as an outer bidder loomed a danger, but could not contain that one in the late stages. SULTRY LASS
showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, built a clear advantage when her outer counterpart faltered into the far turn, maintained a
margin before getting collared by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, then readily gave way. QUEEN LECA (URU) tucked around the first turn to track
from midpack along the inside, but chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. AMERICA'S VOW tracked from the three path, but got outmoved by an
outer rival while chasing around the far turn, yielded between horses entering the lane and made little impact. ENCLOSURE prompted outside of the leader
and from the three path, but gave way entering the far turn and folded between horses turning for home.

LEAMETATRAINER laid well back five wide, launched a rally in the four path into the turn, bid four wide leaving the quarter pole and drew off. CLASSIC
MYSTERY stalked along the inside around the turn, bid inside of the leader along with an outer rival leaving the quarter pole, but was outkicked by that
co-bidder, chased through the final furlong and held place late. POLITICAL SPIN saved ground off of the pace, encountered brief traffic in upper stretch, yet
stayed on in the final furlong, tipped two wide at the sixteenth pole, offered a bid for place but came up short. INDY LABEL showed the way in the two path,
but gave way between bidders entering upper stretch, then held fourth through the final furlong. HYMNAL steadied when put in tight quarters between
horses by an inner rival early on, recovered to stalk three wide down the backstretch, attempted a bid between rivals entering the lane, but got outkicked
and gave way. SO FAR SO GOOD tracked from the two path, shifted out to the four to five path in upper stretch then chased evenly. OUR PRAYER laid off
of the pace three wide and between horses, pursued from the three to four path around the turn before moving to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to
menace. AMERICAN SPLENDOR trailed in the three path around the turn and failed to factor. PLAY MAKER lacked speed four wide, took the turn in the
four to five path and made little impact. MIDWAY VOW raced well back two wide and got outrun.

Footnotes
JE SUIS RAPIDE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, advanced among foes entering the lane, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch,
then rallied to reel in the clear leader in the closing stages. GLORIETTE dueled for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inside
around the turn, drew away in upper stretch, but was collared and worn down by an outer rival nearing the wire. XTRA EXTRAORDINARY tracked along the
inside, chased evenly through the lane and edged show from an outer rival in the shadow of the wire. VERY WEALTHY dueled for the lead with an inner
rival while taking the turn in the three path, proved no match for her inner counterpart in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead losing place in the final
furlong, gave way and lost show to an inner foe at the wire. BOURBON BREEZE lacked speed three wide and between horses, took the turn in the three to
four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, then ran on willingly and moved up late. SWEET CHABLIS saved ground off of the pace, was
held up behind rivals turning for home, tipped two wide into upper stretch and improved position. SPARKLE OF HOPE laid off of the pace four deep, entered
the lane in the six path, shifted inwardly in the final furlong and failed to menace between horses. BALLADRY stalked outside of the top pair while within
striking range from the four path around the turn, but tired between horses in midstretch. EVIE'S ENCORE chased from midpack two wide and between
horses, cut the corner nearing the lane and gave way. BELLA CRUELLA trailed in the five path and made little impact. BAYTOWN LOVELY pursued in
midpack three wide and between horses, shifted to the five path entering the lane and faded.

got floated five wide whlie getting outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead while sustaining pursuit in the final furlong and
edged place at the wire. COMPLEX SECRET pressed three deep, vied nearing the lane, led narrowly at the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by an
outer challenger at the furlong grounds, kept on but lost place at the wire. TAVERNA brushed with an inner foe upon leaving the gate, tracked two wide and
between horses while rank through the backstretch, settled into stride before awaiting racing room among foes and behind the leaders turning for home,
tipped three wide pursuing in upper stretch and ran on willingly. EUNOMIA was bumped by an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the four to
five path before fanning six wide into the lane, but failed to menace. KAI KAI prompted two wide and between horses, vied around the turn but gave way in

Footnotes
SPYCRAFT took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the five path, ranged up in the six path entering the lane, rallied to drive
past the leader entering the final sixteenth and drew clear. BORN FLAWLESS set the pace inside of a pair of prompters while remaining a path off of the
inside around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer challenger with a sixteenth to go. CUT GLASS prompted two wide and
between horses while taking the bend in the three path, failed to keep pace with the leader entering upper stretch, then saved show at the wire. EYE DEE
KAY broke a beat slow and brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, lacked speed in the five path, swung out to the eight path whlie advancing entering
the lane, then ran on while hanging on his left lead but missed show at the wire. LIKE A SALTSHAKER was jostled by an inner rival at the start, laid off of
the pace two wide, then along the inside around the turn, crept closer entering the lane, but only managed to chase thereafter. SOUTH DECATUR was
jostled between horses and pinched back at the start, saved ground while trailing and moved up inside of rivals. ONE COOL DUDE traded light contact with
an inner rival while off half a step slow, stalked along the inside, tipped to the four path to take aim entering the lane, but lacked a kick. MY GRASS IS BLUE
bobbled when the gates sprung, leaned outwardly and jostled an outer rival upon recovery, then laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor.
SPEITFUL SAM tracked in the three path and between horses, then weakened. YES I'M A BEAST broke a touch outwardly, pressed outside of the top pair
and from the four path, but faded between horses entering the lane in the five path.
