Footnotes
GREEK HEIRESS stalked along the inside, pursued the top pair from the two to three path around the turn, bid outside of them in upper stretch and drove
clear. ROSE PALACE was reluctant to load, tracked forwardly five wide and outside of rivals, moved forward to bid two wide into the turn, vied with an inner
rival turning for home before an outer bidder joined the fray, but got outkicked by that one leaving upper stretch then lasted for place late. STAND BY YOU
laid off of the pace in the five path, stayed on between horses in the final furlong to offer a late bid for place, but missed. ABITIBI prompted two wide and
between horses early on, checked back into the turn, chased from the three to four path around the bend, drifted out to the six path in upper stretch and ran
on mildly. MERCY WARREN broke a beat slow yet recovered to set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer challenger around the turn, got headed
when a wider rival bid in upper stretch and weakened. ARELLA STAR tracked three wide and among foes early on, dropped back with a half mile to go and
continued to faded.

Footnotes
D'ORO UNBRIDLED tracked from the two path, then between horses down the backstretch, chased bidders from the three path turning for home, ran on
well aiming inside of the clear leader in the final furlong and reeled in that foe at the wire. EGLISE was brushed by an inner rival at the start, stalked outside
of the top pair and from the four path, bid turning for home, led into the lane, cleared in upper stretch but was caught by an inner bidder at the wire. DUKE
OF DUVAL brushed an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside, advanced between horses in upper stretch, tipped to the four path at the furlong
grounds, ran on to gain show late and held from an outer bidder. BOURBON SOCIETY laid off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the four path,
shfited out to the six path in upper stretch and stayed on to miss show. MOMENTUM FILES showed the way along the inside, met a pair of outer challenges
at the five sixteenths pole, to headed entering the lane and faded. CAN'T STOP WILLIS pursued from midpack in the four to five path and lacked a bid.
MAGNIFICENT RAGS laid off of the pace in the three path, trailed around the far turn, improved between horses in midstretch then encountered traffic late.
READY AS EVER pursued from midpack along the inside, crept closer at the five furlong pole, chased forwardly around the far turn, but faded through the
lane. HE'S A JOKER prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, bid along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, but was no match for
that one in upper stretch and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
ZECA DIABO pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked from the two path around the turn, shifted four wide at the three sixteenths pole, rallied while
changing leads at the furlong grounds, drove past the leader shortly after and drew off. MISCHIEVOUS M showed the way in the two path, but offered little
resistance to an outer on-charging foe's challenge in the final furlong and held place. CHUN MONEY stalked along the inside, sustained pursuit along the
inside, but was denied place and saved show late. NOBLE EAGLE broke a step slow, advanced outside of rivals at the half mile pole, sustained progress in
the five path around the turn before floating to the six path into the lane, yet ran on willingly through the late stages to miss show. SKELLY ROAD tracked in
the four to five path and lacked a bid between horses. NOT SO HOLY tracked two wide and between horses, chased among foes turning for home and
yielded. REDEPOSIT pressed in the four path early on, chased three wide around teh turn and weakened. LINE OF SCRIMMAGE hopped and took contact
from an outer rival at the start, reacted poorly and spotted the rest many lengths in the aftermath, trailed in the two path, rallied inside of rivals into the lane,
progressed through midstretch but was blocked behind traffic in the final furlong. MACHO VILLA lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor.
NATIONAL ECLIPSE was fractious in the starting gate and required a veterinarian exam before being reloaded, bumped an inner rival at the star, lacked
speed in the three to six path and made little impact. HIGH FIVE SY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, got floated to the eight path into the lane
and never got involved. CONSTITUTIONREVIEW broke a bit in and was off a step slow, lacked speed in the two path and got outrun.

FAN THE FIRE vied for the lead two wide and between horses while taking the turn in the three path, battled with his inner counterpart through midstretch
and drove clear in the final sixteenth. UPSTRIKER vied for the lead with a pair of outer foes while remaining just off of the inner rail around the turn, sparred
with a single outer foe through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth and lasted for place. SOARING BIRD prompted two wide and between horses
before backing off to stalk with nine sixteenths to go, pursued around the turn, then ran on between horses in the final sixteenth and missed place at the
wire. BEST OF GREELEY prompted outside of the top pair and from the four path, failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch, kept on mildly, then was taken
off of the track in an equine ambulance. JAMMING EDDY pursued from the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace.
ONCOMING TRAIN laid off of the pace along the inside, but steadied hard when getting rank at the half mile pole, then failed to factor. ONE FOR RICHIE
broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the four to six path and made little impact.

KENTUCKY SMOKESHOW chased forwardly in the three path and between horses, tipped to the four path to take aim outside of the embattled leading pair
entering the lane, lacked progress pursuing through midstretch, yet closed in to drive past the top pair at the sixteenth pole and inched clear. WISCONSIN
GAL leaned into an outer rival at the start, tracked while hung in the five path, yet ran on while drifting out in the final sixteenth and narrowly reached place
at the wire. HALEAKALA broke sharply, vied with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inner rail around the turn, sustained the long battle through
midstretch, but got outkicked by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth and was nailed on the wire for place. SWEET MUSIC vied for the lead with an inner
rival while kept in the three path, led narrowly as the duel continued through midstretch, but was surpassed by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth and
yielded late. HEAR THE QUEEN broke a step slow whilst last away, pursued from midpack in the three path around the turn and willingly pursued the
leaders through the lane. MISS TIFEYE stalked along the inside and lacked a bid. MACLEAN'S LULLABY took contact from an inner foe at the start, got
rank between horses at the half mile pole before steadying into t he turn, then failed to factor from the four path. FEARLESS LADY lacked speed along the
inside and made little impact. DINAHS GIRL made little impact two wide and between horses. ROYALEWITHCHEESE bumped with an inner rival at the
start, pursued from midpack tucking to the inside and weakened. D'ARGENTO BOLT bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate and got outrun in the three
path. DIVINEINTERVENTION got hung in the five path in pursuit and tired.

Footnotes
SUNDAY DISRUPTOR tracked two to three wide, loomed a danger outside of the new leader turning for home, bid nearing the lane, drew clear in upper
stretch and held sway. MARGOT'S ANGEL stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, shifted to the four to five path into upper stretch,
rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, but was fended off late and saved place from an outer bidder. DAWN AFTER DAWN laid of of the
pace two wide, then four wide around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly to miss place. ALONGCOMESAWOMAN
stalked in the three path, bid and gained an advantage tucking to the two path into the far turn, but met a menacing outer bid nearing the lane, proved no
match for that rival in upper stretch and faded. RUNNIN N GUNNIN pursued from midpack along the inside, then further back around the far turn, shifted to
the four path into upper stretch and surpassed tired rivals. RANDO pursued from midpack two wide and failed to factor. TRADING SECRETS failed to
menace three wide. CHAMPAGNE NIGHTS broke slowly, trailed, two wide around the far turn and got outrun. ALEDEAN broke out and into open space at
the start, showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder into the far turn and folded. RITA'S LEGACY lacked speed along the inside and
was through early.

Footnotes
BENEDETTA set the pace inside of a vying rival while a path off of the inside around the turn, drew off entering the lane and was driven home to seal the
deal. HUNTRESS FOR HIRE broke out and brushed a foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, took the turn in the three path, split foes
nearing midstretch and edged place from outer rivals leaving the furlong grounds. LEMON MUFFIN laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced in the
four path and between horses in midstretch, tipped to the five path shortly after and sustained a rally to reach show late. LIGHTNING MYQUEEN prompted
outside of the eventual winner and in the three path, yielded in the four path entering the lane, kept on through midstretch but lost show late. COME AS
YOU ARE was bumped by an inner foe and forced to jostle an outer rival at the start, lagged behind the four path, swung out to the seven path into upper
stretch and rallied willingly. HARBOR SPRINGS broke a step slow, then was brushed by n inner rival into an outer foe leaving the chute, laid off of the pace
two wide, shifted to the six path in midstretch and failed to menace between horses. HEY OLIVIA tracked in the three path and between horses, moved
forward to bid for place entering the lane but weakened shortly after. DETERMINED CANDY was jostled by an inner rival at the start, shifted out leaving the
chute, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, entered the lane in the five path and faded. SWEET GAL OF MINE transferred contact from an
inner rival to an outer foe at the start, advanced to stalk along the inside, then faded. STEAMPUNK was brushed by an inner foe and clipped heels between
horses entering the chute, lacked speed two wide and made little impact. LA FORET broke a step slow, pursued from midpack in the four path and between
horses and weakened. MISS ROCKETTE veered out at the start, pursued from midpack in the five to seven path and weakened.

through the late stages and prevailed. RIPERTON prompted outside of the top pair and from the four path, led in the five path in upper stretch, dug in to
resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, battled gamely but was bested. V V'S DREAM tracked two wide and between horses, split foes three wide
in upper stretch, dueled with an inner foe for show through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. SILVER ROSE raced forwardly along the inside, dueled
for show with an outer rival through the final furlong and missed. MS. TART trailed in the two to four path, floated seven wide into the lane and failed to
factor. PRINCESS MADISON vied for the lead in the three path and between horses around the turn, then faded between horses in upper stretch. LET

Footnotes
HURRY HURRY broke a step slow and lagged behind around the first turn, advanced in the six path around the far turn, then rallied outside of rivals to bid
outside of the leaders in the final sixteenth and edged past. MACKMAN pressed two wide, bid in the three path entering the lane, dueled through midstretch,
led into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder late. BATON ROUGE set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering
the lane, dueled through midstretch, but yielded late and saved show from an inner foe. LAMBETH stalked along the inside, took aim inside of the leaders in
upper stretch, but needed more and missed show. KING KUMBALAY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, steadied when in tight quarters among
foes in the five path in upper stretch, recovered and kept on. CREATIVE MINISTER pursued from midpack two three wide, chased in the five path around
the far turn, but lacked a bid. BEN FRANKLIN laid off of the pace along, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and failed to threaten. EVENT DETAIL
lacked speed along the inside, swung out to the eight path entering the lane and failed to factor. GAME WARDEN tracked two to three wide, pursued in the
four path and between horses around the far turn, but yielded. BOURBON RESOLVE tracked along the inside, but failed to change leads through the lane
and gave way. SINGLE DOT YAHT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and made little impact. EXPENSIVE CUT broke a beat slow, got a bit
keen passing the wire for the first time, lacked speed in the three to five path and got outrun.
