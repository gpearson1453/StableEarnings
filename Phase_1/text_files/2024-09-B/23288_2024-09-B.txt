Footnotes
INDY'S SONG pressed the pace, closed willingly, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. GOLDEN MERGER was in tight early, dropped inside,
saved ground to the turn, angled out, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and held for place. JUVAL raced close to the pace towards the outside, went nine
wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late rally. ELLIOT was taken wide on the backstretch, went ten wide leaving the turn and finished well.
ESTEEMED was void of early speed, bid along the rail leaving the turn and lacked a stretch response. B A CHAMPION led early while racing well off the
rail, pressed the pace when headed to the turn and stopped. HESA PROSPECTOR was in tight early, moved up inside to assume command, led to the turn
and stopped.

Footnotes
BYE set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duell and drew off under urging. UNDER OATH pressed the pace three across, challenged for
the lead on the turn, dueled, was no match late and finished second best. RONAMO saved ground to the stretch and closed well to get up for show. BRADY
BOY pressed the pace between horses to the turn, fell back, angled in, leveled off in the drive and was outfinished for third. HOLLAND was never far off the
pace, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed late response. PANCHO LEFT ME was never far back, had nothing left for the drive and dropped
back. CAPITAL JOKE was checked after the start, trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn, closed steadily, inched away late and held under pressure. FOR FUN advanced to
the turn, bid three wide vied gamely and was outfinished. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH pressed the pace, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and earned show.
FLOWER POWER set the pace to mid stretch, was outclosed and caught for show. PANDEMIC GIRL was taken outside, raced wide and lacked a rally.
WAY RITE was off a step slowly, checked entering the turn and improved position. JERRYS WAY raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to threaten.
WINNING AT EASE raced close to the pace along the inside and stopped leaving the turn.
