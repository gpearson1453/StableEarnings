Footnotes
FACTISIMFLASHY set the pace from the outset, opened up and widened along the backstretch, raced in the two path entering the lane, remained well clear
near the eighth pole and held off late charging rival in the final stages. OUR LAST SONG chased the leader early on, raced in the three path into the lane,
rallied late in the stretch but did not have enough in the final stages. RONNI'S WIND was very hard to load into the gate in the pre-start, raced near the rail
along the first turn while being back early on, was in the four path into the lane with a belated gain late in the stretch run. RATATAT chased the pace early
on, raced in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. MIZ KEETA hopped at the start, was steadied along from between horses
early on, raced in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch. GOODNESS SAKES raced along the inside in the first turn and chased the
pace, stayed near the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. KETTLE KISS raced far back early on, was on the inside into the lane and
improved position down the lane. BRIEF ENCOUNTER was never a threat. MOBIL CHIC was never a factor. MISS ELIANA was never involved.
DANZANITEAWAY was done early. EXPRESS FASHION was through after a half.
