Footnotes
LAVENDER DISASTER brushed the near side stall at the start, settled tracking the front along the inside, tipped to the two path at the three-eighths and
remained patiently handled through the far turn, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tipped out bumping PEDIATRIC PRINCESS twice to gain a
clear lane at the three-sixteenths, came under light coaxing and two taps to the right shoulder and burst to the front a sixteenth from home and was in hand
to the finish to prevail safe on the wire. COMPETITIVE MARKET broke a half a beat slow and traded a bump with VOW TO RESEILIENCY conceding two
lengths to the front, tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick to
secure the place honors. SNIPSNIPPITYSNIP broke out at the start, established the front and showed the way rated along the inside, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared inside the eighth pole, ran on to the finish to preserve the
show honors. ALL NIGHT REVIVAL broke in at the start, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside patiently handled until set down spinning four
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge bidding for command a furlong out, then got repelled inside that station and weakened in the late stages.
VOW TO RESILIENCY broke a half a beat slow and traded a bump with COMPETITIVE MARKET conceding two to three lengths to the front, tracked the
pace along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.
PEDIATRIC PRINCESS three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
got bumped outwards twice by LAVENDER DISASTER near the three-sixteenths when that rival needed a clear lane and then weakened to the finish.
PARAIBA BLUE broke a beat slow and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, tracked the front just off the inside and then along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CORAL SEA raced three then two wide through
the first turn, tracked the front just off the inside down the backstretch before heading three to four wide through the far turn, received two taps to the right
shoulder with five-sixteenths to go, angled six wide into upper stretch and was never extended while never engaged through to the finish.

Footnotes
WILD MAMA showed speed on the outside of foes, vied in the four path on the turn, led in the three path into the stretch then moved clear, drifted in around
the three-sixteenths pole, drew off under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was kept to the task into the final sixteenth and held while shortening
stride. SAVE THE QUEEN was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four then three path, found her best stride in
the final furlong and finished with good courage to secure the place. VESPERA showed speed between horses then chased, climbed into the kickback near
the nine-sixteenths then dropped back, went around the turn in the three then four path, kept on willingly in the stretch and earned the show. DECREE AND
DECLARE showed speed between horses, vied in the three then two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. MIA VITA bumped
with a rival while breaking in front, showed speed on the inside of rivals, dropped off the pace late on the backstretch, came off the rail leaving the
backstretch, moved from the two path to the three path on the turn, dropped back while still on her inside lead in upper stretch then swapped to the proper
lead and lacked the needed response. SMOOTH CLARET stumbled at the start and bumped with a foe, showed speed between horses, moved from the
two path to the rail early on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. COMPLEX GAL stumbled at the start and bumped with an opponent,
dropped back between horses early, raced green into kickback late on the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five
path and was no factor. FAITH bumped soundly with a rival at the start, angled in at the back, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and failed
to respond.

Footnotes
NELSON AVENUE broke out then bumped with a foe, went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while inside on the turn,
responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, was put to a right-handed crop near the furlong marker and held under steady urging. BANK
FRENZY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was well placed while settling into stride down the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, was
roused inside the three-eighths pole, moved out late on that bend then reached the four path, floated into the six path into the stretch, gained on the winner
in the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place. COSTA TERRA settled off the pace, climbed near the five-eighths pole, went around the
turn in the three then four path, lugged inward in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. IRISH EXIT broke in then bumped
hard with a foe, was urged along on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn and tired. LOST IN ROME bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the
start, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, chased in the two path on the turn and capitulated. MISTICAL
CURLIN bumped hard with foes on both sides at the start then checked after being bounced around, raced at the rear, moved from the two path to the four
path on the turn and faltered then was reported to have bled.

taking to the rail, showed the way through the turn patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat but held safe to prevail. BAREFOOT DISCO took up residence saving ground at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. NAUGHTY DESTINY chased
just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
CERRETTA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid.
FOLLOW YOUR ARROW chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and stayed on one paced
through to the finish. LIL' HAYADOIN chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch,
offered up a bid but was outkicked. GENEROUS LUVA broke out at the start bumping CORRI FELICE, led briefly and then chased just off the inside and
was forced to steady off the heels of MO DAMORNINGGROUCH at the half mile pole, chased along the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. RUSSALITE coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside, got forced to steady off the heels of MO

turn, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the eighth-pole, drifted in and out from the crop in the
final furlong and held under steady urging. BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD bumped with foes on both sides at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong and finished with good
courage to just get the place. LOCKE AND KEY went two to three wide on the first turn, pulled his way forward near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the three
path on the far turn, came four wide at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the
show. GEM MINT TEN bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, chased in the final
furlong and missed the trifecta. AGENT CREED settled while saving ground, was roused on the far turn, moved out nearing the quarter-pole, came four
wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved position. UNION TRAIL went to the front, raced in the two then three path on the first turn, floated
out entering the backstretch then angled back in, showed the way, raced inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came off the rail, lost
the advantage in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final furlong and weakened. CABLE READY went around the first turn in the two path, settled
off the pace, was asked between horses in the two path on the far turn, moved in after being behind traffic briefly in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. CLEAR CONSCIENCE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then checked off heels, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the
rear, was roused in the four path on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. BAR FOURTEEN bumped with
a rival at the start, was taken in hand while forwardly placed early, raced in the three path for most of the first turn then was carried to the four path, stalked
the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
MON PETIT CHOU hustled from the gate, pressed the pace of CONDIMENT GIRL from the outside four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn between foes, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, dug in under a
drive inching away to the eighth pole, came under late threat and held safe to the finish. R FUNNY BIZNESS struck the off side stall at the start, chased just
off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors.
EVERLYS GIRL chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran
on to procure the show honors. MY FIRST LOVE coaxed from the start, raced six paths off the inside in aim of the front down the backstretch, tucked three
wide through the turn advancing to prompt the pace stacked outside the top pair, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. GRINGOTTS coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. CONDIMENT GIRL coaxed from the start,
showed the way in hand three paths off the inside under pressure from MON PETIT CHOU to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and got joined by MY
FIRST LOVE three deep and was under pressure from a pair of rivals and came under coaxing near the quarter pole in response, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, then weakened inside the final furlong. JOLLY MISS JILL chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no headway. RIBOT'S VALENTINE coaxed from the gate, chased four
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, came under coaxing tucked to the two path at the three-eighths, tipped
three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
GASLIGHT DANCER settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to get up inside the sixteenth-pole and win going away. JAVA BUZZ bumped with a rival at the start then drifted in, moved up to get the lead
then sped clear, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, was set down while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper
lead near the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place. HILARIOUS AFFAIR moved in while off the pace,
took an awkward stride against the rail outside the half-mile pole then dropped back, saved ground on the turn and improved for the show. KORRONGO
tracked the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased in the three path into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. NANO MAN broke in but was
away alertly, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. PALACE VIEW (IRE) settled off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. INFLATION NATION (IRE) was reserved off the
pace, went around the turn in the two then three path, spun into the stretch in the four path, moved out outside the furlong marker and also failed to
threaten. COLLECT FROM IKE settled near the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, swung out six wide into upper stretch and was
no factor. HE'S GOT IT settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, raced behind traffic in upper stretch, altered out near the furlong marker and lacked
the needed response. GRUMLEY bumped with a rival at the start then was forced in, settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed
to respond.

Footnotes
SHADE OF PALE tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled until let out angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong out, then edged away to the finish to prevail. JITTERBUG saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. WEIGHTED AVERAGE broke in striking the near
side stall at the start, tracked the pace along the inside through until tipped two to three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and went three wide for home, kicked on belatedly to the finish. THIS COUNTRY coaxed from the gate, tracked just off the pace just off the inside and then
along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SILVOLOGY settled just
off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the
finish. GOODNIGHT MY ANGEL attended the leader to the outside applying pressure only through her presence until placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. TIME STONE established the front and showed the way in hand along the
inside under the watchful eye of the aforementioned foe latched on to the outside, came under pressure five-sixteenths from home and came under coaxing
near the quarter pole in response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared a furlong out, then weakened to the finish. HIDDEN
PRESENCE three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered
no kick. PROMDATEBONNIE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.
AUTUMN'S TURN broke open the stall door prior to the start when growing fractious in the gate, then broke inwards hit the gate at the start, chased just off
the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. PURRFECT GIRL chased four wide throughout coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped five wide into upper stretch, tired.
