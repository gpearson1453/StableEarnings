LAYAWAY stalked the pace through the turn then slipped through at the eighth pole with a late kick to prevail. EUROWENDI was never far back then angled
out to four wide at the eighth pole for a late run to be second best. CREAM PUFF REAPER prompted the pace to the turn then moved up to engage the
leader midway through the turn to the top of the stretch but couldn't collar the leader and stayed on for the show. TIFFANY'S FERRARI roused to the front to
take a clear lead to the turn then was challenged from midturn to the top of the stretch and edged away but tired.
