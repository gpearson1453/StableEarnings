Footnotes
PALMETTO FURY set the pace in the two path, built a clear margin around the turn, shifted out in the final furlong as an outer rival took aim and held sway
late. LIL GIN N CLASS laid close up along the inside, chased the clearing leader turning for home, tipped to take aim outside of that one at the furlong
grounds, sustained slow progress late but was kept at bay. MILA JUNES broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, edged show from an
outer rival passing the furlong grounds and held that position from an outer challenger. LITTLE SISTER SUE trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted out
to the three path around the bend before fanning to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on into the final furlong, leaned in and brushed a rival while forging
fourth at the sixteenth pole. BRIGHT LADY DAY pressed the leader from the three path into the turn, came under urging while failing to sustain pressure
turning for home, saw her rider lose his crop while drifting to the five path in upper stretch, gave way delaying a lead change in midstretch, took contact from
an outer rival while losing fourth at the sixteenth pole and faded. ITSABLINGTHING lacked speed in the four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
MIZMALICE was hustled to the fore leaving the gate, showed the way in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and widened under a drive. CRUZ CHICA
stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, sustained pressure around the far turn but proved no match for that one in upper stretch, then
remained clear of the rest while hanging on her left lead. SPUNDERELLA shifted in and brushed a rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, got
keen and steadied repeatedly inside of rivals around the first turn, chased under urging in the three path around the far turn, then edged show from a tiring
inner rival in midstretch. SIP'N' SPEED raced off of the pace in the three path and between foes around the first turn, pursued tipping to the four path turning
for home before getting floated wider into upper stretch, ran on mildly and moved up late. KIM POSSIBLE stalked along the inside, chased under urging
around the far turn and gave way. JOYFUL JOSEPHINE tracked in the four path, but faded between horses around the far turn. COMBATTANTE leaned in
while off a beat slow, then was firmly taken in hand while taking contact from an outer rival in the aftermath, trailed in the three to four path into the
backstretch, took the far turn in the five path and failed to factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS IS OLIVIA stalked along the inside and close up around the turn, bid inside of the leader entering the lane, wrestled an advantage leaving upper
stretch, inched clear with a sixteenth to go and held from a late outer challenger. SHERBET FOUNTAIN tracked two wide and between horses under a snug
hold into and around the turn, took aim outside of the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, sustained slow progress in the final furlong to offer a late bid
but was denied. BOBBIE SOX showed the way in the two path, sparred with an inner bidder entering the lane, got headed leaving upper stretch then yielded
between rivals at the sixteenth pole. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF broke out and bumped a rival at the start, trailed in the two path, improved inside of foes while
tipping outside of a foe and to the four path in upper stretch and moved up mildly. KACHOW pressed in the three path into the turn and faded in upper
stretch. WEATHER MAP was bumped between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path before shifting to the five path into upper stretch
and failed to factor. HURRICANE LASSIE bumped an inner rival upon leaving the gate, pursued from midpack in the four path but faded turning for home in
the five path.

Footnotes
THUNDERIAN set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, fought back through midstretch to lead into the final sixteenth,
and held from a late outer challenger. PIKE PLACE laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped out to the five path entering the lane, rallied to offer a late
bid but missed at the wire. SOARING BIRD pressed the leader from the three path, wrestled a very narrow margin entering the lane, dueled while failing to
kick away from his inner counterpart, relinquished the lead to that one in the final furlong and yielded between foes late. HUGE BIGLY tracked from the four
path, then chased willingly through the lane while lacking a bid. FOWLER BLUE trailed in the three path and made little impact. BREADMAN stalked along
the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn and weakened. MY NOBLE KNIGHT leaned outwardly and was off slow, raced off of the pace in the
five to six path and weakened.

Footnotes
COUNTTHEBRAVE broke outwardly yet still on top, showed the way from an inner pair of prompters early on, led in the four path around the turn, inched
clear entering the lane, shifted out while meeting an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, drifted further to repel that challenge at the sixteenth pole, then
narrowly held from a late bidder. MORAL pursued from midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two path, shifted out to the five path to launch a rally in
upper stretch, shifted out to counter the leading pair's drift in the final furlong, sustained a late kick to close in approaching the wire, but just missed.
BERMUDA BLITZ tracked along the inside, pursued from the three path turning for home, tipped to the four path to take aim entering the lane, crept closer
to offer a bid at the furlong grounds, but was herded outwardly and turned away at the sixteenth pole before getting outkicked for place. BROTHA KENY
trailed in the five path into the turn, then rallied to reach fourth in the late stages. ENDRICK vied for the lead with an outer pair of rivals early on, failed to
keep pace with his widest counterpart entering the lane and gradually gave way. LANDING CRAFT broke slowly and bumped with an outer rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the four path and ran on mildly. MARKET WATCH broke slowly and bumped with an inner foe upon leaving the gates, lacked speed
along the inside and saved ground to no avail. HOFF prompted two wide and between horses, but gave way entering the lane and faded. FROSTY BLUE
leaned outwardly at the start, chased from off of the pace while tucking inwardly around the turn and tired. TAP EM' OUT stalked in the four path, yielded in
the five to six path entering the lane, drifted out and weakened. SUPER SMOOTH chased early on, weakened in the four path and between horses into the
turn and was done early.

into the lane, and rallied to reel in the clear leader in the final sixteenth. ROMANTIC DANCER took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied in the three
path, dueled with an inner rival around the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, hung on her left lead while clear into the final furlong, but was bested by an
outer bidder in the final sixteenth. TEMPTING LADY broke a step slow while last away, laid off of the pace in the three path, moved forward in the four path
entering the lane to claim show passing the three sixteenths pole, and ran on willingly. STAGFLATION brushed an outer rival at the start, saved ground off
of the pace, shifted to the three path into upper stretch before moving to the five path at the furlong grounds, and stayed on to be best of the rest. STREETS
OF PARIS bumped with an outer rival at the start, rushed forward to be close up behind the leaders along the inside at the nine sixteenths pole, settled into
stalking stride into the turn, chased tipping two wide and between horses into the lane, but lacked a bid. SAKURA SKY pursued from the four path and failed
to menace. DREAMSCAPE raced forwardly two wide and between horses, chased into the turn and lacked a bid. CHARLINA was bumped by the inner stall

made little impact. THUNDERSTRIKE stalked in the four path, floated to the six path entering the lane, drifted out and weakened. MISS ESCAPADE took

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS stalked in the two path before tipping outside of the top air and to the four path around the first turn, bid in the three path at the three
furlong pole, gained an advantage from an inner rival entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch and held from a late challenger. WAR CAMPAIGN
tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail, remained in hand into the turn, tipped out to the four path turning for home, then gradually closed in on
the clear leader in the final furlong, offered a late bid approaching the wire but was denied. HOWLING TIME broke a step slow and was last away, trailed the
short group in the three path, gained between horses nearing the lane before tipping to the five path entering it, then sustained a gradual rally in the final
furlong but needed more. TRADEMARK tracked in the four path, got floated to the five path by an inner rival around the first turn, chased while hung in the
five path around the far turn, spun for home in the six path and failed to menace. FROSTED DEPARTURE prompted outside of the leader and from the
three path, dueled into and down the backstretch, led narrowly into the far turn as an outer rival offered a bid, got headed by that one entering the lane and
tired. FAIR AND SQUARE showed the way early on, dueled with an outer foe down the backstretch, yielded to a pair of outer rivals with three furlongs to go
and caved through the lane.

in on the leader late, but steadied slightly and missed place at the wire. WAILUA hesitated at the start and spotted the rest many lengths, moved out of last
