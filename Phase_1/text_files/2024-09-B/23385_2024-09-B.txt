Footnotes
ASHLEY'S ARCHER took control right from the start, travelled comfortably up front with little pressure applied throughout the turn, opened up when coaxed
for more with three sixteenths from home and safely coasted in for the win under mild urging. SUGAR BUZZ stalked on the fence down the backstretch,
saved ground, keeping pace while ahead of only one rival through the turn, shifted out with five sixteenths to run to be seven wide for the drive and closed in
belatedly to be second best. HAMMERHEAD was slow into stride on the break, settled at the rear down the backstretch, made a bold move early when
circling four wide at the three-furlong pole, angled out six wide turning for home, could not sustain the run by the furlong marker between runners and just
held for the show award at the wire. WAR WARRIOR sat just behind the pacesetter in the beginning, continued to travel on the fence watching the
frontrunner around the turn, was in range still inside saving all the ground turning for home but was one paced in the lane to settle on the fringes. NIIGON'S
LAW stalked on the outside three deep down the backstretch, moved closer three wide into the turn, was hard ridden at the five sixteenths pole to try to
maintain position between runners, angled five wide straightening out for home but yielded in mid-stretch. CHARTED MAP was situated in the middle of the
pack in the backstretch, was roused, but was losing ground to runners through the turn to be last in the four path at the top of the lane and could only find
enough for the drive to pass a weary runner in the stretch. ACCELERANDO tracked outside in the early going, shadowed the pacesetter outside around the
bend, could not quicken with others in upper stretch and folded on the fence with a furlong left to run.

Footnotes
GREYSTONE watched the front two on the first turn, rated kindly on the fence keeping a close eye on the engaged duo alone the backside for the final time,
shifted out at the quarter pole to have his sights set on the leaders in the four-path turning for home, began to reach for more ground when urged at the
eight pole and wire down the lead pair in dep stretch for the victory. MEYER stalked on the outside in the third tier in the beginning, made an early move
swooping around foes in the second of three turns at the eleven sixteenths marker, pressed the pace outside down the back straight for the final time, took
command by the quarter pole, dueled through the lane but was picked up late by the winner closing in on the outside in deep stretch. JOURNEYMAN was
under a snug hold setting the early fractions in this test of stamina, was headed outside going into the backstretch for the second time dueled up front inside
until ceding the lead at the quarter pole, fought on stubbornly trying to fight back on the fence in the lane, yielded to the front two finishers in deep stretch
but held safe for a clear third at the wire. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was unhurried at the rear for the better part of the race, started to rally, swinging out five
wide for the stretch drive still seeing the field and closed belatedly to best the rest at the finish line. LIL BIT GANGSTA was in the second flight on the
outside in the early going, was shuffled back a couple of positions down the backstretch, was roused and stayed involved between runners through the last
turn to be in range for a share of the prize in upper stretch but evened out late. TWOWAYCROSSING was content to track in the second flight outside under
a good rhythm, came under a ride but could not go with the lead trio making a move around the far turn and retreated in the four path in upper stretch.
BRITISH ROYALTY settled near the rear for most of the race, made a brief move picking up the bit on the fence from the three eighths marker until the
quarter pole, had no more to offer straightening out for the drive and backed away on the rail down the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUPREME broke sharply and quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, was given mild encouragement in upper stretch and responded
by kicking clear, received just mild hand urging the rest of the way in a dominant performance. ELLA IT IS stalked the eventual winner from outside racing
about three wide through the turn, was no match for that one but second best. SKYLIGHT CAPER bumped with a rival at the start, settled at the back, went
three to five wide on the turn coming out seven deep for the drive, kept on under urging to get up for show. I LOVE TO WIN tracked from inside, shifted five
wide in upper stretch, was one-paced thereafter. SERIOUS GREEN broke a step slowly, was pulling hard against the rider's restraint late up the
backstretch, came up empty. PRINCESS ROSINA settled mid-pack, was encouraged along by the three-eighths racing three to five wide on the turn, came
out six wide for the stretch run, made no late bid. MISTY POINT bumped with a rival at the start, shifted in nearing the three-eighths, was never a threat.

HE'S NOT JOKING broke inwardly, pressed the early pace from inside on or just off the rail, took the lead about the three-eighths, moved clear turning for
home and under urging, held. DREXEL HILL was forced out and squeezed back at the start, shifted in and moved forward up the inside, tracked behind,
came out in mid-stretch, was gaining but too late. THUNDERING settled outside at the back, went four to five wide on the turn advancing to be six deep and
close at the top of the stretch, drifted in through the lane but kept on to secure show honors. MAKI MONARCHY settled at the back, raced near but off the
fence, ran on. ADAPTED broke open the gates early and veered out, forced the pace two to three wide, came up empty. MISTER MONOCLONAL stalked
then pressed the pace from outside three to four wide, was under urging by the five-sixteenths, came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
ADAPTED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
ENDURING pressed inside at the start, was then reined back to set behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, had an ideal set up, all alone watching the
engaged trio with three furlongs to go, angled out with five sixteenths from the wire to loom boldly in the six path entering the stretch, was urged left handed
to take the lead in mid-stretch and was kept to the task late to hold safe for the win. NANTUCKETS DAY broke out on the start, stalked in the third tier with
runners on both sides along the back straight, edged closer with three eighths remaining, angled to the four path in upper stretch, shifted out further, six
wide having clear run at the furlong pole and chased the winner home. PAINTED GLORY stalked on the rail while on hold in the third flight down the
backside, began to lengthen stride three wide at the quarter pole, shifted out off tiring foes in the six path a furlong from home and closed in smartly to
capture third place at the wire. PLAISIR D'AMOUR cleared from the outside post to get to the rail by the three-quarter marker, was headed outside by a
couple of runners three furlongs from the line, lost the lead on the fence in upper stretch, dug in stubbornly but was no match for the winner with an eighth
remaining and faded late to just get picked up fir third money. LADY IONA was bumped inside on the break, co-trailed on the outside in the early stages of
the race, swung out widest in the seven path for the drive and finished up willingly to pass some runners down the stretch. SHAKSHUKA travelled in
mid-pack three deep in the early going, moved in three wide to prompt the issue at the half, poked her head in front for a moment while five wide turning for
home, could not match strides with others making a rally in the lane and gave way between horses at the furlong pole. RUSH TO GLORY was eager when
hard held co-trailing on the inside down the back straight, made little impression around the turn, shifted out to the five path just behind the leaders at the
quarter pole but could not pose a threat, lacking a rally down the lane. LEMON SWEETS settled in the third flight, three deep on the outside down the
backstretch, made a mild run three wide through the turn closing the gap outside, had no more to offer five wide straightening out for the drive and emptied
out in upper stretch. CANVAS broke out on the start, was under a snug hold tracking outside in the beginning, moved closer to vie between foes up front at
the half, was in the thick of things in the two path when turning for home, could not find more and folded by mid -stretch.

DROP YOUR GLOVES settled off the pace outside, swung six wide turning for home, rallied to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
CAPTIVATING NAME quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, was no match for the winner and just held place. OUT N OUT DISGRACE was
ridden along last but one at the seven-sixteenths, came out seven wide for the stretch run, was gaining but too late and missed second. LONNY'S GAMBLE
stalked from outside in range of the leader racing mostly four wide, lacked the needed late kick. REGAL GUEST broke awkwardly and slowly, trailed, was
ridden along at the five-sixteenths, failed to menace. LASTING SILENCE chased from inside, made no late bid. AIM DON'T MISS was forwardly-placed in
range of the leader stalking three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
DEWOLF settled in mid-pack on the fence, tracked behind the frontrunner around the turn going smoothly waiting for sign to go, shifted outside between
foes in the five path at the top of the stretch, seized the front at the furlong marker when asked for more, was kept to the task to fight off the stubborn early
leader inside who would not concede and edged away late for the victory. UNBRIDLED WEATHER had a slim lead on the outside at the start, took over
loose up top with three quarters left to run, rolled along up front around the bend, drifted out to be three wide for the drive to the wire, relinquished the lead
to the winner with an eighth from the wire, was persistent in his pursuit inside late but just didn't have enough to come back for the win. SHADOW REALM
pressed the issue at the start, was then reined back at the three quarters marker to track on the outside, chased in the two path with the eventual winner
inside through the turn, was fanned out six wide turning for home, could not go with the top two at the furlong pole, then switched leads and found more to
be gaining late but it wasn't enough. KEKOA travelled between runners in the middle of the pack, dropped back some at the half mile marker while on the
fence and came on smartly through the stretch in the two path to finish up with interest to play a minor role in the end. AWESOME RAINBOW co-trailed on
the inside down the back straight, ran evenly between foes in the two path through the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch, could not get into gear
and finished up one paced to the wire. MAGIC POWER travelled three deep in mid-division down the backside, kept pace staying up with runners
throughout the turn, was in range shifting seven wide for a share of the prize at the top of the lane but flattened out with a furlong remaining. RIDE FOR THE
PURSE was checked at the start, settled near the rear on the rail down the backside, could see the field at the rear through the turn, caught up to the pack
swinging out widest in the nine path turning for home but could not get involved down the lane. SHINIGAMI co-trailed on the outside in the early going,
made little progression three wide around the bend, angled out in the seven path for the drive, had no more to offer and tired in the stretch running.

Footnotes
ZISISIT (IRE) rated just off the leader inside saving ground, moved out past the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch five wide, put to urging at that point
and struck the lead inside the furlong marker then held while being kept to the task. MISS ROBERTS (GB) settled just in behind and off the leaders, tracked
inside saving ground throughout, bid up the inside near the eighth pole taking a brief and narrow lead but was soon overtaken and relegated to second best.
SWINGING MANDY moved clear from outside, set the pace from off the rail, had no extra in the lane. DEVIL'S BIT was well-placed stalking from outside
mostly three to four wide, needed more. MY GIRL SKY settled mid-pack off the inside part of the course, was one-paced. AMAZIN QUEEN saved ground on
the first turn racing inside, moved out, fanned seven wide turning for home making a mild advance but then evened out in the stretch. MORAL TURPITUDE
failed to threaten racing off the inside. TALK TO YA LATER settled outside off the pace, made a very mild advance on the far turn, fanned six wide into
upper stretch, failed to rally. FISH MOONEY angled in early, saved ground along the rail, was ridden along on the far turn but had no response.

Footnotes
MALIBU MAMBO veered in on the break and had to be taken hold of for a moment to trail down the backside, made a very sharp move splitting runners
extending his stride smartly at the half, had to be restrained behind the contesting trio on the turn, was let loose finding a seam five wide at the top of the
lane, blew past the dueling leaders at the furlong pole and won comfortably in the end. OLD CHESTNUT was brushed outside on the break, settled outside
near the rear down the backstretch, took the short way around closing the gap through the bend, followed the winner in the five path down the stretch and
finished up well to best the rest at the wire. MASON'S GAMBLE travelled on the inside close to the back of the pack in the beginning, was last on the turn
when encouraged left- handed at the three furlong marker, gathered speed shifting out eight wide catching up to runners by the quarter pole, was full of run
late and closed in to get up for third just before the finish line. TWIN CITY forced the pace outside down the back straight, vied between runners throughout
the turn, dueled with runners on both sides at the furlong marker and faded in the final sixteenth of a mile for a small piece of the prize. ROARING FORTIES
was in the mix up front four deep on the outside of rivals, could not accelerate with the lead trio through the turn, angled out seven wide for the drive but
could not get into contention in the stretch running. BORDER TOWN had a slow start to begin, then was hustled on the rail to have a slim advantage down
the backside, continued up top while hounded outside by two runners around the bend, was clinging onto the lead inside in the two-path turning for home,
was collared outside nearing the eighth pole, had nothing left and wilted in deep stretch. TOWN CRUISE tracked inside in the second flight early on, took
closer order to prompt the issue three wide around the turn, angled six wide still with a chance for a share at the top of the lane but retreated by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
CABERNAYDO had a slow start to begin trailing on the fence into the first turn, improved on the rail along the backside, had to wait behind a wall of runners
with three furlongs to go, burst through, finding a seam two wide at the quarter pole and was full of run in the four path down the stretch to just get up in the
last jump under a well-timed rally. QUIET KNIGHT pressed the issue outside in the four-path entering the first turn, was content to sit alone, watching the
loose leader down the backstretch, moved in to bid for the lead outside at the quarter pole, dueled outside down the lane, edged away for the lead at the
seventy-yard marker but could not fend off the late surge by the winner at the finish line. MONDAY MORNING was in the third flight with runners on both
sides down the back straight, took closer order chasing the embattled duo around the final bend and finished up well down the stretch to capture the show
award just a few strides before the finish line. CONNOR broke out on the start, took this field up top while going three wide in the first turn, dictated terms
down the backside loose up front, was collared outside with a quarter mile to run, battled determinedly on the rail in the stretch but faded very late to lose a
couple of placings at the wire. HELLO LADIES stalked near the rear outside, travelled in mid-pack down the backstretch, was shuffled back some at the
three-furlong pole, skimmed the fence turning for home and finished up willingly inside through the stretch. ARYEH watched the front two going five wide on
the initial bend, travelled three deep on the outside in the third flight down the back straight, kept pace between horses on the far turn, angled out five wide
for the drive but failed to fire, having no rally in the stretch. EROS travelled on the fence in midfield going into the first bend, settled inside two other rivals in
the third tier along the backside, was going the wrong way inside at the quarter pole and weakened in the two path in mid-stretch. REBEL FAITH broke out
on the start, was steadied three wide between runners into the first turn, was ahead of only the other troubled foe down the backstretch, offered a brief run
four wide midway on the far turn, angled six wide straightening out for home but showed little to the finish line. SAINT TEMPLAR was brushed inside to
begin, carried out eight wide avoiding troubled foe entering the first turn, trailed the field down the backstretch and could not be a factor afterwards.RIDERS
CLAIM OF FOUL #6 REBEL FAITH AGAINST #10 ARYEH GOING INTO THE FIRST TURN WAS DISALLOWED
