Footnotes
HOLY REBEL was unhurried early, steadily advanced outside, closed willingly, wore down his rivals and got up in the final strides. THE SMOOCH pressed
the pace, challenged between horses entering the stretch, dueled past the eighth pole, inched away and was caught late. RUNAWAY VICTORY was off a
step slowly, bid inside on the turn, closed willingly and got up for show. HOLDWHATYOUGOT set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel,
faltered late and lost position. SAPELLO SAMBA pressed the pace three across, bid willingly, didn't have enough left and hung. MARKSALOT advanced
outside to the turn to loom a threat, fell back into the stretch, dropped in and finished evenly. COLFAX KID was eased and walked off. EL DIEZOCHO was
pulled up and walked off.

SOUPED UP WILDCAT broke in, was never far off the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. GHOSTLY
CHANCE set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. HE'S A GENIUS bumped at the start, raced close to the pace
along the inside, fell back on the turn and finished well to get up for show. ON MY MARK pressed the pace while racing between horses, was in tight
entering the turn, weakened in the drive and faded from contention. GREATER CAUSE pressed the pace three across, was in tight entering the turn, swung
wide entering the stretch and gave way. SAPELLO RIDDLER bumped at the start, was slow early, closed inside and failed to threaten. FLY BECKY was
crowded at the start, raced wide early and lacked a bid. SALSA AMERICANA was not a factor. WANING CRECENT stumbled at the start and lost the rider.

the start to be off slowly, advanced outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, was outclosed and settled for show. HOLOTTALUTE set a pressured pace
to the turn, fell back, weakened and faded through the stretch. NOT TO FANCY pressed the pace along the inside, fell back entering the turn and stopped.
