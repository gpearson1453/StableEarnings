FLAT OUT LOUDER was not long in gaining a clear lead about the two path then held a comfortable margin throughout under steady handling. APPLE
SEED gave chase to the winner from three then four wide, could not close the gap but held well clear for the place. RIVER CHARMER had no rally racing
three to four wide. SCANDALOUS was not a factor. PRAIRIE COMET saved ground and steadily dropped back.

to widen a bit. OXFORD OUTING moved up inside to make a mild bid nearing the lane but could not match strides the remainder. SOMERSETSLASTRIDE
forced the early pace outside the winner and weakened nearing the lane. KRUSHOUR trailed throughout.

FESSY showed speed from the start outside rivals, edged clear in the turn then held safe in the lane under steady handling. I THINK I KNOW YOU saved
ground to nearing the lane, angled three or four then moved back inside rivals upper stretch and could not run down the winner. INCLUDING ELLIE showed
speed between rivals early, settled back on the turn then challenged four wide approaching the lane but came up empty in the drive. JOSIES SCORE was
always back three wide. OUR CLOVER GAL contested the early pace from along the inside and weakened.

showed early speed along the inside, shook a bid nearing the lane to move clear again then could not handle the winner through deep stretch. ROBERT
WHO stalked the pace from three or four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. STOOPS SINE DIE pressed the pace two or three wide to bid in the far turn
but weakened in the lane. CORTE trailed and failed to threaten.
