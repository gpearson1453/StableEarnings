throughout the stretch but was out finished in the end. MOON CAT was in tight in the early going then settled, rallied three wide in the stretch to be gaining
ground in late stretch. VARSITY was unhurried early on and settled, saved ground on the far turn then rallied along the inside in upper stretch and closed
fast but was too late. SEVEN FLAT stalked the pace while inside down the backstretch, made a bid on the far turn but faltered in the stretch. WILTON was
in tight and steadied off heels on the first turn then was settled and failed to menace. LARIDAE was unhurried early then raced three wide on the far turn
