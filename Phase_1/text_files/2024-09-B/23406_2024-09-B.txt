Footnotes
BAYTOWN BARACUS sent from the gate, set the pace inside, shook clear through the second turn, then drew off in the stretch under mild urging. VINO
COURAGIO tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner,
drifted out late and was clearly best of the rest. NOTFANUTIN rated outside the leader, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide
outside that one, weakened and held the show. SAKI BOMB passed a tiring rival. BRAVADEER well placed and outside, faded three wide through the
second turn.

Footnotes
ANADOR (FR) well placed and outside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead at the furlong marker, then dueled late and held. MILLE DREAMS (FR) unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, dueled with the winner late and lacked the needed kick. HIGH VIBES well placed and inside, steadied
along bearing out and moving up through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, was blocked, steadied on heels, then angled out and edged
up in the final strides for the show. PRETTY FLATTERING unsettled in the gate, lost her path at the start, gained position three and four wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. SEIVER passed tiring rivals. CIDSTAYINURLAINE led in the
early going, vied down the backstretch and through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. STARSHIP MACYS vied for the early lead inside, moved
up to gain a short lead down the backstretch and through the second turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then drifted in and faded the final
furlong. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

RUSTY MY BROTHER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the stretch, then turned back a bid, shook clear, and drew off
in the stretch. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA stalked the pace on the outside, moved to a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one, while clearly best of the rest. ON THE SHORTLIST well placed, held position three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then could not gain and held the show. ROCK N REWARD lugged in and improved position.
LOVELY EVER AFTER hopped at the start, passed a tiring rival. LAWN DART mid pack, moved up and steadied into the second turn, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and faded.

Footnotes
KISS BLUE tracked the pace, moved up and raced boxed through the second turn, waited, angled three wide into the stretch, was bumped and lost her
path, angled in and split foes into the stretch, then made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task.
SICILIAN PRINCESS well placed and outside, looped up to a short lead three and four wide through the second turn, then was no match for the winner the
final furlong and held the place. LITTLE MISS MUNNY unhurried, looped up three wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and closed well for the show. OLD FASHIONED GIRL mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and got up for a share. KITTEN'S WAR mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, lugged in,
bumping a rival, then passed tiring foes. MAHJONG GIRL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn,
then faded in the stretch. BELLA STRADALE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into
the stretch. VISION OF ANNA was never involved.

Footnotes
HEY PADRE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. THALBERG
well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. LIGHT CRUISER rated back early, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
had a mild late gain for the show. GIANT PAYDAY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch,
dueled in the late going and edged up for a share. MR TITO'S mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch, dueled from between, evened and finished on equal terms with YADI. YADI unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch, dueled late and finished on equal terms with MR TITO'S. VAN stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on
the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, then weakened late. RICHARD HOOTY allowed to settle, saved ground through
the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and improved position. EL SOLITARIO unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second
turn, came five wide into the stretch, angled widest and could not gain. TIZ TACT TOE was never involved.

Footnotes
GENERAL WINSTON well placed and outside, gained a striking position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and drove clear late. SEEING RED rated back, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged up for the place in the final strides. JUST WATCH ME NOW set the pace off the rail, turned back a bid into the stretch,
shook clear, then weakened the final yards and held the show. BEE BY THE SEA mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and closed for a share. COMMODORE BARRY unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch
and improved position. FUEL THE BERN stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader
into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one and faded the final furlong. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT ran evenly. THE COOKIE MAN was no
factor. DUDLEY was never involved.
