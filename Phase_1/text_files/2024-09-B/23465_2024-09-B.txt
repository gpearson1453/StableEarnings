Footnotes
D'WILD MUFFIN went to the front to set the pace from off the rail and won going away. UNPLUCKED GEM broke well then settled off the pace to mid turn
then made a mild rail bid but was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. MAGIC IN A HAT raced near the back and passed tiring rival in the
stretch. NEW YEARS LOVE trailed the field and lacked a rally. TOTHEMOONANDBACK hustled along to press the pace from two wide then three wide on
the turn and tired.

KONA KINLEY raced off the pace through the turn then slipped through near the eighth pole and cruised home. MAYA D roused to a pressured lead from
off the rail to the quarter pole then matched strides inside of LOTTA PRADA and bumped slightly in upper stretch but kept on to the eighth pole when
overtaken and gave way. LOTTA PRADA pressed the pace to the quarter pole then engaged the leader and matched strides outside of MAYA D but was
bumped slightly in upper stretch but continued on to the eighth pole and tired. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE stalked the pace from four wide but never made a
bid. JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS LODGED, THE JOCKEY OF LOTTA PRADA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MAYA D FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON

COLD AS YOU roused to take the lead near the half mile marker then edged away in upper stretch but drifted in late and held on. FLIPLIT was allowed to
settle to the three furlong marker then moved up from two wide on the turn and tipped out to mid track to make the late rally but was not enough and just
missed. LIL MISS DE BUY tracked the leaders while saving ground through the turn then started to make a bid from two wide but shifted in to make the rail
bid near the eighth pole and had to shift back out in the final yards and was outkicked by the late closer in the middle of the track. T R'S FIRST was not a
factor and passed tiring rival. DIVA DE KELA was away alertly to take a brief lead then prompted the pace but floated out in upper stretch and was empty.
JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF LIL MISS DE BUY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST COLD AS YOU FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

ARIZONA REINA went to the lead from between horses then edged away on the turn and fended off the late deep stretch challenge to hold the win.
CREAM PUFF REAPER pressed the early pace from the inside but had to steady slightly midway down the backstretch, settled off the pace to the middle of
the turn then made a mild bid for a late run at the leader but couldn't collar and was clearly second best. TIFFANY'S FERRARI vied for the early lead from
three wide then two wide but fell back on the turn and was along for the show. MOR FOXY trailed the field to the turn while saving ground moved up slightly
around the turn but failed to menace. SPECIAL TWIST was never a threat and outrun.

MY BUDDY MEL shared the command inside of MOON SHINE TIME to the nine sixteenths pole then prompted the pace around the turn, made a rail bid in
the stretch and dueled inside of BIG JACK to the wire and won the nod. BIG JACK chased the top two to to the quarter pole from three wide then moved up
to engage the leader near the eighth pole and dueled outside of MY BUDDY MEL to the wire to just miss the win. MOON SHINE TIME shared the command
outside of MY BUDDY MEL to the nine sixteenths pole then edged away on the turn but was collared near the eighth pole and tired.
