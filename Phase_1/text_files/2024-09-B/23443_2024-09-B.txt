but was no match and proved second best. MAKE IT BURN tracked the leader but lacked a late kick. PERFECT TOM trailed the field racing three wide on

TAP TAP HUSTO was off a step slow then rushed up to take a clear lead before the half mile marker and was kept to task in the drive. JUST N JACK raced
near the back while saving ground down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn, angled out to three wide at the eighth pole to make a late bid but
was not enuf. ORO went to a brief early lead then fell back around the turn and passed tiring rival. STAND BY TIME pressed the pace from the inside down
the backstretch then went two wide around the turn and tired. SCHLEICHER trailed the field while racing wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
CREATIVE MIRACLE prompted the pace from two wide to the half mile marker then took command and pulled away on the turn and cruised home.
COWBOY DON stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then made a mild bid through the turn but was no match for the winner. MONGOLIAN MOON
tracked the leaders down the backstretch then fell back on the turn but made a rebid to be up for the show. WIN FOR FUN trailed early, raced four wide
around the turn to make a late run to improve position. PRECEDENT raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground but lacked a late response. GAME
TO PLAY was hustled away from the gate to take the lead to the half mile marker and tired.
