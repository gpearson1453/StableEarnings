Footnotes
LUCYLOU WHO gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail, eased to the five path leaving the turn and dug in to take over the final strides. GHOSTLY
SQUALL gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and dueled to a slim lead mid-stretch, but was caught in the final strides. SWEET SHUGS chased
through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and dug in to take third under the wire. WHISKEY WILD rated the pace toward the inside, came
under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and kept the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, but was met mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards.
SCARLET REBEL steadied off the heels of Whiskey Wild leaving the gap then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane.
CASTLE TOY chased inside and raced close at the rail on the turn, but faded from mid-stretch. CONTROLLED TEMPER gave chase outside and rounded
the turn about the four path. RIVER REWARDS RVF was slow getting into stride and never factored.

through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, finished well and just missed. ONE CANDY CASTLE gave distant early chase, raced in the five path
on the turn and finished evenly to take third later yards. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY chased, raced in the three path on the turn then flattened in the lane. BUDDY
BUDDY gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. COLT ROCK chased, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened in the

Footnotes
ZIGGY STARDUST rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the
lane. W V LAD raced in the five path the first turn then closed to contention leaving the half mile pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn but
ultimately, had to settle for second. DENIZETTI stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths and
flattened near the rail on the far turn. UNCLE PRESS rated close inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.
TOWN HOT raced well back off the rail the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six
path and passed some rivals outside. SHOOT THE BREEZE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the
rail on the far turn. LOVE IS WICKED settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. JUST CALL ME AL raced off
the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and weakened in the three path on the far turn. BRADLEY DO RIGHT was left out of the
starting position when the gate opened and was declared a non starter after a Stewards inquiry was conducted. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SOMESUGARNSPICE rounded the first turn about the four path and left the turn outside, started her bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and
improved steadily from that point, raced in the five path on the far turn, dueled for the lead while lugging in mid-stretch, and widened through later yards.
SMOKIN LADY angled in and rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of Miss Bee Bop nearing the three eighths pole and turned that one back approaching
the head of the lane, was met mid-stretch but held on for second. PRINCESS MARGARET settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, then flattened stride in the lane. MUSIC LASS stalked the early pace inside, gave chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. MISS BEE BOP came away awkwardly then angled in to stalk
the pace, challenged toward the three eighths pole and remained a factor two deep on the far turn, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and
weakened. QUEEN NEFERTARI was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the three path on the opening turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
but weakened off the rail on the far turn. SNEAKY LYNK ducked in and made contact with Queen Nefertari leaving the gate, steadied into the first turn and
was never in contention.

IM THE DIRECTOR took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to
hold off ANNAPOLIS ROAD through the lane. The latter veered out leaving the gate then engaged in close chase through the backstretch, contested at a
slim disadvantage off the rail on the turn and finished evenly at the outside girth of the winner. JUBA'S HEART was bumped leaving the gate then gave
chase, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. THIS JUICE B LOOSE ducked in and made contact with Juba's Heart leaving the gate, gave
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. SAPPHIRUS ducked in and made contact with BOLD DESERT
leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed little more. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then saved
ground. FORBIDDEN SPIRIT ducked in leaving the gate then pressured the pace, dropped back approaching the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the
rail on the turn.

RIDICULOUS settled back off the rail the first turn and started his bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed to the lead in the three path approaching the
head of the lane and dug in determinedly to hold on. SARGENT KOBE raced well back in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole and closed steadily, raced in the five path on the far turn, cleared second inside the sixteenth pole and finished well. MASAI MAN
settled in the four path the first turn, left the turn toward mid track and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the three path then
flattened stride later yards. GABRIEL SEVEN rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, was met leaving the turn and relented
mid-stretch. MISTER WINSTON saved ground well back, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and improved his position at the rail on the far
turn. INDIMAAJ rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. PROTA rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn toward the outside and showed little response through the backstretch.
TAPIO was never a factor. AUBURN MILL stalked the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.
