CHERRY RIVER was allowed to settle near the back then moved out to four wide near the quarter pole while moving up to run down the leader and drew
clear late. RAIDER NATION sprinted to the brief early lead then vied for the lead from two wide and regained the lead at the quarter pole, fought gamely
down the stretch and gave way grudginly. TAPITBOY chased the leaders from three wide to mid turn then moved up to engage the leaders near the quarter
pole and fought gamely in early stretch but weakened. BRUTAL BUSINESS showed no speed and passed tired on in deep stretch. COLD SOUL rushed up
the rail to take the lead midway down the backstretch while under pressure to the quarter pole and tired.

the winner and was clearly second best. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY chased the leader and failed to menace but was best of the rest. NEW YEARS LOVE
