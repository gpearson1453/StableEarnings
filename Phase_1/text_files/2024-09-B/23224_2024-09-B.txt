STOLEN JEWEL stalked the pace from the rail, gained an advantage at the head of the lane and won going away. OUT FRONT attended the pace while
five wide, fanned four wide in the final turn, and lacked the late kick that was needed. NO PEOPLE hustled to the front, contended the pace while two wide,
and lacked the rally needed. HENRY'S GAMBLE pressed the pace while three wide, and came up empty in the drive. ADDYDIDIT sat just off the pace while
four wide, and tired early.

STEVIE WONDER GIRL allowed to settle along the rail within striking range, set sights on NIGHT FLYER nearing the quarter pole, swept the lead and drew
off under a confident hand ride. JOY IN GRACE trailed the field, and closed determinedly getting up in time to score second. MACHINA rated off the pace
while four wide, rallied three wide into the stretch, and was bested. NIGHT FLYER vied inside for the early lead, showed the way through the backstretch,
saw margins diminish nearing the quarter pole, drifted out at the head of the stretch, and gave way grudgingly. ORANGE THEORY fanned four wide into the
opening turn, sat in striking range while three wide, was steadied between foes, and yielded. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry
into the stretch run of the race but made no change.

BARAK sat in striking range while three wide, moved up inside of TAPFERSURE to challenge to front, opened up in the final turn, held good margins into
the stretch and was geared down. PACHECO fractious in gate, reared leaving the gate then was gapped, chased outside leaving the backstretch, bid three
wide at the head of the stretch and secure a second place finish. CAPE'S LEGACY saved inside, was in tight into the far turn then steadied, dropped back
and closed gamely for show. VANTASTICCANAVERAL showed the way through the backstretch, shuffled back into the far turn, and faded gradually.
TAPFERSURE tracked the pace while four wide, and had nothing left in reserve late. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the
start of the race involving PACHECO but made no change. TRAINERS OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the trainer of CAPE'S LEGACY against the
riders of BARAK and VANTASTICCANAVERAL alleging interference in the far turn was not allowed.

HIGHER IMAGE unhurried early, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, was set down at the quarter pole, swept the lead at the sixteenth pole, and
was ridden out. ANNAMARIA closed late to score place. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN broke alertly to show the way, was overtaken and rundown.
MONOPOLIZE reared leaving the gate, trailed the field and bid belatedly. WISH ON A STAR lacked a serious bid. QUICK DIAL stalked the pace while three
wide, and tired early. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving MONOPOLIZE but made no change.

FROSTEDBIRD contended the pace inside of TAKE CHARGE CURLY, edged away into the lane, and held on under a late drive. VIATURE stalked the
dueling pacesetters, drove three wide in the final turn, closed determinedly and just missed after a game effort. BODEMONSTER was five wide into the
opening turn, rallied into the stretch from along the rail and held for show. CREDIBILITY saved inside and closed well late. TAKE CHARGE CURLY pressed
the pace while four wide, and lacked a rally. ATTENZIONE offered a mild late bid. PARKING PERMIT brushed WHERE'S THE GOLD in the first turn, and
lacked a closing response. WHERE'S THE GOLD was brushed in the opening turn, and lacked a bid.

ROCKY RIDGE GINGER contended the pace inside of ISABELLE ANNE, disposed of rival after passing the quarter pole, and kicked away. DA BOSS sat in
striking range while three wide, closed with good energy but was no match for the winner. PASSAGE trailed early, shifted out four wide entering the stretch
and improved late. COUNTY WINDS offered a late bid. TITIAN mild interest late. OUR SUNSHINE chased mid pack, and flattened out in the stretch.
ISABELLE ANNE contested the pace while four wide, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and yielded. SIRACHA tracked inside, and retreated
in the stretch. VIOLENT VIOLET tracked the pacesetters while four wide, and tired early.

Footnotes
RAILWAY emerged the leader into the backstretch under a snug hold, responded to a challenge from CAB SAV, moved clear into the stretch and won going
away. KYSTONE stalked the pacesetters, angled out three wide, closed gradually under encouragement and was along with time for second. CAB SAV sat
in striking position inside, moved up alongside RAILWAY to challenge the front, and lacked the rally needed. WRONG SPOT hesitated, angled out sharply
at the head of the lane, and closed determinedly. STREET VENDOR stalked five wide, came under urging in the final turn, and faded. VICTORIA'S CHIEF
sat midpack, and gave way late stretch. COUNTRIFIED lacked a solid bid. NORTHERN JEWEL failed to threaten. EL NOBLE tracked four wide in the
opening turn, was six wide in the backstretch, and faded. BUZZINGA KARMA was wide in the opening turn, gained closer order under a strong hold into the
backstretch, and came up empty in the drive.
