Footnotes
RATLEFF coaxed along early, pressed the pace then fought on even terms up the backstretch, carried a short lead into the turn with rivals on both sides,
maintained the advantage through the bend and dueled with REMI OR NOT into the lane, put that rival away at the three-sixteenths pole, challenged by
LAST CALL PAUL past the eighth pole and stubbornly held. LAST CALL PAUL raced in range off the rail, took the turn two then three wide, tipped out in
upper stretch, challenged RATLEFF from outside in the final furlong and got denied. RED ON SUNDAY went up to take control from inside, set the pace
under pressure then fought head to head at the half-mile pole, battled inside a pair of rivals around the bend, yielded in upper stretch and churned on to hold
third. DRIVE FOR SHOW chased three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. REMI OR NOT hopped slightly
then was forwardly placed outside the top pair, vied three deep leaving the backstretch and around the turn, could not keep up with the winner at the
three-sixteenths pole, tired in deep stretch and was not persevered with. ANTIBES tracked from inside, lost ground around the turn, spun three wide into the
lane, steered out in upper stretch and weakened. HE'SQUITE MISCHIEF broke a bit slow and lost his path at the start, lagged behind in the early going,
saved ground through the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
BIRTH OF COOL dueled inside a rival then inched ahead on the first turn, cleared outer foe into the far turn, showed the way in the three path entering the
lane and held well under right handed urging and steady handling. NAUVOO keen in pursuit of the top pair early, angled from the three path to the rail
around the clubhouse turn, remained close up into the second bend, saved ground to the stretch, steered out in the lane, finished gamely but lacked the
needed late punch in the final moments. TAISHAN tracked two then three wide early, stayed off the rail to the second bend, eased out and traveled five
wide leaving the bend, tipped out wider at the top of the stretch and was along for the show. LOW EXPECTATIONS stalked four then three wide early,
exited the backstretch in the two path, steered out and came five wide into the lane and weakened. HAPI HAPI tracked along the inside then moved into the
two path on the clubhouse turn, chased out of range on the second bend, spun three wide into the lane and could not rally. MIKE OPERATOR away quickly
and dueled briefly from outside then pressed the leader around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not keep pace with the winner leaving the
backstretch, rounded the far turn, three then four wide and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
JERRY'S SPIRIT bumped leaving the gate, lost his path and steadied briefly early, chased after the top pair to the turn, challenged three deep past the
three-eighths pole, kicked clear four wide leaving the bend, drew away in upper stretch while drifting in and widened under some left handed urging and
steady handling. BIG GAIN brushed the gate then broke out and bumped rival, fought head to head for the early lead from inside, roused on the turn as
JERRY'S SPIRIT swept by at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace leaving the bend, kept on through the lane and secure the place honors.
BROADWAY UNIONS raced in range then off the pace on the inside into the turn, steered out around the bend and came six wide into the drive, kept on
through the lane and could not get by BIG GAIN for second. WILD RECRUIT reluctant loading behind the gate, dueled for the lead from outside,
relinquished the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the new leader in the three path exiting the bend and faded. CANGREJO got knocked into outer
rival leaving the gate, got crowded between rivals shortly after, raced in range off the rail then moved inside, came off the fence while losing ground on the
turn, entered the lane four wide and weakened. SHORE ROAD dropped back under coaxing early, saved ground through the turn and was always outrun.

I DON'T GET IT stalked the top pair from the rail, moved into the two path on the far turn, exited that bend in the three path, put to right handed urging past
the three-sixteenths pole, drew alongside WITHOUT BORDERS in deep stretch and dug in late to edge the runner-up. WITHOUT BORDERS dueled from
inside, drifted into the lane, cleared outer rival past the three-sixteenths pole, challenged by I DON'T GET IT in deep stretch and got outgamed. KID
AZTECA steadied off heels on the first turn, chased three, four, then five wide on the far turn, challenged at the top of the lane but flattened down the lane.
KIMMER reserved in the early going traveling three then two wide, stayed off the rail up the backstretch, ridden along past the three-eighths pole, came five

Footnotes
THIRSTY DESTINY raced up close from inside, challenged and put a head in front while dueling on the turn, lost command at the top of the lane, regained
the advantage midstretch and finally put away STANFORD HOTTIE in the final sixteenth. STANFORD HOTTIE showed good early foot from outside to take
control, lost command dueling around the bend, put a head in front at the top of the lane, lost command midstretch and yielded to the winner in the final
sixteenth while clearly second best. PEBBLES B AWESOME stumbled leaving the gate, stalked three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
could not produce a rally and held the show. YOU BETTER YOU BET broke a step slow, chased along the inside, two wide leaving the turn and weakened
in the drive. SWEET ELLA RAE tracked off the inside, eased out around the bend and traveled five to six wide turning for home only to weakened down the
lane. TAIL ON FIRE chased wide up the backstretch, trailed while angling from the four path to the two path around the bend and had little left for the stretch
run.

Footnotes
IN YOUR LIFE dueled from outside then stalked up the backstretch, challenged from between rivals at the half-mile pole, put a head in front on the far turn,
fought with PIPPA PHILIPA past the three-furlong marker, put that rival away in upper stretch under left handed urging and was ridden out through the final
furlong. GOD'S FAVOR bobbled a bit to lose a step, stalked from inside then moved to the two path, raced close up into the far turn, angled five wide
around the far turn, finished determinedly down the lane and gained second. PIPPA PHILIPA raced up close in the three path, bid three deep at the halfway
point, dueled four wide into the lane, yielded in upper stretch and flattened to third in deep stretch. STORMING GRAY had to take up in tight early on the
first turn then drifted out around the bend, chased three to four wide into the far turn, had the rider lose his crop nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
weakened down the lane. MORGAN'S BLUFF veered out leaving the gate, tracked four wide into the first turn then took control into the backstretch, cleared
inner rival, challenged by a pair of rivals at the half-mile pole, lost command on the far turn, chased after the leaders with a quarter mile remaining and tired.
ROUND IN CIRCLES keen early dueling from inside, chased outer rivals into the backstretch, dropped back off the pace in the middle stages, weakened on
the far turn, tired in the lane, eased and walked off.

RED CROSS KNIGHT brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, showed the way three then two wide on the first turn, took pressure from outside on the
backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn, overtaken leaving the bend, lost touch with KING APOLLO in upper stretch, stayed within striking
distance to the final furlong, then came back on gamely from inside to edge the runner-up in the closing moments. KING APOLLO brushed between rivals at
the start, raced up close in the four then three path early, applied pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, gained the
advantage approaching the stretch, cleared RED CROSS KNIGHT in upper stretch, drifted in and out in the final furlong allowing RED CROSS KNIGHT to
come back, fought to the wire but was overtaken in the last jump. CORNELL rated in the two path between rivals on the first turn, continued to stalk two
wide on the second bend, roused entering the lane, chased within range through the drive but finished evenly late. MANITOWISH brushed with outer rival at
the start, tracked three to four wide around the clubhouse turn, moved closer four deep on the backstretch, traveled three deep on the second bend and
weakened in the furlong grounds. CAISSON stalked along the fence, angled out at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. HULA CANDY trailed on the
inside into the clubhouse turn, went two wide into the second bend, spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CIOPPINA PASADINA broke inward then went up to duel from inside, cleared outer rival at the three-eighths pole, showed the way three wide entering the
lane and held safely under right handed encouragement and steady handling. HOT SHOT broke inward, stalked four wide leaving the backstretch, came six
wide into the lane, loomed from outside through the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. LUCKY SERMON came away alertly while breaking
inward, pressed between the top pair up the backstretch, chased two wide into the turn, moved to the inside around the bend then tipped two wide into the
drive, followed within striking distance through the lane and finished evenly for a clear third. DADDYGAVEITTOME broke in and bumped, chased outside a
rival up the backstretch, found the rail on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. CHIPS dueled three deep then outside CIOPPINA PASADINA
into the turn, lost touch with that rival at the three-eighths pole, chased four wide into the lane and weakened. BUDS N SUDS took a bump leaving the gate,
chased from inside, lost ground on the turn, shifted in at the quarter pole and weakened. HELLOVA LOUELLA broke in then trailed up the backstretch, went
two wide into the turn, exited the bend in the four path and failed to make an impact.
