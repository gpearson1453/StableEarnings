Footnotes
THUNDER BERN stalked the pace to midway on the turn, swept up to engage the leaders turning for home, opened a clear lead quickly and drew off down
the lane as much the best. FLORINA pressed the pace through the turn from two wide, took a brief lead at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but
kept-on willingly through the stretch to be clearly second best. SLANDEROUS set a pressured pace from the rail to the top of the lane, had no answer when
challenged in upper stretch and weakened through the drive. FONTABELLE slow in the early going, hustled up the fence to be in contention on the turn and
was used up having no bid in the stretch. POWER DANCE was one-paced never posing a threat. SAVVY DEPARTURE broke slow to give the field several
lengths and was not a factor. SHOW' EM NOLA tracked the early pace from the fence, cut the corner turning for home and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
HORSEPOWER pressed the pace from the outside racing two to three wide, took a narrow advantage in upper stretch, forged clear in late stretch under
steady handling. JETAROS quickly made the lead, set the pace facing outside pressure racing on or just off the rail, was headed in upper stretch, fought on
briefly then yielded late while being guided out a little nearing the wire. SILVER FRONT was a bit fractious in the gate, broke outwardly just a bit, chased
from between runners in the second flight, moved out five wide entering upper stretch, kept on in the late stages finishing strongly but missing the place.
KING COVEE broke slowly spotting the field about three to four lengths and lacked early speed, brought up the rear from inside saving ground, moved out
in upper stretch, was guided back nearer the rail in deep stretch running on mildly. BELTANE pursued from inside saving ground, was never near enough to
threaten. ABADIN was in just a bit tight after the start, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, raced outside a rival at the back, swung out five to
six wide for the stretch run, was never near enough to threaten. JUPITER BLUES chased from outside the second flight three to four wide, failed to rally.

PATRIOT SPIRIT stalked the leaders from the fence while well in hand, angled out late on the turn to rally three wide to the lead turning for home, opened a
clear lead in mid-stretch and drew away while under wraps late in the lane as much the best. LADY RADLER reserved to race at the rear of the field through
the turn while still within striking distance, angled four wide turning for home and closed well to be second best while no threat to the winner. BOUNCER
pressed the pace from two wide through the turn and lacked a closing bid when called upon at the head of the lane and kept-on evenly through the lane.
LOVE THE NEST tracked the leaders from three wide to be well placed on the bend and had no response when called upon nearing the quarter pole.
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE dueled on the lead to the top of the stretch and tired giving way in the lane.

Footnotes
ACADEMY quickly took charge, set the pace from just off the rail shadowed by a foe, kicked clear of all pursuers except one heading into upper stretch,
drifted out under continued left-handed urging in the stretch bumping the outside foe in the process, dug in and held that one at bay. PATRICK'S PROMISE
was guided to the rail heading to the first turn, tracked from in behind inside on or just off the rail, came out leaving the far turn past the five-sixteenths, had
aim on the leader four wide as the lone challenger in upper stretch, gained on that one but was bumped twice in the process while drawing even a sixteenth
out, was fended off after that to be second best. HARRIER settled at the back off the inside, began to advance outside runners on the far turn, swung seven
wide into upper stretch, kicked on outside to gain show honors while no threat to the top pair. MARSHAL was restless behind the gate and proved difficult to
load, was four to five wide throughout and strongly encouraged by the half but only went one-paced thereafter. NATIONAL LAW was outpaced in the early
going racing between runners toward the rear, was mostly four wide throughout, improved position in the stretch. EXTRAORDINARY ONE (GB) was
bumped early, raced mostly two to three wide off the pace, took closer order on the far turn, went evenly in the lane lacking the needed late kick.
PRICHARD bumped an outside foe when in tight and checked sharply past the wire the first time as traffic formed by a rival shifting nearer the rail in front,
dropped back to last and then settled at the rear inside, saved ground, passed foes in the lane. GREY SHADOW was forwardly-placed stalking, moved out
from three to four wide just outside the leading pair, faded in the stretch. BRIGHT ANGEL (IRE) was forwardly-placed moving up outside the leader and
shifting in from four to three wide on the first turn, pressed that one up the backstretch, was done at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. NEW PLEX
broke inwardly, steadied soon after losing the inside path as a rival came in, switched out a bit off the rail early on the first turn racing in behind near
mid-pack, steadied again nearing the three-quarter pole when held up in behind runners, moved closer about the half, was encouraged on the far turn but
began to drop back and faded thereafter. GRAND LIAM was encouraged to chase briefly from outside mid-pack five wide, soon retreated, was distanced.
FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PATRICK'S PROMISE AGAINST ACADEMY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
TRULY QUALITY settled in hand into the first turn to a tracking position, travelled patiently just off the pace along the fence for the next mile, was called
upon early in the final turn to split rivals turning for home, collared the pacesetter in mid-stretch and pulled clear convincingly in the final sixteenth in a well
handled ride. WEBSLINGER was keen to take the lead away from the gate, set the pace under a good hold with mild pressure, repelled the brief challenges
of MCLOVIN down the backside and L'IMPERATOR at the three-eighths pole to be in charge still in hand turning for home, was set to a drive on the straight
and had no answer when engaged by the winner in the lane while keeping on willingly as second best. L'IMPERATOR (FR) unhurried in the early going,
raced well off the pace for the first five-eighths, closed ground on the clubhouse turn to be with the pack on the backstretch, loomed up nearing the
three-eighths pole three wide to threaten and flattened out at the head of the stretch. MCLOVIN pressed the pace for a mile making a bid at the half mile
pole and faltered into the final turn dropping to the rear of the field and was well beaten.

GOVERNOR SAM set a pressured pace, kicked clear and held safe while being kept to the task. OUT ON BAIL was well-placed between runners in behind
the leaders on the turn, angled out a bit at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but held the place. GHOSTLY ROSE bobbled and bumped
with the outside rival at the start, was outpaced early, swung seven wide, was finishing strongly outside but just missed second. CURAHEE was a bit held
up in behind and inside runners up the backstretch, in tight past the half, switched out to the two to three path on the turn, moved between runners in upper
stretch and kept on evenly to secure a minor award. FIRE PIT was caught outside foes four to five wide into and on the turn, dropped back and shifted in
near the quarter, ran on in the lane. SHAREDASHENANIGANS pressed the eventual winner, came up empty. DANCING BEAR exchanged a solid bump at
the start, chased mostly four wide, faded. LAZIO moved forward on the turn to get within range four wide coming near the top of the stretch, flattened out
thereafter. BOTTOMS UP chased from inside, faded.

SIESTA KEY reserved off the pace in the back half of the field for the first three-quarters, was called upon midway on the turn in a full drive, split rivals three
wide at the top of the lane getting a hole to open at the ideal moment and finished determinedly to outduel the runner-up late in a well handled ride.
ARISTOTLE slow early to be the trailer under patient handling, commenced a rally on the final turn, swung five wide to challenge turning for home, angled
inside the drifting pacesetter in upper stretch and finished well battling the winner to the line. THRILLA reluctant to load, broke alertly to take command from
the gate, opened a clear lead on the first turn, slowed the pace down the backside to be well rated through the turn on a comfortable lead, drifted eight wide
turning for home, straightened away and kept-on willingly through the lane to hold the show while out-finished by the top pair. TREVAGGIO stalked the
leaders from three wide the entire trip to be well placed in striking distance on the far turn and lacked a closing bid finishing evenly. MEISTERSINGER
tracked the leaders from the rail down the backside, crept up to be prominent on the far turn with an early bid and flattened out coming home unable to
sustain the rally. NOTMYFIRSTRODEO prompted the pace to the far turn, was called upon to keep pace leaving the three-eighths pole and came up empty
fading from contention. JUST FOR THE MONEY raced near or at the rear throughout and was never involved. SACKETT raced in contention in mid-pack
for a half and came up empty.

Footnotes
ISIVUNGUVUNGU (SAF) exchanged several light bumps at the start but recovered to be well-positioned tracking in behind the leading pair and inside a foe,
cut the corner to bid inside the leaders at the top of the stretch, took charge and moved clear, was all out late and lasted. NOTHING BETTER stalked from
outside mostly three to four wide on the turn coming out a bit further turning into upper stretch, gained steadily with aim on the leader but missed. MAYA
PRINCE bumped the inside runner at the start, was between foes at the rear, moved out a bit leaving the turn in behind the leaders then was guided out
further in mid-stretch, kicked well but too late to get up for show honors. SWEET CHERRY PIE exchanged a couple light bumps at the start, was inside at
the rear and outsprinted early, saved ground on the turn, improved position in the stretch but was outfinished for show. DREAM SHAKE bumped with a rival
at the start, was outpaced early, raced between foes at the back into the turn three to four wide moving out five wide on that bend then further still to be
seven deep in upper stretch, failed to menace. THAT'S RIGHT pressed then prompted the pace dueling through the turn, weakened in the stretch.
CHISELER bumped with the inside runner at the start, was outside at the rear mostly four to six deep, never got near enough to threaten. CRUZIN MAN got
away well and assumed the early lead setting the pace off the rail, was soon prompted by an outside rival, dueled with that one coming a bit further off the
inside leaving the turn, gave way soon after in upper- to mid-stretch.

STYLE POINTS well held early to be rated mid-pack along the fence through the first turn, moved closer three wide between rivals down the backstretch,
waited to rally on the far turn still racing between rivals behind a three horse wall before her, angled out to the clear four wide turning for home , was set to
an all out drive to catch the leader in deep stretch and dueled with that one to the wire. DEEP SATIN stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn to be
well placed, rallied on the bend to engage the pacesetters nearing the quarter pole, took command opening a clear lead midway down the lane, was
collared by STYLE POINTS inside the final sixteenth and dueled to the wire with the top pair on the same bob at the wire. PENDULUM unhurried in the
early going to be at the back of the field, split rivals down the backside to gain position, angled four wide at the head of the lane to mount a belated stretch
rally finishing well to be best of the res. AWESOME CZECH dueled on the lead from two wide for the first three quarters, dug-in gamely when the closing
challengers engaged her turning for home, was unable to match them down the lane and weakened late in the drive. BELLE OF RIGHTS worked her way to
the rail down the backstretch, was well placed hugging the rail on the far turn and lacked a closing response when called upon. DISTORTED D'ORO tracked
the leaders to the three-eighths pole, chased them on the far turn and flattened out coming home. ONCOURTCOMMENTATOR raced three wide through
the first turn at the back of the field, remained near the rear throughout and passed weaker rivals in the lane without ever posing a threat. ASPEN DAWN
trailed most of the way never having been a factor. BROCKNARDINI raced mid-pack down the backside, loomed up four wide into the turn commencing a
bid and failed to sustain the rally dropping out of contention. CALL ANOTHER PLAY duel from the rail for three-quarters and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
DETERMINISTIC broke in a bit, faced mild traffic entering the first turn racing in behind and between, settled for the run up the backstretch dropping back
between runners nearing the far turn, was encouraged along by the five-sixteenths, moved out in the stretch still with much to do, finished strongly to get up
in time. GRAND MO THE FIRST was carried in a bit at the start, settled just off the leaders in the second group tracking inside, moved out under urging
near the five-sixteenths, was four wide in upper stretch with aim, bid at the furlong marker taking the lead but was outfinished. DESVIO bumped the outside
rival at the start, tucked in along the rail settling at the back saving ground on the first turn, advanced some into the far turn, was guided out at the quarter
pole then out further in upper stretch to be about four wide, ran on willingly to gain show honors. ECHO LANE bumped with the inside rival at the start,
gained forward position moving nearer the leader to stalk from outside heading into the first turn, took closer order and pressed into the far turn, bid between
foes at the five-sixteenths, dueled in upper stretch, could not kick on with the top ones but fought on well to outfinish the sparring partner while getting just
beaten for show honors. ZVEREV was well-placed early stalking from outside in the clear four deep, moved nearer on the far turn making a bid at the
five-sixteenths, dueled outside a rival but was outkicked. MASSIF was bumped into a rival at the start, came out a bit turning for home then further still once
in upper stretch, kept on willingly late. FULMINEO was caught outside four to five throughout, made a mild early advance past the half-mile marker to get
within range of the leaders, flattened out thereafter. FRONTLINE WARRIOR was toward the rear racing off the inside mostly three to five wide throughout
and was never near enough to threaten. IZZY D'ORO moved clear early to set the pace, faced pressure into the far turn, was overtaken past the
five-sixteenths and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORNING MIRACLE set a well rated pace down the backside, came under mild pressure on the turn, kicked clear turning for home and was never
threatened in the lane. HIGH SHOT reserved off the pace from six wide down the backside, angled in on the turn attempting to save ground, was still caught
four wide on the bend, angled seven wide at the top of the lane and closed well to be up for the place. CITY MINUTE unhurried early, gained ground from
three wide on the turn, rallied well in upper stretch to get the place spot inside the eighth pole and was outkicked late. UNCAPTURED DOVE well placed
along the fence into the turn, cut the corner coming for home to be prominent and finished evenly late. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF tracked the leaders through
the turn and lacked a closing rally. DONA ILLUSION hopped at the start breaking inward when off balance and trailed most of the way never posing a threat.
TALES TO TELL stalked the pace down the backside, made a three wide bid on the turn to loom in upper stretch and tired through the lane.

MRS. ASTOR was reserved early, between rivals entering the far turn, came five wide off the turn, closed well to get up in time to prove best under a drive.
SLEEPWALKER was rated early three to two wide, made a three wide bid off the bend and hit the front leaving the furlong marker and was clear nearing the
sixteenth marker but was denied late to just miss. TURF ROCKET was settled two wide early, between on the turn and came two wide off the bend and had
a mild late kick but needed more. MISS DELICIOUS was keen early, three wide into the first turn, set the pace while clear, moved to the inside and was
headed nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final furlong, lost show late. SKY VICTORY was allowed to settle early on the inside, moved out in the
lane and had a belated rally. MALAWNIA was off slowly, settled back early, made a four wide move on the far turn but flattened out. MORE THAN GLORY
was reserved early and lacked a rally. DOUBLE FIREBALL chased the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. ST. SUSAN pulled early four wide into
