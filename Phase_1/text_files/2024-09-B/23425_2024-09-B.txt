MISS YOU NO MORE stalked the pace from two wide on the backstretch then moved up to take command past the three furlong marker and drew off to
prove best. I'M A TRUMPER hustled to a clear early lead to the three furlong marker, faded but stayed on for the place. DIXIE CUP MARTINI trailed the
field to the turn while racing three to four wide and passed tired one. FLY FREE was away alertly then settled off the pace and was never a factor.

FLO TIME was allowed to settle near or at the back to midway through the turn then angled out to go four wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to be
up in the final yards. JAZZ BRUNCH sprinted to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was tiring in deep stretch and was caught in the final yard but held
the place. DONNA LIRICA saved ground and moved up going into the turn, matched strides inside of MRS. KRINKLES around the turn then made a late rail
bid to miss the place. AMY D prompted the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and was empty. MRS. KRINKLES stalked the pace from three wide
down the backstretch then matched strides outside of DONNA LIRICA around the turn and tired. THE PICK 3 DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY WAGERED.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIZE pressed the pace from the inside to the turn then fell back slightly but made a late rail bid to be up in the final jumps. MY LITTLE PRINCE was
hustled to a clear lead but was nipped at the wire. TIMEHASCOME stalked the pace from three wide then made a mild bid on the turn but lacked a late
response. JUST PLAIN ORNERY trailed the field to the top of the stretch then made a late run to pass tiring rival. MINOSO rushed up to vie for the lead
from three wide to midway through the turn and weakened. THE PICK 3 DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY WAGERED.

Footnotes
DRIVEHAPPY stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then moved up to engage the leaders at the top of the stretch and matched strides outside of
LIGHTNING STRUCK to deep stretch and drew clear late. LIGHTNING STRUCK shared the command from the inside of BRANNIGAN to the top of the
stretch then matched strides inside of DRIVE HAPPY to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. CREDIT RATING raced off the pace through the turn then
made a rail bid in the stretch and flattened out late. BRANNIGAN shared the command outside of LIGHTNING STRUCK to the top of the stretch and
weakened. TUFF WILLY TE was unhurried to the turn then made a mild three wide bid and tipped out to five wide in upper stretch but lacked the late
response. SCOOTER'S BOY was allowed to settle at the back while saving ground around the turn but was not a factor. THREE FOR THREE raced within
striking distance on the backstretch but fell back on the turn, angled out to six wide in upper stretch but lacked a rally. THE DAILY DOUBLE DID NOT HAVE
ANY MONEY WAGERED.
