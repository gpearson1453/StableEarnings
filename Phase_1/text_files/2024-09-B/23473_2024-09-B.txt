SPORTING STAR went to the front to co-lead inside of GOLDEN BEAUTY to the turn then pulled away near the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch to
prove best. ADETERMINEDMOM tracked the leaders while saving ground around the turn then tipped out to three wide for a late run and held the place.
STOLEN FUNDS trailed the field to the quarter pole then made a stretch rally to be up for the show. GOLDEN BEAUTY co-led outside of SPORTING STAR
to the turn then fell back slightly but kept on to prompt the pace to the quarter pole and tired. ALLIYAS CREATION was unhurried and saved ground around
the turn but failed to menace. ZIP IT KAREN was distanced and jogged in.

Footnotes
TIZ A STRATEGY showed no early speed and trailed the field to the quarter pole then was asked and tipped out to mid track for the late rally to be up in the
final jumps. RAINBOWS ON ICE stalked the pace to the turn then moved up from three wide and drove past the leader at the top of the stretch to take a
clear lead but was caught in the final jumps. PRINCESS VANELLOPE prompted the pace from three wide to the turn then fell back slightly around the turn
but lacked the late response and was able to stay on for the show. AFLEET DIVINE rushed up to vie for the lead on the inside then faded on the turn and
kept on saving ground to pass tiring rivals. KARMA DE VILLE was hustled to the lead and edged away around the turn but gave way at the top of the
stretch. BIG MARY was never a threat.

TAPIT DOWN stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then moved up on the turn and went between horses at the quarter pole to take the
lead but was challenged down the stretch but fended off the rivals to prevail. NORTHWIND sprinted to a clear lead from off the rail down the backstretch
then kept on to vie for the lead around the turn then made a rebid near the eighth pole and just missed. NON TOXIC bobbled leaving the gate then moved
up to take the lead near the seven sixteenths pole but was headed near the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch and gave way grudgingly. ETHAN
was allowed to settle while saving ground to no avail. MEET GEORGE JETSON showed little while racing near the back. CHICKEN N BISCUIT trailed the
field throughout.

HAIL STATE sprinted to an early clear lead but was headed at the half mile marker and dueled around the turn outside of OAKES CROSSING then pulled
away going into the stretch to prove best. BLUE SKYE JADE prompted the pace from three wide through the turn then made a mild bid to be up for the
place. DANCE FOR RANSOM was unhurried through the turn then showed late interest in the stretch run to be up for the show. OAKES CROSSING rushed
up to vie for the lead from the inside then moved up to engage HAIL STATE at the half mile marker and dueled around the turn with that one but weakened
in the stretch drive. OPTIMAL stalked the pace from three or four wide and raced four wide around the turn but failed to menace.

Footnotes
EURO TRACKING sprinted away and moved to engage the leader near the half mile marker and matched strides with HAPPY HOUR BOBBY then edged
away near the quarter pole and drew clear in the stretch. BRANNIGAN stalked the pace from four wide through the turn then showed a late kick to be
second best. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY sprint to lead but was headed near the half mile marker and matched strides with EURO TRACKING but couldn't keep
on and faded. DOCS CARO CAT vied for the early lead from three wide then prompted the pace around the turn but lacked a late response. SHARP AZ
NAILS was never a factor. RIVERSPORT raced wide through the turn and was never a threat. FUNNY ACTOR saved ground to no avail.
