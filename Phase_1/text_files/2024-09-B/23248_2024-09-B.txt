Footnotes
SMILE BABY SMILE brushed between rivals at the nine-sixteenths pole fighting for the lead three deep, dueled from outside leaving the backstretch, battled
three deep again midway around the turn, put away inner rivals in upper stretch and drew away under urging and was kept busy to the line. SKY SAILING
raced up close from inside, vied with outer rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, fought to upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong
but stayed on to secure second. SAPADILLA lost her path and steadied early, chased outside rivals then two wide into the turn, crept closer around the
bend, swung four wide into the lane and gained third. ACE ACE BABY bobbled leaving the gate, went up to vie for the lead between rivals and brushed
early, dueled from inside approaching the far turn, held a slim advantage over rivals on both sides past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command at the top of
the stretch and weakened. RESPECT THE CROWN bobbled leaving the gate, raced in range from inside, climbed leaving the backstretch, got put in tight
along the fence at the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch, moved out in the furlong ground and could not threaten. BEAUTY N THE BOLT got
crowded in the early stages, chased off the rail then got crowded again at the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane and failed to menace.
KYTHIRA pressed five deep early, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. HALF NELSON tossed her head and broke out, stalked widest up the
backstretch, rounded the bend six then five wide and faded. UNIFIED A. P. vied four deep early and brushed with inner rival at the nine-sixteenths pole,
stalked the leaders leaving the backstretch, took the turn four then three wide and tired.

Footnotes
TRUSTY RUSTY bobbled a bit leaving the gate, steadied briefly when the leader came over early, stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse urn,
chased outside a rival then was closest in pursuit to the far turn, reeled in the leader and drew alongside past the quarter pole, kicked clear into the stretch,
then drew off under a few taps of right-handed encouragement and steady handling late. STONEVICIOUS traveled three deep at the back on the clubhouse
turn, asked while angling out on the far turn, finished well through the lane but was no match for the winner. STOP AND A TRES flashed early speed then
took a stalking position on the inside, fell out of range on the backstretch, exited the far turn two to three wide and churned on for third. IT'S MY HOUSE
sped to the front and showed the way three then two wide early, opened up on the backstretch, held a diminished lead with a quarter mile remaining,
confronted by the winner shortly after, yielded to that rival entering the stretch and weakened in the late stages. KEEN HEIR forwardly placed and got
bumped from outside entering the first turn in the three path, moved in a bit around the bend, driven two wide into the lane and failed to menace. MOBOU
settled on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, took the second turn three wide and lacked further response. LORD SHELDON dropped back four then
three wide early, raced four deep on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and weakened. FUNKENSTEIN tracked five then four wide early,
remained wide and exited the far turn in the six path and lacked a rally. MONTANA got put in tight and checked early, traveled two wide towards the rear,
advanced inside on the far turn and had little left for the drive. IMPOSSIBLE TASK pulled along the inside early, trailed into the far turn, angled seven wide
on the far turn and could not make an impact.

LOVIN' ON THE RUN traveled in mid-pack off the rail, came four wide into the lane, rallied from outside and proved best late. ASHLEY stalked three deep
then two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, rallied in tandem with LOVIN' ON THE RUN and got outclosed in deep stretch. CYPRUS MOON
showed the way under pressure early then cleared, showed the way along the rail through the turn, collared by the top pair at the sixteenth pole and yielded
late. BAL DE MAR forwardly placed from inside, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch but finished evenly late. GIRVIN GAL pressed briefly from
outside the stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, roused two wide on the turn but flattened out in deep stretch. IRISH ROSE unhurried and dropped
back in the early going, saved ground through the turn and offered a mild rally to improve position. STEP IT OUT (IRE) got put in a bit tight leaving the gate,
advanced on the inside up the backstretch, stayed on the fence through the turn and could not produce a bid. SPIRIT RULES stalked between rivals then
had to take hold when crowded from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, saved ground around the bend, moved off the fence in the drive
and could not threaten. TINY PRANCER settled inside, got put in tight past the three-eighths pole, shifted over to the two path on the bend and lacked a
rally. MISS WENDY SUE coaxed along early, chased from off the pace, steadied at the three-eighths pole, exited the bend three wide and came up empty.
GIFT OF TIME keen under a hold early near the back, checked behind THEY ARE FOR SALE near the three-eighths pole, angled in from the four path, ran
into traffic behind TINY PRANCER tipping out at the quarter pole, went two wide through the turn and failed to menace. THEY ARE FOR SALE chased from
outside under coaxing, pulled up into the far turn, unsaddled on the bend and was transported off the track via equine ambulance.

PRACTICAL DREAM dueled from outside, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths pole, led along the rail into the stretch, then responded well to right
handed urging and strong handling hold CASH CALL at bay through the final furlong. CASH CALL hit the gate and shifted inward at the start, climbed early
chasing the top pair, took aim from the two path entering the lane, remained in range into deep stretch and could not summon the needed late kick. AUNT
MO turned her head and came away a bit slow, coaxed along from off the pace, moved to the rail for the turn, tipped back out and came three wide into the
lane, finished willingly down the stretch and earned the show honors. PURA VIDA PRINCESA chased the top pair outside a rival up the backstretch, lost
some ground on the turn, raced four wide turning for home and kept on to round out the superfecta. MIA SORPRESA broke in and bumped CLAPPING
TREES, climbed early and dropped back, went three deep into the turn, angled out and entered the lane in the five path, then offered a mild response to
improve position. CLAPPING TREES hopped then got bumped by MIA SORPRESA in the beginning, traveled three deep at the three-eighths pole, four
wide leaving the bend and lacked a rally. THIS NAME'S TAKEN bothered early by rival climbing along, raced between foes at the back into the turn, chased
in the two path into the stretch and was never a factor. WHIRLWIND bothered by outer rival at the start, raced inside a pair of rivals at the back up the
backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and never got involved. ALANIS dueled from inside to the turn, lost touch with the leader approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, weakened approaching the stretch and gave way. MAC AND CHEESE tracked out of range off the inside, dropped back on the turn,
came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF AUNT MO AND AFTER
A REVIEW RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

coaxed along while shifting to the rail into the far turn, had to wait in traffic around the bend, roused approaching the stretch, tipped out, drew alongside the
winner in deep stretch and just missed. MONGOLIAN ALTAI traveled two wide at the rear early on, went between foes into the far turn, remained two wide
to the stretch and bested the rest. AGATINO (IRE) broke out and brushed rival, tucked inside at the back, raced outside a rival into the far turn, chased three
deep into the lane, angled out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally to round out the superrfecta. PASS THE BATON moved to the inside racing near

Footnotes
MOMAD tracked out of range, raced wide through the turn, ridden five wide into the lane, rallied widest and drove clear late. BARTHOLDY forwardly placed
three deep into the turn, asked left handed exiting the bend, rallied between into deep stretch but got outclosed by the winner late. MIRAHMADI raced up
close then pressed the leader from outside, raced on even terms at the quarter pole, took over into the stretch, put away inner rival past the eight pole,
confronted by outer rivals shortly after and yielded to the top pair. ABITMISCHIEVOUS stalked in hand along the inside, chased two wide into the drive,
moved further out, ran into traffic midstretch and altered in but could not regain his lost momentum. HARRY HOUDINI broke well and cleared before being
pressured by MIRAHMADI up the backstretch, headed by that rival a quarter mile out, relinquished the lead entering the lane, fought to the eighth pole and
weakened. ARABIAN FLIRT coaxed along chasing well off the rail, went four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. WESTERN AVENUE stalked
between then off the rail while climbing a bit, traveled two wide then came three wide into the lane, angled inward in upper stretch and weakened. BOLT'S
TREASURE lugged in early then climbed along at the back, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the drive and could not make an impact. NASSAU
CIRCLE lacked early speed, raced in the four path entering the turn, moved down to the two path around the bend, tipped back out in the drive and failed to
threaten. BRUCKNER sat off the pace, angled from the four path down to the rail on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SORRENTO SKY (IRE) raced up close early, lost a bit of ground into the turn, crept closer around the bend, moved out and drew alongside the leader past
the sixteenth pole and overhauled the runner-up. RED PILL sped clear and set the tone in the early going, ridden along the rail through the turn, led clear to
the sixteenth pole and was overtaken by the winner. DOS PASSOS traveled along the inside at the back, saved ground through the turn, surged late from
the fence but ran out of time. DISKO TRIBUTE tracked two wide early, drew closer around the bend, went three wide into the lane and finished willingly.
BOLT SUPREMACY bumped leaving the gate then got bumped from outside early, traveled in mid-pack early on, rounded the bend two then three wide,
moved out in the drive and kept trying to the wire. OSCAR JOY broke in and bumped rival, trailed early well off the rail then outside a rival, was forced to
check from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, raced between foes around the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch and improved
position. WILL BE tracked from inside, lost ground on the turn, moved off the rail in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) got bumped on
both sides at the start, chased outside foes and bumped with inner rival early, rushed up to a forward position outside the pacesetter, chased two wide
through the turn and weakened. EDDIE'S LAST got crowded between rivals early, urged along the inside then two wide on the turn, tipped out in the lane
and failed to menace. IRISH ROYALTY broke in and bumped on both sides, raced three deep at the back into the turn, four deep at the quarter pole,
entered the lane in the five path and could not make an impact. HABEAS got bumped around at the start, raced towards the rear, went two wide into the
turn, angled out to the four path around the bend and never got involved.

TIGER IN MY TANK vied briefly then cleared outer rivals, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch, met the bid from BEE EYE GEE at the eighth
pole and gamely prevailed. BEE EYE GEE stalked inside rivals up the backstretch was closest in pursuit around the bend, took aim two wide entering the
stretch, challenged from outside in the furlong grounds, dug in late but could not get by the winner. WINDRIBBON tossed his head and broke in the air to
come away well behind the field, trailed on the inside into the turn, passed a few rivals around the bend, angled out in the lane and finished with late run to
earn the show. MIO BAMBINO climbed along up the backstretch, steered inward then raced between rivals into the turn, angled out past the five-sixteenths
pole, came seven wide into the stretch and offered a mild rally to earn a minor award. NO MORE DING DONGS tracked wide up the backstretch, entered
the lane in the five path and flattened in the late stages. COACH CRONIN raced in range briefly then dropped off the pace under coaxing, went two wide
into the lane, split foes midstretch and kept on to improve position. KERRY GOLD chased off the rail under coaxing, angled in to save ground on the turn,
cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. TEQUILA TALKIN forwardly placed three deep leaving the backstretch, remained off the rail and exited the
bend three wide, then failed to offer a response when asked. MIRINDA stalked outside rivals in the early going, went five then four wide through the turn and
weakened. BOB'S BLUE MOON tracked between rivals, got shuffled on the turn, went three to four wide into the lane and came up empty. RICKS RED
STORM bobbled a bit leaving the gate, climbed early and dropped off the pace, went three deep into the turn, trailed past the five-sixteenths pole, angled in
and failed to menace. IRISH CORN showed early speed then chased between into the turn, dropped back around the bend, came three wide into the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ARTISLAS traveled in mid-pack along the inside, drew closer between rivals on the backstretch, moved over to the rail again on the far turn, challenged
from inside in upper stretch, put a head in front past the eight pole, edged away from MISCHIEF RIVER in deep stretch and held over the late run from
SABERTOOTH in the closing moments. SABERTOOTH unhurried three then two wide at the back, split foes on the far turn then angled back inside, moved
off the fence in the lane, closed fast inside the leaders late but ran out of time. SCIPIO steadied into the first turn, traveled three then two wide towards the
rear, had to take hold when running up on heels at the midway point, went three deep then two wide on the far turn, spun three wide into the drive, tipped
out at the top of the stretch, surged late and got up for third. MISCHIEF RIVER vied three deep into the first turn then dueled from outside around the bend,
cleared inner rival at the half-mile pole, moved inside, led a bit off the rail into the lane, challenged by ARTISLAS in upper stretch, relinquished the lead past
the eight pole, stayed on through deep stretch while getting passed for the place and show. SHOW OF FORCE vied inside a pair of rivals then dueled
around the clubhouse turn, stalked the leader past the half-mile pole, switched over to the two path, drew alongside MISCHIEF RIVER again at the quarter
pole but could not keep up at the top of the lane, stayed within striking distance through the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. IVAN THE
GREAT reserved in the two path, went three deep into the far turn, shifted to the two path around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and needed to find
more late. AN CHORR DUBH (IRE) got bumped from outside leaving the gate, taken to the inside off the pace, raced between rivals into the far turn, drew
closer under light coaxing around the bend, roused entering the lane and lacked the needed late punch in the furlong grounds. SNOWDONIA tracked
outside a rival out of range, three deep in the middle stages, tipped out to the four path around the second turn and could not rally. COACH CHUCK broke in
and bumped rival, pulled the rider along in the early going, continued to tug on the backstretch from inside, went between foes into the far turn, angled out in
upper stretch and could not rally. TOPPERS AT SEASIDE lost his path and altered out into the first turn, traveled three deep at the rear, went four wide on
the far turn before angling down to the two path but failed to get involved. TIZ HAPPY showed early foot between rivals then ceded command and took a
stalking position in the two path, remained in good position into the far turn, lost ground two, three, then four deep on the far turn and weakened down the
lane. RUN FOR KIDDER stalked along the inside, fell out of range approaching the far turn, tired around that bend and faded down the lane. PANUCO sat
off the pace four then three deep early, coaxed along into the far turn, dropped back around the bend, trailed into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

seized command leaving the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire under left-handed encouragement and strong handling.
MCKINZIE STREET stalked the top pair keenly in hand early, suffered a mild shuffle at the half-mile pole, chased three wide through the turn, finished
determinedly down the lane but had to settle for second best. CITIZEN BULL allowed to settle outside a rival at the back, gained four deep around the bend,
flattened in the late stages but was able to hold third. GETAWAY CAR dueled from inside, inched ahead from outer rival at the half-mile pole, cleared
leaving the backstretch, confronted by GAMING midway around the turn, relinquished the lead approaching the stretch and weakened in the drive. R
HEISMAN raced in range between rivals, got crowded a bit at the half-mile pole, steadied leaving the backstretch, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. RANK climbed in the early going at the back of the field, raced in the three path entering the turn, angled out and was driven five wide
into the stretch but failed to rally. BROTHER TONY dueled from outside then pressed inner rival at the half-mile pole, could not keep up approaching the
turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
RUGELACH took control early and moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, drew away at the quarter pole and was kept busy through the lane, to
remained unchallenged to the wire. CORNELIA FORT stalked along the rail, coaxed through the far turn, stayed on the fence in the lane and bested the
rest. LADY CLAYPOOLE (IRE) settled in the two path then between rivals, had to pause when running up on the heels of a rival approaching the first turn,
moved inside on the backstretch, came off the fence and outkicked SHOCKING GREY for third. SHOCKING GREY traveled two wide towards the rear in
the early going, remained in the two path to the far turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped five wide into the lane and got outfinished for the
show honors. MAHINA off a bit slow to begin, tucked inside at the back of the pack, swung out into the lane and summoned a mild rally. PLEASANT WAVE
tracked two wide early, went three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the drive and could not rally. GRACE PERIOD (FR) located near the back of
the field early on the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, tipped out further at the top of the lane, lacked room in traffic from upper to midstretch and
improved position once moving to a clear path. SPECIAL FLOWER sat off the pace outside a pair of rivals early, exited the backstretch two wide, eased out
on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, found traffic in upper stretch and weakened. MONTJICA (FR) broke a bit slow, traveled outside a rival at
the back, got carried out leaving the far turn and failed to menace. ANDIAMO RAGAZZA laid off the pace along the rail, drew closer in the middle stages,
got boxed in at the quarter pole and again in upper stretch, moved to a clear path but was too late. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE stalked the lone leader three
deep, ridden along still three wide on the far turn and faded down the lane. ANNIE'S JOY stalked in hand early in the two path, was closest in pursuit of the
leader approaching the stretch but tired in the drive.
