SILENT PRINCESS was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. QUEEN SAHARA showed
speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. IMPRESSIVE STYLE was away alertly,
raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. ALWAYS MY FAULT was in range but chased on the turn and dropped
back through the stretch. BAMBOO'S BABE stumbled at the start, lost the rider and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE
RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
CLARAYOUTHEBEST was in range, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. SUPER CHRISTIE set a pressured
pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was unhurried early and roused
from the inside on the turn but needed more. MISS SINGH ANGEL was away alertly and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
had nothing left. FEROCIOUS QUEEN was in touch early but trailed the field on the turn and was no real threat.

Footnotes
DIXIERIBSY set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. EYE GOT IT GOOD was hustled
early, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. REMEMBERING RHODA was unhurried early, had a
mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. STOLE THE RING was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. LOADED SECRET was away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top
of the stretch faded.
