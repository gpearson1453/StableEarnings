Footnotes
DRINKS AT THE CLUB forwardly placed leaving the start, got shuffled back a bit in the early stages and trailed approaching the turn, guided four wide
nearing the quarter marker and loomed nearing the top of the lane, responded to urging and vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command
into deep stretch and dug in to prevail. SLADE CUTTER broke alertly, settled just off of the early pace and stalked three wide nearing the turn, mounted a
two wide bid along the bend, vied for the lead into upper stretch, took a slight lead and battled approaching the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final
sixteenth and was clear of the rest for second. NO D'ORO forwardly placed in the early running, saved ground into the turn, angled to the three path at the
quarter marker, rallied into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong grounds, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held well in the end for third. SIR
LUCAS bobbled at the start and away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, raced outside of rivals along the turn and was
urged five wide into the stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and missed for third. SENOR FEDERICO off a step slowly, was hustled in the early
stages, chased the pace from the inside approaching the turn, saved ground into the bend and lost position nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response
in the stretch drive and tired. MY AMIGO sent to assume early command, set the pace heading to the turn, dictated the terms through moderate fractions
nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and faded in the drive. BANDON GIG raced close up to the moderate early pace, a bit hard to
place nearing the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter marker and gave way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

CATCH N ANGEL was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the moderate pace outside of ANNIE FOX approaching the turn, tracked the pacesetter
two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, asked for run into the stretch, took command nearing the furlong marker, drew away in the final sixteenth and
was hand urged to the finish in a solid debut win. ANNIE FOX showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and sprinted to a clear
lead heading to the half-mile marker, set moderate fractions while clear into the turn, was overtaken by CATCH N ANGEL into upper stretch, could not
match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. COIFFEUR tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, was well
placed while saving ground into the turn, could not impact the top two in the stretch drive and just held for third at the finish. STORMY KISS settled off of the
moderate early pace, chased two to three wide along the turn, lost ground into the stretch, mildly re-rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for third.
DIXIE ROSE LEE broke out at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, passed a tired rival in the stretch drive and did not factor. CANDY LITZ
chased the moderate early pace while outside of rivals, went three wide into the turn, lost position at the quarter marker and was outrun in the stretch drive.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
REEF CITY was allowed to settle then started a forward move on the turn, bid four wide at the top of the stretch, finished strong under steady handling and
intermittent urging to outlast a fast closing rival. MAJESTIC COTTON broke outward at the start and did not show much speed, was allowed to settle into
stride and race five wide down the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch just behind the quartet battling for the lead at the top of the stretch, rallied
boldly and just missed. PINEAPPLE JUICE settled in the middle of the pack, through the initial furlong then pulled up into contention heading in the turn,
was three deep of four horses fanned across the track at the top of the stretch, ran on willingly but was out-finished by the top pair. MARK LOVES ANN was
quick into stride and sent for the lead, opened a clear advantage heading into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch with a trio of challengers to the outside,
held on gamely to mid-stretch then weakened late. MOMO'S KIDDO hustled from the break and moved up to challenge MARK LOVES ANN, settled in a
tracking position just behind that one, launched a serious bid from the quarter pole and turned for home between horses, finished willingly but was outkicked
in the final yards. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM was hustled out of the gate but was not fast enough to contest the early pace, stayed to the inside and was last
into the turn, finished with some late interest but was never a threat. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
REGAL PATRIOT tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn, loomed at the quarter marker and took command into upper
stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker and was ridden out in deep stretch as much the best. SATANTA unhurried in the early stages, improved
position two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for the stretch drive, closed in the final furlong, could not impact the winner in deep
stretch and got up in time to secure the place honors. SMUGGLER'S RUN broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the moderate pace from the
outside, was well placed nearing the turn, chased three wide approaching the quarter marker, was outkicked in the stretch drive and was overtaken for
second in the final yards. BLAZING PEME showed early speed and assumed command away from the start, set a moderate pace while clear nearing the
half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and set the pace while off of the rail heading to the quarter pole, was overtaken by REGAL PATRIOT into the
stretch, chased the winner to the furlong grounds and faded in the late stages. SQUARE CAT settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground along the
turn and lacked a late rally. NORTH COUNTRY allowed to settle while never far back in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace three to four wide
nearing the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and could not muster a late response. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
C HER BEAUTY was away quickly then was allowed to dictate pedestrian fractions, repelled all challenges along the way then kept a determined STARLIT
HARBOR at bay down the stretch while drifting out to the middle of the track in the final furlong. STARLIT HARBOR did not get away well then circled the
field around the first turn to gain contention but very wide of the tight pack down the backstretch, launched a bid approaching the half-mile marker and was
nearly even with C HER BEAUTY at the quarter pole then came under heavy pressure and battled gamely down the stretch but could not get by that
stubborn foe while being floated wide in the final furlong. MISS PERU got caught four wide into the first turn the advanced under light restraint to race
mid-pack raced between horses down the backstretch, then responded when asked to go on, broke free of the tracking group with about three furlongs to
run, tried hard to catch the top pair but was not quite good enough. LOOKOUT PASS broke a beat slow then was bothered by RICKELLE a few strides out,
went three wide through the clubhouse turn then was last of the tight group down the backstretch, bided time there while racing three to four wide, started a
mild rally from the seven-sixteenths marker, loomed, but could not find another gear when needed down the lane. MAMARANDO came away in good order
and allowed to settle mid-pack, raced between horsees in the two path to the half-mile marker, did not quicken when asked and was not a factor in the late
stages. SILVER FLIRT was last away and was last into the first turn, advanced quickly forward down the backstretch and was up with the leader before the
half-mile marker, began to drop out of contention passing the three furlong pole and was not a factor from that point. WINNING LUCK was close up through
the first turn then dropped back and was boxed in as the field bunched up down the backstretch was asked to go on from the nine-sixteenths pole, then had
to steady, lost momentum, then went three wide around the far turn and did not rally. RICKELLE veered in after the start and bothered to two rivals to the
inside, raced close up for a half mile faded to the back of the field and had nothing to offer in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CLEVER CLOVER sent to assume early command, set moderate fractions while well handled into the turn, set a pressured pace nearing the quarter
marker, met the bid of GRUBAUER into upper stretch, dug in while kept to firm right handed urging past the furlong marker, was unyielding into the final
sixteenth and determinedly held for the win at the finish. GRUBAUER forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace outside of
CLEVER COVER, raced three wide into the turn and pressed the pace nearing the quarter marker, chased CLEVER CLOVER into upper stretch, Espinoza
lost his riding crop at the furlong marker, inched closer past mid-stretch and battled into the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in the late
stages and was clear of the rest for second. NAFTIS settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter
pole, swung four wide for the stretch drive, finished well in the final sixteenth and was clear for third. VALIANT SON allowed to settle away from the start,
improved position into the turn while between runners, chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, finished evenly in the stretch drive and was
outkicked in the final sixteenth. HALO RANDO tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, got shuffled back a bit at the three-eighths pole and
trailed approaching the quarter marker, re-rallied in the stretch drive but needed more in the late stages. EL GALLITO tracked the moderate early pace from
the inside, saved ground into the turn, lost position at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MY BUCKET LIST was unhurried early, raced on the inside of the trailing group through the first two furlongs, tipped out to the two path while starting a rally
with three furlongs to run, continued to run on well through the stretch and won clear despite running on the left lead. LESSONS OF AUTISM sprinted clear
from the break, held the margin through the turn, turned away a bid form ALMANERA at the five-sixteenths pole, opened up on the field in the stretch then
started to weaken in the final furlong and was unable to hold off the late charge of the winner while clear of the third horse. TOO MUCH INFO raced in the
middle of the pack to the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, was kept to task and gained third. ALMANERA (IRE) showed good speed from the start, was
confidently handled tracking LESSONS OF AUTISM going into the turn, then was unable to catch that rival, came under pressure from the quarter pole and
flattened out in the stretch. TITOS WITH A TWIST dropped far behind the field early, was still well back of the rest on the turn then rallied and past a few in
the late stages. CUT ACROSS SHORTY raced on the outside of the trailing group while three to four wide to the turn, struggled to keep up on the turn while
still wide, was kept to task but was no factor in the stretch. STORMIN GALILEO came away well and was close up to the turn, loomed a threat while saving
ground then came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. THUNDER OF ZION raced between horses in the trailing group
down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, was put into a drive from the three-eighths marker but could not threaten. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
