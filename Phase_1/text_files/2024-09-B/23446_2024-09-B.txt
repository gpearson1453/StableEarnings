missed. A LATE ONE trailed early, was asked to quicken leaving the backstretch, and lacked a closing response. BOSS MAN CAN stalked the pace while
three wide, and faded. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH hustled away, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SAXON SAGA vied for the early lead from the two path, pressed the pace while three wide in the backstrech, dueled outside of DON'T LET ME DOWN, and
narrowly prevailed after a long hard drive. DON'T LET ME DOWN contested the early pace from the rail, matched strides inside of SAXON SAGA through
the backstretch, battled on through the stretch but was outfinished. VIATURE sat just off the pace from between foes, lacked running room into the final turn,
shifted outside early in the stretch and rallied late to earn show. KYSTONE tracked the pace while three wide, lodged a bid outside and lacked a closing
response that was needed. STREET VENDOR saved inside and tired early.

TAYLOR FIELD went in pursuit of the leader in the far turn, swept the lead, and just held under a late drive. HANDSOME HENRY closed steadily and just
missed after a game effort. DONTBRINGMEDOWN hustled away but was outsprinted to the turn, raced in closest pursuit, was under urging through the
stretch and was outfinished. DOUG'S HERO was four wide leaving the opening turn, and passed tiring rival late. TENNESSEE MOSES quickly opened up
on the field, held good margins in the backstretch, and stopped in the stretch. JUMP THE QUEUE offered little. SHINING TIGER chased inside and failed to
threaten. THISCATSGOTSPEED outrun throughout.
