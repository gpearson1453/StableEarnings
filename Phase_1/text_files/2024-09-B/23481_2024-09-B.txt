UNDERRATED rated close off the rail the first turn, took the nod approaching the seven sixteenths pole and was pressured for more leaving the three
eighths, was met while two deep past the quarter pole but dug in under determined handling and edged clear late yards. WELL SPOTTED veered out
leaving the gate and made contact with Sugarfree Rootbeer then settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and
drew to even terms inside leaving the quarter pole, dug in gamely through the upper stretch but reluctantly ceded later yards. SHARP STYLE was forced out
at the break and rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and
dueled through the stretch for third. JANES JENSEN stalked inside on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. ONYOURSIDE saved ground. SUGARFREE ROOTBEER veered out leaving the gate and was
bumped a stride later, raced in the three path the first turn then saved ground on the far turn. THOR'S LAD took a slim lead in the four path on the first turn,
was met and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.

rounded the turn off the rail and dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and was shuffled back at the rail in late yards. GREEN GABLES chased and
raced close in the three path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and flattened later yards. GARY DOING BIZ chased through the backstretch, raced off the
rail on the turn then eased out into the lane and finished evenly. AT THE HALF chased, raced in the three and four paths on the turn and showed little in the

GALACTIC GLORY exchanged contact with Fuji Fire leaving the gate then closed to contention and stalked off the rail, took over past the nine sixteenths
pole and came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and held on with steady stretch handling. TOUCHED UP settled
in the five path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dueled to clear second inside the eighth pole and
finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. CROWN THAT SAINT rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. FUJI FIRE exchanged contact with Galactic Glory leaving the gate then saved ground on
the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. SPEEDZILLA saved ground racing well back. RESTRIKE
raced in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened while drifting on the far turn. FROSTED CUPP
set the early pace inside, was met past the nine sixteenths pole and faded readily through the backstretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
