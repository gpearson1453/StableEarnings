Footnotes
NAVAL EMPIRE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, challenged on the outside with a furlong to go
and pulled clear. LIVANA tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, swung wide entering
the stretch, gained ground outside and chased the eventual winner home. LA TACHE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the
three path around the turn and into the lane and weakened late. MUNNIS PRETTY trailed the field on the outside in the early going, saved ground around
the turn and made no bid. BEE MOUNTAIN led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired on the rail in
the stretch.

inside, saved ground rounding the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, and ran on for place. FEAR THE DEER prompted the early pace while two
wide, continued to race two wide around the far turn, but evened out late to show. GOLDIE'S BOY trailed into the stretch from inside but stayed on and
improved position late. SKYDIVING rated from the three path, was ridden five wide into the stretch, but was one paced. SAM IN STYLE stalked inside, was
coaxed from inside around the far turn, but faded into the stretch. HELLFIRE BOB raced in midpack from the three path but was empty coming into the
stretch.

up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and faded to the wire. NOBLE PRESENT bumped with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the early going, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. KIMSFAVORITESTORM raced off the

Footnotes
CHICA BOOM tracked from the two path, ranged up while making a bid from the three path coming into the stretch, and drew clear. SAFE TRAVELS set a
loose lead, was roused while racing inside at the top of the lane, yielded to the eventual winner passing the eight pole but held on for place. GIRL'S ON
FIRE chased from the two path, was ridden from the inside at the top of the stretch, and improved for show. TIZ NENA raced in midpack from the inside,
was driven three wide heading into the stretch, but finished evenly. SCHATZI rated from the three path, was cued from the four path at the top of the stretch,
and improved position. MAP THE MOMENT stalked from inside, was roused while two wide coming into the stretch, but faded. WASSER broke out, trailed
early and never factored. VIOLET JESSOP raced from well back and inside, checked along the inside into the stretch, but was empty.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE GREEN saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail approaching the
quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and held off the closers to the wire. FLYING FORTRESS raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn
and up the backstretch, began to move up while racing four wide around the second turn, gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane and just
missed. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and chased the winner home, narrowly missing. GO BIG BLUE NATION raced in the three path around the first turn, settled
in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground in the
stretch and was the best of the rest. STAR RULES raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses,
navigated the far turn from the two path, gained ground mildly in the lane and was outkicked late. AURUM chased the leader from the two path through the
opening half mile, continued pursuit of that rival around the far turn and flattened out in the final furlong. SMARMY showed the way while saving ground
around the first turn, opened up on the field while racing up the backstretch, began to slow down while saving ground around the second turn and weakened
further in the stretch. LONGPANTS REQUIRED raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the
two path and was not a threat. INSIDE THE BOX raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack between
horses, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up empty from there. UNA LUNA raced at the back of the pack on the outside around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the four path and made no bid. FOLLY saved ground at the back of the pack the entire way
around the oval and was never a factor. This race was mistakenly listed to run on the outer turf course but was run on the inner. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE RACE IS HAND TIMED.

eighths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and dueled gamely to the wire, getting the head bob for the win. KOKO STAR saved ground around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path, began a bid entering the stretch and gained
ground steadily on the outside to just miss. NOICATTARO bumped the horse to his outside at the break, raced inside at the back of the pack around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground late on the rail down the lane. FEISTY KITTEN raced in the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position mildly in the
stretch. SON OF GRACE was bumped by the horse to his outside and stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to trail the field on the inside in the early going,
began to improve position while saving ground around the far turn and finished evenly. SWIFT KID trailed the field from the three path through the opening
half mile, came around the turn in the two path and offered no bid. MR EVERYTHING led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to
show the way up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn and tired in the stretch. CHILLING SECRET raced off the pace while saving
ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded between horses in the lane.
