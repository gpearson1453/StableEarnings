Footnotes
D T R DEBUTANTE was away alertly to stalk the pace of CLEVER GEM while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, quickly opened a clear margin and raced in hand to the wire. EVIL TEMPTATION broke sharply to chase the pace of CLEVER GEM while racing
three-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to
be clearly second best. TRICKING TRIXIE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. CLEVER GEM set a
pressured pace from the inside for a half and weakened. BEACH BODY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
DIAMOND ONTHE TOE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGNUS WHO pulled to the lead soon after the break, was well rated through the back-stretch while saving ground and held TAB ME OUT safely to the
wire. TAB ME OUT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, moved within striking range of the winner but failed to
gain late. WILD FIREWATER was away in good order to chase the winner from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. DUDE ROW
was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. BIGG LIMO lagged early, raced off the rail through the second turn
and was eased through the stretch. CORA BELLE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was eased through the lane.

MAMA WAS A ROCKET dueled for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and edged away from GONE PROSPECTING through
the final yards. GONE PROSPECTING disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way grudgingly to that rival in the drive. GEORGE WHO
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH lacked early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. HENNESSY LOOKER RF was away alertly to vie for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened
after going a half. ATTILAS TORNADO was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. W F PRIMA
DONNA showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
