Footnotes
MEMPHIS MAFIA pursued the loose pacesetter, advanced into the stretch, wore down that rival and drew clear in the late stages. IMPERIAL MOON quickly
took control, maintained a long lead to the final sixteenth and weakened. CONGRATS ANSWER dropped far behind then offered some late energy to gain
the show. STARSHIP BLANCA chased the loose leader wide and flattened out through the stretch. SHIRLEY GREENE trailed for half a mile and was never
in contention. HEY DEWZPOTS broke slowest, rushed up inside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DEPLANE raced at the back of the pack inside, swung wide into the stretch, surged and was just up in time. AGELESS ENDEAVOR vied between rivals
throughout, was bothered in midstretch and continued gamely to the finish. MUTTLEY earned a narrow advantage dueling inside, came out bumping rival in
the stretch and weakened slightly. GOLDEN WILDCAT battled between rivals throughout, was bumped about in midstretch and battled to the wire. CLEAR
CUT forced the pace four wide and began fading after half a mile. NICKY DA FOX chased off the pace then made a gradual gain inside through the stretch.
PEACE CRUSADER rushed up inside for a quarter mile and stopped abruptly. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the fourth finisher against
the third finisher for interference in the stretch, MUTTLEY was disqualified and placed fourth.

E T'S CANDY MAN dueled along the inside, shook loose midway on the turn, widened in the stretch and stayed safe. INDIRECTLY lacked speed inside,
saved ground throughout then closed well through the stretch. PYLON dueled winner outside, faded on the turn then came again outside to gain the show.
SPECTACULAR KID stalked the dueling leaders outside and continued well to the finish. DON'T RECALL lagged far behind then caught tiring rivals late.
BIZZY GILLESPIE dropped back inside and was always outrun. HIM SHE KISSES made a menacing inside bid on the turn then gave way through the
stretch.

POP THE CLUTCH lacked speed, swung very wide rallying into the stretch, closed strongly and moved clear late. BELLA MARIA made a menacing outside
bid on the turn, angled inside in stretch and was up for place. SNAPPY RIDE alternated for the advantage in two path and finished willingly. DEBBIE'S
SURPRISE settled outside the dueling leaders, advanced on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. RUBY DOOBY DOO broke in a complete tangle and
raced far behind. SOUL SEARCHER saved ground and was always outrun. FIGI'S TALE broke very slowly, rushed to the front inside and stopped after half
a mile. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race concerning RUBY DOOBY DOO.

BRODY SLAM reserved close up, angled out on the final turn then drew off through the final furlong while geared down late. IZA ONE lacked speed then
advanced well outside through the stretch. RELENTLESS RUBY prompted the pace, led briefly at the quarter pole then tired. THE BIGGEST ONE broke
alertly and led inside, was collared on the final turn then weakened. MANUELA broke awkwardly, moved wide before half a mile, bid then weakened.
LULINDA'S HEART chased within range inside early then gave way readily. RISEN CHANGE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

NO FOOLING DUDE set the pace inside, drifted out into the stretch then held inside rival safe repelling a challenge and edging clear again. SILVER FURY
angled inside on the turn, loomed a threat in the stretch and was second best. KEEPING THE PEACE eased back after the opening quarter, went after the
leader on the turn, loomed threat but flattened out in the stretch. LAWN BOY (GB) lacked speed then finished well missing the show. OFF THE MEDS
dropped back at the start and was never in contention. TOMATER GATOR failed to keep up early and weakened steadily. AMERICAN FLEET chased well
off the leaders and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ABHAILE controlled the pace, widened in hand on the final turn then coasted home with a huge advantage. CREEDIBILITY lacked speed, advanced inside
to the quarter pole, angled out and gained place. HOLA PRINCESS was taken up between rivals early then closed along the inside. WEST HORIZEN raced
inside, closest pursuit of winner on the final turn then faltered. TAYLOR'S BELLE chased outside, was asked for run into the far turn but had no response.
ANGEL RAPHAEL came in early crowding rival, forced the pace half a mile and stopped. PARTY IN THE SAND lagged far behind throughout losing contact
with her field.

Footnotes
GRAVITRON set the pace under a firm hold, widened when ready on the final turn and pulled away as much the best. DRIVEN BY SPEED dropped back
outside, continued wide and rallied for the place. A RING THING settled off the leaders, moved three wide on the final turn and flattened out. SOLEMN
OATH raced off the pace inside and lacked a solid rally. AMPLIO ESQUEMA trailed early inside and was never a factor. BOOM BOOM GIRL moved
between rivals down the backstretch and faltered. IN A SPIN dropped far behind in the two path and was never in contention. SALLY'S MUSTANG
prompted the winner to the final turn and gave way.

WORLD PARTY stalked the pace outside, took over nearing the quarter pole and edged away under moderate pressure. J D'S VISTA settled off the pace,
advanced on the final turn and continued gamely while easily second best. SEA PINES set a clear pace for half a mile, was collared on the final turn and
proved empty late. WILL LEMON DANCE was urged close up inside, dropped back on the final turn then moved wide in the lane. PUMPERNICKEL chased
wide, faded before half a mile and was never a factor. RISQUE'S JEWEL raced off the leaders wide and never involved. SHETALKSTOMUCH lacked speed
along the inside and was always outrun. ARTIE'S ROSE chased far behind throughout.

quarter, moved very wide and closed well in the stretch. AWESOMENEWYEAR chased off the leaders in the two path and rallied too late.
DREAMINOFDASIES raced far behind outside then advanced wide with good energy. MADE TO HUSTLE dueled along the inside and weakened in the
stretch. ONE TOUGH ROSE prompted the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. SWIFT FACTOR saved ground off the leaders and faded. SILVER
BANSHEE raced inside behind the dueling leaders and tired. ALMOST EVIL lunged at the break and raced far back throughout.
