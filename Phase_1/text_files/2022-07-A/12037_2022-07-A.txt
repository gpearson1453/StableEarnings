Footnotes
JOJOMAR pressed the early pace from between rivals, then rated off the pace three wide on the turn, shifted out five wide leaving the three sixteenths,
closed well to hit the front leaving the sixteenths pole, then held off MOTI late to prove best, driving. MOTI hit the gate and was slow into stride early, then
advanced on the turn two wide, came three wide into the drive, then closed well and split rivals by the sixteenth pole and was gaining late to just miss.
INTERCEPT vied for the lead and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but faded late. WOLFINBARGER vied for the lead on the inside and gave way
grudgingly. THE BEST CANDY was outrun early, came widest into the lane and showed some late foot. ROCKET BLAST tracked the early pace, then was
on the inside on the turn and weakened. NEVER COMPROMISE chased the pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened.

JUST DEAL WITH IT was allowed to settle early, made a four wide run nearing the quarter pole, closed well on the outside under left handed crop urging,
then got up in time to prove best. HANFORD was well rated early two wide, made a three wide move on the turn and drew clear by the quarter pole, then
was still clear by the furlong marker but was caught late. TOUCH OF PRINCE was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn but
came up empty in the drive, bested rest. SKIMBLE SHANKS was carried out wide into the first turn, then had to be used to go ahead and set the pace and
move to the inside entering the backstretch, then was headed on the turn and gave way. SAM LORDS was carried out wide and bumped into the first turn,
then checked on the first turn, then finally shifted in entering the backstretch and tired on the turn. KAZTHAROS was away alertly, then was trying to move
to the inside by the finish line the first turn, then got rank going into the clubhouse turn, got out badly on the first turn, then was pulled up leaving the nine
sixteenths while still rank, walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN, AFTER REVIEW THE
RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

CINQUE AMORE was away alertly and soon clear to set a big lead early while off the inside, then widened the margin on the turn, then went on to win
easily while wrapped up through the lane. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN chased the early pace two wide, then switched to the inside nearing the quarter pole,
then rallied for the place award to be clearly second best. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL chased the early pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came three
wide into the lane but was empty, bested rest. SAKARI was settled early and three wide on the turn and was not a threat. FRED'S SHEILA was settled four

LA LIMONADA was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn, hit the front nearing the furlong marker
and then drew off to prove much the best under mild urging. LIME SQUASH was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, came two wide into the lane and
proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place late. OH SO JAZZY was well placed early on the inside, then moved to be two wide entering the
backstretch, made a three wide bide by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive, held show award. MELODIA was reserved early, advanced three wide
on the turn but lacked the needed bid in the lane, missed show award. INANNA'S QUEST was allowed to settle early, advanced five wide leaving the half
mile marker, was also five wide on the turn and then was empty. LAUGH IT OFF was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally. LOOP THE LOOP chased
the pace four wide and tired. LIGHTNING ROUND failed to menace. JANE stalked the pace three wide and tired.

CRUSH IT was rated early, then was between rivals on the backstretch by the half mile marker, made a three wide move on the turn to take over nearing
the quarter pole, then drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under mild urging. HOT N SPICY LOVE pressed the early pace and made a two
wide bid on the turn to vie for command leaving the five sixteenths, then angled out by the furlong marker but could not go with the winner, second best.
COLONEL MOORHEAD tracked the pace on the inside and then was two wide by the quarter pole, weakened, bested rest. BORSA VENTO was reluctant
to load, prompted the pace four wide and tired. ALL TACKED UP set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. PAL CAL was bumped at the start, then
was four wide on the first turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SPEED SLOT pressed the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole and shook clear by the furlong marker, then held on latye to
prove best under left handed crop urging. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was reserved early, advanced three wide by the quarter pole, angled out nearing the
furlong marker and closed well on the outside to just miss. MONEYONTHELINE was with the pace four wide, then came five wide into the drive and ran on
late to best the rest. MISTER ARANGUIZ set a pressured pace two wide and then weakened in the lane. JEKYLL ISLAND pressed the pace on the inside
and weakened in the drive. CROWN'S DEFENDER stalked the pace five wide and weakened.
