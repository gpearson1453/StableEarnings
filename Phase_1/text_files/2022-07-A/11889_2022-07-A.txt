BON FIRE DIVA set a loose lead, opened up rounding the far turn, and was kept to task to hold on. GLOSSAMER chased from inside, was hustled inside
rounding the far turn, and ran on for place. TINAS SHINING STAR stalked inside, was coaxed from the five path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly to
show. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL tracked from the four path, was ridden in the six path in upper stretch, but flattened. TIKTOKNAWAY rated inside but was tired
into the stretch. SAINTS VICTORY prompted the pace from three path but faded rounding the far turn. FARCICAL was well back and no factor. OUR TINY
DANCER was done after a half.
