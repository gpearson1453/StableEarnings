KING DEUCE vied inside of CAESARTHERULER into the turn, continued to battle for command into the stretch, dug in gamely under firm pressure, edged
away to as slim lead and held firm. CAESARTHERULER vied outside of KING DEUCE into the turn, battled on two wide for the lead into the lane, stayed on
determinedly but got turned away in the final sixteenth. LARCH roused forward to race three wide in aim for the lead mid-way around the turn, swung four
wide and weakened off the top pair at the head of the lane and just lasted for show. OSCAR WINNER WALLY rated off the early pace, launched a four wide
bid in upper stretch and just missed show. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced in the last flight, hustled along two to three wide around the turn and lacked a
rally. NOSBOR raced in early contention, chased inside on the turn then tipped two to three wide approaching the head of the lane and gave way.

ANNUAL BUDGET was forwardly placed along the inside soon after the start then tipped out and hustled along two wide around the turn, stayed on
determinedly through the lane and ran down SANGRIA SKY nearing the wire. SANGRIA SKY broke inward at the start then quickly roused forward to the
lead, held clear and saved ground around the turn, stayed on with good response but could not contain the winner late. SUCCESSION was off slow at the
start and hustled up into closer contention, swung five wide into the lane, sustained response and finished well clear over the rest. MACH SWEDE broke on
top then conceded position but remained in close contention, sustained three to four wide bid around the turn then weakened in the lane. WILY WADE
raced off the early pace, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a rally. ONE SOCK BILLY showed response along the inside around the turn then

MIDNIGHT RULES set a pressured pace through the backstretch and held a slim lead on the final turn, saved ground into the lane, widened to a clear
advantage along the inside and kept to task under steady encouragement. EVIL KNIEVEL stalked the pace through early stages, raced up close three wide
around the far turn, roused for response approaching upper stretch, sustained a two wide bid through the lane and finished second best. PISTOL PACKIN
MAN was reserved racing well off the pace, picked up the tempo around the far turn, stayed on four wide into the lane and prevailed for a share. FLEET OF
HOOF tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for command mid-way around the far turn then weakened in the lane.
SWAMPDRAINER applied pace pressure to MIDNIGHT RULES through the backstretch then faded around the far turn. TACTICAL REBEL was not too far
back in early stages then retreated entering the final turn.

around the turn, came four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under right handed pressure and finished strongly. LITTLE TOE tracked the top flight in
early stages then chased four wide on the turn, sustained a bid through the lane and ran on for a share. FEARLESS WILL raced up close in early stages,
vied for the lead with LODE OF BLARNEY at the quarter pole then came up empty a furlong out. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP was forwardly placed in opening

the three eighths pole, saved ground around the turn and had no late response. CHICAGO CHROME set the pace up the backstretch, dueled at the quarter

Footnotes
ACE GILFORD dueled three deep for the early lead then took on the challenge of FREER entering the turn, shook free in upper stretch, widened to a clear
advantage and held late under a driving finish. HERZEN lacked speed and raced near the back, swung five wide into upper stretch, kicked in gamely and
rallied strongly to the wire. FREER raced in close contention then advanced to duel with ACE GILFORD entering the turn, could not move on with eventual
winner in upper stretch but stayed on and held a share. B MAKER vied between rivals for the early lead, chased the duel around the turn then gave way in
the lane. CREATIVE ONE tracked the second flight heading into the turn, urged three wide into the lane and failed to rally. MR FROST chased three to four
wide around the turn then tired in the drive. HANDSOME HUNTER vied for the lead soon after the start, chased inside around the turn then retreated in the
lane. MAX'S HEART saved ground around the turn and raced off the pace, fell near the sixteenth pole, lost the rider and got vanned off after the race.
