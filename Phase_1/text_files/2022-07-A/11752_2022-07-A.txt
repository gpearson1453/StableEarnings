final turn, rallied inside of DUNE D'ORO into the stretch and held on for place. DUNE D'ORO chased inside through the backstretch, swung out at the top of
the lane, angled in to duel outside of ZICTELA but was unable to get by rival. WALKTHELINE vied inside of HARD TO COME HOME, dueled through the far
turn, and yielded in the stretch. HARD TO COME HOME dueled for the lead, was unable to move on with rival after the quarter pole and gave way. MR.

Footnotes
WEDGE POND allowed to settle early in the two path, gained the lead leaving the backstretch, opened up through the stretch and was kept under a brisk
hand ride. LONE PIONEER raced in close quarters into the opening turn, gained closer order, chased in vain through the stretch and finished clearly second
best. SPORTSCARR led the field through the backstretch under a snug hold, was overtaken into the far turn, and passed tiring rival late. ROOKIE YEAR
hustled away, contested the pace into the far turn, was no match for the eventual winner and weakened late. WHERE'S THE GOLD sat in range, and
lodged a late mild bid. NEVVARE offered little. BIG AL'S VISION was outrun.

IM A WHISKY GAL dueled for the lead inside of SMOKEDYA, disposed of rival nearing the quarter pole, and held firm under a drive. BEAUTIFUL CALL
stalked the pace from the four path, hustled through the final turn then went in pursuit of the leader, gained steadily but was unable to get by. DRAGON
WING stalked the pacesetters, lacked the closing response needed and held for show. WICKED WIZZY sat in range while five wide, lodged an all out bid
along the rail but was unable to get by late. SMOKEDYA dueled outside, was unable to move on with rival, and tired. PUNCH PERFECT no contention.

Footnotes
VIATURE unhurried away, saved ground from rail, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside of REGAL MAX, and inched clear late. REGAL
MAX was quickest to the turn, set a pressured pace from just off the rail, edged away into the lane, responded to challenge from VIATURE and gave way
grudgingly deep stretch. CATS TOUCH went three wide through the opening turn, saved in second flight, hustled four wide into the lane, and closed
gradually. GRAVES MILL ROAD sat mid pack while three wide, chased inside and was unable to improve position through stretch. MR. KALYPSO went
three wide into the first turn, and showed a mild interest late. EL NOBLE pressed the pace outside of REGAL MAX, was unable to move on with rival and
faded. LANNY MAC saved from between rivals from the second flight, and had no response when called upon. COUNTRIFIED trailed throughout.

HUNGARIAN JOE contested the pace while four wide, fanned three wide into the far turn, gained the lead into the lane, and held sway. CHESTER SLEW
sat in range along the rail, closed gradually under steady encouragement and dug in late for place. WIDE EYED WILEY advanced inside, closed
determinedly, and was narrowly denied. GRADY'S SONG stalked three wide, lacked a closing kick under urging. RUN ROSSCO RUN outsprinted to the
turn, challenged the lead leaving the backstretch, and faded inside into stretch. BIG Z sat five wide through the backstretch, and failed to threaten. FREUDS
VISION flashed early speed, was unable to keep pace and gave way. CRAFTY JOKER trailed throughout.

BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the pacesetters, waited for running room in the final turn, found running room inside then was set down for a drive, struck
the front and held safely. CABOT TRAIL sat in striking position while four wide, drove five wide into the lane, rallied outside of TRIPLE POWER through
stretch and edged away for place honors. TRIPLE POWER hustled to the front, contended the early pace, and was wore down late. DREADNAUGHT
unhurried early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and closed gradually late. AWESOME SATURDAY raced near the back of the pack, came
under urging into the stretch, and improved late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE allowed to settle early, circled into the lane then lodged a bid and evened out
late. PRESS GANG chased and failed to threaten. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER lacked a serious bid. STORMCHASER vied inside for the lead, was unable
to keep pace with the field and wilted.

FULL VELOCITY saved ground early, took closer order in the final turn, was roused at the quarter pole, shifted outside and won driving. LITTLE CHICAGO
attended the pace while four wide, dueled into the lane, and was caught late. TOP DEMON trailed early, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and improved late.
BRADYDABOSS saved ground inside, angled three wide, and passed tiring. FIRST BASE quickest leaving the chute, was overtaken into the far turn,
moved up alongside LITTLE CHICAGO to challenge the lead, and gave way in stretch. ABEEN unseated the rider in the gate, sat in striking distance, and
tired. STRONG AND FREE chased wide early, moved up three wide to challenge the lead leaving the backstretch, and flattened. BLAZING CHANNING
attended the early pace from between foes, and dropped back. SAKURABA chased outside, and tired. *JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection was lodged by
the rider of FIRST BASE against the rider of LITTLE CHICAGO alleging interference in the far turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER quickly took command, opened up to good margins, and finished much the best. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL allowed to settle early,
advanced quickly outside in the final turn, and inched up late for place. AMBER PRINCESS broke awkwardly then hustled into contention, rallied in traffic
then was bumped and was along in time for show honors. WICKED WOMAN angled to the four path leaving the backstretch, chased outside into the stretch
and was bested late. BEAR WARNING hurried away the raced in closest pursuit, and tired late stretch. GET BAKK was reserved off the pace, raced four
wide leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader but was no match and gave way. SHE'S EXPENSIVE allowed to settle early, lodged a bid into the
stretch and lacked room late in traffic. MUSICAL RELOAD broke awkwardly, and passed tiring. SOPHIE MCTROPHY rated well off the pace, and failed to
threaten in drive. MISS DIRECTED saved from rail, and lacked a bid.
