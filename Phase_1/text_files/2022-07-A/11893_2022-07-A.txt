Footnotes
REBECCA G unprepared for the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued to trail into the turn, swung five wide entering the stretch,late bid
outside, dueled the final sixteenth while drifting in slightly, light brush with the runner up, gained the nod at the wire. JUST ANOTHER WIN in mid pack early
inside, continued to save ground turn when moving slightly closer, came off the inside, challenged between foes and inside the winner past the furlong
marker, gained the advantage soon after, dueled with the winner to the wire, slight brush, missed. SCRAPPY broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch, shook clear late in the turn, extended that advantage in upper stretch, offered little resistance to the top two when confronted by that pair inside
the furlong grounds, comfortably saved the show. K V SQUARED vied early outside the leader, chased that one through the turn then began to gradually
weaken. SADIE'S PORT lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a closing kick. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA broke out, was
straightened for race forwardly and three wide, began a steady retreat before a half.

CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST bobble, broke back, dropped in and raced in the second flight through the first turn while saving ground, moved out backstretch,
challenged the two leaders three wide in the second turn, clear when straightened for home, drew clear under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. DRAFT
CHOICE three wide into the first turn when forward, dueled in the two path up the backstretch, vied between rivals and inside the winner midway on the final
turn, proved no match for that rival, remained clear for the place. AMBASSADOR HOUSE away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, vied through
the second bend inside the top two, could not match them in the stretch, remained clear of the other two. MISTA VALENTINE fell back to trail after an alert
break, continued to see them all into the far turn, picked off a single tiring rival while never a factor. PRINCE LOKI in the second flight early off the inside,
was finished after a half.

PRAY IDE SING moved up to duel along the inside out of the chute, continued to hold a narrow advantage into and through the turn, edged away the final
furlong under steady handling in a solid effort. GUILTY AGAIN broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute, dueled up the backstretch and through the
turn in the two path, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the place. BROADWAY JONES lacked early foot in the
second flight while between foes, dropped inside turn, continued along the rail and was slowly getting to the runner up late. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR closest to
the dueling top two while off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. SOUTHPINE GIFT fell back before a half, trailed home in showing little.

Footnotes
HIGH RIDGE broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, set a manageable but pressured pace up the backstretch and into the turn along the inside,
shook off that foe turning for home to be clear, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. MY BOOK unhurried for over a half, moved closest to the
winner along the inside turning for home, moved out a bit and was slowly but steadily getting to the winner late. MY LITTLE FLACO within striking distance
early while between horses, fell back before a half, moved outside, four wide into the lane, lugged in a bit when roused past the furlong marker, finished up
evenly when straightened, failed to pose a threat to the top two late. GENERAL EISENHOWER pressed the winner for just over a half from the outside and
gave way.

Footnotes
LAKE MARIE broke well, shook clear before a quarter, slowly expanded that advantage into the lane toward the inside then continued to draw out under a
firm hand ride. DEBBIES PASSAGE broke with the leaders outside, chased the winner while off the inside into and through the turn, had nothing for that one
through the stretch, stayed on to preserve the place. BRINEE settled off the pace and the inside, second flight into the turn, shuffled back in some traffic
three furlongs out, roused, came back to gain the nod for the show while getting to the runner up. FISH N CHICK broke back, lacked speed, came in the two
path through the stretch, missed the nod for the show spot. CYPRESS QUEEN fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag through the turn, displayed
some late interest to also improve position while in traffic late. PINK POSSE last to leave, raced back and well off the inside, lugged out nearing the furlong
grounds to bother IRONIT, was straightened and finished up evenly. MISS JAMIE in the second flight, steadied toward the front early in the turn, recovered
and saved some ground into the lane, faltered in the late going. IRONIT lacked speed while widest, four path turn, bothered, checked up nearing midstretch,
fell back and did not recover. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF IRONIT AGAINST PINK POSSE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE FURLONG GROUNDS, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM SIXTH AND PLACED EIGHTH.

Footnotes
LIL ADEAU moved up vie early, edged clear before a quarter inside, extended that advantage a bit into the stretch, steady handling with a right handed
crop, shown crop late, enough left to hold off the runner up. MEAN AMERICAN in the second flight off the inside, chased the winner out of the turn and
through upper stretch, approached the winner with less than a furlong remaining, continued to get to that one in the final yards while running out of real
estate, well clear of the others. SUGAR STAR lacked speed while in some traffic into the turn, split foes into the stretch, gained the nod late for the show
while not a threat to the top two. TRICKY MOM four wide into the turn when well off the pace, three wide and between foes turning for home, closest to the
top pair with a furlong to run, outkicked for the show. JULIO CHOICE last away, saved ground off the pace into and through the turn, remained inside and
finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. GLADS LOVE CAT behind the pace while racing off the inside, four wide into the lane, also lacked a closing
response. LOCO LUCY broke alertly, briefly vied off the inside, fell back into the second flight, gave way late in the turn, pulled up upper stretch, vanned off.

Footnotes
MAGEEZ broke back, raced unhurried and inside past the wire the first time, moved out backstretch, angled out further to be four wide turning for home,
closed with good resolve while remaining well out in the course to be up at the wire. BIRTHDAY PARTY broke running to set the pace, continued to show
the way second turn, clear when straightened for home, roused, drifted out a bit nearing midstretch, veered out late, nailed at the wire. MUFFIN NUTS
chased the runner up early off the inside, moved closer to press that one the middle four furlongs, fell back off that rival upper straight, angled in as that
same foe was veering out late, finished up clear of the others without threatening for the win. IM A COWBOY TOO in the second flight while racing outside,
came three wide for the drive when still within striking distance, lacked a winning response. LOUISIANA MOON in the second group early while between
foes, fell back to trail before a half, saved ground through the final turn, came up empty for the drive. RIFLE MAN rank at the start to be last away, recovered
to race forwardly and inside early, tired for the drive.

TAKENFORGRANTED broke back, lagged well back in the run up the backstretch, began to move early in the turn off the inside, swung out five wide
entering the stretch, closed with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be in time. MY LITTLE GUERA raced in the main body off the inside up the
backstretch, closer three wide through the turn, challenged between foes and inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining, outkicked by that one
while holding sway for the second spot. MAVE RUNNER within striking distance early toward the inside, two path and in some traffic late turn, dropped to
the inside past the furlong marker, rail bid,outkicked by the top pair in the final strides. CASH BIZNESS away well, clear early and in the run through the
turn, continued hold a daylight advantage nearing midstretch, cave in when confronted while between horses late. CITIZENS REWARD mid pack early
inside, moved closer in the turn while in the three path, flattened out in the run through the lane. AUNT JANA broke back and remained there in failing to
menace. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT chased the early leader, steadily faded.
