place. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN raced in mid pack from the two path, tipped into the three path rounding the turn, but evened out late to show. DRAGON

MINECRAFTER trailed from the three path, made progress whlle swinging four wide into the stretch, and rallied down the center to win. LAKE NAKURU
rated from inside, made an early bid from the rail into the far turn, drifted out throughout the stretch, but ran on. URBAN WARRIOR stalked inside, raced in
the two path rounding the far turn, tipped into the four path heading into the stretch, stayed on but got squeezed out late. WAR CROSS pressed two wide,
was cued from three wide rounding the far turn, and finished evenly. SUNNY SAINT set the pace in the two path, was coaxed between around the far turn,
but faded. MARKET MOVER tracked from the three path but was no factor. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION IN THIS RACE REGARDING
INTEFERENCE CAUSED BY LAKE NAKURU FOR DRIFTING AND CARRYING OUT URBAN WARRIOR MULTIPLE PATHS IN THE STRETCH. LAKE
NAKURU WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND URBAN WARRIOR.

Footnotes
MIZZEN chased while three wide, was driven four wide rounding the far turn, countinued racing in the four path in upper stretch, and drew clear. KINDA
LUCKY led from three wide, tipped into the three path under coaxing coming into the stretch, but yielded late to place. LIGHTFOOT MISS trailed between
foes into the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch, and rallied. NEW YORK ROCK STAR prompted the pace inside, was hustled along from the four
path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. RAPIDAMENTE was unhurried and saved ground, was short of room on the inside in upper stretch, but was
one paced. ESTA CHUCK rated in the three path, drifted into the seven path at the top of the lane, but was tired. NANCY WORK pressed between rivals,
was roused from inside at the top of the stretch, but faded. STEELY BAND stalked while four wide, was ridden in the four path coming into the stretch, but
was empty. PER RULING FROM THE HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND SAFETY AUTHORITY MIZZEN WAS DQD FOR JOCKEY VIOLATION

Footnotes
EVENT PARTY prompted the pace from two wide, took the lead under a drive while tipping into the four path at the top of the lane, and drew clear.
HEFFNER tracked from the three path, loomed three wide heading into the stretch, and stayed on place. B B BAD stalked, was roused while saving ground
rounding the far turn, was two wide in upper stretch, and ran on. VINNY set the pace from inside but gave way coming into the stretch. LIFESPAN trailed
early from the inside and was no factor. CHIEF CHEETAH rated while two wide but was done early.
