Footnotes
HELLO ROSIE SAY stalked the pace, circled the far turn three deep, closed inside RAVENEL the final eighth of a mile while drifting out late and took the
lead in deep stretch. RAVENEL used three wide to challenge for the lead outside horses leaving the first turn, sprinted clear on the far turn, gradually drifted
out through the stretch and weakened late. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the far turn then failed to rally. LIFE IN FLASH
, well back down the backstretch, swung four wide turning for home and passed a tired rival. POSTINO'S SECRET was outrun. ARBUTUS showed speed
along the inner rail and faltered on the far turn.

Footnotes
DARE TO TRY rated off the dueling leaders while outside a rival, shifted out soon into the lane, bid outside the leader in mid stretch, put a head in front a
sixteenth from home and edged clear late under a left handed drive. HOUSE WRECKER , away alertly, prompted the pace outside SHACKABOOM, applied
more pressure mid turn, gained a slim advantage soon into the lane, wandered outward maintaining command heading to mid stretch, dug in when
confronted then gave way grudgingly through the final fifty yards. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) rated forwardly while saving ground, angled out and edged up
past the three sixteenths, altered back in when encountering some traffic and kept on with interest. I LOVE YOU was rated back from between foes soon
after the break, angled out leaving the far turn and commenced a run, circled five wide into the stretch, continued progress past mid stretch then hung late.
POLISHED GAL saved ground, was under asking mid turn, stayed inside for the drive but lacked a solid kick. SHACKABOOM set a pressured pace towards
the inside, was engaged in a duel mid turn to upper stretch then faded through the final furlong. ALWAYS SOMETHING , unprepared at the start, broke in
the air and was away last, was urged up three wide early but failed to make an impact. DEVILISH AFFAIR broke slowly, steadied off heels leaving the far
turn and gave way.

forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, was bumped by CAIRO QUEEN approaching the turn, saved ground around the turn, angled out
near the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and rallied. SPECIAL FREEDOM , circled wide around the turn, failed to menace and passed tired
horses. TARGE bobbled leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace three wide around the turn and gave way. DIAL EMMA REILLY , outrun, was four
deep leaving the turn. CAIRO QUEEN bumped DULCE KIARA when drifting in leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn and faltered.

HELDISH broke on top, set a rated pace two wide, responded when put to firmer asking in upper stretch, kept BOX N BEN at bay and edged away a bit late
while steadily hand ridden. BOX N BEN prompted the pace three wide outside the winner and kept on gamely to the wire. SMART AND FAST , three deep
chasing the pace mid turn, remained on his left lead past mid stretch and lacked a serious finish. EVENLY DIVIDED saved ground under asking mid turn
and lacked a solid kick through the final furlong. COUNTRY CHARLIE bore out at the break brushing the outer stall, corrected and moved up to contention,
chased between rivals past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and gave way. RASCALLY REBEL broke slowly and was outrun.
BULLOUT lagged well back and was outrun.

Footnotes
PIQUA dueled inside a rival, shook clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling and prevailed. SIEGE OF BOSTON , three wide between
rivals a long way, dropped in leaving the five sixteenths, edged up while saving ground past the three sixteenths, altered out for room leaving mid stretch
and closed gamely to gain. HARD TRAVELER , keen early behind the winner, steadied off heels into the first turn, settled then rated close while saving
ground, eased out for room past the quarter pole, ranged up outside rivals past the three sixteenths and churned on willingly. TRASH TALKIN LARRY ,
away well, disputed the pace outside the winner from the start, stayed on and continued the battle to the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly.
AMARILLO , bumped and checked early on, settled in the clear soon into the backstretch, angled out leaving the far turn, came five wide for the drive but
lacked a serious finish. CURTEIS , three deep stalking the dueling leaders, was under pressure four wide into the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three
sixteenths and gave way. HACHURE , pinched back soon after the break then steadied, lagged off the pace, angled seven wide for the drive and came up
empty. SEE OUT was rated back soon after the break then hung out five wide while steadying around the first turn, moved up well wide past the five
eighths, lacked a kick leaving the far turn and faded. CELTIC SEA steadied early and was not a factor. DECEIVING , bumped at the break, checked early
and gave way.

ROCKINHIPPIECHICK , two wide chasing the pace on the turn, secured command approaching the stretch then drew off under steady handling. CAMELIA
ROD stalked the pace three deep around the turn, drifted in inside the eighth pole and gained the place. SHE'S MO BETTER sped to the early lead, set the
pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. SHINELIKEADIAMOND saved ground on the turn in a striking position, was caught in close quarters
inside the eighth pole, altered course and failed to menace late. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS , four wide leaving the turn, passed tired horses and switched to
her left lead late. MAGIC IN ME , in the three path between horses leaving the turn, lacked a rally. MORNING COCKTAIL hugged the inner rail on the turn
and weakened.

Footnotes
ZATIP stumbled when in tight soon after the break, recovered and edged up outside the leading pair to prompt the pace, went on the attack after being put
to a solid ride mid turn, dueled, gained a short lead past the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling and edged clear at the wire. FRIAR TUCK took
a short lead soon after the break and dueled to the inside of SOUTHERN BRIDGE, battled inside rivals from the five sixteenths to past mid stretch and
stayed on well to save the place. TEXAS BASIN , in range of the contested pace while saving ground, eased out for room past the three sixteenths and kept
on grinding between rivals to gain. MAGIC MULE , between foes while stalking the pace, was under pressure mid turn, worked outward in the final furlong
and kept on with effort. SOUTHERN BRIDGE , away well, disputed the pace outside FRIAR TUCK, sparred on near even terms leaving the three eighths,
was caught between rivals while dueling from the quarter pole to about mid stretch then faded. ABUELO PAPS , three deep stalking the pace, was under
asking past the five sixteenths, eased out to be five wide outside runners inside the furlong grounds and faded. ROYAL CRUSADER dropped off the pace
while saving ground and lacked a response.

Footnotes
SUPER E , along the inner rail down the backstretch and around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, floated to the seven path near the eighth pole,
closed outside horses, drifted in late and was up in time. FAVORITE IMAGE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late.
ON THE ENGINE . in mid pack down the backstretch, swung to the four path turning for home, rallied between horses and drifted in a bit approaching the
finish. SAM IN STYLE saved ground stalking the pace, flattened out and drifted out a bit late. ERAWAN , three wide both turns, chased the pace through the
stretch, failed to sustain the move and steadied in close quarters between horses near the finish. TITRATE , caught in close quarters leaving the starting
gate, was very wide leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. HONOR MY WORLD , near the inner rail most of the trip, weakened. I'M NOT SLOW , two
wide chasing the pace, gave way through the stretch. VIRGINIA FULLA , fractious behind the starting gate, was not a factor. AFTERMATH , four wide both
turns, gave way. An objection by the rider of ERAWAN against ON THE ENGINE for alleged interfernce in deep stretch was not allowed.
