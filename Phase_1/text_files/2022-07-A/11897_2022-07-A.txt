Footnotes
BULL MEECHUM engaged in close early chase inside but steadied off the heels of the errant Majestic Seas in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole,
resumed his efforts leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail, dueled at even terms in the upper stretch, took the nod toward the
sixteenth pole and lasted well. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased toward the outside, rounded the turn two deep, was eased four wide into the lane, dug in to
take second later yards and finished well. COMMAND THE CAT chased, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn outside and finished well for third
late while gaining on the top two. MAJESTIC SEAS veered out leaving the gate then lugged to the inside while setting a pressured pace, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the turn, dueled at even terms through the upper stretch but was caught flattening stride mid-stretch. FREEDOM IS RINGING pressured
the pace and contested the turn two deep, lost some ground entering the stretch, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride.

Footnotes
BRUTUS tapered in and stalked three wide, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced at even terms two deep on the far turn, dropped back at
the eighth pole but came back in the stretch drive and took the nod under the wire. SCOTTSDALE rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the
five sixteenths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the turn, dug in to steady stretch handling but was nipped under the wire. LOST IN
MANHATTAN raced off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran four wide on the far turn, raced evenly to late
stretch but flattened approaching the wire. TY RAN A HOMER settled inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, left the
far turn between horses then flattened stride. BOATSWAIN settled off the pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the three
path of the far turn. SILVER CASTLE stalked the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded at
the rail on the far turn. KING KOA settled close to the pace in the front stretch, dropped back on the opening turn, was eased past the three eighths pole,
unsaddled on the far turn and walked off post race.

Footnotes
RED HOT TODDY settled back in the three path the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole,
steadily improved in the four path of the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire. THUNDER KITTEN rounded the first turn
about the five path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path approaching the head of the
lane but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. ORANGEBURG settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, left the turn widest and came along for third later yards. SCARE DEM rounded the
opening turn about the four path and settled just off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn, angled to the five path into the lane but showed little further. WEST VIRGINIA BOY took over at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came
under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught into the lane then flattened stride mid-stretch.
TIMMY settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. WATCHING SNOW FLY stalked
two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole and remained a threat through the backstretch, but dropped back approaching the top of the lane and
weakened. HARDIN broke a step slow and was slow getting into stride.
