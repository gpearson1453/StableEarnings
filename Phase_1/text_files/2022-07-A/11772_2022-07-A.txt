Footnotes
APRIL MIST was quick to begin to set the pace from the inside, raced well clear through the far turn and lengthened its lead through the stretch run under a
steady hand ride and raced in hand late. MRS SHAW dropped back early on, checked sharply near the quarter pole, angled out to race four wide and rallied
for the place position late. RAHTID was coaxed along early from the inside, continued an inside bid in the drive and had not enough. MOOR STRENGTH
was bumped at the break, hustled early while racing midpack, raced four wide through the upper stretch and raced evenly late. J'S STAR JET broke to the
outside, bumped with rival, dropped back early, raced four to five wide through the upper lane and had no rally. AMOR COCO was hustled along early to
press the early leader and weakened in the stretch run while racing three wide. BAHAMIAN BEACHBABE was coaxed along and faded while racing near
the inside. PROTULLIO was off slowly and trailed.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN vied for the early lead to set the pace from the inside in the early going and held gamely in the drive to be clear under strong
handling. THE BIG CALICO stalked the pace from the inside, shifted out four wide through the upper stretch, brushed with Brave and True, dug in late and
held the place position. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT hopped at the break, was hustled while racing off the pace, moved up five wide through the stretch and
made a good late rally. CROSS HASTE was coaxed along early, angled to the inside race near the inside through the far turn through the stretch and had
not enough in the drive. DOUBLE WARRIOR chased the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the upper lane and weakened late. BRAVE AND
TRUE chased the early leader while racing two wide, checked near the three sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter. Jockey of Brave and True claimed
objection for interference through the upper stretch against The Big Calico and Double Warrior for interference and stewards ruled no change. DUBSTEP
was off slowly, raced three wide and never was a factor. SPLASH OF FORCE broke awkwardly, raced near the inside and never threatened.

Footnotes
EL POLICIA was off a step slow, rushed up the inside to take command early down the backstretch and drew off to be well clear late under steady pressure.
AND THE OSCAR GOES was bumped at the break, moved up along the rail in the stretch run and got up for the place position. MEAN JOE BRO was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on and weakened the final furlong while racing two wide. TELECAST stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole, angled four wide through the upper lane and had no late run. SHIPWRECK stalked the early pace, was four wide through the upper stretch
and weakened. SOULFUL SONG failed to sustain a bid. O DANNY BOY was bumped at the break, raced four wide early and tired readily.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BUSH was allowed to settle off the pace, made an advance towards the leaders through the far turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch and
finished well to get up under strong handling. MISS GHISLAINE chased the early pace while racing two wide, dug in through the stretch and kept on to the
wire. NO NANNETTE NO was slow early, moved up through the far turn, raced three wide through the upper stretch, shifted in to race near the rail and
finished willingly to the wire. C C'S FREEDOM settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. BROADWAY
PEGGY stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, lacked room near the three sixteenths pole, angled out and had no final winning bid. V K
STAR was allowed to settle, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. BUNKER BUNNY was sent along to set the
early pace from the outside and gave way the final quarter while racing near the inside. FOR EVER OURS failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
LADY NOY stalked the pace, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, angled four wide and finished well to just get up under strong handling. PLAYA
INCLUSION dropped back early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in to race near the rail and finished gamely to the wire. RED
WIND was coaxed along early, made a good outside bid in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. TRIPLET dueled for the early lead along the
inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PLATINUMCENTS was hustled along early, made a good outside bid in the drive, was forced to check
nearing the sixteenth pole, jockey of Platinumcents claimed objection for interference in the stretch run on Red Wind and stewards ruled no change.
LANGUE LIEE dropped to the back of the pack early, saved ground throughout and lacked a bid. LOVIELEE dueled early on, drifted through the stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
BEN COPENHAGEN showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced off the inside in the stretch run and held gamely to be clear under steady
handling. THOUSAND LOVES stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished second best. LIL BULL dropped back early
on, made an advance through the far turn, raced four deep into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. TINKER'S PAL dropped back early,
raced four wide through the far turn, was five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. TEDDY'S HONOR stalked the early pace, raced
three two wide in the stretch run and weakened. LAYNES KNIGHT pressed the leader from the inside early on and gave way. GEOSCIENCE refused to
break, stewards conducted an inquiry and ruled Geoscience had fair chance at the start and no action was taken.

steady pressure. FAST PAYDAY settled off the early going, raced four wide through the upper steretch and finished seccond best. HUSBAND IN LAW
stalked the pace, raced two to three wide in the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair. SKYDIVING was off slowly, raced off the early pace, raced
near the inside at the quarter pole, and raced evenly late. TUWAIM was sent along early, dueled with Luis Two Guns briefly, took off the early leader to lay
up close down the backstretch and weakened while racing near the inside. SIMILAR TASTE stalked the early pace, raced three to four wide and weakened
in the drive. THE WILD FLYER dropped back early and failed to respond. COMMANDER KEITH raced far back and trailed.

Footnotes
CHICK'S SHADOW showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. SIMONELA
settled off the early going, moved up near the rail in the stretch and closed well late to get up for the place position. CLASSY OF COURSE raced in a bit
tight quarters early on, stalked the pace while racing near the inside, raced two wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. ZARINA settled off the pace,
made an advance around the far turn, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. BEAUTY GENIUS pressed the
early leader down the backstretch from the outside and weakened a bit the final furlong while racing four wide. FILLMORE EAST dropped back early, raced
towards the outside through the lane and failed to respond. SPANISH DELIGHT stalked the pace from the outside and weakened in the drive while racing
three to four wide. DRILL'S VALENTINE was slow early, saved ground and never threatened.
