SUN FORESTER was well back, gained ground on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. SAMUEL H stalked the early leader and had a slim
lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. SYNCHROMESH was off slow and moved up on the far turn but from
the five path through the stretch was all out. PARTY OF NO was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed
more. TRINITY THUNDAH was unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. READY AT
DAWN set the pace but was headed on the far turn and had nothing left. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY was in touch early but trailed the field on the far turn and
was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON PARTY OF NO AGAINST SAMUEL H FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT

JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH tracked the early leaders from the inside, raced evenly on the turn, angled out through the stretch and just missed. RAYO
COLORADO was away alertly, roused on the turn, a factor in mid stretch and held show. KEEP GOING was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn
but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. FRAT PARTY was off slow, moved up on the turn and had a bid from the four path in
mid stretch while all out. ITMAKESMEWONDER was up close and forced the pace on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
ROYAL BIZ was up close, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the three path in mid stretch was kept to task. WONNEFRAC was in touch, had a mild
gain on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and was second best. LOVE THAT MADISON was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and vied through
the stretch but was outfinished. CLIFF LANDING was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. SON OF MY FATHER was away
alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. SPIRIT SOUL BODY was well back, showed little and
was never in contention. I'M SO FLY had no speed and showed nothing in a dull effort.
