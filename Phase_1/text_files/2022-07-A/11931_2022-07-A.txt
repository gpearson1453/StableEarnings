Footnotes
BRAMBLE BAY was well placed tracking on the inside, waited for room on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied between horses, closed
willingly and drew clear under urging. I'M LISTENING raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied
inside, finished well but second best. ROSELBA set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, drifted off the rail entering the
stretch, dueled with the winner, yielded and stayed on well for third. PERSPICACIOUS stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn, made a mild bid in
upper stretch, then weakened. KITTEN'S COLLUSION raced three wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn, came three wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. POSTINO'S IDOL trailed the field and did not factor. NO SYMPATHY raced three or four wide off the pace, chased on the
far turn and faded.
