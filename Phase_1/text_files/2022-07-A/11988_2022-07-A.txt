the eight path. NATIVE VALLEY failed to menace. NATALIA'S TEMPLE stalked the pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. IT'S ALL CASH moved

CHOCOLATE RABBIT pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead then finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win going away. RED HOT
POWER broke sharply, set a pressured pace along the inside for a half, shifted outside the winner before the furlong marker and was no match. THE
GOSPEL OF MARK trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late near mid track. VOLUME OF TRUST with the second flight two wide, went
evenly. SPLIT MY BRITCHES failed to menace. WESTERN HOPE was a forward factor along the inside into the stretch then gave way.

NEED TO KNOW BASIS never far back, rallied through the stretch along the inside and finished second best. SWING STATE stalked the early pace,
improved in the four path nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished. ELECTION INTEGRITY was bumped hard at the start, offered a mild bid three wide
into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. GOOD MUSIC failed to menace. ROUGE TU RICHES pressured the winner from the inside into the turn and
was through after a half. LIAM'S ROCKET MAN hit the gate, bore in badly bumping hard with ELECTION INTEGRITY at the start, lost contact with his field,
pulled up on the turn and was walked off.

Footnotes
DYRDEK shifted two wide into the clubhouse turn, surged to the front before a half, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under
strong handling to win as much the best. YOUVESAIDITALL saved ground early, shifted out to the seven path entering the stretch and rallied for second
best. GLENNWOOD close up from the start, moved closer five wide into the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. EXALTED JOY allowed to settle, closed a
gap along the inside on the far turn then leveled off. ZALINSKY failed to menace. COSMIC TREASURE raced three wide into the first turn, loomed boldly
three wide before a half then came up empty. MAN DOWN was no factor. IMTHEPRINCE broke in a tangle and was outrun. UNCAPTURED PULSE set the
early pace along the inside, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then faltered. THE DRAKE was through after a half.

Footnotes
BIRDIE'S CHANTZ close up two wide, ran up on heels past the seven sixteenths pole, shifted out three wide nearing the quarter pole, made the lead late
under left handed urging and won under strong handling. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM stalked the pace from the inside, lacked racing room past the seven
sixteenths pole, shifted out four wide on the far turn, rallied into the stretch to gain a slight advantage, matched strides then couldn't handle the winner in the
final strides. ROCKY CHANNEL never far back, loomed boldly three wide before a half then was outfinished. DANZA MAGIC pressed the pace two wide for
a half, inherited the lead, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. STATE OF GRACE was no factor. SMOKIN MARE EVANA broke in front, set the
pace near the inside for a little over a half then stopped.
