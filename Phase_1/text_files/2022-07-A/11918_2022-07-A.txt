Footnotes
A. K. A. GRAMS unhurried early, asked along midway on the turn inside, continued to save some ground into the stretch just off the rail, steady gain, late bit
between foes, up at wire. MADAME JANE broke alertly, showed the way early unpressured, shook off a rival turning into the stretch, well clear a furlong out,
could not contain the winner at the wire. MISS NITAP broke with the leaders, settled off the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, asked for run three
wide into the stretch, closed the gap late on the runner up while not having enough in the waning strides to overtake that one or match strides with the
winner, widest of the first flight at the wire,. MIDNIGHT TRIP last to leave, fell further back in lagging early, continued to trail into the stretch, steered out
widest past the furlong marker, displayed a mild amount of while too late. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA chased the runner up early off the inside, lodged a bid
outside that one late in the turn, gave way badly soon after, trailed home.

Footnotes
CRIDER CHASE broke in a bit to help tighten up and bother a couple of inner rivals, moved up to duel in the two path first turn, took over and gained a clear
advantage turning for home, extended that advantage past the furlong marker, comfortably held the runner up safe late. SANDY'S WAGER broke out to
assume most of the responsibility of tightening up a pair of rivals, settled in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the drive, set down, slowly
getting to the winner late. CRAFTY PRINCESS in tight and bothered at the start, void of early speed as a result, continued back the middle half, came four
wide for the drive, finished up willingly to be up for the show while too late for the top two. TOOSIE took command soon after the start, was joined by the
winner before a quarter, dueled inside that one up the backstretch, first to blink exiting the final turn. MAC LEGACY in the second group inside the runner
up, continued to save ground second turn, came up empty for the drive. OVERLY SWEET in tight at bothered at the break, trailed throughout and never
threatened.

Footnotes
B W P SPECIAL in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, moved closer to the leader in the two path turn, engaged that one when straightened
for home, gained the advantage a furlong out, drifted in to bother that early leader slightly, shook clear, drifted in again a sixteenth out, continued to extend
that lead late under steady handling. JACKIE MOON sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the turn, offered
brief resistance then was falling back off the winner when that one drifted in a furlong out, steadied when that rival drifted in again late, clearly second best.
CHAIRMAN MOO off a step slow, raced back and four wide into the turn, two path into the stretch, improved through traffic. TEN BUDS chased the runner
up along the inside up the backstretch, began to steadily weaken before a half. TRAELEE lacked early foot, improved toward the inside late in the turn,
came three wide for the drive, flattened out the final furlong. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS in mid pack off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, failed to
muster a rally. BRAD EYE main body early, fell back in the two path turn, lacked response drive. CORN SOUP lacked speed well out in the strip, five path
turning for home, tired and trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF JACKIE MOON AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SNIVELING last to leave, raced unhurried early off the inside, waited late second turn, split foes nearing midstretch, edged clear under firm handling. ONE
TIME GEM broke on top, dueled through some soft fractions in the two path, held a narrow advantage a furlong out then gave ground grudgingly to the
winner while inside that one at the wire. VARNISHED also away in good order, alternated up front through those relaxed fractions along the inside, also
proved stubborn to the end. POSEIDON WRATH lacked speed while racing off the inside, angled out to be four wide turning for home, displayed some mild
late interest to be slowly coming late. UNDERDOG closest to the dueling leaders for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch drive. SMOKY TOPAZ lacked
speed, remained back in failing to muster a rally. TRIVISTA was finished after a half.

Footnotes
DREWMAZING broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path up the backstretch, continued to alternate through the turn, put the other speed away into the
lane as the runner up was moving closer along the rail, held that rival at bay to the wire under steady handling. HOLIDAY DIAMOND back off the pace while
along the inside, continued to save ground turn, cut the corner when moving to a striking position on the winner, brief challenge then could not keep the final
furlong, fully extended to hold the second spot. MR ELVIN one paced in the second group behind the leaders, three wide turn, roused, late bid for the
second spot, missed. JAMAICAN ME fell back to trail after the start, advanced four wide to improved in the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a
closing response. XANTHUS WRATH in the second group early, fell back along the inside turn, improved up the rail while not a serious threat through the
lane. MY MAN LOUIE dueled up front inside the winner for four furlongs then gave way in the drive. HIGHHOPES DIAMOND bobbled at the start, remained
always back in failing to menace.

Footnotes
SUFFRAGETTE last to leave, raced back early, bit closer turn when asked for some run, steered out three wide turning for home, bid past the furlong
marker, kicked strongly clear under firm handling. MY REBEL GIRL in the main body while outside, four wide into the turn, floated five wide into the stretch,
finished willingly while remaining widest through the lane to annex the place, no threat to the winner. MISSGREELEY'SSONG forwardly placed while three
wide, also floated out by the winner into the lane, four wide and between foes, up late for the show. TWO WITH A TEN behind the early pace inside, asked
along into the turn, shuffled back along the rail three furlongs out to lose some position, came back a bit through the lane while remaining toward the inside
to improve a bit, missed the show. ALLSTAR MAGIC dueled up front along the inside for six furlongs, weakened when headed with less than a furlong
remaining to lose several positions. APHRODITES REVENGE set or forced the pace for almost three quarters, also faltered the final eighth. CLOCKED IN
TYME fell back after the start to trail, never a factor.

Footnotes
CREOLE CHARLIE away in good order, within striking distance up the backstretch outside, closer in the three path into the turn, challenged entering the
stretch, wore that rival down under steady handling to be edging away late. PRADO'S PRIORITY broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch while
angling in a bit toward the inside, continued to show the way turn, responded when the winner came alongside into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to
that one in the run to the wire, clearly best. MICAJAH broke outward and steadied to be back early, toward the inside in the rear of the main body into the
turn, steered out a bit into the three path late in the turn when advancing, closest to the top two with a furlong to run, could do little with that pair to the wire,
well clear of the others. FIESTY FIST pressed the issue early between horses, tapped on the brakes in some traffic briefly with four furlongs to run,
continued evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch. SCHNELL lacked speed outside, continued four wide through the turn, went one paced through the
stretch to also be found lacking late. SABER RUN off slowly, trailed well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
PRIZELESS behind the early pace off the inside, moved closer in the turn with a three wide middle move, flattened out and weakened through the stretch.
MUCHO MARVIN forwardly placed early toward the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS stumbled at the start but still managed to break with the leaders, pressed early inside, put a head in front along the rail in the group
of three in the lead pack, headed upper stretch, dueled with that rival to the wire, fought back and proved best in game fashion. CABOCHON TREASURE
behind the first flight off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, dueled to the wire outside the winner and
was outfinished by that one while well clear of the others. COLE'S SENSATION off the pace and the inside,four wide midway on the turn, three wide into the
lane, no threat to the top two, gained the nod for the show. JOHNNY JUDE broke alertly narrowly set the pace in the two path and between foes, weakened
from between the top two into the lane. R T'S IRON MAN off a step slow, was finished early. HEZA BREEZIN off a step slow, remained back and was never
a threat. FIGHTING SOLDIER pressed the issue three wide up the backstretch, stopped in the turn.
