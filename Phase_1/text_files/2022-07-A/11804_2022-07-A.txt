Footnotes
LOST ARK broke in at the start, displayed good speed between horses, vied outside of a foe in the two path around the turn, passed the five-sixteenths
under urging, shook clear into upper stretch, responded well when put to the crop nearing the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. PERFORM
showed good speed on the outside of two foes, dropped back with a half-mile to run, chased three wide around the turn, gained under a drive into upper
stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened but held the place. AARON was last to commence, moved in under urging at the rear,
shifted from the rail to the three path early on the turn, moved to four wide late on that bend, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and finished willingly
but missed the place while well clear for the show. STAR ATTITUDE lost his footing at the start, was urged along near the back, dropped from the three
path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point to the quarter-pole, moved out around the furlong marker and failed to threaten. CERTIFIED
LOVERBOY came away in good order, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail while inside of the winner on the turn, passed the
five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. STRONG FINISH was hustled from the gate, chased the leading trio on the outside,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from four to three wide early on the turn, continued three wide into the stretch and capitulated.

VIOLENT POINT went clear early, controlled the action while inside around the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, responded well under a strong
hand-ride in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole then had the
rider lose the crop on the first pop and proved best under a hand-ride to the wire. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA settled at the rear while taking short strides,
saved ground around the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place.
CADEAU DE PAIX was well placed just off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted to the two path while asked with three furlongs to run, chased
the winner under the crop in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. SHE'S A BLACK BELT tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in
the three path on the turn and came up empty. MISS PEPPINA settled off the pace, dropped back while moving from two to four wide around the turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
SIFTING SANDS (GB) was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the hedge on the turn, was asked while moving into the two
path into the stretch, split foes to make a bold bid between horses inside the three-sixteenths, gained a short advantage inside the furlong marker and held
under strong urging. EMARAATY (GB) was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, went two then three wide while held up around the turn, lost position
some late on that bend, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, waited while blocked from that point to the three-sixteenths then altered course to the outside,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast for the place but was too late while probably best. FLORIFORM dropped back early then was reserved at
the rear, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast on the outside to make a bid nearing the
furlong marker, gained a brief and short lead shortly thereafter then lost the advantage to the winner and missed while nailed for the place but was able to
get the show. WINFROMWITHIN was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, drew even with
the leader in the two path under urging around the turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch, battled between foes into the final furlong, fought into the
final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the last spot in the supefecta. FORTY UNDER was hustled to the front, showed the way while inside of
an opponent, came under coaxing along the hedge on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch then lost the advantage, battled inside of three foes into
the final furlong and was out-kicked. IT'S A GAMBLE was reserved towards the back, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper
stretch, gained with good courage into the final sixteenth, was taken in hand while lacking room behind foes late and lost his best chance at the minor
awards. HOMBRE was last to commence, settled on the outside, went three wide early on the turn then was roused while moving four wide, chased under a
drive into the final furlong and weakened. OCALA DREAM tracked the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased three wide around
the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty.

DAUFUSKIE ISLAND coaxed from the gate, led very early before settling three wide in aim of the top pair, remained patiently handled through the turn until
set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, inched away under a drive and held sway over a rival to the
finish. ON THE HILL chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly albeit on his
wrong lead lugging in very slightly while under a right handed crop, continued under a right handed crop through the stretch and was ultimately rebuffed to
the finish while well clear of the rest and along second best. MOTION TO STRIKE broke in at the start under coaxing and was corrected, established the
front shortly after and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure to the inside, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch,
yielded the front straightened away and weakened while along for the show honors well clear of the rest. LUNI SIMA struck the off side stall at the start and
was bumped by MOONSHININGBRIGHT, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired.
MOONSHININGBRIGHT broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, pressed the pace along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. MOCEPHUS four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, continued four wide
into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) showed some speed between foes early then backed off the pace before the first turn, went three wide around that bend, settled
towards the front on the outside, moved closer outside the half-mile pole, stalked in the four path around the final turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole,
dropped in while taking the lead into the stretch then accelerated clear under two taps of a right-handed crop, powered away into the final furlong and
proved much the best under a brisk-hand ride to the wire. FLANIGAN'S COVE moved out into the first turn, traveled three wide around that bend, settled
outside on the backstretch, was roused four wide on the far turn, brushed with a foe into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. R CALLI KIM showed early speed on the outside, went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid
between horses near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path around the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show.
LIGHT STARS (FR) was last to commence, became rank and fought the restraint of the rider early, dropped to the inside into the first turn, continued rank
under a tight hold onto the backstretch, was reserved while continuing to tug on the bit, came under urging on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch
and improved position without threatening. STAR SEEKING (IRE) moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked late on the far
turn, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened. MIA MARTINA was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace,
came under urging while three wide between foes on the far turn, brushed with an opponent into the stretch and had nothing left. STATE CROWN settled on
the inside, was roused on the far turn and failed to respond. CAFE FLEUR (FR) was rated in the two path between foes around the first turn, settled more
kindly down the backstretch, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, was roused between foes in the two path on the final turn and lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
JOUSTER three then two wide in pursuit, had the rider peer back inside the five-sixteenths to take a look at LOVE AND THUNDER, came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole as that rival got her cue and swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, dug in under a
drive inching away to the finish kept to task. CHEERMEISTER broke through the gate prior to the start and was held from running off due to the efforts of
the assistant starter and rider who got balked off, struck the right side of the gate at the start when breaking sharply and eager to the front and was brushed
by LOVE AND THUNDER to the outside, showed the way spurting away keenly in hand down the backstretch three then two paths off the hedge, tucked
inside through the far turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole when the field in behind took closer order, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, battled on inside to the finish showing good courage to the end. LOVE AND
THUNDER (IRE) got bumped between foes due to pressure from MESSIDOR breaking inwards and was pinched back at the start conceding three lengths
to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide down the backstretch and tucked briefly to the two path into the far turn before tipping back three
wide three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show
honors. MESSIDOR (IRE) broke in at the start bumping LOVE AND THUNDER, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and ran on to the finish but was just bested for the show honors on the line. FLOWER POINT chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the
finish. GIGGLE FACTORY three wide in pursuit, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run and offered up a bid
continuing three wide at the head of the stretch, then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
STREET TSAR was bumped hard at the start, chased the pace in the two path through the turn, made a bid in the three path into the stretch then took over
at the three-sixteenths, moved in closer to the runner-up as that foe made a rail bid outside the eighth-pole, dueled gamely with that rival to the wire and
narrowly prevailed under vigorous handling. OCEAN'S RESERVE broke out and forced his neighboring foe into another rival, settled off the pace, saved
ground around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, squeezed through to make a rail bid inside the three-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the
final furlong and was denied while well clear for the place. REFUAH was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, raced off the pace under
urging, went two then three wide around the turn, gained to make a four wide bid into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. FULL COMPLEMENT bumped with foes on both sides at the start, went to the front then moved clear, raced inside around the turn, spun into
the stretch in the two path, lost the advantage to the winner near the three-sixteenths and gave way. SINFUL DANCER stumbled at the start, settled on the
outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. SIGHT UNSEEN broke a bit awkwardly then was forced into into a rival at the start
then pinched back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. BEACH BOY AL was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide around
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.
