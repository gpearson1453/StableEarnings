Footnotes
UNBRIDLED VICTORY hustled out to gain a short lead before the first call, cleared in mid-turn, widened to the eighth pole then was under strong handling
to the wire to hold. QUICK AND EASY chased the pace while near the rail through the turn, continued closest to the rail into the lane then steadily gained to
the wire. MORE APPROVAL chased the pace from the four path through the turn, entered the lane from the five path then lacked the needed response.
SECRET SADIE was near the rail through the turn, angled into the seven path into the lane and moved up while not a threat. FLIRTY DANCER pressed the
pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. BROOKVILLE STORM chased the pace from the five path through the turn,
came into the lane from the six path and tired. GOT SPIRIT raced in the five to the six path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and
never factored.

NO MORE FAKE NEWS raced off the rail while unhurried, stayed in the four path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, caught the leader
soon after, cleared before the eighth pole and drew away then was geared down late. TRIP CHARGE chased the pace from the two or three path through
the far turn, was no match for the winner then just stayed for the place spot. AMAZINGNESS was unhurried while off the inside, gained momentum through
the turn while in the three or four path, continued in the six path entering the lane and continued with momentum to just miss the place spot. LIEUTENANT
KITTY was in the two path through the turns when reserved then oved up. HOOSIER PREMIUM set the pace while in the two path through mid-turn then
gave way. SONG OF THE SIREN was in the four to the three path through the turns and never was a factor. STARLET EXPRESS chased the pace while
along the inside and was empty through the lane.

was under pressure from another while straightening, shook that one off, cleared then was nailed at the wire. LADY FROSTED chased the pace from the
three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go then flattened late. TEMPER TIME was in
the two or three path through the turn when unhurried, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while never a mence. CURRENT CLIMATE was

Footnotes
HENDY WOODS was unhurried while in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the five path with momentum, caught the leader while
drifting in and finished on even terms while in the two path at the wire. FLIPPANT was unhurried while in the two path into the lane, bid from the three path,
split rivals approaching the sixteenth pole, was bumped and continued while drifting to the rail and was even for the top spot at the wire. LAKE LUCERNE
was in the two path through the far turn when close up, tipped into the three path for the drive, gained the lead inside the eighth pole then was outfinished by
the top two. TAKE CHARGE RO was in the three path through the turns, came into the lane from the four path and offered a mild gain. NAVRATILOVA
pressed the pace while two wide, bid into the lane while two wide, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then weakened. TIMELESS ROSE was along the
inside through the turns and never was a factor. TWO SIXTYONE set the pace along the inside while under pressure then gave way entering the lane.
WALIYAK (FR) pressed then stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF ORDER. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
HEALING WATERS was in mid-pack early while in the three or four path, continued with good momentum into the lane from the four or five path, dueled
with the runner-up through the final eighth while drifting a couple of paths then edged up. RUNAHOLIC vied for the lead from the three path from the outset,
gained the lead nearing the three-sixteenths pole, dueled with the winner through the final eighth and yielded late while second best. STARLITE RUN vied
for the lead while three wide and in the four to the three path, continued a contender after straightening in the lane and could not keep up with the top two.
FOXY BOXY raced in the two path through the turn when trailing early, continued in the two or three path and moved up while not a threat. J'S NAUGHTY
BOY vied for the lead early while along the inside of a duo then dropped out nearing the five-sixteenths pole. SOUTH DECATUR was never a factor while in
the four path through the turn. SECRETO DE AMORE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and never was a factor.
MAS ORO set the early pace while between rivals then was suddenly done approaching the quarter pole. IMPLODING raced well off the rail through the
turn, came widest into the lane and made little impact.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS tracked the pace while near the inside into the far turn, split rivals at the five-sixteenths pole to gain a short lead into the lane, repelled
challenger near the eighth pole then cleared inside the sixteenth pole. HELIUM stalked the pacesetters from the four path through the far turn, swung into
the lane from the five path, loomed a major threat near the eighth pole then could not keep up with the winner while clearly second best. RUNNIN' RAY
stumbled at the start, moved up to press the pace two wide into the far turn, gained a short lead in mid-turn, continued in close proximity into the lane, was
no match for the top two but stayed on to finish clear for the show spot. SPA CITY raced in the three path through the turns, came into the lane from the five
path and moved up while not a threat. SOUTH BEND was in the three path through the turn, entered the lane from the four path then flattened out.
ENDLESS SUNSET was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. THOMAS SHELBY raced through the four path in the first turn to gain the
early lead, continued on the lead while moving closer to the inside then gave way when headed on the far turn.

Footnotes
IVAR (BRZ) raced in the two path up the backstretch, came further off the inside after mid-turn, advanced through the three or four path in late turn, came
into the lane from the four path with aim on the leaders, shook up after straightening, moved to the leaders approaching the sixteenth pole and edged clear
while under a hand ride late. CAVALRY CHARGE saved ground through the turns, tipped to the outside of the leader into the lane, was inching past the
leader when passed by the winner late in a good effort. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN dueled for half, inched to the front through the far turn, continued with a
short lead into the lane and gave ground grudgingly. PEACE ACHIEVED raced in the two path into the far turn, came into the lane from the three path,
shifted into the five path inside the eighth pole and moved up while not a serious threat. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) chased the pace from the three path,
came into the lane from the three path and lacked a closing reponse. GRAY'S FABLE vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then gave way after
entering the lane. EL KABONG was never a factor while saving ground through throughout. CULLUM ROAD was outrun while in the two path through the
turns. BLANKET OF ROSES raced in the three path through the turns and was always last.

Footnotes
ACTUATOR stepped in at the start, raced in the three path through the first turn, continued in the three path while in close proximity, bid four wide into the
lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go, brushed with BEST ACTOR inside the sixteenth pole and held. BEST ACTOR stumbled and was forced in at
the start, raced in the three path into the far turn when never far back, moved into the four path approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane from the
five path with momentum, inched up on the winner inside the eighth pole, brushed with that one late and could not get past. KING OTTOMAN bumped both
sides at start, saved ground through the far turn when gaining, cut the corner into the lane, advanced up the rail to loom a serious threat then weakened
late. TRADEMARK set the pace while along the inside, came into the lane from the two path, challenged from both sides when straightened, continued on
well then could not keep up in the last seventy yards. MOWINS pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, was in tight while
straightening in the lane then weakened. FOWLER BLUE raced near the rail through the turns, came into the land from the three or four path and never was
a threat. RATTLE N ROLL was shut off, clipped heels and was back some nine lengths at the start, raced in the three path through the turns and was never
in it while rider did not persevere after losing all chance at the start. FIRST GLIMPSE tracked the pace along the inside through the far turn and was done
turning into the lane. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF THE RACE AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #7 BEST ACTOR
AGAINST THE RIDER OF #8 ACTUATOR FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE DID NOT RESULT IN CHANGE OF ORDER.
