Footnotes
AHEADOFTHEGAME bumped at the break, shared the early lead in hand from inside, was asked nearing the end of six furlongs, steadily drew off under a
drive in the lane and was kept to task until the final seventy yards. CAMARGO bumped AHEADOFTHEGAME then was squeezed briefly at the start,
recovered to vie for the lead outside AHEADOFTHEGAME, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but held second under steady handling.
KEEP ATTACKING broke inward, bumping MAC PANDOWDY, raced in contention running widest, in path three through the second turn then could only
widen his hold on the show late. MAC PANDOWDY bumped at the start, chased from just off the inside, swung out widest for the drive, lacked a rally and
was lugging in deep stretch. CARNAVAL CONQUEST broke inward as well, bumping CAMARGO, then showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
DEAUVILLE MIST rated behind the early leaders, waited two wide on the bend, got through three wide upper stretch, rallied between rivals and caught
QUIET DRAMA near the wire. QUIET DRAMA contested the pace between horses from the beginning, battled in close quarters just outside TEMPLUNA
through the lane, had a narrow advantage in the waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort. TEMPLUNA drifted out some as she vied for the lead
leaving the chute, disputed the pace inside rivals, fought through the stretch, did not have enough left but was clearly best of the others. ARCH FLYER
forwardly placed toward the outside, threatened four wide on the bend but could not sustain her bid in the lane. HALO COUTURE crowded leaving the
chute, altered to the outside, was widest taking the turn and had no late rally. LAUNCH AWAY forced out trying to stay clear of TEMPLUNA leaving the
chute, recovered to race in contention behind the latter, did not keep up leaving the bend, angled out upper stretch and steadily yielded.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE was hustled to prompt the pace outside QUIET DRAMA but gave way the last two furlongs.

MIND YOUR OWN was sent to soon have a clear lead, lengthened command with mild encouragement on the bend, floated out to path three into the lane
and maintained full control under steady urging. WITCHING prominent from outside, moved clear for second from path three on the bend, stayed outside
MIND YOUR OWN entering the stretch, was no match for that one but last for the place under a late drive. SUPER FIRE well placed from inside, was two
wide taking the turn, drew clear for third upper stretch, angled in with a furlong to go and was easily best of the others. NOT TO BE DENIED was steadied
when her path narrowed near the five furlong marker, had the rail on the bend, yielded leaving the turn, altered to the outside when SUPER FIRE took her
path midstretch and continued to fade. EMILY LANE raced in contention toward the outside on the backstretch, followed WITCHING through the turn and
gave way with two furlongs left.

Footnotes
ANTRIM'S GIANT was in tight quarters between horses just after the break, rated off the early pace, angled out three wide on the backstretch, commenced
his bid between rivals into the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, was all out the last furlong and got up in time. SHOBIZ STAR was steadied
back when crowded along the rail early in the first bend, got through two wide leaving that turn, was rated beside CHERNYAHOVSKIY, moved ahead when
asked on the second bend, drew clear under a drive upper stretch, began to wear down in the waning yards and was outfinished. CHERNYAHOVSKIY took
the early lead, gained the rail midway on the first turn, was challenged on the backstretch, did not stay with SHOBIZ STAR leaving the second bend, angled
outside the latter midstretch and did not close the gap in the late going. LONG STATION broke on top and quickly angled toward the inside, crowding those
inside him, was two wide on the first turn, fanned out some entering the backstretch, moved to the rail with four furlongs to go, swung out behind SHOBIZ
STAR into the lane, moved inside when CHERNYAHOVSKIY crossed his path midstretch, closed well but was too late. TOCCETIVE JAC was settled back
behind traffic just after the start, progressed to reach contention two wide on the backstretch, did not keep up on the second turn, fanned three wide into the
stretch, took LONG STATION'S path after that one angled in midstretch and showed late interest. DRAW THE LINE was prominent from inside on the
backstretch, failed to keep up with four furlongs left, saved ground taking the second bend and made up minor ground the last eighth. RADIANT CASTLE
crowded briefly after the break, moved out widest on the backstretch, did not save ground through the second turn, moved out widest again for the stretch
run and had little to offer. JOEY B void of speed, though hustled along after being crowded after the start, advanced to contention from outside on the
backstretch but faded three wide on the second bend. Due to a timer malfunction, the mile fraction is unavailable.

TIZ APPROVED broke on top and was soon clear of the others, showed the way in hand, was roused in the lane, under a drive the final furlong and was
unchallenged. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY was kept close outside TIZ APPROVED, under urging through the stretch, could not close the gap on the leader but
steadily drew off for the place. CITY POSITION moved outside GIRLOLAMO'GLORY with four furlong left, stayed in path three through the bend and had no
significant stretch bid. JACK N JOHN moved out widest early on and showed little.

Footnotes
SUSPECT steadily angled in as he vied for the lead leaving the chute, set a pressured pace just off the inside, moved clear and took the rail into the bend,
floated out some as he was roused leaving the turn then held sway under steady handling in the lane. LATIN CASINO was forced in after leaving the chute,
did not keep up along the rail on the turn, rallied in the stretch, moved clear for second, threatened with a furlong left but began to level off in the waning
yards. W W CRAZY hustled along early, raced in contention along the rail on the backstretch, waited for room behind LATIN CASINO on the bend, altered
outside the latter upper stretch, altered out again for a clear path with a sixteenth to go and was closing the gap late. EL ASESINO pressed SUSPECT from
just outside then gradually flattened out for the drive. LONESOME DREAM prominent from outside, was four to five wide taking the turn and faded after
upper stretch. MKAR THE FAST was in tight briefly between rivals shortly after entering the main track, raced in contention between rivals, yielded from
path three after three furlongs and only passed outside a couple tired rivals the last eighth. NAUGHTY ALFRED was a factor between horses for a half mile
then gave way. TAP'S BIG SHOT in contention early, faded two wide on the bend.
