Footnotes
PICTURE LADY vied outside of CAMCORDIA on the first turn and into the backstretch, shook free at the half mile marker, widened to a clear advantage in
upper stretch and kept to task. CAMCORDIA vied for the lead inside of PICTURE LADY around the first turn and into the backstretch, failed to maintain
equal terms with the eventual winner past the half mile marker pole but remained in pursuit, chased two to three wide into the lane and secured second
best. PAPA'S SECRET stalked the top pair through early stages, launched a three wide bid around the final turn and churned on for a share. CATALE
settled in the back through early stages, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. GIROLAMO LUCY tracked the pace along the inside through the
backstretch then steadily retreated.

TRUE SAINT came away in good order and taken in hand to rate near midpack, began to edge up closer three to four wide late on the turn, given cue in
three path upper stretch, steadily edged up closer on the leader and got up in time. MY BOY GUS sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn,
continued with a clear advantage a furlong out then got caught in final strides. RUBIGINOUS stalked in early stages then hustled along three wide around
the turn, sustained bid into the lane and prevailed for a share. ROCK CITY ROCKET raced off the early pace, urged four wide around the turn, came five
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KEESAWAH raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and never threatened. FUNANDFUNNY raced
in contention through early stages, urged inside around the turn then weakened in the lane.

ROCK CITY ROADHOG was well rated sitting in tracking position off the top pair, began to edge up closer three wide late on the turn, given cue three to
four wide heading into the lane, steadily edged up closer and ran down the leader in final stages. HIS GIANT set the early pace and held firm around the
turn, continued clear a furlong out then got outkicked in final stages. KING OF ANYTHING raced in the back through early stages, was ridden along four
wide into upper stretch and produced a solid finish. JERRYS PRIDENJOY chased the leader up the backstretch, continued two wide in contention around
the turn then flattened in the lane. MATCHLOCK raced off the early pace, saved ground and launched an inside bid into stretch run, briefly gained closer
contention then gave way.

JACK'S PARTY GIRL took over the lead leaving the backstretch and held clear around the turn, turned back the bid from BLUSHING SCARLETT a furlong
out and held firm under a driving finish. BLUSHING SCARLETT tracked the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid for JACKS PARTY GIRL
at the head of the lane, raced in close contention but could not reach the winner and had to settle for second best. VOODAYO broke out at the start and
raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch and churned on for a share. I'M NASTY TOO led the way in opening stages then got
collared entering the turn, chased along the rail into the lane and gave way in the final furlong. CLINE TIME showed brief speed then steadily retreated.

HELLO DARLING got carried four to five wide entering the first turn then settled nicely while rated off the pace, began to edge up closer along the outside
late on the far turn, given cue four wide upper stretch, took command past the furlong marker and kicked clear. ATHENAS SONG tracked in contention up
the backstretch then lacked a clear path mid-way around the far turn, swung to the outside and launched a bid, rallied and captured place. OLIVE OYL led
the way around the first turn then dueled up the backstretch and around the far turn, briefly shook free and fought back upper stretch then got collared by
the winner past the furlong marker and yielded late. SAMIRA stalked the pace up the backstretch, roused three wide around the far turn and ran on evenly
through the lane. SASSY AIN'T I raced three to four wide heading into the first turn then advanced to challenge OLIVE OYL for the lead, dueled inside of
rival through the far turn then came up empty past the furlong marker. DARK SILENCE raced in the back, steadily retreated and got vanned off after the
race.

Footnotes
ALWAYS A CATCH tracked the pace through early stages, picked up the tempo three wide mid-way around the far turn, dug in determinedly in pursuit of
the leader and edged by rival in closing strides. KILLEEN sped to a clear lead around the first turn and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held
clear around the far turn then came two wide into upper stretch, dug in under right handed pressure, maintained a slim lead in the final furlong then got
edged out late. GOTTA LOVE IKE rated off the top pair through early stages, was ridden three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and
churned on for a share. BIG HEARTED FACTOR stalked the leader around the first turn and through the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn
and gave way. PROMISING SHOES lacked speed and trailed the field, was ridden three to four wide into the lane and failed to rally. MAD AT MONEY
raced off the pace, saved ground on the final turn and failed to move into contention.
