slightly at the start, then was unhurried, came two-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. LIGHTNING STAR was bumped at the start by
Attorney Louis, then was forwardly place to near the stretch but lacked a rally. ATTORNEY LOUIS broke out to bump Lightning Star at the start, then was
hard held to be reserved off the early pace while three-wide and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
MOSCOW LADY was allowed to settle in stride racing along the inside, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch, caught Rodeo Rose at the sixteenth
pole and gradually edged clear. RODEO ROSE was off a step slow to get away behind her field, then moved up along the outside to join the leaders before
going a quarter mile, vied for the lead into the stretch, gained a slight lead nearing the eighth pole, but wasn't quite able to resist the winner late. FLY
ROBYN FLY saved ground setting the pressured pace into the stretch and held on fairly well for the show when headed. PAISLEE'S PULPIT vied for the
early lead from along the inside but lacked the needed response. CALLIOPE SONG was finished early while racing three-wide. R HAPPY PLACE hopped in
the air at the start and showed little after that.

CURLING SECRET dueled for the lead from the outset while two-wide and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. JUSPASSINTHRU stumbled slightly at
the start, then rushed up along the inside to vie for the lead and just missed in a game effort. PERFECT ONE was unhurried early, moved up along the
inside on the turn and was making up some ground late. IGOTTABOOBOO was well placed early while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. NORTHERN
BLEND failed to threaten while racing three-wide. IMISSBAYMEADOWS dropped well off the pace early and showed little.

MR. STANG was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished with a rush to be up late. HARD TO DENY prompted the pace from along the
inside, dropped back slightly nearing the quarter pole, angled out for the drive and came on again during the drive in a game try. DEFENSE WINS was
never far back, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FOREVER GOLD vied for the early lead racing in hand while two-wide, shook
clear nearing the quarter pole, set the pace to deep stretch and weakened slightly. MUNCEY bobbled at the start, then dropped back and saved ground and
found his best stride too late. DEMOCRAT was forwardly placed from the start, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.

WHATSTHEDIFF vied for the early lead from along the inside, opened a slight advantage leaving the quarter pole and held a safe edge to the wire. BOBBY
BUCKETS dueled for the early lead from between horses, was unable to stay with the winner but held on gamely for the place. IM MR BIG was off a step
slow to get away behind his field, moved up five-wide on the turn, was bumped nearing the quarter pole by Teachersbugaroo and then finished strongly
when clear. DEVIL'S OFF DUTY prompted the issue while racing three-wide and weakened. HEFTY GARCIA failed to seriously threaten while racing
two-wide. LUCKY SNAKE was not a factor while saving ground. TEACHERSBUGSAROO was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide, came out
nearing the quarter to bump Im Mr Big, then stumbled and gave way.
