Footnotes
K C'S FIRST B M W broke readily, angled to the inside disputing the pace inside foes through the backstretch into the turn, continued in a protracted
skirmish past midstretch but edged forward late under firm handling. SMART OXIE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the bend, gained
position between foes while shifting inwards nearing the wire and prevailed narrowly for the place honors. R VOO'S TABOO, urged three deep in the
opening quarter prompting the pace, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner striking the front racing into upper stretch, drifted out in late stages and
weakened nearing the wire. WILDCAT HAGRID tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and continued evenly inside foes in late stages.
STUN GUN settled last on the backstretch, saved ground on the the turn, tipped off the inside in upper stretch and made some belated progress. RED
WAVE was urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch and gave way racing into the turn. FINAL VISION broke slowly, while being
steadied off a rival at the start and never gained contention.

Footnotes
XTREME V. I. P. hopped at the start, was quickly righted, then urged pursuing the pacesetter into the first turn, moved to press the issue on the far turn
pressed the issue through the far turn past midstretch in a prolonged drive and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. HIGHTAIL COWBOY, urged
along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage to the first turn, dueled for command through the backstretch to late stages contesting the issue
grudgingly to the end but just failed to contain the winner. MARQUEE RIDE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped
out on the far turn while being urged to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but flattened out in the drive. TOP DOG settled along the inside, then continued
evenly into the stretch. SHATTERED DREAMS switched off the inside tracking the leaders in second flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn.
THIRSTY KISS settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. STAR MISSION was a brief factor three deep in second flight racing to the
backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
DEVOTED TO YOU, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pace, was eased off the leaders while shifting out three wide racing into the turn,
pressed the issue to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. PASSTHECAT settled off the second flight
while angling inwards nearing the turn, split foes racing into the lane, then shifted to the five path in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors late.
RUBY'S RED DEVIL tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was fanned four wide while being prompted to advance in tandem with
the eventual winner racing into turn, gained second racing four wide past midstretch but lost some momentum when drifting late. HOLDENTIGHT was urged
pressing the pace between foes through the backstretch, shifted to the inside dueling for command through the turn to upper stretch but weakened late. DA
GHOST settled well off the pace racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn but offered no rally. GUN WAR tracked the leaders three
wide in second flight racing to the turn and faded early. SHAQ'S MY DADDY was urged three wide pressing the pace in the opening quarter, dueled for
command between foes racing through the turn and gave out entering the lane. OVERSEAS LETTER proved no factor.

Footnotes
DESERT GLOW, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue on the far turn into the lane, drifted to the five path in late stages but edged
forward to a narrow advantage under firm encouragement. FORTUNATA was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin while angling to the inside, dueled
for command on the far turn into upper stretch, resisted the winner to the end but proved only second best. CERULEAN tracked off the first flight outside a
rival to the backstretch, tipped out three wide racing through the far turn while being urged to advance and prevailed for a share while failing to gain terms
with the top pair. DELUSIONAL DREAM, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the lane and continued
to improve position. WINTER MUSIC angled to the inside crossing the path of PRINCESS OF MALIBU to track off the second flight to the backstretch,
gained position between foes racing into the far turn but lacked the needed final bid. WALK SOFTLY angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight for
five furlongs, then faded into upper stretch. MS CORONADO CHROME settled last to the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and gained some position
while making no impact. SUMMER MATE, bumped hard by PRINCESS OF MALIBU leaving the chute, failed to menace thereafter. INNOVATE tracked off
the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and quickly came up empty. PRINCESS OF MALIBU, caught
in tight quarters, then steadied along the inside leaving the chute bumping SUMMER MATE, shifted out four wide racing to the backstretch and came up
empty on the far turn.

Footnotes
RICKEY B was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, shook clear racing into the turn, widened the advantage under pressure and held
sway on a safe margin to the end. KIERKEGAARD tracked off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch, switched outside the leader on the
turn while being urged to advance on that foe but couldn't gain even terms while besting the others. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT broke awkwardly, settled last to
the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out racing through the stretch to edge a rival for a share. YOU SPLIT TENS settled along the inside
racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but was outkicked for a share. RELEASE THE BEAST, urged between foes pressing
the pace on the backstretch, gave way early. GIVE EM HECK BECK hopped at the start, switched outside the leaders on the backstretch while being urged
in brief pursuit to the turn but faded into the lane. CAN'T BEAT ME flashed brief pace three wide on the backstretch and emptied out early.

Footnotes
HOITY TOITY was rated between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, saved ground through the far turn,
came through inside the pacesetter when presented an opening to wrest command leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. INDAWIN
was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, continued three deep into the lane, then angled inwards in late stages to split foes just off
the inside to prevail for the place honors on the wire. LIZZ A BEE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the far turn, was fanned seven wide racing
through the stretch but continued to make belated progress to the end. SILVERA was urged to a forward placing between foes tracking the pacesetter in
second flight a bit off the rail, lodged a brief bid just outside the leader racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. BIG NEWS COMING, reserved last,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. JAGGED ARROW was hustled clear along the rail to the backstretch, held
sway to upper stretch and gave out between foes leaving the furlong marker. MIZZANNA was rated off the second flight outside rivals to the far turn, was
fanned six wide into upper stretch but had no final kick. TEQUILA MARY angled to the inside early tracking just behind the second flight, saved ground on
the far turn, then angled out four wide in the stretch while lacking the needed final kick. LADY PHYLLIS, forwardly placed three wide between foes tracking
the pacesetter in second flight to the backstretch, continued in pursuit in that path to upper stretch and gave way. FANCY EMPRESS settled along the
inside early and proved no threat. THAT LUVIN FEELING, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
JOKER MATT was rated off the second flight while angling inwards to race between foes just off the inside in the opening half, was prompted to advance
between foes on the far turn, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the quarter mile marker, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch, then produced a stout
rally under firm handling to strike the front in time. SHADOWLESS was urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside, met the challenge of
a rival leaving the far turn dueling for command past midstretch and continued grudgingly while just failing to contain the winner. TONKA WARRIOR tracked
the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into upper stretch while being roused to challenge but was outkicked by the
top pair. TEST PILOT, very reluctant to load, delaying the start for several minutes, gained a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn to strike the front entering the stretch, drifted out three deep in late stages and failed to sustain his momentum. CHROME
KING, reserved in the last flight to the backstretch, split foes three deep nearing the lane, then shifted five wide in late stages improving position to the end.
NO MORE Z U tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY tracked the leaders three, then four wide between foes to the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane. THE GREEN
CRUSADER reserved last to the backstretch, failed to menace. NEXT JOURNEY angled to the rail nearing the backstretch settling well off the leaders and
proved no threat. BIT COINER was caught five wide through the first turn to the backstretch and retreated early.
