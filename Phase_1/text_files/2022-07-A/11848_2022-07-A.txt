ALL RISE UP was away in good order to battle for the lead first in the three path up the backstretch but got to the rail into the turn opened a good lead in the
stretch and was all out to hold on in the final stages. BULL RING was well back in the early stages along the inside came five wide entering the stretch and
was getting to the winner late but ran out of ground. OUR HALF FIRST raced mid pack in the two path much of the race made a mild bid in the lane but
could not match strides with the top two. MORO HOUDINI was away well and battling for the lead along the inside was in tight quarters and forced to steady
dropped back and could not recover after that. BENTLEY was up close along the inside in the early stages but began a steady fade midway up the
backstretch. LEFT BEHIND was in contention while three wide on the turn lugged out badly entering the stretch and the rider eased the horse while trying to
regain control. MORO BLACK BOOK was fractious in the post parade coming onto the track broke in the back and never had a rally.

Footnotes
COUGAR COUNTRY chased the pace in the two path came out a bit in mid stretch then was straightened and held gamely. After a stewards inquiry into the
stretch run, the stewards ruled that Cougar Country did not cause Gee Whiz Who to lose a better finish. GEE WHIZ WHO came three wide into the stretch
to battle for the lead with Cougar Country on the outside was carried out briefly but the stewards ruled the stretch incident did not affect the order of finish.
GOLD LABEL came through along the inside on the turn to save all the ground and was closing well along the rail. GONE PARADISE showed good early
speed to get to the rail by the turn but gave way through the stretch run. THORNISH was up close early then was six wide through the stretch and could not
make up ground. SLICK IT UP showed good early speed while three wide and then began to fade going into the turn. GAME DAY DECISION was well off
the pace then swung four wide into the stretch and could not make up ground.

BULLAWAY showed the best early speed but stayed in the two path up the backstretch was challenged every step of the way and edged clear through the
stretch for the win. DOWNTOWN BROWN showed good early speed and was able to slip[ through on the inside up the backstretch continued to engage for
the lead on the rail but could not match strides with the winner late. LAST CALL LEROY was up close while four wide up the backstretch but could not
match strides with the top two down the stetch. CIRCLE BACK raced five wide on the turn and never mounted a rally in the stretch. FEISTY BIRD was up
close while three wide on the turn but drifted out through the stretch while dropping back. OTHER THAN THAT was off slow losing about three lengths at
the start trailed for much of the race and passed a tired foe in the stretch. SHKEURTAILFEATHERS was always well back and came up empty in the stretch
while not a factor.

BLUE TWISTED STEEL showed best speed from the gate was headed by Rocketringo on the inside up the backstretch took command once again on the
turn and drew clear to win handily as much the best. SEELEY was well off the early pace along the inside saved ground on the turn and came out for the
drive was up for second in the final yards but was never a threat to the winner. OPTIMAL showed good early speed but was hung three wide on the turn and
could not match strides with the top two through the stretch. ROCKETRINGO showed good early speed and had the rail up the backstretch relinquished the
lead going into the turn and dropped back through the stretch. BEHOLD DE FLAME raced along the inside in the middle of the pack angled out for the drive
but could not make up ground. PAPA CABALLERO was well off the pace came three wide through the lane and passed a few horses late. DEJA CREW
was mid pack along the inside in the early stages and steadily faded. BRAVE HELIOS was well back came six wide entering the stretch and dropped back.

Footnotes
WILDCAT NATION was well in the back in the early stages while three deep came four wide on the turn to battle for the lead drifted in a bit through the
stretch but held off Rockymountaintwist for the win. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST was allowed to settle behind the wall of horses battling for the lead had the
perfect rail trip and moved up when the hole opened on the inside but could not match strides with the winner late. DRYSPELL had the best early speed and
saved the rail through the turn came out a bit entering the stretch but was able to hold third. TOMBI was well of the early pace came widest off all on the turn
behind the tiring frontrunners and was making up some ground through the stretch. BEE EXXTRAVAGANT battled for the lead in the two path but began to
drop back turning for home and was not a factor in the stretch. KITTEN'S BULL showed good early speed but was stuck three wide on the turn nd dropped
back. WILLY B raced in the middle of the pack while three wide and never mounted a serious charge. MAGICAL STAR was hung four wide in a speed duel
going into the turn and began to drop back and had nothing left for the stretch run.
