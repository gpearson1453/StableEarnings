DAAHERACHEL dueled with the eventual winner around the turn and into the lane and yielded late. HOPING FOR A RING raced near midpack, hustled
along four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. GLAMOROUS LIFE raced off the early pace, saved ground into the lane and improved
position. FIFTH RISK raced in early contention then weakened late on the turn. FADED MEMORIES raced off the pace and lacked a needed rally. DIXIE
PENNY raced near midpack into the turn then steadily weakened. MISCHIEF MAMA was not too far back early on, chased three to four wide then faded.

TYLER'S TRIBE sped to the lead soon after the start and set the uncontested pace, widened advantage still unleashed around the turn, roused for more at
the head of the lane, responded willingly and finished going away. TODDCHERO tracked the pacesetter into the turn, hustled along three wide into upper
stretch and failed to be a match for the winner. TOP RECRUIT rated off the second flight entering the turn, chased three to four wide into the lane and
stayed on for a share. UNDALAY was forwardly placed in early stages, flattened mid-way around the turn and had no late response. BAYTOWN GET IT ON
raced outside off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FREE FROM GUILT raced in the last flight, saved ground on the turn
and lacked a rally.

BUTTERBEAN was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, continued unhurried through early stages then began to pick up
the tempo past the half mile marker, quickly gained closer contention near the inside the shifted three wide turning for home, responded gamely to clear
command a furlong out and finished going away. FALCONET prompted the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead on the far turn, began to edge away
on top in upper stretch then got overtaken by the winner and cleared second best. FREE LIKE A GIRL set the pace around the first turn and through the
backstretch, dueled with FALCONET around the far turn, failed to move on for the lead at the head of the lane but stayed on for a share. CANDY RAID
rated off the top trio in early stages, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane and needed more for impact. MY FRIEND
AMY was reserved racing in the back through the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and improved position without threatening. HARTLEY stalked the
pace three to four wide through the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn then faded in the lane. MISS HARD KNOCKS was well placed tracking the
top trio through the backstretch, flattened mid-way around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. NOSILVERSPOONSHERE raced off the pace, had
no response when called upon and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
AIN'T LIFE GRAND raced three wide into the first turn then settled nicely racing off the second flight midway up the backstretch, was ridden along three
wide around the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch, dug in gamely through the lane and got up late. CONAGHER prompted the pace around the first
turn then dueled for the lead with ROME up the backstretch, battled on into the far turn, shook free at the five sixteenth pole, continued well clear along the
inside a furlong out then got reeled in late. CHILENO was reserved and raced in the back, saved ground on the final turn, cut the corner and edged closer a
furlong out then tipped two wide mid-stretch and produced a solid finish. DIAMOND RIM was rated off the early pace, launched a three wide bid mid-way
around the far turn and sustained a mild run through the lane. BIG BLUE LINE bumped a bit at the start then tracked the top flight through the backstretch,
hustled along two wide on the far turn then faded in the lane. ROME led the way on the first turn, dueled along the inside up the backstretch and into the far
turn then came up tired nearing the quarter pole. FEEL THE FEAR raced in contention tracking the top flight then faded on the final turn. MAJOR GENERAL
raced off the top flight up the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.

Footnotes
OFFICIATING settled nicely tracking the embattled duo up the backstretch, picked up the tempo mid-way around the far turn and given cue three wide at
the quarter pole, roused four wide into upper stretch, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of FLEETRIDGE and forged clear in deep stretch. FLEETRIDGE
raced two wide into the first turn and briefly led the way then dueled outside of FLASH OF MISCHIEF up the backstretch, battled on into the lane, shook free
in the final furlong then could not contain the winner late. WARRANT rated three to four wide in range up the backstretch, hustled along four wide late on the
far turn, came five wide into the lane, sustained response under left handed pressure and prevailed for a share. FLASH OF MISCHIEF was forwardly placed
around the first turn then dueled with FLEETRIDGE up the backstretch, continued to battle along the inside past the furlong marker then gave way. SILVER
PROSPECTOR raced in range near the inside midway up the backstretch, urged two wide around the far turn and failed to move on. RATED R
SUPERSTAR got bumped a bit at the start and rated under slight restraint into the backstretch, was a bit keen and tugged to midpack at the half mile
marker then failed to sustain bid and steadily retreated.

TOSKA'S RULER briefly vied for the lead then held clear around the turn, widened advantage in upper stretch and kept to task. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED was
forwardly placed three around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and finished second best. LATE FOR LUNCH hustled up four wide around the turn,
ran on into the lane and prevailed for a share. BIG PINES SANDY was reserved racing in the back, swung wide into the lane and improved position. JUSTA
STREAK raced midpack into the turn and flattened in the lane. WAR RON vied with the winner in the opening quarter, chased inside around the turn then
faded. FINISH UP hustled up along the outside and failed to move into contention. CHINLEE rated off the early pace, began to make a move along the
inside at the head of the lane but lacked a clear path, steadied and lost all momentum.
