Footnotes
NIMBLE BEAST pursued the loose leader, took over midway on the turn then drew away remaining safe driving. RACK GIN dropped back outside, moved
wide on the turn then split foes gaining late. HE HATE ME angled inside early, moved out in the stretch and closed well. STILL HAVING FUN broke slowly
and trailed early then lacked a solid rally. PASSAGE OF LINES saved ground off the pace, faded on the turn then passed faders. FLOAT ON chased the
leaders wide throughout and proved empty in the stretch. KNOCKOUT KICK quickly sprinted clear inside, was collared midway on the turn and stopped.

pace, dropped back briefly in the stretch then came again outside. WITHOUT A VIEW saved ground close up and made a gradual gain in the stretch. FALL
CAMPAIGN stumbled at the break then moved inside through the stretch. MISS ALEX dropped back outside and continued very wide while no factor.
SWEET BALLERINA lagged far behind then caught fading rivals. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS chased inside and weakened steadily. VANISHING FAITH forced
the pace three wide for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
FRAN'S WORRIER settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out at the quarter pole, collared the pacesetters and edged off in a moderate drive. FOX RED
earned a narrow lead outside, was passed in the stretch and continued gamely to the finish. LITTLE HARBOUR vied along the inside and continued
determinedly to the end. FLAT LUCKY trailed early, moved very wide on the turn and rallied mildly. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE chased three wide off the
pace, made a menacing bid into the lane then tired. JAMMINWITHBRANDON lacked speed along the inside and failed to threaten. HIZAAM raced well
behind outside and was never a factor. THE BIG S raced along the inside off the leaders and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WHITE LILACS stalked the dueling leaders inside, angled out at the quarter pole then pulled clear through the stretch. MISQUILLO dropped far behind then
offered late energy outside. LET'S CELEBRATE dueled along the inside to the stretch and weakened. HUSKY SPIRIT firmly rated inside, advanced on the
final turn then flattened out late. BOHEMIA BABE dueled outside to the stretch and faltered. MONSTER RISING lacked speed, made a menacing move into
the lane, was blocked and taken up losing momentum at the top of the stretch. FRAME THIS trailed early and was never in contention. SHARON'S LAW
raced close up outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
NICKYS NOTION vied for the lead outside, drifted in slightly in midstretch then bore out the final eighth and lasted. QUEEN CORDELIA eased back to
inside into the far turn, was blocked and in tight near midstretch, rallied and just missed. CASH ON FIRST outrun early, advanced inside and closed with
rush too late. DREAM TRACER chased inside early, moved wide in the stretch and closed well. DESIGNED TO DAZZLE hustled to the front inside, led to
midstretch and weakened. LADY SIMPATIA prompted the pace outside and faltered in the final eighth. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY swung wide into the stretch,
ducked in and was no factor. TREASURE SEEKER faded on the turn, was taken up sharply in early stretch between foes. NARYUA W was urged off the
pace inside and faded. SARATOGA DREAM dropped back at the start and lost contact with her field. Following a claim of foul by the runner-up against the
winner for interference in the stretch, NICKYS NOTION was disqualified and placed second.
