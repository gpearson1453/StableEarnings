Footnotes
GEH SCHNELL allowed to settle, circled rivals four wide past the quarter pole, was carried out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, made the lead in
deep stretch and drew clear. SUPER VISION was in tight along the rail on the firs turn, split horses two wide to make the lead past the half mile marker,
edged clear on the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, dug in but was no match for the winner. GUCCISSIMO tracked the leaders three wide
into the stretch, altered course past mid track and finished determinedly. ALGORIX set a pressured pace two wide, came on again in upper stretch but was
outfinished. BUCKY was no factor. CONDUCIVE pressed the early pace and was through after a half. SCHMULTZY had speed for a half, stopped and
jogged to the wire.

THANKSDAD away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside, turned back a bid from the runner up on the turn and into the stretch then proved best
under mild right handed urging. MARCH MAGIC pressed the pace four then two wide, drew on near even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole,
matched stride until deep stretch and finished clear for second. NOSEY POWER never far back, finished with good courage along the inside. ZAROSHA
pressed the pace four then three wide and faded in the stretch. JOHNS BIG RED was no factor. DASH OF FIRE was no threat. BIG TIME FLIRT pressed
the pace three then two wide and was through after a half. TANNER stumbled badly at the start and trailed.

SAMMY AND SHORTY away alertly, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook clear then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while in
hand. KING PATRIOT never far back, rallied on the turn and into the stretch near the inside and finished clear for second. CASUAL ATTIRE passed tiring
rivals. PRIMITIVO had speed from the start, inched closer on the turn, drifted to the five path then failed to sustain that bid. OKLAHOMA JOE pressured the
winner two wide into the turn then was through after a half. INDY CARR was bumped at the start and no factor. LITTLE RONS ROCKET broke in a tangle,
bore in bumping hard with INDY CARR at the start and was never involved. CONTROLLER had brief speed. AINT NO BANDLEADER flashed speed and
stopped.

Footnotes
BELLAVALENCIA away alertly, stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch and finished full of run under
strong handling to win as much the best. OAXACA prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead briefly then was no match for the winner.
PURDY PUMKIN unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the five path. STRAIGHT TO GO went evenly. MISS ENCISO broke ion front, set a pressured pace
along the rail into the turn then was used up. TEST YOUR FAITH was outrun. ROMA MONA had brief speed. MALIBU SKY was no factor.
