Footnotes
ABBMAR broke on top and in a few seconds was many lengths ahead of the others, showed the way in hand, received slight hand urging in the stretch and
was allowed to coast in the waning yards. WEEKEND PASS chased from inside, swung out entering the lane, was under steady urging and easily second
best. SPECIAL CONQUEST was soon well back, saved ground taking the turn and did not respond to hand urging in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRYST CAT was hustled from the gate to set a pressured pace between rivals, moved clear when allowed into the bend, took the rail, was asked again
leaving the bend, gradually opened up in the stretch under a mild drive and was allowed to coast the final sixty yards. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN broke on top,
was soon chasing TRYST CAT from just outside, retreated some from between rivals on the turn, swung outside MY WIFE IS BOSS for the stretch run,
could not close the gap on the leader but gained second with fifty yards to go. MY WIFE IS BOSS briefly rank at the start, moved up quickly from outside
once under control, threatened just outside the leader with two furlongs left, proved no match for TRYST CAT when set down for the drive and began to
wear down inside the final furlong. LILLET displayed early speed from inside but gradually began to yield before finishing a half mile. GHAALEB'S APPEAL
hustled along from the beginning, steadily faded after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
CAIRO SUMMER was bumped by G MONEY LIV shortly after the break, stalked the latter from just outside, floated out some into the lane, was under
steady urging the final furlong and pulled away as much the best. WILDWOOD'S WILDCAT never far back, progressed four wide on the bend, fanned out
further to stay outside CAIRO SUMMER, lodged her bid and gained second widest of all in the waning yards. G MONEY LIV drifted out some to bump
CAIRO SUMMER shortly after the start, was hustled to a clear lead, threatened from both sides on the turn, was no match for the latter the last eighth and
began to wear down approaching the last sixteenth. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER was bumped off stride at the break, recovered to prompt the early leader from
inside then gradually wore down for the drive. VALE OF EVESHAM broke outward, bumping solidly with BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER, raced in contention from
just off the rail but gave way with three furlongs to go.

AFOOLER rated off the pace and the inside, angled in on the bend, rallied under steady urging the last eighth, moved clear inside the final sixteenth, drifted
out the last sixty yards but maintained control. APOLLO U ANYWHERE angled out some early to make her bid at FIRST SQUADRON, vied for the lead on
the turn, was carried out some entering the lane, lacked the extra needed in the late going but edged ahead of the latter to gain second. FIRST SQUADRON
was hustled to the early lead and the inside, was just off the rail on the turn when challenged by APOLLO U ANYWHERE, drifted out some entering the
stretch, battled to hold on, could not stay with AFOOLER the last sixteenth and gradually yielded for the place. RARE ACTION ATTACK rated from outside,
was just off the rail on the bend, rallied belatedly the final furlong and altered in when AFOOLER took her path in the waning yards. Due to a timer
malfunction, the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
OFF TO THE BEACH was rated from inside for more than a half mile, picked up hid pace into the second bend, waited for room behind CONCOCTION
approaching the end of six furlongs, squeezed through along the rail into the lane, took the lead, drew off under a drive inside the last eighth and was kept to
task until the waning yards. CONCOCTION edged ahead for the early lead on the first turn, was rated from inside on the backstretch, moved clear on the
second turn, floated out slightly leaving that bend, was no match for OFF TO THE BEACH in the stretch and kept EL ROMANTICO at bay for second under
steady handling. EL ROMANTICO forwardly placed outside TAIGA HONEY, gained second nearing the end of five furlongs, threatened just outside
CONCOCTION on the second turn, drifted out some at the top of the lane, weaved in and back out midstretch, kept a straight path inside the final furlong,
lacked a significant response but was easily best of the rest. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS well back and unnecessarily wide, only passed outside a couple
rivals the last eighth. WAVE THE GOLD bumped at the start, was urged along from well off the rail midway on the backstretch, angled in on the second turn,
improved position then came up empty for the stretch run. TAIGA HONEY quickly overcame being jostled between rivals at the break to vie for the lead
outside CONCOCTION on the backstretch but gave way before finishing five furlongs. DEXTER'S HARD TIME broke outward, exchanged bumps with
TAIGA HONEY, was soon far back and showed little throughout the race.

INCORRUPTIBLE was hustled from the gate, bumped leaving the chute, quickly moved clear of the others, was then allowed to relax, roused again midway
on the turn, floated out entering the stretch and kept PALACE KITTEN at bay under steady handling. PALACE KITTEN moved to the outside early on,
threatened two wide on the bend, angled to the inside when his path was taken nearing the eighth pole, could not close the gap on the leader deep stretch
but was unchallenged for second. VIOLENZA D'ORO bumped INCORUPTIBLE leaving the chute, moved to the inside when PALACE KITTEN came out
shortly after that, closed the gap some from along the rail on the turn, also floated out some for the stretch run, moved out widest nearing the last eighth and
slowly yielded.

GONEGHOST vied for the early lead from inside, lost the advantage into the turn, battled through the lane and edged ahead of R H SMOAKEM the final
sixteenth. R H SMOAKEM broke on top, soon share the lead outside GONEGHOST, moved ahead from between horses into the bend, drifted out briefly
nearing the last furlong, was straightened, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. STUMP advanced from inside on the backstretch, angled out
three wide on the turn, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but proved easily best of the others. COOL AMBITION soon trailed, gradually advanced on the
bend and upper stretch then leveled off. DR. LIECHTY raced in contention toward the outside for four furlongs then began to flatten out. BEL BIMBO was
fractious in the gate then showed little in a wide trip.
