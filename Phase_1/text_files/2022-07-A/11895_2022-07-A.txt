Footnotes
READTHETRANSCRIPT broke a bit outward and on top, showed the way between rivals, stayed just off the inside on the turn, floated out some entering
the lane, responded to urging, lengthened command and maintained control while allowed to coast the final sixteenth. WILDWOODS DREAM was bumped
and forced into ANUNKA at the break, kept close just off the inside, angled out through the bend, rallied from path five in the stretch and drew clear for
second inside the last sixteenth. ANUNKA bumped and forced outward at the start, pressed READTHETRANSCRIPT from just outside for a half mile, did
not keep stay with that one upper stretch, finished evenly but was unchallenged for third. STORM BORN was steadied back when his path was taken just
after the break, chased from outside, came three wide into the lane and passed outside tired ones. MISSOURI GENT broke outward starting a chain
reaction of bumping, raced in contention from inside the steadily faded after three furlongs. HIGH LIFE AGAIN was a brief contender from outside but gave
way from between rivals on the bend.

Footnotes
DARK NINJA rated on the front end between rivals, was three wide on the turn, angled in some for the stretch run, was all out and narrowly held on. AGAVE
KID stumbled just after leaving the gate, was hustled up from inside to prompt the pace, under steady urging in the lane, came up short and just lasted for
the place. FRONTANA prominent from the beginning, was in close quarters two wide with two furlongs left, did not keep up leaving the bend, angled out
three wide for a clear path upper stretch, closed well but was also too late. GONZO chased from outside, was widest taking the turn and showed a
willingness to run through the lane. GOLDENPENCE raced in contention four wide for a half mile then began to fade. Z U SOON was soon far back, eased
in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
IRISH LIGHTED ROAD broke in stride, sprinted away from the rest while in hand, floated out when put to urging into the stretch and kept to task until the
last fifty yards. COPPER CROSSING rated between rivals, was two wide taking the bend, rallied between horses, took over second inside the last furlong
then could only pull away for the place. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE bumped EVIDENCE at the start, raced in the second flight between horses, came three
wide into the stretch, battled for second but began to wear down inside the last eighth. ON THE MUSCLE advanced two wide on the turn, angled to the
outside upper stretch, improved his position but only made up minor ground in the late going. EVIDENCE bumped at the break, raced in second flight from
along the rail then gradually wore down for the drive. MUNCH raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, was three then four wide taking the bend
and also flattened out in the lane. RIP IT RYAN unruly in the gate, had no speed, though hustled along, raced wide throughout and only made up ground
deep stretch. A BIG A BAD BILL showed little in a ground-saving trip.

PACHI pressed from inside, rallied in the lane, engaged CHOPPER with a sixteenth left and edged ahead in the waning yards. CHOPPER broke on top, set
a pressured pace in hand between horses, floated out to path four entering the lane, was under steady urging but did not have enough left deep stretch.
DEVIL'S RULE pressed from just outside PACHI on the backstretch, angled out three wide into the turn, lost ground staying outside the latter into the
stretch, lacked a rally but held off THE LAST OPTION for the show. THE LAST OPTION hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, chased from the
outside, was three wide on the bend, swung out widest entering the lane, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the final furlong and was making up
ground late. RENEGADE BOB raced in contention four wide on the backstretch, faded from just off the inside on the turn and failed to have a stretch bid.

Footnotes
U CAN DO IT advanced in hand between rivals on the backstretch, followed PRINCESS MANDII on the turn, lost considerable ground staying outside the
latter entering the stretch, rallied under urging and drew off the final furlong. PRINCESS MANDII contested the pace from outside, moved in beside HEART
OF REASON after two furlongs, was forced out by the latter leaving the bend, fought for the lead from path six, was no match for U CAN DO IT inside the
last eighth but was easily second best. BEZEL SET prominent from outside on the backstretch, stayed in path four taking the turn, angled outside HEART
OF REASON upper stretch and drew away for third the final sixteenth. HEART OF REASON disputed the pace from just off the inside, drifted out leaving
the turn and gave way for the stretch run. THEYCALLHERPINKY failed to menace in a wide trip. THE MORE I BURN raced in contention from inside on the
backstretch but began to fade after three furlongs. AKA LIONESS began to fade from between horses before finishing two furlongs, pulled up on the bend
and walked off.

Footnotes
TIZ HOPPIN was encouraged to contest the pace between rivals, moved clear just off the inside leaving the bend, floated out some into the lane then
steadily opened up while kept to urging until the waning yards. HOT DAME vied for the early lead from inside, was outrun into the turn, did not keep up from
just off the inside on the bend, was under steady urging from between horses in the stretch and got up for second nearing the wire. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE
displayed early speed from outside, did not stay with TIZ HOPPIN on the turn and slowly wore down from path four deep stretch. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM
chased from just off the inside, took the rail on the turn, fought for third in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. GO STORMIN GIRL reluctant to load,
chased from outside, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned widest for the stretch run and flattened out for the drive. KITTEN ROCKS trailed from
inside, angled out on the turn and failed to have a stretch bid.

Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO settled between foes early, picked up his pace two wide on the turn, swung out to path six entering the lane, was all out the last furlong and
got up in time. WILD FOX also settled early, advanced along the rail on the bend, waited for room leaving the turn, got through three wide into the stretch,
rallied to gain the lead near the sixteenth marker, was outfinished but clearly second best. BASEBALL POLITICS under stern urging leaving the chute,
contested the pace outside JACK VAN BERG, edged ahead two wide on the bend, battled to hold on in the stretch but did not have enough left the last
eighth. JACK VAN BERG disputed the pace from inside, fought in the lane but flattened out the final furlong. RIDE INTO THE SKY broke alertly but steadily
retreated from outside, closed the gap some three wide on the turn, was forced to swing seven wide for a clear path entering the stretch and failed to have a
significant response. ONE WAY HOME raced in contention three to five wide for five furlongs then flattened out.
