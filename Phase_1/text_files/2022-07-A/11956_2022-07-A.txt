CITY GLITTER showed early speed and pressed the pace to the turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving the quarter pole, extended the lead in upper stretch
and drew clear in the final sixteenth. LADY IN A HURRY rated off of the early pace, gained ground while outside of rivals on the turn, made a four wide rally
into the stretch run, gained ground on the winner in the final stages but could not reel that one in in the end and proved second best. LION'S LAIR chased
the early pace, gained ground along the inside on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally, while holding safely for third. MARY
MARGARET hesitated at the start and was off slowly, recovered to track the pace to the turn, advanced while three deep nearing the quarter pole, lost
ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MISS ARROWHEAD broke through the gate prior to the start, was away alertly leaving the break
and showed good early speed to the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken entering the stretch run and faded in the
final stages.

Footnotes
OYSTER SHOOTER stalked the early pace to the turn, ran evenly through the turn while two wide, gained ground in upper stretch, was engaged by AMBA
and ran on even terms with the runner-up through the final sixteenth and determinedly prevailed in the end. AMBA took back off of the early pace, gained
ground from a four wide path on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while within aim, ran on even terms with the winner through the final sixteenth and was
denied the win while holding safely for second. WICKED SUNSET broke alertly and contested the moderate early pace through the turn, took a narrow lead
into the final furlong, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished, while holding safely for third. PULPIT SINGER stumbled at the start
but recovered well and contested the early pace, continued to duel on the front end through the turn, remained in close contention nearing the furlong
marker but tired in the final stages. MERGIE TROID disputed the early pace to the turn, remained close to the lead along the turn while three deep, was
shuffled back nearing the eighth pole and could not muster a late rally. SPUN AWAY was away a step slowly, was shuffled and took up in the first furlong,
chased the pace through the turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the stretch, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked the needed late
response.

Footnotes
MAXINAMILLION settled four wide off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, overtook
the pacesetter in upper stretch and drew clear in the final furlong. MEGAMEISTER saved ground in the early stages while unhurried, improved position on
the backstretch run, angled out leaving the far turn, found his best stride late and was not able to reel in the winner but held safely for the place. DUB TOWN
stalked the early pace while under a tight hold, lost ground on the second turn and into upper stretch, re-rallied in the final furlong and was outfinished in the
end, while clear of the rest for third. EARNEST was off a step slowly, stalked the early pace, lost position on the backstretch run, came three wide to the
quarter pole while maintaining position, ran evenly to upper stretch and lacked the needed late response. SLEEP OVER broke alertly and was sent to the
early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter pole and was overtaken in upper stretch, stayed on to
mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. DI LAURIAN was prominent into the first turn, lost ground and was shuffled leaving the seven-eighths pole, settled
through the backstretch run, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung widest to be six wide in upper stretch and was unable to make a late impact.
HAKUNUI was forwardly placed in the early going, attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, gained ground in upper stretch to vie for
the lead nearing the eighth pole but could not sustain that run and tired in the final stages.

ZU ZU FLYNN rated off of the early pace, mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took a narrow lead into the final furlong and held the runner-up
at bay to prove best in the late stages. WONDERFULWONDERFUL was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, came under
pressure nearing the quarter pole, battled against that pressure into upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished
in the final stages, while besting the rest. LAST STARFIGHTER chased the early pace, gained ground from along the rail on the turn, was outkicked in
upper stretch and was no match in the end for the top pair but held safely for third. CONNIE'S PROMISE hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly,
chased the moderate pace, came in tight and lacked room along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. P T RANGER broke alertly and
was close to the pace to the turn, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. CLOSED
CIRCUIT was off a bit slow, lacked speed to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker and showed little.

LADY BRETT showed good early speed while contesting the pace to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker while pressed, shook clear in upper
stretch, felt late pressure from MAGICAL LADY but held that one at bay in the end to prevail. MAGICAL LADY was off a bit slowly, improved position on the
turn while three wide, continued that bid in upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and challenged the winner in the late stages but could not get by
that rival in the end and held for second. GETAWAY CHARM broke alertly, chased the quick pace to the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, continued that
rally in the final stages and just missed for second, while well clear of the rest for third. BACALAR stumbled at the start but recovered to contest the early
pace, pressed the quick fractions through the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KERRYGOLD LADY chased
the pace outside of rally and did not offer a late rally. INEXPENSIVE STAR hit the gate and broke in at the start and was off slowly, was void of early speed
to the turn, improved position nearing the eighth pole but was not a late factor. NASHIRA'S FIRE lacked early speed, improved position in upper stretch but
could not muster the needed late response. HILLSDALE NATION chased the quick early pace, came four wide nearing the quarter pole, dropped back in
upper stretch and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
THUNDER OF ZION was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, gained ground outside of rivals on the bend, continued that advance in upper stretch,
found his best stride in the late stages and reeled in the runner-up in the final sixteenth to prevail. VANDENBERG was forwardly placed into the turn, stalked
the solid fractions to the quarter pole, took command in upper stretch, was put to firm urging through the lane and was just reeled in in the final sixteenth by
the winner, while holding safely for second. AMADMADWORLD took back off of the early speed, advanced inside of rivals on the turn, continued that rally in
upper stretch, could not reel in the top pair in the final stages but was up in time for third. JOHNNY DAR showed speed and tracked the solid early pace,
maintained position while close to the pace through the turn, stayed in contention into mid-stretch, yielded in the final furlong and was just edged for third.
ADIOS NICANOR was bumped at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, trailed approaching the quarter marker, swung widest into the drive
and showed good late interest in the stretch run while challenging for the minor awards. PICK BYMY FRIEND chased the pace from the second flight,
gained ground while three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a final bid in the late stages. RODEO JOE was sent leaving the break
and showed good early speed while setting solid fractions, led to the quarter pole, was overtaken in upper stretch, stayed on to the furlong grounds and
faded in the drive. BUEN CHICO was bumped at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, was outrun on the turn and was not a factor.
