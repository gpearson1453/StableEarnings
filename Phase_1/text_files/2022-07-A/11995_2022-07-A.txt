Footnotes
BACKATYA was forwardly placed from the outside to lay up close in the early stages, took command nearing the three sixteenths pole, raced three to four
wide in the drive and was well clear late under steady handling. LAW OF THE LAND chased the early pace from the inside down the backstretch, moved up
along the rail through the upper stretch to challenge but was no match for the winner late. RUNANDHIDE WIND was off a step slow, settled to the back of
the pack early, moved up three wide nearing the quarter pole and moved up in the drive to improve his position. ALWAYS DRINKING was quick to begin to
set the early pace, raced two wide in the stretch run and gave way. BUTTONED UP stumbled at the break, stalked the pace from the outside, took up near
the three eighths pole and weakened in the drive while racing near the inside. MESMERIZED dropped back early on, swung five wide into the upper stretch
and had no response.

COPPOLA was quick to begin to set the early pace along the inside, asked through the upper stretch under steady handling and raced in hand the final
sixteenth while racing well clear. PROUD CIVILIAN chased the early pace down the backstretch, raced three wide in the stretch run and was no match for
the winner. GHOST OF KHOZAN raced off the early pace, was four deep nearing the three sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. BOAT
SONG was away slow, quickly recovered to press Coppola from the rail down the backstretch and weakened through the drive. NAVAL OFFICER was
allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the far turn and had no response. FRONT DANCER was slow early on, saved ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
RIVETING SPIRIT raced five wide near the seven eighths pole, settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, split rivals nearing the
eighth pole while racing three to four wide and finished well to get up strong handling. NO SNIVELING showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced
clear near the eighth pole, dug in late and gave way grudgingly. NANA'S SHOES stalked the pace, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch
and kept on to the wire. PURRAGEOUS DYNA stalked the early pace, moved up through the far turn, took aim near the three sixteenths pole and flattened
out in the final stages. PETTIGO GIRL pressed the pace from the outside and weakened the final eighth while racing off the inside. BEAUTIFUL TIZ settled
off the early pace, swung five wide through the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. NOTION INTERRUPTUS was off slowly, dropped to the back
of the pack early, raced four wide near the quarter pole, angled in through the upper stretch and never threatened. R TENDERONI settled off the early pace,
raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a final bid. MAHKATO stalked the pace from the outside and faded in the drive while
racing three wide.

Footnotes
SPICY MARGARITA was hustled between early to set the early pace and drew off in the final stages to be well clear under strong encouragement. JET
FORCE pressed the early pace while racing three deep and was no match for the winner in the drive. CASTILLEJA settled off the early going, made an
advance through the far turn, raced four to five wide in the drive and had no final winning bid. MOVING IN STEREO settled to the middle of the pack, raced
five to six wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly through the stretch run. ESPERANNNA settled off the early going, saved ground near the quarter
pole through the stretch and lacked a rally. ROMANTIC COMEDY dropped to the back of the pack early on, raced three wide through the far turn and lacked
a bid. LEAH'S LEGACY was away alertly, showed good early foot and was done early.

from the inside early on, experienced traffic near the quarter pole, made a good bid nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished. INITFORTHELOVE settled
off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. OUTRAGEOUS BET was slow early, raced three to two wide in the
stretch run and showed good late interest. PETIT FILS (FR) was unhurried early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. LA

Footnotes
MASTER OF WAR settled off the early duel, moved up through the far turn, was fanned six to seven wide into the upper stretch, finished well late and got
up under strong encouragement. SOCIAL EQUALITY was slow early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled four to five through the upper lane
and finished gamely to the wire. DAVID'S PROSPEC stalked the dueling pair early on, made a quick move down the backstretch to challenge from the
inside and kept on in the stretch run while continuing to race from the inside. GUNHAND dueled early on with Fore On Seven, responded well through the
far turn and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. BABY BULL settled off the early pace, altered out near the three eighths pole and weakened through
the stretch run. FORE ON SEVEN dueled early on and tired readily.
