Footnotes
BURTNJOE got up in time for the score after stalking the pace from a three wide stance and dueling in the homestretch. REVEREND AJ rushed from outset
and led the field into and around the bend, locked into a stretch duel and was nailed at the wire. EUROBOND finished with a rush and was gaining on
leaders at finish after showing reserve early and rallying mid track. HE'S MUNNIE pressed the pace from a two path stance, but failed to sustain the bid in
final furlong. VALID DECISION rated along inside of second flight into and around the bend, but could not muster a rally to end a ground saving trip.

Footnotes
MEAN CANNON showed reserve through the opening turn, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, circled rivals near the quarter pole and drew
off in final furlong for a clear score. INTERACTIF MOMENT rushed form outset and led the field through the opening half while saving ground but could not
fend off the late rally of eventual winner in closing stages. OKLAHOMA LINE finished evenly and held on to the show after stalking the pacesetter from an
inside stance. MAJOR SHIPMAN was unhurried and trailed the field through the opening half then passed tiring foe in final furlong to end a ground saving
trip. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND settled on the heels of pacesetter in the early going, trekked the two path, and tired in closing strides.

Footnotes
TERRIFIC INDY showed early interest in establishing command, exchanged command with two rivals through the bend, was three wide at upper stretch
and proved best of the dueling trio in final furlong. RIGGED RIGHT settled between rivals on the front end, dueled for command from outset, locked into a
three way stretch duel and was outnodded at wire. LONESTAR CHROME rushed from outset to share the lead as the inner most rival of three abreast,
exchanged command throughout, but was outdueled in final sixteenth. BENT TO WIN stumbled leaving at the break, settled alone into second flight and
lacked a rally while giving chase to the dueling trio. TELLURIDE failed to threaten while chasing rivals from a back rated pose. VISUALLY FIT trailed
throughout and failed to factor.

LUCKY KINGBIRD hustled from outset to establish a ground saving position, rated close up through the opening bend, maintained the rail stance around
the closing turn and rallied to draw clear in final furlong. DIXIELAND QUALITY lunged at break and trailed the field through the opening quarter, closed the
gap on rivals along the backstretch, gained command approaching the quarter pole, but was unable to fend off the rallying rival in the homestretch.
BACKSTAGE BUD hustled to share early command from a three wide but was unable to sustain the bid in latter portion of contest. SWAY BACK WHEN
was unhurried from outset, gave chase to pacesetters while travelling wide, and finished evenly. TAKING ENERGY pressed the early pace from between
rivals through the first turn, lost ground to front runner along the backstretch and steadily retreated in closing strides.

ANGEL WHISPER broke alertly, chased the pacesetter while trekking solo in the second flight, was roused inside the quarter pole, and ran down the leader
in final sixteenth. DEVINE CANDY zoomed away from outset and established a wide margin on all rivals at first call but was unable to fend off the late
charging rival and was caught in the final furlong. CAT GOT LUCKY settled along the inside, saved ground through the bend, and finished willingly to
procure the show but was no match for top pair. SQUEAKY BOOTS lacked a rally to end a three path journey. RIVER BLING failed to threaten while giving
chase from a back rated stance. JOAN'S SONG rated mid pack and trekked three wide at upper stretch before weakening in the closing strides. FAT
TUESDAY trailed from outset and was never involved.

furlong. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE hustled away at the start, established a two path pose and shared the pace throughout before being outdueled in final
furlong. THE ONE FOR FUN settled into second flight, gave chase to front running dueling duo and finished well clear of rest for the show. FAVORITE
SISTER was unhurried and trailed the field from outset before passing tiring foe in final sixteenth. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH tired in crucial stages after
giving chase from a back rated stance.

GOSPEL DEWEY showed interest in early command, established a two path position, set the pace in unison, and kicked clear of that rival in closing strides
to secure the score. SILVER POM POM hustled from outset and set the pace in concert with GOSPEL DEWEY, saved ground throughout, but was unable
to match strides with that rival in final furlong. SHAWK'S LIL AVA settled into second flight and chased pacesetting duo from between rivals, locked into a
stretch duel for the show and bested that rival for the honors. VALENTINA LIL was outdueled for the show after travelling widest of all in the second flight
and locking into a heated battle for the show in the final furlong. HUSHED saved ground to no avail. MISS COFFEYVILLE trailed from outset and was never
involved.

settled into the second flight between rivals before fading in the closing stages. OKIE UNION rushed from outset, gained first command and never relished
that command while steadily widening the margin for a gate to wire victory. OUR CORNERSTONE showed reserve around the first turn, improved position
along the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. STEELS ALL IN trekked three wide around the opening bend,

furlong. GODDESS OF WONDER established a ground saving pose shortly after the start, shared command in the early going but proved no match for
winner in the end. SWEET STORMY ELLE broke alertly, trekked the two path around opening bend, shared early command, but was outfinished by top pair
in the end. MISS ALLIE GRACE showed reserve from outset, chased the field through the opening half, then passed a tiring rival in final furlong. ROCKIN
RONI travelled three wide throughout and tired in the end. EUROBOUTTOGETIT walked out of gate and was stopped.
