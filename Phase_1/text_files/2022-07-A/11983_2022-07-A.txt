Footnotes
DULCE VICTORIA got loose briefly before loading, galloped about a sixteenth, broke with the top ones and pressed the pace two wide through the turn,
gained the lead into the lane then drew away through the final sixteenth. D' KITTEN stepped in at the start, set the pace while under pressure into the turn,
continued on near even terms through the turn, lost the lead into the lane then could only chase the winner home while clearly second best. PADDI'S WISH
bumped and was bothered at the start while being forced in, chased the pacesetters through the turn while losing ground to that duo, continued on through
the lane and finished clear for the show spot. JURADICIAL raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the three to the two path and
never was a threat. PRETTY HEART was never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. ADDICTED TO LOVE was slow to gather
and dropped well back before the first call, continued along the rail into the lane and never menaced. MISTY MIDNIGHT chased the pace from the two or
three path through then faded through the lane. EXPLOSIVE SKIES entered the turn from the four path, guided to the two path through the turn and tired
through the lane.

Footnotes
WILLAMINA chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with aim on the leader, inched up on that one through
the lane, shifted into the four path and surged in the final thirty yards to clear late. RACEDAY ATTIRE pressed the pace two wide through mid-turn, gained
the lead and cleared before entering the lane, remained clear when drifting from the three to the five path inside the eighth pole then was no match for the
winner late while clearly second best. WITH CAUSE was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and moved up for the
distant show spot. MEDWAY QUEEN was off a step slow at the start, raced into the turn from the five to the four path, angled closer to the inside entering
the lane then flattened out inside the eighth pole. NOBLES FEELINGS was near the rail through the turn and moved up while not a factor. STRONG
DEMAND chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane and tired. STRONGENOUGHSTORM sprinted to the lead soon after the
start, was overtaken after mid-turn and was done. THE RACE WAS HAND-TIMED TO DUE A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FIRE BABY was close up early then settled along the rail to chase the pace through the turn, angled into the lane to the four or five path, gained momentum
steadily through the lane and drove past the pacesetter late. MO MOVES pressed the pacesetter two wide through mid-turn, took over into the lane, cleared
when straightened, drifted out a couple of paths when roused left-handed, drifted back in a path when urged right-handed late and could not hold sway.
PERFECT PRANK set the early pace while in the two path, could not repel MO MOVES in late turn then continued on while tiring and lasted for the show
spot. BIG MAN ON DECK was steadied along the inside early, chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane and never was a threat.
BAYTOWN JAGGER never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn. VELOCIMO raced in the three path through the turn and tired.
MCMONEY raced in the four to the two path through the turn and was always last.

GUEST SPEAKER was crowded at the start, reserved early, raced in the three or four path through the turn when gaining momentum, swung into the lane
from the four path, caught the leader with minimal effort outside the eighth pole and drew clear while ridden out. FIRST CROWNED set the pace while in the
two path, was clear into the lane, could not go with the winner then stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. RACEY TYPE stalked the pace from the
three path through late turn then weakened after straightening in the lane. ONEMORANDTHECHECK trailed while in the two path through the turn and into
the lane and never was a threat while moving up a couple of positions. FLOYD G was near the rail through the turn and never factored. WHEN IN ROME

Footnotes
SPOKE raced to a short lead before the first call while in the two path, cleared in mid-turn, widened through the turn and into the lane while under minimal
effort, continued to widen through the final eighth while being ridden out. FOLLOW THE MONEY was in the two path through the turn when never far back,
swung into the lane from the five path and moved up while not a threat. NO MAN CAN was in the four to the three path through the turn when near the back,
came into the lane from the three or four path and moved up while not a threat. LEO'S ROAR pressed the pace from the inside early, could not keep up with
the leader,chased that one into the lane and weakened. READY FOR MORE was never a factor while near the rail. CHECKWITHTHEDEVIL chased the
pace from the three path through the turn then faded through the lane. MISTER MACHO raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the six path and tired. THE FINISH TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION. THE QUARTER, HALF AND FIVE-EIGHTHS TIME
AS RECORDED BY TIMER WERE GOOD.

PERTINACIOUS TIZ raced inside early, bid three wide at the half-mile mark, advanced and was clear late under steady urging. ULTIMATE MISSION raced
inside early, bid three wide at the quarter pole and closed late to gain the place. MORNING ANGEL hit the gate, trailed inside, bid in early stretch and was
taken up in tight quarters, then came back early. MADRE DI GRANDEZZA led in the four path around the first turn, moved inside to the two path around the
far turn, dropped in on a rival at the top of the stretch causing that one to take up and causing herself trouble, then yielding late. AUNT RUTH stalked the
pace in the two path, saved ground on the far turn, bid entering the stretch and was taken up losing all chance. TREMILA raced in the four path with no late
bid. LAYLA'S SONG pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. DOGWOODS BECCA stalked the pace between
foes, then faded on the far turn. After a Stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of AUNT RUTH, MADRE DE GRANDEZZA was disqualified and
placed fifth.

POLAR WIND was unrushed early, angled six wide at the quarter pole, rallied and was up in time under steady handling. STOP HAMMERTIME stalked the
pace in the three path, bid on the turn, led late and was caught at the wire. A FEW TOO MANY pressed the pace early three wide, dueled outside of a foe,
had the advantage and then yielded. VIOLENT GIGI led between foes, dueled inside but couldn't hold off foes. ALEBRIJE stalked between foes but had no
late bid. ROLLING FORK stalked the pace inside, moved to the two path on the turn, bid but couldn't gain late. LORD EDDARD STARK was not a factor.
GORMLEYS GOT GAME pressed the pace inside but gave way on the turn.

GUNTON ROE pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid on the far turn, dueled inside through the stretch while the pair drifted out slightly, and lasted
under steady urging. LONGSHANKS stalked the pace three wide, bid at the half-mile mark, dueled outside through the stretch and was outfinished.
MIRACLE ON ICE raced inside, angled four wide at the three-eighths pole, bid but then couldn't close late. JEEPER stalked the pace in the two path, bid
four wide at the three-eighths pole, then faded in the stretch. A LATE ONE was off awkwardly, then raced evenly. SWIRLY hit the gate, then passed tired
foes. OUTBOUND saved ground, then faded in the stretch. MR LIBERTY led inside of a foe, gave way after a half mile and then faded.
