Footnotes
APPLE PICKER shot to the front, showed the way while inside through the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper stretch, was given one light tap of
a down-turned right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and drew off under strong urging.
TRIBAL QUEEN chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved
no match while able to hold the place. MARIA FROM MIAMI brushed with a foe and lost her footing slightly at the start, dropped back under urging, saved
ground around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out inside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. FLY HIGH was
bumped at the start then forced into another rival, checked while pinched back between horses, was urged along on the outside, advanced with a half-mile
to turn, chased in the five path through the turn and tired. MYSTERIOUS STARE broke a bit slow, raced at the rear, saved ground behind a foe from the
nine-sixteenths to the five-sixteenths, shifted to the two path while asked at that juncture, swung out four wide into upper stretch, drifted in around the
sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. RANSOM STYLE broke in and bumped with a foe, was coaxed along in third position, came under stronger
encouragement while joined on the outside by FLY HIGH early on the turn, chased inside that opponent in the four path into the stretch and capitulated.
GRACEFUL was bumped twice at the start then dropped back, raced off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LINNY KATE grew fractious in the gate rearing up to nearly sit in the stall, remained in the stall and had the rider remount prior to the start, settled just off
the inside in pursuit from mid pack, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch
surging to the front near the eighth pole being shown the crop twice to the left side, came under vigorous right reined urging being shown the reins and
tapped with them through to the finish and gamely held on. MISS DELICIOUS tracked the pace along the inside, got set down taking the inside route into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick but was ultimately rebuffed on the wire. VOICE OF SPRING showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, got collared straightened away nearing the eighth pole and fought on inside to the finish to
preserve the show honors on the line. MORE MANGO chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MAYBE LATER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LADY OF THOROTON chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four
wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch and offered no kick.

LIFE IS GOOD broke in at the start under coaxing and quickly established the front just after the break to show the way tipped out four paths off the inside
down the backstretch under pressure from SPEAKER'S CORNER latched on to the outside, continued four wide through the turn lightly coaxed along
holding his main danger at bay, cornered four wide into upper stretch and drew off under a drive to the finish under urging until the final strides, the outcome
in no doubt. SPEAKER'S CORNER broke out at the start under coaxing and pressed LIFE IS GOOD from the outside five paths off the rail, continued five
wide through the turn pressuring outside and coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch under the crop to the right side,
proved no match for the top one while running on to safely secure the place honors. REPO ROCKS chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish unable to reel in the top
pair. HARVARD broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout getting guided outside through the stretch to the
finish when not persevered with through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAPENSIS came out towards the back, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused while moving from two to three wide
early on the far turn, rallied four wide outside the quarter-pole, closed fast to take the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear under a left-handed crop into the
final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop and was given one pop at the sixteenth-pole then powered away under a strong hand-ride in an impressive
debut. RUNNING BEE dropped from the four path to the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the final turn,
hesitated in light traffic from near the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and finished willingly for the
place. SOSUA SUMMER went three wide on the first turn, stalked outside under tight restraint, went around the far turn in the two path, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show.
INTERNAL CAPITAL checked between horses on the first turn, was rated inside down the backstretch, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was given his
cue near the quarter-pole then moved out into upper stretch and came up empty. BREAKWATER was hustled to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside around the far turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. EMBOITE
(IRE) was coaxed from the gate, dropped from five to four wide while taken under a tight hold on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside
under strong restraint, bobbled some near the half-mile pole then came under urging, chased three wide around the far turn and capitulated. CALLOWAY
PEAK settled while saving ground, raced under a tight hold midway down the backstretch, moved off the rail while roused on the far turn, swung five wide
into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
DANGEROUS EDGE forwardly placed four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader from the half mile pole latching on that rival three furlongs
from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole when seizing narrow command and swung four wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive
kept to task. ENDOWED broke a half a beat slow without incident and lost his lane at the start to a rival being lightly and briefly taken in hand conceding
three to four lengths to the front, tipped out six paths off the inside soon after the break and pulled his way to the front poking a head in front six and a half
furlongs from home, cleared rivals and tucked to the two path six furlongs out and held a safe and clear command into the far turn before having his margin
steadily cut into as the aforementioned foe advanced outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. BOLD VICTORY broke out at the start taking over the lane of
ENDOWED, who broke slow, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the
show honors. WRITEITONTHEICE broke in a step at the start, showed the way early on after tussling briefly for command, then got displaced from the front
with six and a half furlongs to run as ENDOWED advanced outside and took over, chased that rival along the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. AIR SHOW chased five then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered four wide into upper stretch, tired.

MAKIN MY MOVE went to the front, showed the way under a strong hold while well out in the course, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the
turn in the two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and held under strong urging. SHE'S A MIA
was well placed just off the pace under a hold, lost position under stout restraint from the nine-sixteenths to the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in the
two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths then gained between foes, shifted four wide nearing the quarter-pole, pursued the winner to the wire and
secured the place. DUFRESNE broke out at the start, was rated off the pace, moved in some around the five-eighths, was asked leaving the backstretch,
chased three wide around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was out-kicked while willingly able to get the show. AUTUMN GLORY was taken in
hand early, bumped with a rival inside the three-quarter pole, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was let out near the five-sixteenths
then roused while shifting two wide outside the quarter-pole, tipped further out into upper stretch and improved position to just miss the show. HAPPY HILL
LIL was well placed on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. LOVE'S MISERY settled on the outside, went three wide around the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. KISS ME SMILE bumped soundly with a rival at the start then dropped back, settled at the rear, was urged two then three wide
around the turn, came out seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. BIG AL'S GAL bumped soundly with a foe at the start, bumped with another rival
inside the three-quarter pole, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused four then five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came
up empty.

CHARGE IT chased along the inside down the backstretch, was nearing the five furlong marker when tipped out three wide to nudge NABOKOV four wide
at that station put to brief coaxing to get an outside path on the leader just prior to that rival tucking inside near the nine-sixteenths, advanced now outside
FLUID SITUATION and took over command three furlongs from home, shook away through the latter portion of the bend and spun just off the inside at the
quarter pole before straightening away in the inside route in upper stretch roused, forged clear under a drive and was kept to vigorous hand urging to the
finish continuing to add to his margin all the way to the end. RUNNINSONOFAGUN stumbled at the start pecking the ground before settling into stride,
chased three wide down the backstretch, altered out to the five path briefly five furlongs from home as NABOKOV got nudged in front, tucked three wide
through the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, improved position for the place honors while
never getting a sniff of the winner and weakened to the finish. FLUID SITUATION established the front just after the start and showed the way lightly coaxed
along in the two path, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go and came under threat to the outside, got displaced from command at the three-eighths,
chased along the inside through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. UNBRIDLED BOMBER
chased along the inside detached at the tail of the field, tipped out four wide into the far turn and came under coaxing half a mile from home, went five wide
at the head of the stretch and made no impact. NO SABE NADA chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a
prolonged drive with seven-sixteenths to go, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. NABOKOV showed brief speed three wide in aim of the
front, got nudged four wide five furlongs from home when CHARGE IT tipped out along his inside at that station, chased three then two wide through the
turn in full retreat, went four wide for home and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
MAIL ORDER showed speed on the outside then was taken under a tight hold, stalked the pace on the outside of the leading duo, went around the turn in
the three path, took the lead while set down into upper stretch, drifted in while moving clear coming to the furlong marker and proved much the best under
strong urging. A LITTLE FAITH hit the inside of the gate at the start, recovered well to contest the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn,
lost touch with the winner under a drive near the furlong marker then moved out inside that marker, kept on determinedly to the wire and just held the place
while no match for the winner. SHE'S THE ONE bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide into
the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SILKY BLUE settled off the pace, was roused
three to four wide on the turn, spun seven wide into upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. NOTA BENE broke out and bumped with a foe,
was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, angled in just inside the furlong marker and was no factor. TUSCAN
QUEEN hit the outside of the gate then dropped back while in tight between horses, raced at the rear, went four wide around the turn and never reached
contention. O'GOTTEN GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired. ANADOR (FR) was bumped at the start, settled under some coaxing, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn, moved closer
in the process, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CRUZ BAY was away alertly, moved in while well placed in fourth position,
drafted inside to the two path around the turn, wheeled out four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch, bobbled approaching
the furlong marker and capitulated.

JERRY THE NIPPER broke out at the start bumping SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY in concert with HOLD THE SALSA, then got clipped behind by that rival
after the start, led early on under a firm hold before settling in hand to vie inside a pair down the backstretch from the two path, tucked inside into the far
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, edged clear under a drive
beginning to drift out near the sixteenth marker and was shown the crop to the right side and shied in awkwardly at that station while safely clear to the
finish. BAY STREET MONEY three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on willingly
to secure the place honors. CELESTIAL CITY chased three wide from near the rear of the field, tucked inside through the far turn and was patiently handled
until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in late for the show honors. THIN WHITE DUKE vied three then two wide
between foes clinging to command most of the way, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded the
front straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY got bumped and pinched back between foes at the start who each
broke his way, then clipped the back of JERRY THE NIPPER bobbling and conceding seven to eight lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
three then two wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, angled out seven to eight wide into upper stretch and offered
up good courage to close belatedly outside to the wire. POET OF LIFE (IRE) four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked to the finish. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, angled out four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HOLD THE
SALSA broke in at the start bumping and pinched back SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY in tandem with JERRY THE NIPPER, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through the far turn, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining and cornered just off the inside for home, then weakened in the stretch.
DEVIL'S OUTLAW three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along just inside the three-eighths marker, swung five wide into upper stretch and came up
empty. KHAFRE vied five then four wide outside a pair down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go,
spun three wide for home in retreat and tired in the stretch.
