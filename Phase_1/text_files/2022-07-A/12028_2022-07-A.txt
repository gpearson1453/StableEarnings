Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY MINDY off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to race closest to the lead pack onto the backstretch, advanced on that trio
and challenged four wide with four furlongs remaining, took over early in the turn, quickly clear and then continued to draw off through the lane under steady
handling. ZEEROCK broke alertly, fell back off the pace, brushed when UNION GRAD leaned in entering the turn then got out to bother and carry out that
same foe soon after, raced three wide into the lane and rallied to be clear for the second spot, no match for the winner. TAP YOUR FRONT with the pace
out of the chute, continued to vie while closest to the inside of the first flight, weakened and fell back off the issue exiting the turn, came back to recapture
the third spot while not a threat to the top pair. SWIFT N' STORMY contested the early pace three wide up the backstretch, continued in the three path while
inside the winner early turn, chased that one into and through upper stretch, faltered late to lose a couple of positions. UNION GRAD lacked early foot
outside, leaned in to brush with ZEEROCK entering the turn, was bothered and carried out by that rival a couple of strides later, remained well wide to come
into the stretch in the five path, lugged in approaching the furlong marker and finished well back. PERFECT PUDDING flashed early foot between rivals for
three furlongs and stopped, trailed home.

Footnotes
GABY'S PROMISE last away, lacked speed for three furlongs, closer upper stretch, split foes just inside the furlong grounds, proved narrowly best in a
determined effort. ENVOYS LEGACY forwardly placed well off the inside into the turn, three to four wide exiting the bend, challenged while widest in
midstretch, dueled to the wire outside the winner, outkicked by that one late while edging clear for the place. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL broke alertly, showed
the way inside, continued to set the pace into the lane, could not keep up with the top two the final furlong, narrowly saved the show. ACHANCETOWIN
pressed the leader early from the outside,moved up to vie by late in the turn, continued on equal terms with the lead pack past the furlong marker, had little
left late to lose a couple of positions. TEXAS MAMA in the second flight inside the winner and along the rail, moved a bit closer past midstretch, lacked clear
room in traffic with a sixteenth remaining, finished up evenly. PER RULING #25047 FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION, GABY'S PROMISE
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED HOPE broke sharp, cleared toward the inside, rated kindly the middle half mile while setting a soft set of fractions, clear into the lane, held the
runner up safe late under steady handling. OAK HILL SOLUTION also away in good order, followed the winner into the first turn, chased that one in the two
path, set down for the drive, crept a bit closer approaching the furlong marker, could not get there, clear for the second spot. ORPHAN CREEK forwardly
placed while racing three wide, continued to be evenly paced into the lane, lacked a winning response to finish up best of the rest. PA PI void of early foot,
came three wide for the drive, displayed some mild interest to improve position, not a serious threat. ANGOLA VACATION in the second flight early while
saving ground, began a gradual fade after a half. PLAY MASTER remained back in lacking a rally. VERDUNVILLE off the pace while racing outside, had
nothing for the drive.

TOTALLY ADDICTED broke back, raced unhurried off the inside, steered out five wide entering the stretch, finished with good energy to win going away,
wrapped up at the wire. BERNIE SPECIAL broke alertly, set or forced the pace for four furlongs along the inside, proved no match for the winner late, dug in
and annexed the place in game fashion. BASEBALL LOVER pressed the issue three wide, held a narrow advantage late in the turn, also proved no match
for the winner, outkicked by the runner up while outside that one at the wire. TOO MUCH CROWN fell back to trail turn, came four wide into the lane,
displayed some belated interest to improve position by passing a couple of tiring rivals, no real threat. MY LITTLE JUNIOR with the pace while between foes
for a half, tired in the drive. BIG RESULTS behind the pace, steered out four wide when moving a bit closer to the first flight exiting the turn, gave way the
final furlong, trailed home.

Footnotes
DORGENOIS broke with the leaders to race never far back, challenged three wide and between rivals midway on the turn, narrowly showed the way into the
stretch, edged clear past the furlong marker, continued to extend that advantage to the wire. TAP IRON FIST lacked early foot inside, continued to save
ground when lagging through the turn, angled out steadily when straightened for home, finished willingly late to be up for the place in the final strides.
DREAMED I AM FAST away well, showed the way into the turn closest to the inside, fell back off of the winner and another rival late in the turn, got back to
race closest to the victress with less than a furlong remaining, nipped for the second spot at the wire. DOLLY'S GUITAR broke back a bit, moved up steadily
outside the winner to challenge with that one midway on the turn, dueled into the lane, flattened out the final furlong to lose a couple of spots late. ONE MO
TO GO last to leave, lacked early foot, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. LA VIE EN ROUGE broke alertly, raced with the early pace then
began to back up before three furlongs. JESSOLOGY broke back, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

FAHAN away in good order, moved out to clear into the first turn, was joined by the runner up from the outside soon after, raced on equal terms with that
one the middle half mile, regained the advantage entering the stretch, clear when straightened for home and increased that advantage to the wire under
steady handling. WILDWOOD Z shifted out and moved up to duel in the first turn, held a narrow advantage up the backstretch, headed late in the final turn
by the other speed, proved no match for that one in the drive, comfortably held the place. GHOST COWBOY fell back to lack speed after an alert break,
continued to trail backstretch, began to move closer far turn, continued to slowly make progress on the runner up through the lane. ZULTAN closest to the
dueling leaders for five furlongs, stopped.

Footnotes
BETISON broke sharp, narrowly showed the way out of the chute from the outside, relinquished that advantage before a quarter, stalked that leader into the
turn, took over into the stretch, steadily drew out under pressure. TUGBOAT moved up along the inside to take command out of the chute, showed the way
up the backstretch, headed by the winner midway on the turn, offered brief resistance to that one upper stretch, maintained daylight on the others the final
furlong. OUR LITTLE GIRL one paced while racing outside, three wide out of the turn, slowly getting to the runner up late while holding sway for the show.
LACIS JEWEL lacked speed, came four wide out of the final turn, displayed some mild late interest, not enough for the show. BEYOND D'ORO within
striking distance early, exited the turn off the inside, had little left in the run to the wire. KAITLYN'S COURT last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TARGET PRACTICE broke running, showed the way into the turn, shrugged off a brief bid late in the turn, clear again when straightened for home,
maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. ETBAUER'S SECRET forwardly placed along the inside, moved closer into the lane,
proved no match late, willingly to be edging clear for the second spot. SPRY CHARLIE within striking distance off the inside, lodged a brief bid outside the
winner turning for home, got out soon after to be five wide into the lane, caught for the place. T D Z HI COURT pressured the winner early from the outside,
gradually weakened before a half. FLASHY PREMO broke back, lacked speed, continued back into the lane, showed some belated through some traffic.
LANE in mid pack early, three wide through the turn and went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. KATS PICK fell back to trail after the start, failed to
rally. JOEY'S LIGHTENING balked a bit a loading, broke slowly, near back, tired through the stretch.
