ANOTHER LULU was bumped at the break, raced off the early pace, moved up four wide through the far turn, made a good outside bid in the stretch run
and got up in his final strides under strong pressure. SUTTON VALLEY was coaxed along down the backstretch while racing four wide, had a narrow
advantage at the eighth pole, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. CHIEF CHARLIE settled to the middle of the pack early on, angled out five wide
near the three sixteenths pole, moved up and improved his position in the drive. GOLDEN AVIEATOR set the early pace, raced off the rail early on, angled
back towards the inside, was headed near the eighth pole and weakened late. BOURBON OVER ICE was coaxed along in the early stages and weakened
the final eighth of a mile. STALKING was unhurried early, raced three to four wide and lacked a rally. RUNNER was bumped at the break, dropped to the
back of the pack early and lacked a bid. SIMPLY VALID pressed the early pace while racing between horses and tired.

JACK A ROSE stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three wide in the stretch run and finished well to get up under strong pressure. ALEXIS S was
hustled along early, worked through traffic near the three sixteenths pole, raced three to four wide and made a good late bid. EDMUND FITZGERALD was
quick to begin to set the early pace, had a clear advantage near the eighth pole and was wore down late. DANCE ON THE MOON was hard sent from the
inside, checked near the three eighths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. TUCKER ROAD dropped back early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole
and made a mild gain through the stretch run. SHARP SENSATION stalked the pace, raced towards the outside in the stretch run and had not enough.
MAGIC MONDAY was forwardly placed to lay up close early, steadied briefly past the three eighths pole, raced four wide through the upper stretch and had
no final winning bid. DON CICCIO was forced in tight at the break, swung five wide into the lane and had no rally. TEMPESTA dropped back early, raced
towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid.

CALL WIL stalked the pace, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, angled four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under
strong handling. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK set the early pace, dug in inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. VALIANT VIRTUE was coaxed along
from the outside early on, raced three wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. JAG dropped towards the back of the pack early on, raced near the
inside at the quarter pole and moved up late while racing four wide. UNCLE REMI was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced near the inside and had
no final winning bid. GREAT GO GO stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the upper stretch and weakened. MR FANTASY raced in
tight early quarters early on, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. NOBLE EL SID was slow early, raced far back and never
threatened. HIS ROYAL G bolted entering the far turn and was pulled up.

Footnotes
TAHAWEEL stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong handling.
CINNAMON DREAM was unhurried early on, made a good advance through the far turn, split foes, bumped Adriana Es Bonita deep stretch, surged and just
missed in a game effort. A stewards ruled was filed to review the stretch run and no action was taken. CHALK HILL settled off the early pace, angled six
wide through the upper stretch and made a good late gain. ADRIANA ES BONITA was forwardly placed early on, took command through the far turn, raced
clear near the eighth pole, weakened and was bumped deep stretch. SHE SO COOL raced off the early pace, was four to five deep through the upper lane
and had not enough. WINNINGFORPLEASURE was unhurried early on, raced along the inside through the far turn, lacked room near the quarter pole and
never threatened. ANAHIYA'S DREAM dropped back early on, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. CELESTIAL DIVA was
bumped at the break, fanned seven wide into the stretch and raced widest through the lane. MISSPOKEN stalked the early pace, raced four deep at the
quarter pole and tired. MAJESTIC'S GIRL was quick to begin to show good early speed and was done early.
