EASTER SNAP tracked the pace while four wide on the back stretch, then rallied on the far turn, gained command at the quarter pole then drew clear in late
stretch under a strong hand drive. OLD SOT was unhurried early, then was gaining ground on the backstretch to menace while five wide on the far turn then
closed belatedly in the stretch. TRULY DANZIG was unhurried early then rallied while four wide on the far turn and was closing well in the end. MORE LIKE
IT chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive on the backstretch then bid mildly on the far turn then came up evenly in the final furlongs.
RESOLVE NOW tracked the pace while four wide, then rallied on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY was unhurried early then
swung six wide on the far turn to bid mildly in the stretch but was no threat. FLEXATI settled along the rail into the far turn then bid on the stretch but was no
threat. JOHN DOUGH was unhurried early then bid while two wide on the far turn, steadied slightly, then continued to bid in the stretch but was no factor.
NOT NECESSARILY set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive on the backstretch, then was bothered by a loose horse then continued to bid on the
far turn, steadied sharply to avoid the same horse then flattened out coming into the stretch. ELUSIVE D'ORO raced while four wide on the backstretch then
faded coming into the far turn and failed to menace. LAB RAT was well placed on the inside on the back stretch, was in a long drive then steadied on the
turn and failed to rally in the stretch. NANAS BOY stumbled at the start and lost the rider.
