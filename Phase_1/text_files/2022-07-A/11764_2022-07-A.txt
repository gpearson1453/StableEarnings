Footnotes
DR. TROUTMAN dueled for outside a rival into the first turn, took over while three then four wide, moved clear on the backstretch, opened up in the three
path on the second turn, put to right-handed urging with a large lead in the lane and continued well clear to win easily. FAMILY BIZ tracked five wide into the
first turn, angled down to three path, continued three wide into the lane, whittle the gap on the winner late and was clearly second best. ENGRAM chased in
the two path early on, angled four wide on the far turn and was along for the show. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) tracked four to five wide on the first turn,
chased outside a rival while in the two path on the second bend and weakened. STUDLY PERFECTION tossed his head just after the start, continued to
fight the rider while prominent early, chased the leader while pulling along on the backstretch before finally settling down, saved ground through the far turn
on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
STAR ENTRY pressed the pace from outside early, took over while dueling in the three path around the turn, fought with FUN COUPONS into deep stretch
and drew clear late. FUN COUPONS took control early, set the pace up the backstretch, lost command while dueling with STAR ENTRY around the turn,
fought back through the lane, faltered late and held the place. FLYING CHARLIE chased widest up the backstretch, took aim four wide through the turn,
continued to give chase within striking distance of the top pair down the lane but lacked the needed late kick. MEDINA MAN broke a step slow, coaxed
along the inside to a forwardly position, saved ground through the turn and never produced a bid. MR. TOUCHE broke a bit slow and got shuffled between
runners leaving the gate, pulled hard up the backstretch then shifted out into the turn, came four wide into the lane, moved out in the lane and could not
rally. DERBY STORM away well and took a forward position off the rail, went two then three wide around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and
lacked further response. CALDER VALE dropped back off the pace, angled inside MR. TOUCHE entering the turn, exited the bend two wide and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
FAMILY TRIPS pressed three deep then outside the leader into the turn, dueled while taking control around the bend, kicked clear past the quarter pole and
held well. GLITTER LAKE broke out and bumped rival, chased inside then moved off the rail, checked between foes entering the turn, moved back inside
and rallied near the fence to gain the place but could not reach the winner. TRUTH PREVAILS tracked the pace from outside, navigated the turn four wide
and gained the show. ALESHA got crowded between while brushing with rival in the beginning, dropped back well off the pace, went three then four wide on
the turn, angled out late and finished well to earn a minor award. ALL leaned back and took a bumped from inside leaving the gate, got put in tight between
foes entering the turn, swung five wide leaving the bend and failed to threaten. VIDALIA pressed the pace from inside early, could not keep up into the turn,
eased off the rail and chased three wide into the stretch and flattened. BLUE BUTTERFLY dueled for command from outside early, put away VIDALIA but
was soon met with another challenger from outside, battled through the turn and into the stretch, fought to the quarter pole and weakened.
THISONESFORBARRY hopped leaving the gate, went two then three wide around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
SMOKIN AMELIA chased three wide, took over past the three-sixteenths pole, moved clear then held gamely over the late challenge from IT'S SAUL
RIGHT. IT'S SAUL RIGHT chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane, bid inside the winner but could not get by.
PAYTRICIA raced up close from outside, dueled and took a short lead around the turn, lost command past the three-sixteenths pole and kept on to save the
show. DANZIGS STAR STORM broke a step slow, tracked between runners then got put in tight early on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked
a late bid. BUBBLES FOR MIA broke slow from inside, went two then three wide around the turn, came out midstretch and never threatened. THE COMRIE
RULE drifted in a bit early while taking control early, dueled on the turn while relinquishing command, stayed on from inside then shied from rivals whip
nearing the eighth pole and gave way. IDA NEEDA DRINK ducked in early and lost the rider, caught by the outrider in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
STRAIGHTEN UP sped clear and crossed over, led a bit off the rail into the stretch and held safely under a tap of left-handed encouragement and strong
handling. CHARBONNEAU raced in range from off the rail, was closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, finished willingly but had to settle for second best.
WORKDAY came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, tracked two wide around the bend and rallied to edge ROYAL HALO for third. ROYAL HALO chased
along the inside into and around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and lost the show. WESTERBERG
suffered a mild shuffle between rivals early, traveled three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond in the lane. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY chased four
wide to the stretch and flattened in the final furlong. MY RANSOM broke slow then lost his path at the start, rounded the turn four then five wide and failed to
menace. RESCUE STORY broke slow and bumped at the start, chased outside a rival into the turn then got bothered when that rival came out a bit at the
seven-sixteenths pole, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the stretch and never threatened. SMOKEM HOWARD got bumped and
forced in leaving the gate, had his path taken entering the turn, angled into the two path around the bend and failed to make an impact. EDDIE'S LAST
reared up in the gate, stumbled and bumped with rival at the start, came out a bit and checked entering the turn, angled out and went between rivals at the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened.
