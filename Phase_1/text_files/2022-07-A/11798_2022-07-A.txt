ITS A WRAP led the way on the first turn and set the early pace, got collared by BIG THORN entering the far turn, dug back in gamely, roused forward to
take back control over the lead leaving the furlong marker and held firm. RARE STRIPE stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid
around the far turn, sustained response into the lane and finished clearly second best. PRINCIPE GUILHERME rated off the top trio in early stages, hustled
up four wide into the lane and got up late for show. DEANOS CAPE was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground on the final turn and lacked a
needed rally. BIG THORN stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch then took over the lead from ITS A WRAP entering the far turn, held clear into upper
stretch then came up empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE BLING dueled for the early lead then shook clear in the turn, came under a drive approaching upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage
and kept to task. IRISH CONTESSA raced off the early pace, hustled along five wide into upper stretch and rallied for place. BREW CASA lacked a clear
path leaving the backstretch and continued in traffic into upper stretch, altered course near the sixteenth pole and improved late. FRUGAL BETTY dueled
for the lead in the opening quarter, remained forwardly placed around the turn then flattened in late stages. BIND ME UP was forwardly placed in opening
stages and chased three wide around the turn, continued in the mix a furlong out then gave way. MAD TABBY was not too far back leaving the backstretch,
saved ground into the lane and failed to move on. THAT'S ALL RIGHT raced near midpack into the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
FEARLESS WILL tracked the top flight in early stages and moved three to four wide around the turn, launched a bid upper stretch, roused forward a furlong
out then kicked clear and finished going away. PARLAY PETE dueled for the lead up the backstretch, shook free around the turn, continued on top a furlong
out then got overtaken. UPPERCLASSMAN dueled outside of PARLAY PETE in early stages, chased the pace around the turn then churned on for a share.
SILVER AND ACES lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and improved position without threatening. PRICE TO PAY raced
off the pace, was ridden two wide on the turn and failed to move on. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP raced in early contention, urged along the rail gaining position
then faded in the final furlong. CATALOGUE was off a step slow at the start, chased the early pace then failed to respond when called upon and faded.

drive, gathered strong momentum under a drive and kicked clear. ITSNOTMYJOB sped to the lead at the start, came under attack from LIL MISS HOT
MESS mid-way around the turn, dueled outside of rival into upper stretch, began to inch away then drifted in under right handed pressure, shook free to a
clear lead then got reeled in late. LIL MISS HOT MESS moved up to engage ITSNOTMYJOB midway around the turn, dueled inside of rival into upper
stretch, got in tight along the rail and steadied past the furlong marker then stayed on and cleared the rest. HOPING FOR A RING raced off the early pace
and two wide around the turn, angled inside a furlong out and gained position. GLORY ROLL raced in range and three to four wide around the turn then
gave way. ORNERY ANGEL chased the early pace, urged three to four wide around the turn and failed to respond. BOURN came four to five wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. RED RED WINE was forwardly placed in early stages, chased around the turn then retreated. THE RIDER OF LIL MISS HOT MESS
