Footnotes
STOWE ANGEL rated close off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a slim disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in
determinedly for the nod inside the sixteenth pole and inched clear under the wire. MOONLIT SHADOW rated a short lead inside, dug in to the challenge of
Stowe Angel approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled gamely through the stretch but gave up the nod
past the sixteenth pole and grudgingly ceded later yards. STAND BY YOU broke a step slow and rounded the opening turn about the four path, stalked
leaving the turn and gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. OCEAN LILLY exchanged contact with
Platinum Frolic leaving the gate and rounded the first turn about the three path, stalked into the backstretch but steadied nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
quickly regained stride, ran near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. PARTY MONSTER saved early ground and showed little
response through the backstretch. PLATINUM FROLIC exchanged contact with Ocean Lilly leaving the gate then saved ground on the opening turn, eased
out into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF WINDSOR settled off the pace and off the rail, rallied to the front approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the rail on the far turn and just
lasted with steady stretch encouragement. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground off the pace, bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in
under steady handling leaving the turn to take second under the wire and just missed the win. ROAD SLEW settled off the pace about the three path, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was outfinished in the duel through the stretch then nipped from second under the wire.
AIR MEDAL raced well off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in
the lane. WINDSOR'S TRACKER rounded the early turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. HILLBILLY ROCK raced
well back. OBANNON drew off to a long early lead but gave way approaching the five sixteenths pole.
