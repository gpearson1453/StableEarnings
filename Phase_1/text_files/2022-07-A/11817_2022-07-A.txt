Footnotes
SPRING SPINNING took a bumped from outside at the start, stalked up the backstretch off the rail, bid inside the trio on the turn while in the two path, took
over leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away. WORTHINESS was off a bit slow to begin, chased on the inside then two wide into the
stretch, rallied for the place but never threatened the winner. SWEET HEIDELBERG drifted out early while vying for command, held a short lead three wide
on the turn, lost command leaving the bend, drifted out further in the stretch and flattened to third. WETHERLY vied between rivals while getting floated out
some early, battled in the four path still between foes on the turn, got crowded when SWEET HEIDELBERG drifted out in the lane, steered to the inside for a
clear path and kept on for a minor award. LOOKIN FOR ROSIE vied outside a pair of rivals to the turn, continued to fight with inside pair while in the five
path around the bend, could not keep up with the winner past the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. AUNT OPAL broke in and bumped rival, trailed two
wide on the turn, angled in at the top of the stretch and failed to make an impact. GALACTIC MELODY brushed the gate in the beginning, tracked five then
four wide around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
IRISH CIRCLES took control early, held a short lead over ROMEO'S GLORY through the turn, got bumped by that rival repeatedly from midstretch to just
pat the eighth pole and held gamely to the wire. ROMEO'S GLORY got bumped between rivals at the start, chased outside the pacesetter then applied
pressure in the three path on the turn, lugged in and bumped IRISH CIRCLES repeatedly in the stretch, stayed on through the final sixteenth but could not
get by. BALLROOM HUSTLER tossed his head leaving the gate but still came away well, stalked three wide around the turn, drifted inward in the lane and
held the show. DARING DANNY stalked outside a rival early on, went four to five wide into the stretch and finished evenly. TEX HANLEY chased the
pacesetter from inside, lost ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SHANGHAI COMMAND broke well but lacked early quickness and
dropped back, trailed two wide around the turn and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN THE WINNER
AND RUNNER-UP IN THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ROMEO'S GLORY LUGGED IN AND INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH
IRISH CIRCLES AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

into the turn, bid inside the top pair in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. I AM NOT UNCERTAIN brushed with outside rival at the start, chased three
deep then bid outside the leader into the turn, traveled three to four wide around the turn, fought to the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong, then
walked into the van under his own power following the race. KOLOMIO got forced in at the start, lost his path and checked past the half-mile pole, checked
again early on the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, could not rally and was not persevered with late. TOP GUN CLASSIC broke slow and
got forced in leaving the gate, went three wide into the turn, exited five wide and was never a factor.

NAP TIME broke well then got displaced by the early leader, chased along the inside leaving the backstretch, drifted out a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole,
continued near the inside into the stretch, bid inside the leaders, reached the front with an eighth of a mile to run and drove clear. SO SOFTLY forwardly
placed in the early going, was closest while taking two then three wide on the turn, bid outside in upper stretch and got outkicked by the winner. ROSES N
GOLD stalked the pace from outside, went three then four wide around the turn, failed to summon the needed late kick in deep stretch but ran on for the
show. NOISEY BURGLAR broke a step slow and inward, rushed to the front and took control, showed the way two wide into the stretch, resisted to
midstretch then lost command with a furlong to run and got edged for the show. CLEARANCE trailed outside a rival into the turn, steered out and exited the
bend five wide, moved out further in the lane and was not a factor. TOPANGA CANYON broke in, chased between and got put in tight entering the turn,
came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. PINK VALENTINA broke in, tracked along the inside into the turn, angled out leaving the bend and lacked
further response.

MAJESTIC WIND broke out and bumped rival then sped clear from inside, met the challenger from outside around the bend, led off the rail into the stretch,
kicked clear, drifted out in the lane and drew away. FINGLAS LAD bumped with inner rival twice at the start, raced in range early off the rail, rounded the
turn three wide, moved out in the lane and rallied to earn the place. FRANKLIN ONE STAR showed early speed then chased the winner to the turn, bid
outside around the bend, drifted into the stretch, lost contact with three-sixteenths remaining, flattened late and lost the place. OLYMPIC LEGEND away
quickest from the gate then suffered a mild shuffle between rivals and dropped back to last, trailed four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. KIMMER got
pinballed leaving the gate, chased the lone leader up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. UNCLE WILBUR stumbled badly leaving
the gate, recovered quickly and went up to forwardly placed outside rivals, went three wide around the turn, four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FINALLY HERE stalked the top pair from outside, went four wide into the turn, entered the stretch five wide, bid five deep in the late and dug in gamely to
edge the runner-up. IT'S MY HOUSE dueled inside a rival in the two path through the turn, led three wide in upper stretch, resisted into the final sixteenth
and was overtaken in the closing moments. COMMANDER KHAI dueled for command from outside, three wide around the turn, four wide upper stretch,
battled through the lane and finished game third. EL DIABLO ROJO was off a bit slow from outside, trailed early on, got boxed in between rivals and behind
a foe at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out in the lane, put in a late bid four deep and finished well between rivals. SAFFA'S DAY raced in range two then
three wide on the turn, angled in and launched a bid from inside in the lane, challenged into deep stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SOLO ANIMO
chased four to five wide around the turn, moved out at the top of the lane and failed to rally.

Footnotes
TEN RINGS broke awkwardly at the start, coaxed two wide around the bend, bid inside the leaders in the lane and edged clear. JUST NAILS dueled for
command from outside early, chased the leader three then four wide on the turn, re-bid from outside with a quarter mile left to run, gained command at the
eighth pole but got overtaken in the final sixteenth. LILYPOP bumped leaving the gate, dueled inside a rival up the backstretch, cleared around the turn,
challenged again at the quarter pole, lost command with a furlong to go and faltered late. LILAC STARLIGHT climbed briefly from kick back, chased three
wide around the turn and improved position. GYPSY LYNN bumped in the beginning, pressed three deep early, chased four then five wide on the turn and
flattened in the drive. STRAWBERRYONTOP broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, raced two wide then a bit off the rail into the stretch and could not
rally. DEMURRA bumped both sides at the start, traveled along the rail then moved to the two path around the turn, steered out in the stretch and failed to
threaten. SUPERCENTS bumped with GYPSY LYNN at the start, went five then four wide on the turn and was not a factor. YADIAMA hopped slight leaving
the gate, chased from along the rail and faded out of contention.
