Footnotes
HIGH DOLLAR DATE led throughout, opened up into the far turn, and was much the best. FEMINISTA tracked while two wide, was ridden in the two path
coming into the stretch, and held place. MEMORIES ETERNAL rated from the two path, was coaxed three wide coming into the stretch, and ran on for
show. PETITE ROUGE rced from off the pace in the two path, made a sweeping move while tipping four wide at the top of the lane, and had mild kick down
the stretch. COME WHAT MAE broke out to bump Crimson Lille, stalked from the rail, cut the corner into the stretch, but flattened. MY LUCKY HEART was
unhurried racing from the rail, was three wide roundign the far turn, drifted into the seven path at the top of the stretch, but improved. COOKIE DUNK DUNK
was well back in the two path, raced in the three path roundoing the far turn, tipped into the four path in upper stretch, but finished evenly. KAREN'S
CATITA raced in mid pack while three wide, was driven from the three path in upper stretch, but was empty. PRINCESS ZURI trailed early while two wide
and was never a threat. CRIMSON LILLE was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but was done early.

BOUND BY DESTINY led throughout from the two path, floated into the four path heading into the stretch, and won easily. GOLDEN NEVE pressed from
inside, was hustled along while saving ground rounding the turn, and held on for place gamely. LUCKY FREEDOM was well back and inside, tipped into the
four path at the top of the stretch, and improved for show. TRUE QUEEN stalked in the two path, was ridden from the three path at the top of the stretch, but
flattened. PEACE FIRE tracked from the four path, was roused from the five path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. TOUGH GAME rated from the
rail, was driven along in the two path around the turn, but was tired. BIZ AS USUAL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THISNAMEISOKAY prompted the pace inside, made a bid two wide rounding the far turn, opened up into the stretch, and held. DOWNTOWN KATIE rated
from inside, was cued between at the top of the lane, and rallied for place. IDES OF MARCH stalked inside, was coaxed from the two path at the top of the
stretch, and held on for show. ZOOMED IN led while two wide, saved ground rounding the far turn, but yielded in late stretch. BAY B raced in mid pack from
the three path, was inside rounding the far turn, but finished evenly. STYLE was well back in the three path, but lacked response in the stretch. SUNDAY
SWAGGER raced in midfield while two wide, was driven between around the far turn, but was empty. FARCICAL trailed into the stretch and was no factor.
CLOSERTOTHEHEART tracked two wide but was done early.
