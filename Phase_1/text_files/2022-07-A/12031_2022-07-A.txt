disputed the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. LOUD N PROUD vied
inside down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn, angled three wide turning for home and churned on to hold the show. JETTIN OUT chased the
pace two wide and lacked a rally. CHILL HAZE was up close four wide for a half then faded. ZANNO failed to menace while racing five wide. NEW YORK

Footnotes
JOURNEYTOTHEMOON settled off the pace along the inside, advanced between foes down the backstretch, steadied nearing the far turn, saved ground
while waiting for room around the far turn, swung three wide nearing the head of the lane, kicked in, moved to front leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead
under a drive. KARENVILLE set the pace in the two path, angled in early on the far turn, led inside to midstretch and fought on inside of foes through the
final eighth to save to the place. SIMONELA was in range while racing two and three wide, bid between foes in midstretch and was outfinished. HARDLY
SOCIAL settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn and finished evenly. JAZZY T trailed inside
for a half, circled five wide around the far turn, drifted wider into the lane and faded. BEAUTY GENIUS tracked the pace three and four wide and lacked a
closing bid. ISLAND MAGIC had early speed three wide and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
MAXIMO set a clear pace in the two path and drew off while ridden out. TIZADUKE stalked the winner three wide, could not match strides with that foe
around the far turn but stayed on to remain clear of the rest. ENSIGN SKIP chased the pace three and four wide, lacked the needed rally and bested the
rest. PHOBIA saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole and never threatened. JUNIPERO SERRA was bumped entering
the first turn, raced three wide between foes around that bend, went two wide around the far turn and was never in contention. CRAFTY KING broke
awkwardly and failed to menace while racing four and five wide. CHRISTENSEN was pulling hard inside of foes through the opening half and had little
response around the far turn. MIAMI PLAYER tended to get out, bumped JUNIPERO SERRA entering the first turn and played no further factor. HIGHLY
UNLIKELY was outrun inside.

RESTOFTHESTORY stalked the pace three wide, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole and inched ahead. DEM A WONDER dueled inside of GITANA
to the sixteenth pole, won that duel but was unable to hold off the winner. GITANA dueled two wide to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished between the
top two finishers. ELUSIVE MOLLY raced off the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. SADE PURSE failed to menace while racing three wide.
KILLARGUE'S GIRL had only brief speed inside. FROSTY BREW was trying very hard to get out throughout, bore out nearing the quarter pole, was pulled
up in midstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS bobbled at the break, pressed the pace between foes in the three path, was under a drive around the turn, put a head in front in upper
stretch then drew off readily through the final furlong. AVANT GLORY set the pace in the two path, yielded to the winner in upper stretch but kept on to be a
clear second. GRAINGER COUNTY stalked the pace four wide, had aim near the quarter pole but lacked a closing bid. JOE DI BAGGIO chase the pace in
the two path and lacked the needed rally. AGARRAMESIPUEDES was outrun inside. TRINNI SUMMER had his head turned at the start, raced in range five
wide and wilted in the lane.

the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and ran on for the place. ASTERS D'ORO vied two wide between foes, could not keep pace with the winner from
the quarter pole and held on for the show. HIGH VIBES dueled inside of a pair and faltered nearing the lane. ROSE'S CAUSE was off slow and outrun while
racing three wide.
