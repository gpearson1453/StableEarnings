Footnotes
TIL THE END was well rated throughout on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn and kicked clear in the final furlong while just being show the riding
crop, ridden out. BEACH TRAFFIC chased the pace three to four wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then went on even terms with the
winner nearing the furlong marker but hung, second best. MY FRIEND FRANK was allowed to settle early, then was on the inside on the far turn, swung out
five wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but needed more. SHADOW BOAT was void of early speed on the inside, angled out in the drive and had a
belated rally. THE TRAIN tracked the pace three to four wide and lacked the needed rally. TOMASCO set a pressured pace on the inside to two wide and
then gave way in the drive. SPIN CYCLE prompted the pace three wide and then was four wide on the turn and weakened. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was
reserved early and had no rally while on the inside. LEAVE 'EM LOADED chased the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
CURLINGTON was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the three sixteenths and drew off in the drive to prove
much the best under a mild drive. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE was rated along the inside, shifted off the inside nearing the quarter pole, came five wide into
the lane and rallied well for the place award, no match for the winner. BERMONDSEY pressed the pace two to three wide, made a three wide bid on the
turn to take over, but weakened in the drive, bested rest. WAR NOVEL prompted the early pace four wide and tired. HELMS DEEP set a pressured pace on
the inside and gave way.

leaving the quarter pole and was five wide into the lane, finished well to be clearly second best. LUSCIOUS LOLA chased the pace and was on the inside
on the turn, then had no rally while getting up for the show award. ECLIPTICALS SARAH pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but
weakened, lost show award late. TAK E LADY chased the pace and was two to three wide on the turn and then was empty. NO EASY ANSWER set a

UNCLE YUDI was off a step slow, then was well rated throughout, eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths, hit the front nearing the
furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. SOUL STORY was off slowly, settled three wide early, made a four wide move on the turn, then
finished willingly to be second best. STREET LAMP was well placed on the inside, then was boxed by the quarter pole, shifted out and then was blocked
by7 the furlong marker, angled in by the sixteenth peg but needed more, bested rest, rough trip. LTL BEAR SALOON pressed the early pace between rivals,
made a two wide bid on the far turn to vie for command and weakened. KHAKI JACK pressed the pace four wide early, made a three wide bid on the turn
and weakened. MIDDLE EARTH was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. THAT'S MY BOI TOY set a pressured pace two wide and then gave
way.
