Footnotes
BREWHOUSE sped clear along the inside in the opening stages, set the pace on a clear margin into the bend, tipped out to the three path racing into upper
stretch, then widened her advantage in the closing stages under hand urging. SUMMER SWINGER broke sharply, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in
second flight racing into the turn, was urged to challenge the leader racing past the quarter mile marker, shifted inside that foe entering the lane and proved
no match while best of the others. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS was roused to contend in the opening stages, then was eased off the pace, shifted outside a rival
nearing the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. SWEET SECRET was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter in tandem with a rival
racing into the bend and gave way into upper stretch. SASSY BANKER settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. THUNDER
ISLAND settled last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LAST MARTINI tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, tipped out three wide racing into the stretch and continued with a steady
late response to wrest command and go clear under firm encouragement. RIVIERA CHAMP attended a rival's pace under light restraint to the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch to gain the advantage midstretch but proved no match for the winner. SHATTERED DREAMS settled last
to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch, then tipped off the rail in the closing stages to improve position between foes to the end.
BEHAVIN MYSELF tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out entering the stretch and continued evenly between foes late. NATURAL
CHILL was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER
tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing into the lane and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
VIOLIN MAKER broke outwards bumping KNIEVEL, was righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, set
the pace to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes leaving the far turn into the lane and gamely held the challenge of several rivals in an all out
drive. GOPHER GOLD was rated between tracking just off the flight racing to the backstretch, continued along the inside on the far turn, tipped out three
wide racing into the stretch and was outkicked while finishing on even terms with a rival for second. KID'S INHERITANCE, in touch attending a rival's pace
in the opening half, pressed the issue outside the winner on the far turn, then between foes racing into upper stretch striking the front momentarily but was
outfinished while sharing the place honors on the wire. TIO BLAS settled last along the inside, swung out on the far turn to race four deep into upper stretch
and continued with an effort to improve position. LIGHT CRUISER, bumped, then squeezed between foes leaving the chute, tracked the leaders three wide
between foes into the lane and finished evenly late. KNIEVEL, bumped at the start, was guided to the inside, then steadied momentarily when clipping heels
leaving the chute, tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch but came up empty racing into the far turn. CLUB MESQUITE came
inwards racing through the chute bumping LIGHT CRUISER, moved to a forward placing tracking just off the leaders three wide to the far turn and gave way
nearing the lane. WILLTOBELUCKY, caught in close between foes leaving the chute, settled between foes and failed to menace thereafter.

TIME HEIST was urged inside a rival prompting the pace in the opening stages, jumped shadows racing past the half mile marker pressing the issue along
the inside racing into the turn, tipped off the inside gaining a narrow advantage racing through upper stretch and edged forward to a clear advantage under
brisk handling. BOLD MINISTER tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing to the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and edged rivals narrowly for
the place honors nearing the wire. SHOTGUN RIDER settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the turn, advanced four wide on the leaders racing
into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. CANNONBALL COMIN broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch into the turn and faded between rivals in late stages. FINDING SILVER tracked off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted three wide nearing the
lane to lodge a brief bid between foes but came up empty midstretch. HATTIES JEWEL, reserved last to the turn, suffered no mishap.

Footnotes
WHISKEY PLANK, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light rating to the backstretch, shifted outside that foe racing into upper stretch, took over
leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. MR. COUGAR tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight to the far turn, tipped
out racing through the stretch and collared a rival on the wire to gain the place honors. HONOR STRIKE sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace
on a clear margin into the second bend, held sway to the furlong marker and gave out once headed by the winner. DELFT BLUE tracked the leaders outside
a rival in second flight to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. MYSTIFIER, reserved inside foes in
the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but offered no rally. WHERE'D THE DAY GO was firmly rated off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch and came up empty nearing the lane. ALL ABLAZE was settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch and
never menaced thereafter. MARQUEE RIDE was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

HONEY PARADE, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward entering the lane and narrowly prevailed under
brisk handling. MISS GLORIOUS angled in sharply in the opening stages to press the pace between foes, then outside the winner into the stretch and
continued willingly contesting the issue to the end while prevailing for the place honors. TAILORBESWIFT, reserved along the inside in the opening quarter,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly inside the leaders to close the gap nearing the wire. C C THE BARTENDER was rated tracking off the
first flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly. BIG ANDY, a bit outpaced in the opening stages, raced five wide
through the backstretch into the turn and never seriously menaced. FLYING BUSINESS switched out in early stages to race four wide between foes from
out of striking distance but offered no rally. SOUTHERN VENTURE flashed brief pace three wide prompting the leaders but gave way racing into the turn.

MAD GRACE angled to the rail crossing over the path of LEATHER AND LACE racing into the first turn to track the pacesetter inside a rival in second flight
to the backstretch, tipped out nearing the far turn to press the issue between rivals, dueled between foes into upper stretch, edged forward late and just held
the late charge of ACCORDING TO ASPEN under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide into the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but produced a solid closing response to just miss collaring the
winner at the wire. HURRICAIN HUNTER, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, gained some position along the inside on the far turn,
was roused to split foes just off the inside midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. Y NOT SIZZLE tracked the leader outside a rival in second flight to
the backstretch, advanced three deep entering the far turn to press the issue to upper stretch but flattened out late. SILVERA was hustled to the lead along
the inside, set the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn into the lane and gave out late. SAILING ALONG, reserved
along the inside, never gained contention. NORTHERN ALLIANCE was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never proved a
factor. LEATHER AND LACE was steadied out of tight quarters along the rail nearing the first turn, was rated off the second flight to the backstretch,
switched outside foes on the far turn, swung out four wide entering the lane while being prompted to advance, took an awkward step midstretch, was
immediately pulled up by her rider, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn,
maintained that margin into upper stretch and shook clear through late stages under firm handling. MILTONTOWN was rated off the first flight while angling
inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, came through inside foes gaining position in upper stretch, tipped outside the winner in late stages
but was always only second best. LONELY PRIVATE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch but
weakened late. JUSTICE WARRIOR vied for command three wide between foes into the turn and gave way midstretch. COTTONCANDYMARTINI tracked
off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch and offered no rally. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY was urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset
into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.
