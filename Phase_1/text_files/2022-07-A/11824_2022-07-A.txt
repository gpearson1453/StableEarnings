Footnotes
DANGER was in a good tracking position soon after the break, sat behind the battling pacesetters through the turn, assumed command at the eighth pole
and held well late to stave off an inside closer. GABBY SQUARED stalked inside mid pack in the early going, finished strongly inside of horses through the
stretch but could not close enough late to collar the winner. VERY SAVVY was roused entering the stretch splitting horses in the five path, was in range of
the winner at the eighth pole but could not offer a strong challenge late. WAR EMPRESS settled outside of horses through the turn, angled out widest
through the stretch for a clear run down the lane and closed belatedly for a minor share. DIVINE GENESIS made a mild run between horses in mid stretch
only to even out in the late stages of the race. BOBBI'S LEGACY battled for the lead on the outside, repelled that early inside challenge through the turn,
then was collared at the eighth pole and faded the final sixteenth. SNOW SQUALL was near the back from the start and never got involved. BORN TO BE
GOOD was slow into stride, trailed and never reached contention. ASHA IRONBORN dueled for the lead on the rail early, gave way at the three eighths
pole and stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL set the pace racing just off the rail, was headed near the furlong marker while steadily drifting out, continued to drift a bit but dug in and
retook the lead seventy yards out. DESTINIQUE stalked the pace from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, was carried out a bit in the stretch putting a
short head in front then was outfinished while clearly second best. SUPER LUNAR came in a bit after the break with moderate urging to gain forward
position, pressed then chased three wide, had no extra and ran on evenly. WICKED MIAH was in just a bit tight after the start, raced mid-pack four wide
through the turn and ran on. ANITA GRIGIO tracked from between rivals in the second flight, went evenly and failed to rally. FIVE DAYS IN MAY raced
toward the rear two to three wide between foes through the turn, came out seven wide and improved. ORBALINE tracked inside the second flight, steadily
weakened. STORMY DERBY DAY raced outside toward the rear going four wide on the turn and failed to menace. SARARENDA was urged at the break
but lacking speed, saved ground on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PHILIP MY DEAR was allowed to settle back in the beginning, saved ground through the turn, waited at the quarter pole, found a seam in the five path
splitting horses mid stretch to pull away late. KAUKOKAIPUU chased the leader, was between runners at the five sixteenth pole battling for the lead, took
command briefly at the eighth pole but could not find the energy to hold off a fast closing rival late. ONE FOR CHAP broke inwards starting, rated inside on
the turn, found room to angle out to the seven path for a clear run at the three sixteenth pole and closed belatedly for show. WICKEDBLACKBULLET broke
outwards at the start, tracked on the rail through the turn, behind horses down the stretch and when he found a seam ran on well with late interest. TREJO
set the early fractions on the rail, gave way inside at the quarter pole and faded through the field in the latter stages. FIGHTING IRISH broke in sharply at
the start, made a middle move around horses on the turn to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, briefly held the leader position mid stretch but backed
away in the final eighth of a mile. C R HOT SHOT was squeezed on the break, trailed and never reached contention. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE stalked
outside mid pack early, roused entering the stretch only to lose his path around the three sixteenth pole causing him to steady briefly, and retreated from
there. J'ADORO was steadied hard at the start and could not recover to contend. BRITISH ARTILLERY was away slow after the break and never factored.

Footnotes
FARAWAY KITTEN set the pace inside facing moderate early, edged clear by the seven-sixteenths, was clear into the stretch and put to urging, drifted out a
bit under left-handed use of the crop but held sway. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) settled outside mid-pack racing three to four wide, gained steadily in the stretch
but was not enough while clearly second best. TOUR OF DUTY was forwardly-positioned between runners into the first turn, eased back at the
six-and-one-half and switched out content to stalk, was within striking distance three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick while preserving show
honors. NASHTRICK tucked in two wide heading into the first turn racing off the leaders, continued two to three wide on the far turn, shifted in once in
mid-stretch and ran on evenly for the minor award. LAPOCHKA raced off the pace two to three wide early, moved out heading up the backstretch, was four
deep and inside a rival entering the far turn brushing that rival and in a bit tight past the three-eighths, ran on with late interest. DESOLATOR angled in three
to four wide early, maintained a wide berth racing well off the leaders up the backstretch, swung six deep into the stretch and improved position. TIMESKIP
saved ground along the rail early, came out a path late on the far turn and again in upper stretch, ran on. NATIVE PRINCE raced outside three to four wide
early, was carried five wide into the far turn and brushed a bit past the three-eighths, failed to rally in the stretch. DUKE OF CARTHANIA settled well back
toward the rear in about the two path, angled out seven deep at the top of the stretch and failed to threaten. ZAP MOTION tracked up close inside, came up
empty. WORKIN OUT was forwardly-placed outside four then three wide through the first turn, moved in a bit heading up the backstretch, dropped back and
faded.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE trailed in the beginning, made a long sustained run circling horses six wide on the final turn to wear down his rival just before the wire.
SHANGASSAH was well back early, made a bold move on the final turn outside passing horses to assume command at the eighth pole and fought on
stubbornly to the wire. FINALIST set the early fractions, was collared at the eighth pole but finished on determinedly to hold for third. MASTER MCGRATH
was tracking between runners, ridden between foes through the final turn, then dropped to the rail to close belatedly just losing the nod for third. ELUSIVE
KNIGHT was between runners throughout, showed some interest late closing willingly the final eighth. JUAN PABLO trailed inside, angled out in the stretch
for a clear run and passed tiring foes. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was four wide on both turns, loomed into contention entering the stretch and stalled late.
COLLECTIVE FORCE waited for room on into the final turn, weaved through traffic and had no finishing kick for the drive. MAMBOINTHEFOREST stalked
mid pack between horses and never gained contention. BOURBON EXTENSION tracked inside, ridden on the second turn and backed away. LAMENT
stalked outside horses, was asked while four wide on the final turn and offered little down the lane. CARMENOOTZ retreated on the rail at the three eighths
pole and was not persevered with through the stretch.

Footnotes
ROSEBUD'S HOPE was urged from the break, moved clear and shifted in to dictate terms near but just off the rail, put to a drive at the top of the stretch
and extended the margin with the rider looking back a few times for challengers and finding none, was then geared down through the final sixteenth.
GUILEFUL settled four wide off the early leaders racing outside, still had a bit to do moving out from three to six wide on the far turn coming seven deep into
upper stretch, drifted in a bit but rallied to get up for place and just held that position from ANN OF CLEVES, who was unhurried early trailing near the
inside, still last turning for home but coming out a bit, moved out eight deep for room nearing the furlong marker and was closing late but missed the place.
DIVA READY settled off the pace inside saving ground, moved out two wide past the quarter pole and three deep in upper stretch, took over second just
past the furlong marker but was outkicked late. GLORIANNIA bumped the outside rival at the start, was in tight heading into the first turn and forced five
deep on that bend, fanned nine wide into upper stretch and ran on. ENGLISH BISCUIT settled off the pace, saved ground through both turns and ran on
evenly. GAL WONDER (GB) was bumped at the break then urged forward into rivals and had to tap on the breaks about the six-and-one half, tucked in to
race two to three wide on the first turn, moved out six deep later on the far turn and failed to produce a bid. BODACIOUS MISS was well-positioned
mid-pack racing two to three wide throughout but failed to threaten in the stretch. CHEERUPSLEEPYJEAN (FR) was bumped into a rival at the start but
recovered to move forward tracking the pacesetter into the first turn against the rider's apparent restraint, settled into stride thereafter near the inside, came
up empty for the drive. GOOGLY EYES stalked two to three wide just off the pace, dropped back and faded. FEDALIA was caught four wide into the first
turn, dropped back moving out from three to five wide on the far turn and tired in the lane.

CHELSEA DAGGER tracked the leader inside, waited on the rail through the turn, angled out turning for home and wore down his rival late. CLASSIC
LEGEND hopped at the break, took over the lead leaving the chute, set the fractions while comfortable up front, and fought on gamely inside through the
stretch to just give up the lead nearing the wire. HE'S GOT SOUL was near the back early, circled horses five wide on the turn, and finished well while
widest in the lane to get up for show. MAGNIFICENT MARIO stalked mid pack while saving ground on the turn, angled out for the stretch run, made a mild
rally entering the lane and ran evenly in the final stages. MIDNIGHT ARKLE was mid pack between runners, ridden on the turn, split horses through the
stretch and finished with some late interest. GASTON was inside of horses mid pack down the backstretch, roused entering the turn and never fired while on
the rail. FACTOTUM chased the early speed and weaken the final eighth. TIZ DESTINY chased outside of horses and stopped entering the stretch. UNDER
SURVEILLANCE trailed and never got involved. COLLABORATIVE was mid pack outside horses on the turn and offer little through the stretch.

DAY TRIPPER was out front early but ceded the lead at the nine-sixteenths content to stalk from outside, went three wide into the turn taking closer order to
press about the seven-sixteenths, took a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, was clear past the quarter pole and kept to the task. JACK settled in the back
half of the field racing three to four wide on the turn, angled from behind rivals at the quarter pole for room, ran on to get up for second and just held from
READY FOR THE LADY, who was in tight at the start then settled well off the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, angled out past the quarter pole,
was gaining but too late for second. JINXED (IRE) was well-placed stalking three to four wide through the turn, lacked the needed late kick. NIKOLAOU
broke outwardly, raced outside four to five wide on the turn, was carried out further in upper stretch and kept on evenly. SOVEREIGN CAUSE tracked inside
just off the leaders, came out a bit turning for home, steadily weakened. AIR FORCE RESERVE was bumped at the start, raced outside a rival two to three
wide on the turn, shifted in about the three-sixteenths and ran on inside. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY raced outside mid-pack going four to five wide on the turn
and failed to rally. ALLEN DIGGS bumped a rival at the start then oved forward to force the pace inside but just off the rail after the opening
three-sixteenths, dueled through part of the turn then came up empty for the drive. GOLDEN BURN saved ground before coming just off the fence, was
never near enough to threaten. PHANTOM JEWEL was outpaced racing three to four wide, lugged in and out a bit in upper stretch and was not persevered
with late.

Footnotes
FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) was well rated on the lead, appeared to be collared entering the stretch then was asked by his rider and responded very well
drawing away convincingly at the end. ROARING FORTIES tracked outside into the turn, rallied between runners to contend turning for home, finished well
through the lane to garner the place award. CASH DIVIDEND was allowed to settle near the back, angled out widest turning for home and ran on willingly to
get up for show. AVOMAN broke in at the break, was near the back early on, angled outside of runners at the eighth pole and was picking up tiring rivals
late to get a minor share. PRIMO TOUCH was mid pack between horses, ran evenly throughout the race and never offered a serious challenge. OLD
CHESTNUT broke outwards at the start, tracked the leader down the backstretch, contended inside turning for home and levelled out final eighth.
CLAYTON chased inside runners throughout and had nothing to offer for the drive through the lane. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed early and never was
in contention throughout. AVIE'S FLATTER circled runners while four wide on the turn, loomed boldly entering the stretch, was near level with the winner at
the three sixteenth pole, then stalled while outside of horses close to the eighth pole and backed through the field in the final sixteenth. LENNY K stalked
inside and retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
CHURCHTOWN settled off the leaders caught four to five wide, advanced while getting bumped past the quarter pole, struck the lead approaching the
furlong marker, soon kicked clear and held sway under steady handling. HENLEY'S JOY bumped the outside rival at the start, settled into stride well off the
leaders angling inside, came out a bit early on the far turn, angled five wide past the quarter pole, took aim on the leader and gained but was too late. A
THREAD OF BLUE tracked two wide early then along the rail for much of the far turn, came out at the furlong marker to advance past a rival and gained
show honors. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) attended the pace inside, took over the lead about the nine-sixteenths and was clear by the three-eighths, lacked the
needed late kick. MR. DIFFLEY settled well back racing near the inside, came out five wide turning for home and ran on. ESKIMINZIN was in tight quarters
entering the first turn and tapped on the brakes racing inside to two wide, continued to track in behind two deep, steadied slightly past the quarter pole,
regained composure and ran on. BODE'S TIPSY lacked early speed racing two to three deep, swung seven wide into upper stretch then shifted in abruptly
about the three-sixteenths, passed tired rivals. TYCOON prompted the pace two wide, gave way in the stretch. BELLA NINA was forced out four wide into
the first turn, raced outside into the far turn going six deep turning for home and was never a threat. MUSICAL RIDE was bumped at the break then
forwardly-placed stalking three wide, brushed with a foe past the quarter pole, was empty for the drive.
