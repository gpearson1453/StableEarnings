moved up outside rivals mid turn, shifted five wide for a clear run past the quarter pole, ranged up to engage the winner in mid stretch, kept on willingly but
was denied. HEIDI T had early speed then was rated back to stalk three wide, edged up to have aim into the lane, challenged between runners near the
three sixteenths, failed to match strides with the top in the final furlong and faded. HUMMIN' THE FUNK lagged early, raced between rivals leaving the far
turn, shifted out some for the drive but lacked a serious response. FLAVA'S DREAM , in range early, dropped back under asking mid turn, angled out in the
drive but failed to threaten. SHE'SRUNNINGHAPPY cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, came two wide for the drive, failed to hold off challenges
and tired through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SWIFT ACTION broke a step slow, quickly recovered and edged up to be within striking distance of the leader, was asked three wide nearing the quarter
pole, seized command nearing mid stretch and eagerly widened while steadily hand ridden to the wire. WINKED showed good early speed and cleared
soon after the start, was pressed from the outside past the five sixteenths, was headed nearing mid stretch but kept on willingly to be best of the rest.
DETERMINED HOPE broke outward at the start, raced three wide into the turn, went five wide nearing the quarter pole and could not sustain a bid. POINT
WELL TAKEN , towards the inside, was under pressure chasing mid turn and weakened.

FEDERAL OFFENSE stumbled leaving the starting gate, gained a short lead outside MR. FIBONACCI on the turn, floated to the three path entering the
stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and drew off. AUSPICIOUS LAD bore out after stumbling at the break, chased
the pace, was four deep turning for home and flattened out. MR. FIBONACCI showed speed inside horses, hugged the inner rail around the turn and faded
in the stretch run. BOURBONONTHEROCKS , wide on the turn, was five deep entering the stretch and lacked the necessary response. I WANT MORE was
not a factor. BUKOVEL showed brief speed along the inner rail. BOUBOLINO , off slowly, was bumped and pinched back soon after the break.

MAGNIFICENT PEARL , patiently handled down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses through the stretch, led near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. NIBBLES stumbled leaving the starting gate, circled foes on the turn, was fanned seven deep in upper stretch, remained on
her left lead and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. RAISE YOUR GAME chased the pace, was fanned to the six path by PLEASE MARRY ME in upper
stretch and gave way the final furlong. PLEASE MARRY ME set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted four wide turning for home and faltered.
PINK DAISY , outrun, was wide around the turn.
