PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, launched her bid four wide
entering the final turn, collared the pacesetter entering the lane, and quickly proved too much while pulling clear late under confident handling. HEART OF
TEXAS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backside, maintained her advantage into the final turn, was collared entering the lane, and while unable to match strides with the winner in the late
stages, battled on gamely to prove second best. DONE THAT away well and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground along
the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and drifted five wide in deep stretch to garner a share. HEREVERYWISH settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to show interest from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. CERTIFIABLE was slow into stride, but raced into a stalking trip entering the
stretch the first time while racing four wide, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to make a late impact.

REMEMBERTHEALAMO away alertly and sprinted to a clear lead from just off the rail entering the turn, maintained a clear advantage into the lane, and
was never seriously threatened while finishing two out from the rail in the drive to prove best. FILLY FATALE broke sharply and chased the leader into the
turn while racing one out from the rail, narrowed the gap leaving the turn, but was unable to seriously threaten the winner late while drifting in behind that
rival in mid stretch. FORCE TO REKN WITH chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail entering the turn, and finished with late
interest from along the inside in the stretch drive to garner a share. INDYETTA got shuffled back in the run to the turn while racing along the inside, chased
from just off the rail through the turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. C C SUNRISE chased the leaders three
wide into the turn while devoid of the early speed to contend, angled towards the rail midway through the turn, but had little to offer late while finishing from
along the rail.

TRAPALIS unhurried early while taken in hand and allowed to settle at the back of the field while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first
time, continued to bid his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched a strong three wide bid entering the final turn, inhaled the
pacesetter leaving the turn to take a clear advantage into the lane, and drew off under confident handling in the drive. SHOWMAN away alertly and raced to
the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of CATTITUDE while racing out from the rail through the second
turn and in the run down the backside, led into the final turn, but was no match when tackled by TRAPALIS leaving the turn, but battled willingly through the
lane to hold the place. CATTITUDE steadied when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the first turn, tipped three wide through the first turn and forced
the issue from the outside of SHOWMAN through the stretch the first time, continued to press that rival in the run down the backstretch while racing three
wide, struggled to match strides with that rival through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. LUNAR NEW YEAR
settled well off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to advance three wide entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EH TEE EM broke sharply and stalked the
leader into the first turn while putting CATTITUDE in tight quarters entering the turn, maintained a stalking trip through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail, struggled to hold his position in the run down the backstretch, and had nothing left to offer over the final furlong.

SOUTHERN LASS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backside while racing just out from the rail, continued to control the pace into the final turn, turned back a bid from HARBOUR STORM leaving the
turn, and was never seriously threatened late. HARBOUR STORM away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from
the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn to loom a threat leaving the turn, but was no match for
the winner late, while finishing three wide in the drive. SILVER ARROW hopped at the start to get away a step slow, trailed the field into the stretch the first
time while saving ground at the rail, began to advance three wide midway down the backstretch, continued two out from the rail into the final turn, and
finished with late interest two wode in the drive to garner a share. SAVER THE KISS broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time
while saving ground along the inside, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn while continuing to save ground, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SUNBURNT stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail,
struggled to maintain her position while racing four wide into the backside, began to lose touch with the field in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to
offer over the final furlong.

Footnotes
FINDING WAYS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail through the lane the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival entering the lane and quickly drew clear as much the best. BAKLANE stalked the
leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, split rivals soon after entering the backstretch to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, was no match for his pace rival entering the lane, and finished five wide in the drive while all out to hold the place.
ERLICH settled well off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the
final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive to just miss the place. YOUNG VIGILANTE settled off the leaders into the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the late stages. A TREE OF LIFE away alertly and
dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with the
top pair in the run to the final turn while dropping to the rail, and faded over the final furlong. DON WITH THE WIND unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

THE ALL BUTTON away well and stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly from
along the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and
vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of LITTLE GROOT in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, and just failed to last in a game effort. SANAWAR lagged well off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run three wide in deep stretch to get up for a share. LAUGH WITH ME
lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best
stride late while finishing seven wide in the drive. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn while looming a threat, but failed to sustain that bid in the drive. WE'RE IN COMMAND lagged
well off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, was carried out entering the lane, and finished
five wide in the stretch drive. LITTLE GROOT broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of BILLS SMOKN BULLET entering the first turn,
continued to force the issue from the outside of that foe in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival
entering the lane, and faded in the stretch drive. BLUEGRASS ANGUS stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide through the final turn, but came up empty in the lane. Following the running of this race there was a trainer's claim of foul. The trainer of
WE'RE IN COMMAND lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LAUGH WITH ME, for alleged interference entering the first turn. After review the claim of
foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

JACOBS CALL raced up to assume command one out from the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn while racing two wide,
opened a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch while well in hand, maintained that lead through the final turn, and was never threatened late
while under wraps late. GUNS N AMMO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, began to advance while racing three out from the rail in the run down
the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. STAY ALL NIGHT away well and
tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly to
garner a share. ACCEPT NO OTHER away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. NORTHERN KID settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the lane the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. ATOMIC HAZE
broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
