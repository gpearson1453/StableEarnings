Footnotes
KING RAMOS tracked close up on the inside, angled out midway on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of TURNPIKE BOB, took over in upper
stretch and drew clear under urging. TURNPIKE BOB set a pressured pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, dueled with the winner turning for
home, was no match for that rival and well clear for the place spot. AMERICAN FORCES raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, rallied
mildly outside and got up late for third. LORD MIO raced three wide early, then pressed the pace racing two wide, chased on the far turn, weakened and lost
third. CANDY KINGDOM was outrun early and passed tired rivals. MYSTERY MO stumbled at the start, stalked close up two wide, chased three wide at the
quarter pole and faded. BELLAMY DOLCE raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
KITTEN WITH A WHIP steadied going into the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, made a rail bid on the far turn, led into the stretch, moved clear under
confident handling and held well under hand urging. STRONG GEM steadied in tight entering the first turn, settled off the pace, moved up three wide on the
far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, dug in gamely in deep stretch but needed more. ISLA BONITA raced off the pace, moved up three
wide on the backside, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled and weakened. MUSETTA raced three wide off the pace, two wide on the far turn, came three
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SEEDS OF TIME set the pace, opened up leaving the clubhouse turn, dueled between rivals on the far turn and faded.
NOT A TRACE had an inside trip and faded. SIP'N DIP was in tight quarters nearing the first turn, then hit the rail, stumbled badly and fell, vanned off. After
a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.

FRIENDLY FELLA set a pressured pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, responded when asked, drew off, widened while being ridden out and
coasted the final yards. UNCLE NED raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside and dug in late to earn
the place spot. RELISHMENT raced off the pace inside, rallied inside in the stretch run and was outkicked for second. BLOOD MOON dueled two wide for
the lead, chased the winner on the far turn and weakened. CANDY CANE LANE raced off the pace inside, went three wide on the far turn and had no rally.
TAPSOLUTE raced off the pace between rivals, chased between foes on the far turn and faded. GO POKE THE BEAR raced off the rail, off the pace and
did not factor.

R GIRL FAITH stalked three wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, took over, kicked clear in upper stretch and held on well under urging. LOVE
UNLIMITED tracked close up on the rail, was in a bit tight, waited for room at the five sixteenths marker, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied, finished well
but second best. GRACE IN MOTION raced off the pace with an inside trip, moved up on the far turn, swung wide at the quarter pole and closed mildly.
TIME GOES FAST trailed the field, raced two wide on the backside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. NO MO DANCING stalked two wide,
chased and faded. TRACKER JACKER set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled on the far turn and gave way. POP POP'S BABY BOO was off
slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace and dropped back on the far turn.
