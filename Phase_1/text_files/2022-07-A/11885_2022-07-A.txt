Footnotes
POWER ATTACK broke fast while hustled, showed the way while inside around the turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch then extended
advantage while put to a strong hand ride, was given one tap of a down-turned crop inside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage while
flagged with the crop to the final strides. NEW YORK PANTHER moved out while settling off the pace, was roused inside early on the turn, shifted three
wide outside the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. CAPTAIN PARTY was coaxed along off the pace,
went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out around the furlong marker and improved position to garner the
show. M. C. DOUBLE R hit the outside of the gate at the start then was hustled, showed speed behind the winner then moved out leaving the backstretch,
chased in the two path around the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and weakened then lost the show. MAKAR 'was urged along on the outside,
dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. TWIRLING CHARLIE was reluctant to load, hesitated at the start
and broke towards the rear, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out around the furlong marker and failed to threaten.
WHO ME broke a bit slow as the field left the gate staggered, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging, went three wide around the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. JACKSON HEIGHTS dropped back while slow into stride, saved ground around the turn and was no
factor. SEA CRUISE was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, went three wide on the turn and never reached contention. ENGLISH STORM
was urged along on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, continued to retreat in the three then two path around the turn, came out some into
the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CHANNEL MAKER established the front and showed the way rated on the pace just off the inside early on until tucked inside nearing the first turn, rode the
rail through that bend and down the backstretch through sensible splits under close watch from HIGHEST HONORS to the outside but facing no pressure
until midway on the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, took the inside route into upper stretch and bumped with HIGHEST
HONORS straightened away, then brushed with that foe just outside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside
gamely to take back the front near the sixteenth marker and steadily inched away late to prevail on the wire. SOLDIER RISING (GB) tracked the front just off
the inside until tipped three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take
command a furlong from home, got headed near the sixteenth marker and was out-gamed to the finish while safe for the place honors. HIGHEST HONORS
attended the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch getting on
near even terms and was bumped by that rival, traded a brush nearing the eighth pole and ran on to procure the show honors. BRITISH ROYALTY tracked
the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ADMISSION
OFFICE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch,
offered up a bid but made no headway and trailed.

Footnotes
WINIT was hustled to the front after breaking towards the rear, showed the way while inside to the two path around the turn, responded well when asked
coming to the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, drifted out under a hand-ride around the sixteenth-pole then was
straightened by the rider, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter then drifted out again coming to the wire while much the best. SIDEKICK came
away in good order, showed early speed then was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path around the turn, cut the corner while put to the
crop into the stretch, kept on well in pursuit of the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the place. MAKING IT tracked the pace on the outside then in
the three path around the turn, was asked late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the
show. GASOLINE pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, was asked in the two to three path around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came
up empty. OUTPERFORM was bumped soundly at the start, dropped back under some urging then settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside to
the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. CLOUD FOREST was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside, took an awkward stride inside the
three-quarter pole then had the rider take a peek behind to the inside before the five-eighths, went two to three wide around the turn and was no factor.
SECRET CARGO broke in and bumped soundly with an opponent, settled towards the rear, was ridden along three wide around the turn then driven four
wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
U SHOULD B DANCING four paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from near the rear of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out to swing seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to take command a sixteenth from home, then edged
away to the finish to score. MANDY GREEN chased just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got set down angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CANDY MONET five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. STUCK ON
KITTEN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish.
FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS forwardly placed from the start, got clipped behind by THISMIGHTBETHEONE five and a half furlongs from home while pressing
the pace of UNLOCK to the outside in the two path, went two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over
command at that station and went three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth from home and weakened in the late
stages. BUSTIN BULLET broke in at the start bumping MISSING LINK, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late going. TEMPERMENTAL crossed to the inside soon after the start and chased along
the rail coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped three wide for home and improved position offering up a mild kick. THISMIGHTBETHEONE
coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed and clipped the back of FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS with five and a half furlongs to run bobbling and conceding
two lengths of ground, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
MISSING LINK got bumped at the start by BUSTIN BULLET, who broke inwards, showed brief speed three wide down the backstretch before fading, tucked
to the two path through the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and weakened. UNLOCK hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along the
inside under pressure from FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS to the outside, got headed for the front at the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then
tired in the drive. PREDETERMINED chased three then two wide from the tail of the field, lost her action near the seven-sixteenths short striding into the
turn, was not persevered with through the bend and went six wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
WHO HOO THATS ME settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, moved out while gaining in upper stretch, rallied to the lead at the furlong
marker and drew away under steady urging. COLORMEPAZZI disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, shook clear in the two path midway through the
turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final furlong and proved no match but showed good courage to hold the
place. UNIQUE UNIONS chased the pace, went three wide around the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, battled between foes into the final furlong
and weakened but was clear for the show. WIN FOR GOLD was bumped hard at the start and off a bit slow, raced on the outside under some urging, went
five wide around the turn, chased outside into the final furlong and capitulated.. WHITTINGTON PARK bumped hard with a rival at the start then was
hustled, raced towards the back under urging, went two to three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch then tipped further out and failed to
rally. MAJOR SPIN broke in and bumped hard with a foe, was coxed along just off the pace, chased two then three wide around the turn and came up
empty. AGILITY bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken in hand, raced at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path
around the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and was no factor. GOLQUIST lost his footing at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, dropped
back four wide around the turn and faltered. FENWAY broke out and bumped hard with an opponent then was corrected by the rider, came out in front
despite the contact, disputed the pace on the inside of the runner-up while along the rail, dropped back with three furlongs to run and stopped.

Footnotes
MOON HUNTER tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, gained to make a bid between horses in upper stretch, took
the lead outside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. MARTINEZ was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, gained
to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. BOINTHEBACK was
reserved off the pace, moved in inside the five-eighths, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, paused
ever so briefly when a foe came out in front inside the three-sixteenths, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the show. CHAPEL
ROAD bumped with foes at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch, chased to
the wire and finished willingly to just miss the show. MAJESTIC JOHNSON was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three
then four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and gained but missed the superfecta. BRENNAN'S WAR was bumped in the hindquarters at
the break, pressed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back off the pace leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a bid along the
rail under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back coming to the sixteenth-pole and weakened. SLUGO settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch and improved position. CROCK OF GOLD was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out while put
to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. UNLIKELY was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, had the rider fall back in the saddle and was
taken up some early, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SOUTHERN CIVILITY was
bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, raced at the rear, saved ground around the turn and was no factor. LUCA AT THE SPA settled on the
far outside, moved in to race in the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. N Y ANTHEM was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the
outside, inched away with a half-mile to run, went around the turn in the two path, was asked for his best into upper stretch then lost the advantage and
gave way.
