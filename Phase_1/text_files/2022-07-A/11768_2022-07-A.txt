MYBLUEBELL (FR) bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, was set down
for the drive and held for the win over the oncoming runner-up. STATEFOREST stumbled leaving the break and was off slowly, was allowed to settle while
not far off of the pace, gained ground on the second turn, closed on the winner along the rail in the stretch run, could not quite reel in MYBLUEBELL and
missed for the win, while besting the rest. BLUSHING BAY stalked the pace outside of rivals, gained ground while four wide on the second turn, continued
that bid into upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding safely for third. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) was forwardly placed into the first turn,
stalked the modest pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

SHOULD BE ILLEGAL tracked the early pace from the inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, confronted STANFORD BAY in upper stretch,
dueled with that foe to the sixteenth-marker and wore that one down in the final stages to prevail. STANFORD BAY broke alertly and showed good early
speed to the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds, met that bid and dueled with SHOULD BE ILLEGAL into the final sixteenth but
could not hold that one off and was outfinished, while besting the rest. STRUT TO THE WIRE was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the
pace from outside of rivals on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive, while holding safely for third. GOOD BYE PUTIN was off
slowly and was slow into early stride, swung widest to be six wide in upper stretch, was unable to reel in the top three but was gaining in the final sixteenth.
EDINBURGH EXPRESS was asked to show early speed and pressed the quick pace, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. PROOF OF
REALITY chased the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC SECRET was sent after an alert beginning, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run while well handled, was confronted in upper
stretch by SUMMER APPARITION, repelled that bid and held in a drive in the end to prevail. MALIBU JEWEL tracked the pace from a ground saving trip,
made a steady advanced in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final stages but kept on to secure the place. SUMMER APPARITION was hustled leaving
the break and attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, advanced in upper stretch to confront FANTASTIC SECRET, was turned away in
that effort and gave way in the final stages. SASSY EINSTEIN settled off of the early pace, trailed through the backstretch run, went three wide nearing the
quarter marker and was able to offer a mild late rally but was not a threat. BRITE TAN was off a bit slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run,
improved position on the far turn but could not go on with that run and was not a factor. FIRE DIAMONDS came four wide along the first turn while settling
off of the pace, lost ground on the second turn and stopped in the stretch run.

CHUCKANUT BAY was in tight soon after the break, gained ground on the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, closed in the final furlong and
reeled in STRENGTH OF AUTISM in the final sixteenth to prevail. STRENGTH OF AUTISM showed early speed and contested the pace with
GALLIVANTER through the turn, was able to take a narrow lead from that rival in mid-stretch and was caught nearing the sixteenth-marker by the winner,
while besting the rest. SMOKIN' HOT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace from a rail path through the turn, ran evenly to the
stretch run and was outkicked in the final stages, while holding safely for third. HAPPY DOES was away slowly and lacked early speed, came three then
four wide nearing the top of the lane and was able to offer a mild late bid but could not summon the needed late response. MONEY MUNCHER was in tight
soon after the break and was shuffled back nearing the half-mile marker, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch
and was not a threat. GALLIVANTER was hustled to show early speed and contested the early pace with STRENGTH OF AUTISM, dueled with that rival
through the turn, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
ROYAL 'N RANDO stalked the early pace, came three wide along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused along the far
turn and slipped to the inside nearing the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and was ridden out in the end as much the best. NUESTRO
ENGREIDO was sent to show early speed to the first turn, took a narrow lead into the backstretch run then vied with WALKING BOSS leaving the half-mile
marker, was shuffled back a bit between foes nearing the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on to be be best of the second
flight. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was hustled to be close to the early pace, advanced from a three wide path on the far turn and vied for the lead nearing the
quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages, while holding safely for third. CRAZY DREAMS broke
in a tangle and was off slowly, recovered to be not far back in the early stages, was a bit rank on the first turn, improved position while four wide on the
second turn and tired in the drive. WALKING BOSS tracked the early pace, made a middle move to vie for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun
on the far turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
FAR WEST was hustled to the early lead, set modest fractions while prompted by FRIDAY'S AT SHADY through the backstretch run, was headed by that
rival along the second turn, dueled through the lane and determinedly dug in for a game victory. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY kept close attendance to the early
pace, advanced on the second turn and headed FAR WEST nearing the quarter marker, dueled with the winner through the drive, drifted in late under
right-handed urging and could not get by the determined winner and was second best. DR. HOFFMAN was crowded a bit at the start an was away slowly,
was unhurried through the half-mile marker, improved position while along the rail on the second turn, was no match for the top pair in the final stages but
kept on to get the nod for third. SUNNY SPOT stalked the early pace from a four wide path, lost ground along the backstretch run, came three wide nearing
the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and was just edged for third in the end. NILES CHANNEL stumbled at the start, recovered in the early
stages and settled off of the pace, lost ground along the backstretch run, ran evenly through the second turn and into upper stretch and could not muster a
late response. BABY FRANKIE raced off of the early pace while saving ground, lost ground nearing the half-mile marker, stopped along the second turn,
was eased through the stretch run and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled through the opening stages, was steered to go two then four wide nearing the quarter
marker, was roused to mount a five wide rally at the head of the stretch, closed with a rush in the final furlong and drew clear inside of the sixteenth marker.
ITALIANO chased the quick pace from midpack, gained ground while five wide on the turn, continued that advance in upper stretch and vied for the lead
approaching the eighth pole, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages and just held for second. ANMER HALL was in tight in the early going while
chasing the pace, came two wide between foes along the turn, came within aim in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and just missed for second at
the end. HANDSOME GARY was shuffled at the start, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while six wide nearing the quarter pole, was not able to
summon the needed response in the drive but was able to make up some ground on the leaders in the end. QUANTUM QUEST was hustled leaving the
break and set quick fractions while on a clear lead through the turn, was tiring in upper stretch, was caught just inside of the eighth pole and gave way in the
final stages. IRREFUTABLE chased the quick pace, lost ground on the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run. HONEYMOONZ OVER
stumbled at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. PROOF HE RIDES was forwardly placed in the early stages,
lost ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was well placed early on while chasing the moderate pace, gained ground along the rail on the turn, tipped out at the top of the lane,
closed on MIRACLE OF HOPE in the drive, overtook the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final stages. MIRACLE OF HOPE
was asked for speed leaving the break and sped to the early lead, carved out moderate fractions through the turn, came under pressure inside of the eighth
pole, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth marker and was second best in the end. SEENEVA THE CAT stumbled at the start and lacked early speed,
improved position on the turn, continued that rally in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair in the final stages but held safely in the end for the show.
JAYCEE broke alertly and stalked the moderate pace through the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. BIG FAME stumbled
at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from a three wide path through the turn and was not a threat. DEAREST BARBARA away well,
tracked the leaders to the halfway marker, was hard-ridden to keep up from there and was unable to sustain a bid. DADDY'SFAVORITESON broke with the
field, was mid-pack after a quarter-mile but began to back up after that. SILVER AFFAIR broke in and brushed the gate, was running erratically early, settled
in the two path on the turn and was always outrun.
