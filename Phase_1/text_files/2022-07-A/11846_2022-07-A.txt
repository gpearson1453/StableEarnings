Footnotes
DEL MAR SUMMER was away in good order to duel for the lead with HUNTINGTONS RITHM and PATRIOT while racing four-wide, vied with that pair into
deep stretch and drew off through the closing yards. HUNTINGTONS RITHM disputed the pace with the winner and PATRIOT while racing removed just off
the rail, vied into the closing yards and gave way to the winner. PATRIOT broke sharply to vie for the lead from between foes and gave way through the final
sixteenth. SUNSCREEN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. GUARDING ELK CAMP showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and did not reach contention.
