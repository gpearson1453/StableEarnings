Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE set the pace while in the two path through the turn and under pressure to mid-turn, shook clear in late turn, widened into the lane then
drew off while being kept to the task. MR MANNING pressed the winner two wide through mid-turn while in the three path, was asked for more into the lane
when in the three or four path, was no match for the top one but stayed on to be clear for the place spot. RESTORING HOPE was in the three path through
the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the four path and moved up while not a serious threat. IDEA MAN was in the two path through the turn
when well back, continued in the two path through the turn and improved position. SILVER MOON ROAD went to his nose at the start, regathered, was
hustled up to contend through the turn then tired after straightening in the lane. KITTENS ADAIR was in the two path through the turn and steadily faded.
CRIME SPREE chased the pace along the inside through the turn and was done turning into the lane.

GRAND HIDEAWAY chased the two rival duel through the turn while along the inside, was guided to the three path entering the lane, caught the leaders
approaching the sixteenth pole and drove past. DRAGON DREW dueled with another from the outset, continued to duel for the lead inside the eighth pole
then passed by the winner then kept on well to just get up for the place spot. SHACKLEFORDS STORM dueled for the lead along the inside from before the
first call, maintained a short lead with an eighth to go then could not save the place spot. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT raced two wide and on the outside of the
winner, swung into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing kick. HIGHEST PRAISE hit the gate at the start while breaking outward, trailed into the
turn and never mounted a rally.

others through the turn, could not go with the top two but stayed on to finish clear for the show spot. C R'S GIRL vied for the lead two wide and between
rivals into mid-turn, chased the pace into the lane then tired. CALYPSO STREET trailed the field while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the six path and moved up a couple while never a menace. RAP STAR never a factor while in the three path through the turn. HEAVENLY SCENT vied
for the early while three wide and between rivals and was empty in late turn.

Footnotes
MINE OWN STAR chased the pace from the three path, moved into the turn from the four path, engaged the leaders after mid-turn while four wide,
continued four wide after straightening in the lane then edged up and held. COUNTER OFFER trailed for half while off the inside, moved into the three path
into the turn with momentum, continued with good energy inside the sixteenth pole, split rivals late and missed. EVIL EYE stalked the pace while in the three
path, bid into the lane from the two path, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then was outfinished by the top two. FIREWATER JAKE chased the pace
from the two path into the lane, bid three wide and between rivals outside the eighth pole, was on near even terms with an eighth to go then yielded to the
top ones. JAMMERS JUSTICE set the pace along the inside from the outset, continued with a short lead into the lane then faltered. PURPLE SHIRT was off
awkwardly stepping in and bobbling, raced in the three or four path through the turns and never factored. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER saved ground
throughout to no avail.

Footnotes
MACHO JUSTICE set the pace from the two path through the turn, was clear entering the lane, inched further away with an eighth to go then continued to
widen when being kept interested. PHILIP SNOW raced in the five to the four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five
path, moved up to be a threat with an eighth to go, could not stay with the top one but stayed on well to be up for the place spot. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE
raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane, continued on with good interest inside the eighth pole then split rivals late for the show spot.
JENNY'S BEIGNET chased the pace from the three path through the turn, swung into the lane three wide, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then
weakened late. REITERATION saved ground throughout and weakened inside the eighth pole. NORTONS was in the two path through the turn and and
never was a factor. STANDOUTJUSTICE never made an impact while trailing in the two path through the turn. PORKYISMYNAME raced in the five path
through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was in it. INEEDRELIEF saved ground into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
STYLISH WHISPA (GB) was unrushed in the three path, angled six wide at the quarter pole and rallied strongly to be there in time under steady urging.
FRENCH CUFFS dueled inside, was clear in the stretch but couldn't hold off the winner while saving the place. HIGH STICK stalked the pace in the four
path, bid late and missed. QUALITY STAR was unrushed early and rallied belatedly between foes. MISSONI bid on the turn, was steadied at the quarter
pole and lost momentum. PORONUI improved position late. LOTTA ROSES saved ground and faded in the stretch. KIVALINA stalked in the three path
before fading in the stretch. COLD CALL dueled outside of a foe, gave way on the far turn, then faded in the stretch. MRS. K was through early.
