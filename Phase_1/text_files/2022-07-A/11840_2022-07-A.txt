PI YO PRINCESS set all the pace from the inside and drew off in the stretch. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA was in the five path before the first turn, able to
drop in before entering the first turn to save ground while racing in the middle of the pack, made a mild rail bid mid turn, angled out slightly in upper stretch
but was no match for the winner. MADAM PIE was position off the pace in the three path around the first turn and down the backstretch but was empty late.
STORMY SUNRISE floated out slightly after the break, was unhurried to the final turn made a rail bid but finished evenly. MISS CHECKMARK tracked the
leaders from the two path around the first turn dropped back in the backstretch and was through early.
