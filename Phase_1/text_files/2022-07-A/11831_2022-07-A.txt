Footnotes
STARS OF BLUEGRASS angled to the inside stalking the pacesetter inside a rival under light reserve to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing
the second bend, shifted out three wide entering the far turn readily moving to terms with the leaders, then took charge racing into the stretch under firm
encouragement. NOFANSINTHESTANDS, cut off at the start, was settled last near the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then altered
course leaving the furlong marker to split foes while prevailing narrowly for the place honors. SHES GOT THE POWER, urged to a forward placing tracking
just outside the pacesetter, advanced to press that rival into the far turn, dueled between foes on the second bend, yielded nearing the lane, then switched
outside rivals in the closing stages. CRIMINAL RECORD ducked in sharply at the start, was quickly righted to set the pace along the inside, briefly resisted
the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but faded late.

Footnotes
TURN THE SWITCH broke readily, was urged clear along the rail through the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch after repelling a bid from
NORTHERN WOODS to race in the three path but continued grudgingly to hold the challenge of SHINBORO to the end under right handed pressure. The
latter tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep on the bend to close the gap on the winner
leaving midstretch, but was just outkicked. IRISH TUFF swerved out at the start impeding POVERTY FLATS, was collected while settling last, switched
outside foes racing into the bend, then continued with a steady effort to prevail for a share late. UNEMBELLISHED broke slowly, angled to the inside
stalking the leaders under light rating racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed late
response. NORTHERN WOODS, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, moved to lodge a brief bid entering the
turn but came up empty in the drive. YOU'LL BE LUCKY flashed brief pace between foes but dropped out early. POVERTY FLATS, roughed at the start,
ducked in while being steadied by his rider, hit the rail, was pulled up with the assistance of the outrider and walked off the course under his own power.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SHINNY bobbled at the start, switched outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch stalking that rival, continued with a steady bid to challenge that foe
nearing upper stretch, then edged forward through the stretch under firm right handed pressure. BOB'S ALL IN settled along the inside behind the second
flight, steadily gained position along the rail racing into the far turn, shifted outside the leaders to race in the four path entering the lane and continued with
interest while failing to gain terms with the winner. SEEKING REFUGE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, then continued evenly
three deep between foes into the lane. TALLESTOFTHETALL tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, faded entering the far
turn, then angled out four wide in the closing stages to regain some position. THIRTY SECONDS OUT sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace
to the far turn and gave way. BUXTERHOOTER settled outside foes and proved no threat.

Footnotes
STONE ARCH BRIDGE broke readily, was eased off rivals while shifting inwards on the backstretch settling last racing to the turn, switched outside foes
gathering momentum four deep entering the turn, angled to the five path entering upper stretch rallying smartly to contention, lugged inwards in the closing
stages momentarily putting FLASH FLOOD in tight quarters in late stages but went clear in time under steady pressure. CELTICS WILDCAT joined the pace
three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival through the turn into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner's late bid but held a rival
for the place honors. FLASH FLOOD tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening quarter, steadily advanced three deep on the bend, moved to
challenge the leaders in late stages, lost some momentum when caught in tight quarters momentarily and was outkicked for second. DUSTY FORD, urged
between foes, then along the inside entering the turn disputing the pace, pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened late. KNIGHT'S HONOR was
urged inside rivals in the first flight prompting the pace, was held up avoiding tight quarters entering the bend and continued evenly. THE CHAMPS KID
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight on the backstretch, angled to the rail racing through the turn and continued evenly to late stages. I CAME
TO SHAME broke slowly, settled near the inside and passed inside some tiring rivals late. GIVE EM SHADE tracked off the first flight between foes in the
opening stages but emptied out early. CLARE CRESCENT tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight and steadily faded between foes into the turn.

Footnotes
DOCTOR K, off slowly while being carried out at the start by KING OF THE COURT, was quickly righted, then hustled four wide in the opening furlong to
gain a clear advantage, shifted inwards to dictate the pace a bit off the rail into the turn, then held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement.
KING OF THE COURT ducked out at the start impeding the eventual winner, was switched outside rivals in the opening stages while being prompted in
pursuit of the pacesetter four wide, then three wide into the bend, continued with a steady effort to late stages but was always only second best. FENDER
BENDER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the bend and continued evenly to late stages to gain some position while prevailing
for a share. LEO DEL REO broke sharply, flashed brief pace three deep to gain the advantage in the opening sixteenth, was headed by the eventual winner
after the opening furlong and faded between rivals racing into the turn. SWAY ROAD, held up avoiding close quarters along the inside early, settled into
stride, then angled out to race five wide between foes into the stretch but offered no rally. SPENDAHOLIC, urged along the rail pursuing the leaders into the
turn, gave way in the drive. BIG LEAGUE BENNY settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide into the lane and proved no threat. DANZ A
REBEL shied at the start, angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight and failed to menace. RUXIN tracked off the second flight between foes in
the opening quarter but emptied out early.

QUANTUM LEAP, bumped at the start, was urged to terms with the pacesetter between foes prompting that rival into the backstretch, continued to press
the issue in a prolonged drive past midstretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm encouragement. SAMYAZA broke readily, was urged along the
rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, resisted a rival's challenge in an all out drive to the wire but just missed. ME B BUBBA T, in touch with the
leaders three wide between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path on the far turn into upper stretch but proved no match
for the top pair late. JOKER MATT ducked outwards at the start, raced four deep between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards on the first turn to
track off the first flight between foes to the far turn, shifted five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. MYOPIC,
caught five wide, then four wide while being prompted to a contending position just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued four deep into the
far turn and faded into upper stretch. GEAUX YOSHKA broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, angled to the rail tracking the leaders in second flight
racing to the far turn and faded in the drive. CITRUS BAY broke in the air while being cut off at the start, settled into stride a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch but never gained contention. MR OKLAHOMA CITY proved no factor. PURE ROCKET tracked off the first flight three wide between foes to the
backstretch and retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
DON'T BOX ME IN broke sharply, sped clear along the inside to the backstretch, maintained a narrow advantage to the far turn, turned back the challenge
of SILVER DASH nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. The latter was rated off the second flight in early stages, shifted
inwards to split foes after a half, advanced on the pacesetter inside a rival nearing the far turn, tipped outside that foe to challenge approaching upper
stretch but proved no match in the drive. DIRECT ACTION tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground throughout and edged a rival for a share.
GABRIEL'S LEGEND broke awkwardly, was settled into stride, came under prompting to make some brief progress between foes entering the far turn but
proved empty in the drive. TRI SPOT tracked just off the leaders outside foes to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing through the far turn and
steadily faded. BROTHER HAROLD, urged to a forward placing tracking just outside the leader, was urged to make a brief bid closing the gap nearing the
far turn but quickly gave out.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE GAME switched out early tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance four wide
racing into the far turn, moved to wrest the advantage outside foes in upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. SPIRIT MISSION was urged inside a
rival disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors while proving no match. ALLEYCAT
tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes in that path on the far turn, then continued evenly in
the drive. YAK broke readily, pressed the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes through the far turn to upper stretch and
gave out late. MISCHIEVOUS MO angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and offered no closing bid. LOVE MY BOSS
settled between foes racing to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the stretch but proved no threat. I WILL YEAH (IRE) broke awkwardly, was settled
outside a rival in the last flight, then was fanned six wide into upper stretch.
