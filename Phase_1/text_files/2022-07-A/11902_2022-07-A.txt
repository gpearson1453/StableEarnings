Footnotes
STORM BOARDER (CHI) was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, drew off on the turn, then remained clear to prove best under right handed
crop urging. RAILMASTER was allowed to settle early, raced two wide on the turn, split rivals by the furlong marker and finished gamely for the place award.
TANKINATOR was reserved early and made a four wide run on the turn, then was outfinished for the place award. PAPAL LAW was settled back early on
the inside, swung out six wide for the drive and had a belated rally. NICE WEATHER chased the pace three wide and then dropped to the inside by the
furlong marker and weakened. UNCLE ROAMIE tracked the winner early, then took a bad step and stumbled nearing the five sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
SACHMO bumped at the start, settled on the inside, advanced in hand on the turn, awaited room, angled out at the furlong marker for racing room, then
closed full of run to edge away late to prove best while being shown the riding crop, ridden out. VICTORY ANTHEM was well placed towards the inside
throughout, shifted out three wide leaving the turn for aim, made a bid and hit the front leaving the furlong marker but was outfinished by the winner late,
second best. FIFTH ELEMENT vied for the lead on the inside and gave way grudgingly in the lane, bested rest. T REX was taken back early, saved ground
on the turn and angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. IM YOUR PAPI tracked the pace three to four wide and came up empty. ECLIPTICALS BEAR
was six wide into the first turn, vied for the lead three wide and weakened. HE CAME TRUE was settled three to four wide and tired.

NOTORIOUS REY was settled early and on the inside but had no rally. NOTEWORTHY chased the pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened. NO

Footnotes
NINJA PRINCESS was well rated early, made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, continued that move and hit the front nearing the furlong marker,
then drew off in the furlong grounds while being fully extended to the wire. PARABLE set the pace two wide and drew clear on the turn, then was headed
nearing the furlong marker and proved to be no match for the winner, second best. PRETTY SPECTACULAR stalked the pace on the inside and fell back
on the turn, then came again for the show award. GLOSSY MADRINA chased the pace three wide and weakened. SMART TART failed to menace.
PANDORAS CHARM was through early.

HIGH FRONTIER pressed the pace and made a three wie bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, drew off in the drive to prove much the best under
a drive. VICTORY REIGNS was settled early on the inside, angled out when straightened and was no match for the winner while clearly second best.
ASGATA dueled for the early lead on the inside, checked leaving the three eighths, then was getting out on the turn, then was along for the show award.
TALENTED TAPPER was bumped at the start, settled and was four wide on the turn and had no rally. FUELED UP dueled for the lead two wide and
faltered. MI PRINCESS DI failed to menace.
