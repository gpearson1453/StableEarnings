out and then was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was gaining slightly late. TALKINGNONSTOP was
three-wide throughout and found her best stride too late. BARSINTHECAR was pinched back and checked at the start, dropped well back and was unable
to recover in time.

finished strongly to be up in the final strides. MANGATA MIST vied for the early lead with Lucinda Rella from along the inside, shook that one off to open a
clear lead nearing the eighth pole, but was unable to resist the winner late. LUVAHAPPYENDING never far back racing along the inside, angled out for
room and brushed with the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole and then was gaining ground late when straightened out. SHE SAID MY WAY dropped
well back early, moved closer on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. DONTFORGETHESUGAR steadied shortly
after the start, then failed to menace while racing two-wide. LUCINDA RELLA dueled for the lead from along the outside to the stretch and tired.

CURIOUS SENSATION was forwardly placed from the start while racing four-wide, angled nearing the three-sixteenths pole, split rivals during the drive and
was up in the final strides. GOLD SUPPLY saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly to just
miss. ONEFINEDAY rushed up to duel for the lead from along the inside, bore out sharply nearing the three-sixteenths pole bumping Simply Perfect, then
responded when straightened and held on gamely for the drive. Following and stewards inquiry and trainer objection, Onefineday was disqualified from third
and placed fifth. BEAU ROCKS steadied early from between horses, then saved ground and finished in a mild rally. SIMPLY PERFECT prompted the pace
from along the outside, was carried out and bumped by Onefineday nearing the three-sixteenths pole and lost her best chance. TWILIGHT GALAXY came
five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MY FUNNY GAL was prominently place early, but lacked a rally.

MS PARKSIDE saved ground setting the pace, opened a clear lead in the stretch and was ridden out to maintain her advantage. BIG FASHION broke in
then prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was unable to stay with the winner during the drive but continued on well for the place. SMILING SALSA
steadied shortly after the start when Big Fashion came then, then was unhurried, moved up along the rail on the turn angled three-wide entering the stretch
and finished in a mild rally. LAFONDA came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. AKASI was not a factor while racing three-wide on the
turn. DONNE CATTIVE was forwardly placed early, came four-wide into the stretch and tired.

MISS DYNAMIC sprinted clear at once, drew clear on the turn turn while saving ground and won as the rider pleased. ALOHA BREEZE chased the winner
from the start, could not reach that one while racing two-wide and finished well for the place. STICKINITTOTHEMAN was allowed to settle in stride, slipped
through during the drive and finished well. SHELBY GOLD raced three-wide and lacked a rally. STARRY BEACH hesitated at the start to get away behind
her field, dropped well back and found her best stride too late. LUTE'S DIAMOND failed to threaten while racing four-wide.

RUNNIN OUT OF DAYS broke out slightly to bump with Nashville Skyline, then ,moved up along the inside to take the lead before going a quarter mile,
quickly drew clear and won with complete authority. DESHAMBEAU was prominently placed while racing three-wide, responded when asked and while no
match for the winner finished well for second. IT'S TURBO was three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished well. GOLD RUSH
JUNIOR prompted the pace while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. MISTER MIDAS was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide and
tired. LLOYDS LOGIC was bumped repeatedly after the start when Six Shots of T came in, then saved ground but was unable to recover. SIX SHOTS OF T
came in and bumped with Lloyds Logic repeatedly shortly after the start and was not a factor while racing four-wide. NASHVILLE SKYLINE was bumped at
the start and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
ROUSING RUBBLE vied with Orcadian Storm from the outset, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was all out to just last. BRONY BOY
ducked in leaving the chute, then dropped well back while saving ground, got through in the stretch and finished full of run to just miss. ORCADIAN STORM
disputed the pace from along the outside of the winner, but lacked the needed late response when asked. BLOOD RED MOON was unhurried early, moved
up a little nearing the stretch while racing two-wide and went evenly late. KEEP ON DANZING failed to threaten while racing three-wide. DARCEE'S LOVI
DOVI saved ground while racing in the middle of the pace, angled out for the drive but lacked a rally. MIKE MAN'S GOLD was prominent early but gave way
before going a half mile.
