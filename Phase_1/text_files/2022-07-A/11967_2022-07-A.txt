CALMING INFLUENCE stalked the early leader, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was kept to task. REGAL BILLEE
set the pace , was headed on the far turn and from the 5-path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. MY BUYBACK settled off the leaders and
raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no kick. SLIGO CALLING was well back and saved ground on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. GOGO GABRIEL was off the pace and roused on the far turn but had no response. SPIRIT
SOUL BODY was hustled early but trailed on the far turn and was not a factor.

turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. NO MORE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but leveled off. BEST AND FINAL

TAKE CHARGE GENT tracked the leaders from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead at the top of the stretch drew off. SHAMBO set the
pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and held place. DYNAMIC MISSION was off the pace and had a good position on the far turn but from the three path at
the top of the stretch needed more. SUIGU STAR was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for
a share. INNUENDO was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. PIPER AT WAR was
unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. MR. DYNAMIC stalked the early leader but
lost ground on the far turn and had nothing left. STREET MAX was in range and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact. SEAQUELLE was in touch
but chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
FAFA FOOEY stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. SUMMER
RETREAT set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. FED FEVER tracked the early
leaders from the inside and was roused on the turn but finished evenly. MALIBU MAX had no speed, trailed the field on the turn and angled out through the
stretch but needed more. CALL ME WALLY stumbled at the start and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out.

had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. MISS TEA BLONDE was well back and closed the gap on the turn but had
no impact. SUBZERO PLUS was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. FINDING
