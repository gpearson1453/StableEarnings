VERDOT slow early advanced on the turn looming boldly abreast foe in upper stretch being turned away late. SPORT PALACE a step slow lagged to upper
stretch finding late response to finish well near mid track. MY BACK PAGES stalked the pace looming into upper stretch weakening late in the four path.
