Footnotes
PLAY RULE set the pace two off the rail, was in a steady drive along the rail on the turn then drew away in the stretch to win easily. RED BIRD'S STORM
bid from the inside then angled out two wide on the turn to rally in upper stretch but was no threat. WITTS SHOWTIME was unhurried early then bid mildly
along the rail in the stretch but was no threat. MUSTBELIEVE chased the pace while four wide, was in a strong drive on the turn into the stretch drive but
was no factor. LECTERN was in a hard drive to stalk the pace while three wide, was used up on the turn and stopped. DOUBLE TRAP chased the pace
from the inside and never fired. KITTY CAT BLING chased the pace while four wide then faded coming into the turn and was no menace. There was a
JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of DOUBLE TAP claimed foul against the rider of WITTS SHOWTIME for interference on the turn, but
after reviewing the replay no change was made to the order of finish.
