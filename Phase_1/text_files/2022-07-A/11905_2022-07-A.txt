Footnotes
HAYDENS HAVOC vied with SWAGGY GEORGE through the backstretch then tracked the leader around the turn, launched an outside rebid at the head of
the lane, forged to command in final stages and held on. ALEX'S STRIKE was unhurried into the turn, picked up the tempo two wide entering the lane,
surged along the rail in deep stretch and just missed. SWAGGY GEORGE vied for the lead then led the way around the turn, continued with a clear
advantage a furlong out then got reeled in late. TURFY was unhurried in the back, came five wide into the lane and improved position. WOKE UP IN LOVE
raced off the early pace, was ridden three to four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BOLD COWBOY was forwardly placed in opening stages,
continued up close around the turn then gave way. RED WHITE AND LOUD was not too far back early on, saved ground around the turn and had no late
response. CARL G chased the pace three to four wide then faded in the lane. THREE EYED RAVEN raced in range through early stages then retreated in
the stretch.

Footnotes
INTERSTELLA tracked the pace in the opening quarter then hustled up three wide around the turn, launched a bid for SHEMEANSBIZNESS at the head of
the lane, dug in determinedly under firm handling and got up in final strides. SHEMEANSBIZNESS bobbled at the start, quickly recovered and led the way
through the backstretch, held firm around the turn then hustled up two wide into the lane, continued with the advantage into the final furlong then got caught
in closing strides. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE was forwardly placed soon after the start, saved ground around the turn and sustained an inside bid through
the lane. SIMMERING settled in early sages then roused four wide around the turn, ran on three to four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact.
KASA was reserved racing in the back, urged four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT raced up close in early stages,
sustained bid around the turn then gave way. AMERICAN SUE raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. RAINBOW SUREBET
chased in contention in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
JANET IS READY hustled up out of the gate and took over the lead soon after the start, led the way up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, came
under a drive two wide entering the lane, stayed on determinedly in the final furlong and held gamely. ARIZONA KALEI tracked the leader in opening stages
then hustled up two to three wide around the turn, stayed on gamely in pursuit of JANET IS READY through the lane, was edging up closer in final strides
but failed to reach the winner in time. CORNINGSTONE was off a step slow at the start and raced in the back then edged closer along the outside entering
the turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch, sustained bid and secured a share. IT TAKES HEART raced three to four wide in contention around the
turn, came four wide into the lane then shifted in a couple paths and ran on evenly while clear over the rest. MOZINGO raced off the early pace, hustled
along three to four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. REALITOS showed brief response along the inside, then came up empty midway around the
turn. REAL TAP lacked speed and raced in the back, came five wide into upper stretch and had no response.

JOYFUL CADENCE slightly stumbled at the start but still managed to break on the lead, vied three deep in the opening quarter then shook free in hand past
the five-sixteenths pole, was ridden out two wide in upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away and raced in hand. BLINKERS was allowed to settle off
the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and gained second best. UPANDCOMINGSTAR chased the
top trio into the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and churned on for a share. SOMEONE SAID SO vied inside of rivals on opening stages and
continued to duel into the turn, could not move on with the winner past the five sixteenths pole and tired in the drive. EURO ME vied for command between
foes in the opening quarter, continued to match strides to the mid-way point around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
JILTED BRIDE was allowed to settle along the inside heading into the first turn then tipped two wide and tracked the top flight up the backstretch, roused for
more three furlongs from home, came five wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer, dug in determinedly and got up in final strides.
GRAYSONSMACHO GAL set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued to dictate terms by a slim margin around the far turn, came four wide into the
lane, battled on gamely and got caught approaching the wire. BECCA'S ROCKET prompted the pace up the backstretch, launched a two to three wide bid
around the far turn, continued in close contention into the lane then yielded in the final sixteenth. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT was allowed to settle in the back
through early stages, came under a ride two wide around the far turn and failed to rally. ALL GOOD TIMES rated off the early pace, was ridden along three
to four wide into the lane and failed to kick on. BLESSED AGAIN raced in the second flight and tracked the early pace, flattened along the rail around the far
turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
MACRON was away on good order from the outside and tracked the pace in the opening quarter, advanced to challenge MINISTER OF SOUL for the lead
midway around the turn, vied to the furlong marker then kicked clear and finished going away. MINISTER OF SOUL took the lead soon after the start and
showed the way into the turn, came under attack from MACRON at the quarter pole, dueled into upper stretch then failed to be a match past the furlong
marker and finished clearly second best. OIL MONEY was forwardly placed soon after the start, got in tight and steadied entering the turn, stayed on three
to four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten the top two finishers. NO SHIRT NO SHOES raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into
upper stretch and improved position without threatening. CHICKS DIG SCARS raced just off midflight into the turn, chased three to four wide into upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally. ULTIMATE raced in the last flight, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. BAYTOWN BEAR got in tight two
wide entering the turn, bumped with TOP GUNNER, steadied sharply, weakened and failed to regain. TOP GUNNER got in tight entering the turn, bumped
with BAYTOWN BEAR and slammed into the rail, was taken up and never recovered. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED LOOKING INTO THE
RUNNING ENTERING THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

missed show. ARISTOCAT bumped with rival at the start, chased three to four wide in range into the turn then flattened in upper stretch. NEW STRIPE got
bumped at the start then raced up close, dueled between rivals around the turn then gave way. DARE TO FAIL got bumped awkwardly at the start, chased
