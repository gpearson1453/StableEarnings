Footnotes
WHISKARITA went three wide through the backstretch, gained closer order leaving the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, and got by deep stretch.
KISSABLE U crossed over towards the rail approaching the opening turn, dueled inside of AWESOME GIGI through the backstretch, moved clear of rival,
responded to challenge from DAZZLING CHIC, and was bested late. DAZZLING CHIC saved ground in second flight, moved up inside of KISSABLE U to
challenge the lead, was unable to get by and just held for show. SKY DESTINY took closer order nearing the quarter pole, and lodged a late bid missing out.
AWESOME GIGI contested the early lead outside of KISSABLE U, was unable to move on with rival and faded. MARYAM saved early, and was outrun.

RUNNIN MAGGIE dropped back leaving the backstretch, and bid belatedly. SAYGE'S SPIRIT saved along the rail, swung out into the lane, and rallied
belatedly. SPIRITSINTHEWIND chased three wide, and faded.

Footnotes
ALL THAT GOLD sat in striking position from the three path, fanned three wide leaving the final turn, rallied determinedly between rivals, gained the upper
edge over KENTUCKY LEGEND late stretch and held bravely. KENTUCKY LEGEND went four wide through into the first turn, settled four to five wide
through the backstretch, drove four wide near the quarter pole, moved up menacingly alongside ALL THAT GOLD but was unable to muster the kick that
was needed to get by. KEEP YOUR COOL attended the pace from the rail, was headed into the lane, rallied inside and weakened late stretch. DOC COPE
trailed the field early, lugged in approaching the stretch, and lodged a late bid. RAVINA LANE sat mid pack from rail, and lacked a serious bid. FOREVER
JIMMY led the field into the backstretch, was overtaken and yielded.** TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.

ASYOUBELIEVE broke alertly, set a pressured pace inside of SPON ON DUDE, disposed of rival approaching the quarter pole, responded to looming
threat in the stretch, and held safely. SLAATS sat off the pace from the five path, loomed boldly through the stretch under encouragement but was unable to
stall the winner. ABOVE AND BEYOND sat in range from the two path, moved up menacingly but was unable to threaten in the drive. FLASHFORDANI
trailed in the far turn, lodged a rail bid, and faded steadily. ANKARA chased outside and failed to menace. SPOT ON DUDE contested the pace from the
four path, and tired early.

Footnotes
BIG HUG bumped PARK WEST leaving then stumbled, angled to the rail in the opening turn, drove four wide off the final turn, gained the lead and drew off.
MUDINATOR vied outside for the early lead, drew away at the five sixteenth marker, rallied inside but was no match for the winner and just held for second
honors. SINGING BELL vied inside of MUDINATOR, dropped back in the turn, lacked running room along the rail at the head of the stretch, angled out to
the four path and closed with good energy getting up just in time for show. SOCIAL CUES chased the pacesetters leaving the backstretch, moved up
menacingly near the three sixteenth pole, and was unable to improve position through the drive. YOGA RULER chased four wide into the opening turn, and
was outrun. PARK WEST bumped leaving and closed the gap. GO AGARTHA unhurried and was outrun.

Footnotes
BUCKYS PICK saved ground from rail, took closer order nearing approaching the final turn, found seam along the rail into the stretch then matched strides
inside of INTENT TO STRIKE, then nipped rival on the wire to prevail. INTENT TO STRIKE broke sharply, led the field through the backstretch, was joined
at the quarter pole then turned back challenge from MAJESTIC CAFE, then battled determinedly outside of BUCKYS PICK, and got denied by the nose.
FROBISHER BAY reserved well off the pace, and closed well late earning show. MAJESTIC CAFE chased the pace from the four path, moved up alongside
INTENT TO STRIKE at the quarter pole, was unable to get by and weakened late stretch. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER chased outside through the
backstretch, and came up empty in the drive. CONCUR no contention. PREDESTINED chased five wide early, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
GLAVA was quickest to the turn, showed the way through the backstretch, opened up by good margins approaching the stretch then was ridden out,
finishing in record time. BUCK WEST settled off the pace from the three path, swung five into the lane, rallied outside of H K MELODY and edged clear for
place. H K MELODY went four wide through the opening turn, came together with BUCK WEST near the three sixteenth marker, and was out finished. WYE
CROSS raced at the back of the pack, circled into the lane, and closed well outside. SEA SPLENDOR unhurried leaving, raced in closest pursuit, chased
the leader in the final turn, and weakened. RYANWATER chased leaving the backstretch, hustled wide at the head of the lane, and flattened out late stretch.
JUMEIRAH COAST sat in range from the three path, chased from the rail and came up empty in the drive. BECKHAM JAMES failed to menace.

MARKET ANALYSIS was well placed in the three path, chased the leaders into the final turn, split rivals at the head of the stretch, and drove clear breaking
the track record. GREEK GEEK unhurried early, angled outside nearing the stretch, and closed steadily to secure the place position. PARKING PERMIT
trailed in the final turn, launched an all out bid outside and was out kicked for place. STONE CARVER led the field leaving the chute under a strong hold,
dueled through the backstretch inside of DEUCES ARE WILD, shook loose of rival at the quarter pole but was soon under attack, was no match for the
winner and gave way grudgingly inside. UNCHARACTERISTIC sat mid pack outside, was asked to quicken nearing the five sixteenth marker, shifted out to
the five path after encountering traffic, and lacked the kicked needed. DEPARTURE stalked the pacesetters from the four path, fanned four wide in the final
turn, and lacked a closing response. WAR GIANT chased through the field, and came up empty late. DEUCES ARE WILD pressed the pace early, was
unable to keep pace with the field and yielded. SEBASTIAN'S BOY settled off the early pacesetters, was roused through the turn and failed to menace in
the drive.

EFFORTLESS hustled away from the gate, contested the pace from between foes, gained the lead into the far turn, and kicked clear late stretch.
ITSMYDAY broke slow, closed the gap leaving the backstretch, hurried five wide off the final turn, and closed determinedly to earn place honors. VICTORY
AT LAST raced five wide through the backstretch, loomed boldly near the three sixteenth marker, was no match for the winner and was caught late. GREAT
VISION hustled outside, chased the pace leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid at the quarter pole and failed to threaten in the drive. CONTE ROSSO
chased wide, and closed late with good energy. EXPO stalked the pace from the rail, and lacked a closing response. KISS AWAY settled in range, dropped
back and finished evenly. I'M SATISFIED passed tiring rival. CHRIS'S COMMAND quickly went to the front, was overtaken and gave way.
