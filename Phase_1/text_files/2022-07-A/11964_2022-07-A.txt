while three wide at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. FORETELL rated from the rail, floaed into the three path rounding the far turn, shifted in to the
two path coming into the stretch, and improved to show. FIONNBHARR trailed early, saved ground rounding the far turn, tipped into the five path at the top
of the lane, but finished evenly. CONTINENTALCONGRES prompted the pace from the two path, was roused while two wide at the top of the lane, but
faded. OSA rated while two wide but was no factor.

Footnotes
HAMMER LANE led the field up the backstretch, opened up while racing in the two path around the turn, and held off a late closer to the wire. MANOLITO
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground steadily down to the wire. HIDE
THE DEMON chased the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly on the rail. ASHAAB raced
at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. MONEY SONG trailed
the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. DUMI KNIFE tracked the leader on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and faded between horses in the stretch. JOYA DEL SUR raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired from there. MO MISCHIEF pulled up shortly after the start and was walked off.

Footnotes
LARGENT pressed two wide, was cued frok the four path in upper stretch, opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, and held gamely. ALEX JOON trailed
early, was ridden in the five path at the top of the lane, and rallied down the center to place. KENDAMA stalked off the rail, tipped three wide at the top of the
stretch, and ran on for show. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY tracked in the three path, was hustled along from the four path at the top of the lane, but flattened.
PASSION PLAY set the pace, was ridden from inside rounding the far turn, but faded. POINT OF GRACE was well back, two wide, and no factor. PAUPING
raced off the pace from inside but was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANCIENT TIMES led the field under a hold the entire course, kicked clear entering the stretch and maintained his margin to the wire under a drive.
AWAKENED raced off the pace through the opening mile, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the inside down the lane. QUID
stalked the leader on the outside through the opening six fences and finished evenly. MONTMARTRE D'ANGE (FR) chased the leader through the first lap,
continued pursuit of that rival during the second mile and weakened late. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) raced at the back of the pack on the outside for the
majority of the race and passed tiring horses in the stretch. PULL RANK raced at the back of the pack through the opening mile, made a mild improvement
of position on the second lap and flattened out. QUALITY CHOICE raced in the middle of the pack throughout and was outkicked. STOLEN SHOES (GB)
tracked the front runner through the opening mile and faded from there. ZARKALLANI (FR) raced at the back of the pack throughout and offered no bid.
DEPOSIT raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, began to drop back after a mile had been run and tired further in the lane. FRACTIONAL
TIMES UNAVAILABLE FOR THIS RACE.
