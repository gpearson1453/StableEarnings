Footnotes
LADY YELLEN broke in and bumped a foe, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, took the lead coming to the three-eighths,
cruised clear in the three path at the quarter-pole, responded well when shaken up inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in while given one pop of a
right-handed crop into the final furlong then was placed under a hand-ride while widening to the wire. MS NO VAX was hustled from the start then settled off
the pace, went three wide while roused on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. KITTY TIN TIN was backed out of the
gate then reloaded, bumped lightly with a foe at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground around the turn and lacked the needed response
while able to get the show. MADAME ROSE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage with three furlongs to run, moved out after losing touch with the winner in upper stretch and tired. KAY TEE GAL was coaxed along off the pace,
went four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. LORDHEARMYPRAYER was bumped hard at the start then
forced strongly into another foe and dropped back, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along on the outside, went four wide around the turn and had
nothing left. EMERALD BANKER bumped soundly with a foe at the start while also making light contact with another opponent, was ridden along at the rear,
went around the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
NOT PHAR NOW established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm, got roused taking
the inside route into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. THE LAST ZIP crossed to the inside soon
after the start and chased along the rail coming under light coaxing half a mile from home, got put to a drive taking the inside route into upper stretch and
closed well to secure the place honors. DURESS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. REUX (GB) got bumped at the star by AMERICAN LINCOLN, who broke inwards and was briefly pushed
behind NOT PHAR NOW conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside from a loose pocket, came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole tipping out to spin three wide into upper stretch let out for the drive and weakened. TROUBLING MOON chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICAN LINCOLN broke in at the start bumping REUX,

Footnotes
EMINENCY pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path around the turn, gained the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, was
roused into upper stretch, dueled gamely inside of the runner-up under a left-handed crop from that juncture and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
PATRICK THE GREAT was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace while tugging at the bit, drafted two then three wide around most of the turn,
ranged up four wide outside the quarter-pole, made a bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner to the wire and was denied while clear for the
place. UNCLE WATER FLOW brushed with a rival at the start, was taken up when DEVIL OR ANGEL cut in front early, raced towards the rear under strong
urging, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn and improved for the show. DEVIL OR ANGEL was hustled from the gate, angled in quickly
while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused under heavy threat at the three-eighths, lost
the advantage to the winner just inside the five-sixteenths and tired. BARONE MARCHIS settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, came
off the rail into the stretch and failed to threaten. CRAWFORD COUNTY was sent hard from the gate then settled under some urging, went three wide on
the turn and failed to respond. GENTLE JACK FROST leaned out at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back five wide around the turn and
faltered. FAIR TO MIDDLIN leaned out then hit the gate and was last to commence, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased four wide early on
the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, lugged out five wide later on that bend and also faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
DENIS brushed with a foe at the start then was forced in some early, raced towards the back, dropped to the rear before the half-mile pole, fell well behind
around the turn and was eased then vanned off after crossing the wire.

SPLENDID SUMMER got bumped between foes and was pinched back at the start, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the finish to score.
MEDIA SENSATION broke out at the start and was bumped solidly by LEFT ON BOYLSTON tossing the rider from the left side iron momentarily, tracked
just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home taking command loosely between foes a sixteenth out, dug in under threat to the outside and was
caught in the final strides to the finish. LEFT ON BOYLSTON broke out at the start and was bumped inwards into MEDIA SENSATION by SPENDID
SUMMER due to pressure outside from THEREGOESMYMIRACLE, got squeezed back between foes just after the start and conceded three lengths of
position before settling into stride, tracked the pace from near the rear in the two path, tucked inside through the far turn and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SMART JOKER showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down taking
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages. MR NOBILITY saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in
the late going. ISLANDMAN four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and paused off the heels of SPLENDID SUMMER straightened away, then weakened to the finish. LEFTY'S WAR three to four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and tired. QUESTION MY SANITY struck the near side stall at the start getting away
last, chased three then two wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

EVVIE JETS tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tipped three wide with five-sixteenths to go and continued three wide for home in behind
foes on pause in concert with NEVISIAN SUNRISE to her inside awaiting a seam, got one a furlong from home and was roused on through bursting into
daylight to split rivals and take command a sixteenth out, then dug in to prevail at the end. LASHARA (GB) three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear of
the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a wall of rivals to knock heads for command
from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when displaced by the top one and fought on willingly to the end. ZAINALARAB three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in taking narrow command among a host of rivals a furlong out, knocked
heads with the aforementioned foe inside that station and was collared when EVVIE JETS split the pair at the sixteenth marker, then ran on to preserve the
show honors. NEVISIAN SUNRISE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside tipping to the two path with five-sixteenths to go, continued just
off the inside into upper stretch, was paused in behind the aforementioned foe among a wall of rivals a furlong out, briefly got a seam and lost it as EVVIE
JETS got the jump on it, then had ZAINALARAB drift in closing it down, gained clearance a sixteenth out and was under a very light drive to the finish.
PRINCESS FAWZIA just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside half at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
angled out six wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to the finish but was outfinished. POCA MUCHA three to four wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. KING'S HARLEQUIN (IRE) just off the inside in closest aim
of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and seized command at that station spinning from the two path into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from a host and was collared a furlong out, then weakened in the late going. ADELAIDE MISS established the front and showed the way in hand

Footnotes
QUEEN BOURBON was taken in hand then reserved on the inside, came off the rail on the far turn, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch,
rallied to make a bid outside of three foes inside the furlong marker and got up late under strong urging. RHEAUME was rated under a snug hold while given
cover in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid into the final furlong, battled between foes into the final sixteenth, gained a
short lead late but was denied while just able to get the place. EYLARA (IRE) stalked the pace on the outside under a tight hold, was given her cue on the
final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained a short lead inside the furlong marker, lost the advantage inside the sixteenth-pole and just missed
while narrowly able to get the show. HAIL TO went to the front, showed the way on the inside under a snug hold, was asked on the far turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, maintained a slim advantage into the final furlong then lost the lead, fought on well to the wire and just missed in a four-way
photo. CLASSIC COLORS angled in towards the rear early, was reserved in the two path while given cover, shifted three wide midway through the far turn
then was roused, came five wide into the stretch, chased outside under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. STEPPER was rated just off the
pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. MET IN MIAMI angled in at the rear, saved ground while
unhurried at the back, was roused on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MARKET ALERT coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing on
the leader and latching on just inside the three-eighths to confront that foe with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch on near even terms,
took over the front nearing the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive kept to task. THERISASTORMBREWIN coaxed from the gate, dueled early on with
LISTENTOYOURHEART to his inside before being joined between foes by DADDY KNOWS who advanced with six and a half furlongs to go to dispute the
pace, vied outside a pair until shaking off both near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths confronted by the top one, swung three
wide into upper stretch, dug in clinging to command until collared just outside the eighth pole, then ran on to secure the place honors safe from the rest.
BROOKLYN STRONG chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
belated bid. LISTENTOYOURHEART coaxed from the start, dueled with THERISASTORMBREWIN to his outside before being joined by DADDY KNOWS
between foes and vied inside that duo to near the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off in tandem with DADDY KNOWS and chased along the rail through the
turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DADDY KNOWS advanced after the start to range up and vied
between foes from the two path six and a half furlongs from home, remained between those rivals with his head cocked in the left side into the turn,
appeared to try and lug in briefly and was shaken off nearing the seven-sixteenths and faded, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, gained on backing
up rivals while making no headway. JEMOGRAPHY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
DREAM OF A DAY settled on the outside, was roused three to four wide on the turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead inside the furlong
marker and prevailed under strong urging. GREG'S HONOR was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn, moved out while put
to a drive in upper stretch and finished with good energy for the place. BALI RIDDIM settled in third position, was roused while saving ground on the turn,
pursued the leader into upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker, kept on to the wire and secured the show. CALLOWAY PEAK settled towards
the rear on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position with late energy to just get the last spot in
the superfecta. THE ICEMAN COMMETH settled between horses, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, had the rider lose his crop outside the
furlong marker and finished with good energy then just missed the superfecta while getting into some traffic at the wire. EVERESTING showed speed while
into the bit, opened up a sizable advantage down the backstretch, remained well clear while inside through the turn, turned into upper stretch under urging,
shortened stride into the final furlong then was overtaken and weakened. UNION OF THOUGHTS settled on the outside, was urged three wide around the
turn and failed to rally. NORTH CAROLINA showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken back off the pace, followed the runaway leader, was urged
along in the two path around the turn and came up empty. LONGEST DAY was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, came under urging in the
two path on the turn and failed to respond. WICK LOVES A FIGHT was coaxed early then settled off the pace, saved ground under urging around the turn
and also failed to respond. IMOLA was off slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field under urging and was eased but walked off.
