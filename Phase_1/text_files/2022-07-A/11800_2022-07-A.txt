Footnotes
DIGGER'S GOLD lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run
and drew off. KIRBY DERBY broke sharply to stalk the pace of TRUEZER while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with
that foe but could not resist the winner through the final sixteenth. MARK'S WARRIOR settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and finished evenly late. TRUEZER sprinted at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. QUINTON'S
CHARMER dwelt, raced far back early and did not reach contention. PALICE REVENGE chased the leaders while racing four-wide, weakened after going
five furlongs and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SUPERBLEA pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held
GRAN MANNA safely to the wire. GRAN MANNA was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive but could not get to the
winner late. OUR ISLAND GIRL pressed the pace while racing four-wide throughout but failed to gain in the drive. LEMON ICE showed no early speed,
saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. ROYAL QUEEN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn angled out further into
the stretch and was not a factor. EMOTIONAL INTEL set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. GABRIELLA
WHO was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten.

DESTINY WHO tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards to be
going away late. DIABOLICAL MIGHT was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage KEY TO THE CITY nearing
the quarter, vied with that rival, gained a brief lead but could not resist the winner from over the top. KEY TO THE CITY sprinted clear soon after the start,
responded when challenged by DIABOLICAL MIGHT nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and gave way through the final furlong. ESTEEMED lagged
early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and did not reach contention. MICKEYS GOLD was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
QUATRO was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead approaching the stretch and held sway to the wire. FLYIN FALYNN was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner but finished well to be up for the place. I'VE GOT IT broke
sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave way in the drive. LITTLE SAMURAI
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. INVODKAWETRUST showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor.
