Footnotes
TOWN AGENDA urged briefly from the gate, was then rated from the inside, roused after a half mile, came into contention along the rail on the second turn,
continued his bid under urging in the lane and took over nearing the final sixteenth. VIVA VIOLENCE was sent to get the lead from inside into the first bend,
moved away from the rest on the backstretch, floated out some entering the lane, was all out, did not have enough left but proved easily second best. HE'S
A FINE MAN broke on top, was overtaken from inside entering the first turn, stayed close outside VIVA VIOLENCE, angled in some when the latter took his
path into the stretch and gave way the last eighth. CLEVER BOY chased running widest most of the way and had no late bid.

Footnotes
ART HEIST took a clear lead midway on the backstretch, showed the way just off the inside, was under a drive in the lane, gradually drifted out despite
right-handed urging inside the last eighth but held sway. SHANGHAI SILVER broke on top, was soon chasing ART HEIST from just outside, lacked the
extra needed deep stretch but was clearly second best. TURBINADO was steadied behind traffic for nearly a furlong midway on the backstretch, angled to
the outside after a quarter mile, came into the lane from path three and made up minor ground the last furlong. THAT KHENNY prominent from inside early,
gradually yielded after three furlongs.

BRIANS WAY rated just outside GRUMPA, took over when allowed on the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, opened up under urging upper stretch
then continued to draw off while ridden out the last eighth. THACKER FROMM was steadied when caught behind traffic midway on the backstretch, altered
in nearing the half mile marker, swung to the outside on the bend, came into the stretch from path four and steadily drew away for the place. GRUMPA
displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with BRIANS WAY on the turn, came off the rail some for the drive, gradually yielded, began to drift out deep
stretch and was allowed to coast in the waning yards. LAGRUE broke inward and was steadied, recovered to race in contention from outside on the
backstretch, angled in on the bend and steadily faded.

WILDCAT BOBBIE was angled in early, rated just outside JUST A WONDER, asked on the bend, took over from path three upper stretch, moved clear
inside the last eighth and held off GHAALEB'S RANGER under steady handling. GHAALEB'S RANGER settled well off the early pace, commenced her bid
after two furlongs, angled to the rail on the turn, rallied under steady urging in the stretch but came up short. WILDWOOD POSSE chased from outside,
made her bid three wide on the bend, was widest entering the stretch, loomed a serious threat with a furlong left but leveled off instead. JUST A WONDER
hesitated at the start, rushed up from just off the inside to gain a clear lead but flattened out for the drive. DIAMOND STELLAR broke well but steadily faded
from inside soon after.

FAIRWAY LANE prominent between rivals, was asked three wide on the turn, carried out to path five entering the stretch, rallied the final furlong and got up
nearing the wire. W W RUSSIAN GOLD pressed the early speed from between horses, did not keep up on the bend, floated out to path four into the lane,
also made a strong move deep stretch but came up a bit short. HELLOFAGUY well placed from inside, retreated on the turn, altered out three wide for a
clear path after entering the last furlong, rallied in a gradually narrowing path, bumped with RIPE ATTACK as he squeezed through between rivals nearing
the wire and got up for third. BAM BAM CAM recovered from a significant stumbled at the break to set a pressured pace between horses, gained the rail on
the turn, was soon challenged by RIPE ATTACK, brushed repeatedly with the latter leaving the bend and upper stretch, battled gamely to hold on in the late
going, drifted out slightly nearing the wire, bumping RIPE ATTACK and was outfinished. RIPE ATTACK pressed from outside, went for the lead on the turn,
brushed repeatedly with BAM BAM CAM as he fought for the lead, began to weaken some between horses deep stretch, bumped with the latter nearing the
wire then bumped HELLOFAGUY and was steadied. RICHIESONARAMPAGE raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but gave way widest on
the bend.

Footnotes
KHOZYS CROWN moved to the inside approaching the end of a quarter mile, was roused on the turn, under steady urging in the lane, squeezed through a
narrow opening along the rail to engage HELEN MAE'S SONG with a sixteenth left and edged ahead in the waning yards. HELEN MAE'S SONG broke on
top and sprinted away from the rest, was kept in hand on the bend, floated out some as she was asked entering the stretch, was under steady urging but did
not have enough left. PALM COURT chased from just off the inside, gained a striking position between horses on the turn, fanned outside HELEN MAE'S
SONG into the lane and rallied belatedly deep strech. CARSON RESERVE settled inside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, swung around SATIATE
on the turn, came into the stretch along the rail, angled out three wide when a path opened approaching the furlong marker then made up minor ground in
the late going. MENDING chased from outside, came into contention three wide on the turn but leveled off widest for the drive. SATIATE showed little in a
ground-saving trip.

SEAWARD bumped leaving the chute, vied for the early lead between horses, gained the rail into the bend, was asked with two furlongs to go, gradually
drifted out despite right-handed urging, moved clear inside the last furlong, held a straight path with seventy yards left and held sway. LEA RO in contention
from outside, did not keep up three wide on the turn, fanned widest into the lane, gradually angled out to keep a clear path outside PLAY TWENTY, swerved
around that one in the waning yards and got second. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE prominent between rivals, followed PLAY TWENTY through the turn, angled
outside that one for a clear path upper stretch, began to close the gap inside the final eighth, angled inside for a clear path inside the last sixteenth and
gained third near the wire. PLAY TWENTY was a step slow as she broke outward, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside SEAWARD, moved ahead
as she also began to gradually drift out in the lane and slowly wore down from between horses deep stretch. KIMBERLY FRANCES chased from inside and
could only make up minor ground the final eighth. TAP'S LULLABY bumped SEAWARD leaving the chute, was forwardly placed from inside but began to
yield before finishing three furlongs.
