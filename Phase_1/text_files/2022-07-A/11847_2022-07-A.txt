PALTARREVENGE angled in a bit nearing the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, was carried out to the eight path and got up in
time three wide. NOBLE BEHAVIOR away alertly, set the pace along the inside, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, dug in determinedly but couldn't
handle the winner. VENETIAN DREAM pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the seven path and was outfinished in a game effort.
GALTERO was in tight along the rail entering the first turn then failed to menace. SAY HEY KID was no threat. ADANO was in tight between rivals entering
the clubhouse turn, offered a mild bid four wide into the far turn then came up empty. PRETTY STORMY also in tight into the first turn, was no threat.
