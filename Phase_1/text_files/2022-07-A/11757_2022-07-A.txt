Footnotes
MONZZA close up inside from the start, continued to vie along the rail into and through the turn, extended duel through the stretch, brushed with the runner
up, outfinished that one in a determined effort. MOVE IT pressed early outside, vied four wide in the far turn, hooked up with the winner in a protracted duel
turning for home outside that one, exchanged brushes to the wire, outkicked late. QUANA DUDE fell back steadily the opening quarter, trailed through the
turn, improved inside of several rivals entering the stretch, finished well clear of those other rivals while not a serious threat to the top two late. ONE PROUD
BOY narrowly showed the way up the backstretch while between foes, remained forward early in the turn then began to gradually weaken. CARIBE
NIGHTS broke through the gate prior to the start, away in good order, with the pace three wide and between foes for three furlongs, gave way. OPTIMISTIC
lacked early foot, four wide through the turn and into the lane, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
CARLOS LOVES TEE broke on top, pressed the issue into and through the first turn between foes, dueled late backstretch and into the far bend, took over
midway on that turn, drew off steadily through the lane, won wrapped up and ridden out. MSCHITCHATTOUR settled off the pace just off the inside, moved
out, four wide through the second turn, roused into the lane, proved no match for the winner while rallying to be clear for the place. SUFFRAGETTE one
paced off the leaders and the inside, moved a bit closer three wide to chased the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one in flattening out, caught
for the place. KAPPA HILL with in striking distance while three wide early, continued to maintain contact with the two leaders second turn, had little left for
the stretch run. LYONAISSE last to leave, trailed, fell further and further back in a dull effort, jogged in while picking off a fellow faltering rival late. SHE'S MY
PRIORITY narrowly set the pace for five furlongs along the rail and inside the winner, stopped second turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
TEASIN' TESLA dueled up front in the two path, shook clear before a half, kept widening to the wire while under token encouragement down the lane to win
ridden out. ASK DALE lacked early foot, improved position three wide second turn to be closest to the winner into the lane, had nothing for that one to the
wire, well clear of the others. RYAN'S GRACE dueled early along the rail and inside the winner, lost contact with that one after a half, proved no match for
the runner up as well, comfortably saved the third spot. TRINITY HOPE one paced throughout, was never a factor. LUKIA was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
IZEONPOINT unhurried early, continued back turn, came five wide for the drive, rallied while remaining widest, dueled final sixteenth, put a head in front late
to narrowly prevail while drifting in a bit late. J Z'S FIRST last to leave, trailed early, angled out four wide when straightened for home to bother a stalled
OLD FASHION AMOUR, hooked up with the rallying winner inside that one and dueled to the wire, led late, missed while being floated in by that same rival
in the waning strides. A WISH FOR MADELYN away in good order, dueled early inside her entrymate, put that foe away by early in the turn to be clear,
continued to hold a daylight advantage past midstretch, proved no match for the top two, narrowly saved the show. CAJUN SHOTS lacked early foot, came
three wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest, gaining for the show. AMERICAN REBEL in mid pack off the inside, moved closest to
the leader three wide turning for home, flattened out in the run to the wire. HOLY WAR in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into
the lane, had little left for the stretch run. BE A BANDIT dueled up front early outside entrymate, began to fade just before a half, continued to weaken
through the stretch. OLD FASHION AMOUR prompted the issue three wide up the backstretch, began to weaken after a half, was continuing to tire when
bothered by the runner up in upper stretch. PRETTY PRODUCTION was finished early, trailed home well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH UPPER STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION QUARTER AND HALF-MILE TIMES
WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
EYE DEE KAY pressed the issue for a half in the three path, took over in to the far turn, steadily increased advantage into and through upper stretch, won
ridden out in coasting home late. DOUBLE ON THE RED void of speed, began to move closer along the inside far turn, moved out a bit in the two path,
steered out further to be four wide into the lane, finished willingly to be slowly closing the gap on the winner while well clear of the others. SERGEANT
RECKLESS set or forced the pace while in the two path, fell back off the winner into the far turn, evenly paced into the lane, no match for the runner up,
came back for the place. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved up to mid pack before a quarter, made an
additional advance into a forward position to be closest to the winner late in the final turn, flattened out in the drive to lose the show late.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN lacked speed while three wide, asked along into far turn, lacked a closing response. LONG ARROW set or forced the inside for
five furlongs and faltered. TIME TO MOVE four wide when pressing the issue up front through the first turn, was finished after a half. PRODUCTION TIME
five wide into the first turn when toward the middle of the pack, stopped before a half, jogged in.

Footnotes
GREEN MONSTER underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, in the second flight early while between rivals, asked along and challenged three wide while
still between horses into the lane, put a head in front nearing the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. SWEET PRAYERS dueled up front in the
two path out of the chute, continued to contest the issue while between horses through much of the turn, proved stubborn throughout the stretch, narrowly
gained the nod for the place. ROMANTIC BEAST in the second group while racing outside, four wide when moving slightly closer on the outside entering
the stretch, lacked a late punch to miss the place. GEE GEE broke alertly, was a pace factor along the inside for over a half, weakened gradually through
the lane. LIL ALLIE DANCER back off the pace while toward the inside early, swung out five wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a rally. LOVE TO LEARN
last to leave, failed to menace.

Footnotes
NET A BEAR unhurried early, continued under patient handling while saving ground into the far turn, angled out when straightened for home, briskly roused,
closed with good resolve to be up in time while widest of the first flight at the wire. LADY VALENTINE broke on top, set a moderate pace toward the inside,
briefly headed midway on the final turn, regained the advantage into the lane, drifted out while leading late, nipped in the closing strides. QUINN ELLA
forwardly placed early, made an early move to challenge far turn, briefly put a head in front midway on that bend, headed by the pace maker into the lane,
not enough late while between the top two at the wire. VALENTINES DAY off the pace while four wide first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, three
wide when with the second flight second bend, lacked a significant closing response and posed no threat to the top trio. SPLENDA GAIL chased the early
leader, moved a bit closer three wide in the second turn, came four wide when falling back off the issue into the lane, also finished up evenly. JUST
PASSING THRU void of speed off the inside, came five wide for the drive, failed to fire off a rally while remaining well out in the strip. GOLD INCLUDED in
mid pack through the first turn, was finished before a half, well back, jogged across.

Footnotes
MOMENT TO DREAM broke on top, set the pace off the inside, shook clear in the turn, continued to hold a large advantage into the stretch, enough left to
hold the runner up safe late. TUGBOAT pressed the winner early from along the inside, let that rival go into the turn, continued to be that same rival's
closest pursuer into the lane, shifted out, roused, gaining late, well clear for the second spot. BEYOND D'ORO last away, settled off the pace inside,
continued to save ground turn, moved out slightly for the drive, no threat to the top two late, clear of the others. LACIS JEWEL lacked speed off the inside,
raced three wide through the turn, improved slightly without posing a serious threat in the drive. ROCKETT MAGIC forwardly placed in the early going,
began to weaken before a half. MY SWEET SOPHIA fell back to trail, showed little while four wide.
