DIVA'S DIVA raced along the inside then angled three wide into the stretch wore down the frontrunners and was up for the win in the final jumps. ATOKA
GIRL pressed the pace from the outset in the two path took a narrow lead into the stretch and extended the margin a bit but could not fend off the winner in
the final strides. LA ROSA DRIVE was quickest from the gate and held the lead on the inside but was challenged every step of the way took the lead into
the stretch but was outfinished by the top pair and had to settle for third. STREETTALKINHOTTIE raced along the inside while well within striking distance
but offered no rally and dropped back through the stretch. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL raced in the two path the entire race while in contention but gave way
through the stretch. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

Footnotes
JACK WITH SEVEN broke in the air and spotted the field at least three lengths came through on the inside up the backstretch then raced three wide into the
turn swung six wide into the lane and finished best to win convincingly. EL DIABLO GRANDE challenged for the lead from the outset in the two path took
the lead mid stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final eighth. ALL SHACKED UP was the quickest early and had the rail but was challenged by
two rivals from the outset held the advantage into the stretch but could not go with the top pair in the final yards. MR. WHITE raced in the two path up the
backstretch and then swung three wide into the lane made up some ground but was never a serious threat. BEAU GOSSE had a rail trip behind the
pacesetters moved into contention along the inside at the head of the stretch but then backed up through the stretch run. WILD FIREMAKER showed good
early speed but was hung three wide the entire trip remained up close midway on the turn and then dropped back. FELON was in the two path for the first
half of the turn then swung three to four wide turning for home but never mounted a rally. PICKELJUICE raced in the three path into the turn and then swung
five to six wide turning for home and came up empty.

MUCHO GIFTED was very quick away from the gate and opened a clear lead from the outset held the margin on the turn then increased the lead through
the stretch while not being asked to win as the rider pleased. CRUZ'N OLLIE raced in the two path moved into the second position turning for home and
while no threat to the winner was clearly second best. BUMPER POOL raced along the inside passed some tired foes and was up for third while never a
threat to the top pair. RUN FOR MATTY was well off the pace along the inside made a mild bid through the stretch while never a serious threat. BARLOWS
PRIDE was midpack while racing five to six wide on the turn and never mounted a rally through the stretch. BURBACH chased the pace in the two path and
then gave way through the stretch.

TEQUILA RITA chased the leader along the inside angled out turning for home drew alongside the leader at the top of the stretch and then steadily drew
clear through the lane to earn the win. KELLEY'S MANDATE was away in good order and took the lead and the rail held the advantage on the inside until
the top of the lane but could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. RIVER CHARMER was off the pace along the inside found her best stride
along the inside through the stretch and was able to get third while never a threat to the top pair. TRICKY LEX was wide while racing close to the lead after
a quarter mile then began to fade and was not a factor. TYLERS ANGEL WINGS was always well back and never a factor while racing off the rail. THERE
