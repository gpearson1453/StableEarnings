Footnotes
FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL hustled to a clear lead early, moved easily on the turn then widened in the stretch under a drive. SHACKLE CAT pursued the
winner inside and continued willingly while no match for the winner. SCOTCH ROCK'S lagged far behind then showed late energy to gain the show.
THOROVER prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. I SAW IT ALL broke sluggishly, moved inside, angled out on the turn and tired. E
T'S DEUCES WILD raced off the pace in the two path and gave way readily. FROST'S SONG saved ground and began retreating on the turn.

HAY BUCK pressed the pacesetter to the stretch, edged clear in midstretch and extended margin while kept to a drive. JULIET'S MUSIC controlled the
fractions, was collared into the stretch then yielded in the final furlong. PENANCE settled inside off the leaders, angled wide on the final turn and was up for
the show. GALILEO'S AFFAIR trailed for five furlongs then passed rivals without menacing. SPLENDOR GAL saved ground close up then faltered on the
final turn. SAME MOON dropped back inside and lacked a response. QUIET PLEASE stalked the pacesetters outside for half a mile and faded.

SWEET BLAME firmly rated outside, bid three wide into the far turn, moved clear, was challenged from her outside and held on gamely while drifting out.
MANI PEDI settled inside, rallied wide on the final turn loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. FRISKY FEELING raced well back inside then
gained show in the stretch. TOWSON raced close up inside, moved wide on the final turn and faded. TIME TO TWO STEP prompted the pace outside for
three quarters and gave way. HOLMDEL PARK set a pressured pace inside, was collared into the stretch and faded. LONDONDERRY dropped far behind
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EL HERMANO angled inside early, bid to the front at the quarter pole, drifted out in the lane and edged off. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE set the pace off the
inside, was collared after half a mile, altered course tiring in the stretch. FACTOR THIS IN settled close up outside, was asked for run on the final turn, and
had a mild rally. DUBROVSKY trailed early inside then passed rivals without menacing. SPRING EMPEROR broke slowly, moved close wide then came up
empty in the stretch. COBBLE HILL dropped back early and failed to menace. TAINO was urged close up for half a mile and stopped abruptly. A claim of
foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

BROAD JUMPER saved ground early, angled out on the turn then wore down the leader following a long drive. CLASSY SADIE pursued the loose
pacesetter, led into the stretch and held on gamely. FIFTYSHADESOFRUN quickly took control, was collared into the stretch and weakened. CAPE COD
SALLY saved ground close up then began tiring on the turn. BALBOA'S SMILE chased outside and lacked any response. MISBEHAVING LADY broke
slowest and was always outrun. LEFTATTHEALTAR dropped far behind inside and was no factor.

BRETT'S WORLD rated behind the dueling leaders, split foes in the stretch then caught the leader under strong handling in the final sixteenth. RISQUE
REBEL dueled along the inside for three quarters, battled when hooked but could not resist the winner. LONG GRAY LINE trailed for half a mile, moved
inside in the stretch and was up for the show. TACTICAL PLAN sluggish early, advanced between rivals into the far turn then flattened out. HOORAY FOR
HARVEY vied outside to the stretch and gave way. RUNNINGFORHOME raced very wide just off the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. EXTREME
FORCE rated close up three wide for half a mile and stopped. OPEN LENGTHS lacked speed along the inside and was never a factor.

MELITZA stalked the pace under rating, bid to the front at the quarter pole then drew away under moderate coaxing. DIANE'S COMET set the pace,
widened before half a mile, was collared near the quarter pole and lasted for the place. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO trailed early then offered some late energy
while no threat. PETITE ROUGE saved ground, moved closer on the final turn then weakened. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL dropped well behind and was
never in contention. RELENTLESS CANDY urged close up wide to the final turn and gave way. NARYUA W prompted the pace briefly then stopped
abruptly.

CENTRE COURT CHAMP set a pressured pace inside, shook loose into the stretch and drew away while kept to her business. SEAMIALAUGH stalked the
dueling leaders outside, bid wide in the stretch and finished gamely for the place. GOLDEN TABBY forced the pace outside winner, was asked for run on
the turn, weakened but continued willingly to the finish. LIVE AID dropped back after the start, saved ground then passed rivals late. ESPERNSITA chased
very wide down the backstretch and faltered. SUMMARY JUDGMENT angled inside behind the pacesetters in the opening quarter and faded after the half.

VIOLENT TURBULENCE rushed up to duel inside, battled throughout, lost the lead a furlong out but came again in a game victory. BIG CITY BOB dueled
the winner in the two path, led briefly in midstretch but was outfinished late in a solid effort. JOHNNY RITT settled off the pace, bid three wide into the
stretch then went evenly late. PRINCE OF RAIN trailed to the stretch, was in tight between rivals in early stretch then closed well inside too late. EASY DAY
raced off the pace very wide, continued wide and flattened out in the stretch. FAST BREAKIN CASH prompted the pace three wide to the three eighths pole
and tired. DAVIDIC LINE saved ground off the leaders, was asked for run on the turn but faded through the stretch.
