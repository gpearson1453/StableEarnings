winner nearing the quarter pole, resisted to midstretch then weakened. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL saved ground well back and rallied belatedly. GIRLY THE
BUTCHER chased the pace two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. PRETTYKEEN settled off the early pace while
racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. USURPED stalked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

PARKLAND dueled along the rail throughout and dug in gamely to prevail. HEZA KITTEN had early speed two wide, settled back into a stalking position
midway around the first turn, re-bid three wide around the far turn, reached even terms three deep nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside of the winner
from there and just missed. MR MATUSCHEK dueled two wide to upper stretch, weakened and held for the show. GO MIKE failed to menace while racing
two and three wide. POPPY'S BOYS was outrun inside.

GRAND DAVID set the pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. ALWAYS GAMBLING tracked the pace three and four wide, bid outside of the
winner in midstretch, lugged in, switched back the left lead near the sixteenth pole and flattened out. SPACE RUNNER was off a step slow, raced well back
two wide, went four wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. FATHER GLADO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. TRUST DADDY
prompted the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner around the far turn, angled in nearing the quarter pole and continued to fade.
TREASURE KING saved ground and never threatened. SILENT CHAOS saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole and came up
empty in the lane. STARSHIP ABRAHAM stalked the pace inside and retreated through the lane.

BION MAGIC bumped with ANNA'S DREAM at the start, stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, seized
command in midstretch and drew off under a drive. SEA ART stalked the pace two wide between foes, angled to the rail in upper stretch, continued on the
left lead, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. ANNA'S DREAM bumped with the winner at the start,
pressed the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, battled between foes past the eighth pole and weakened. DEMURELY steadied near the
five-eighths marker, raced off the pace four wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally. CHASING HAPPINESS was off a bit slow, sped to the front,
set a pressured pace inside, yielded nearing the quarter pole then was in tight in upper stretch and continued to fade. KNIGHT SLEEPER was outrun inside.

rallied outside through the lane and was bumped in deep stretch. HURRY UP DEAR was caught five wide between foes entering the first turn, gradually
angled into the two path rounding that bend, was shuffled back nearing the far turn, went three wide between foes around most of that turn, came six wide
into the lane, continued on the left lead and rallied for the show. MISS KEEN settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn, advanced five
wide around the far turn, bid in midstretch but flattened out. YOUR INHERITANCE raced two wide around both turns and improved position in the lane.
CALI DIVINE stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. SHES SKY HIGH played no factor while racing four wide.

the two path and faltered near the quarter pole. OUR TEN ANGELS chased the pace five wide and retreated nearing the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY
AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SEMIRAMIS, HARDSPUN WOMAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR
