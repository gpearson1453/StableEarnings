Footnotes
MARK DID IT became a bit anxious in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the four path, eased to the outside past the
eighth pole, dug in fot the lead late yards and raced clear under the wire. GLASTONBURY engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced at near
even terms into the turn, took the nod at the rail midway through the turn, was steadily handled leaving the eighth pole but gave up the lead in the final
yards. PAPA DON pressured the early pace, steadied between horses into the turn, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the stretch
while gaining on the runner-up. PITCH DARK became a bit anxious in the gate then set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep into the turn but
was met midway through the turn and flattened later yards. HE IS BONAFIDE gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. ON
SPOT gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. BUFF'S CAT was never a factor. Per HISA Ruling #1, Papa Don was disqualified from
earnings.

Footnotes
HOBE SOUND rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of One More Factor leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
kept alert in the lane. FRANKEE MERCH settled in the two and three paths the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path then cleared second inside the sixteenth pole. FAST LOADED stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the five
sixteenths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. CHARLIE POTATOES rounded the first turn in the three path, bid past
the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride. ONE MORE FACTOR stalked the earlier pace two deep, challenged leaving
the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) was unprepared for the break
then saved early ground.

Footnotes
MOIRAINE took over and tapered to the inside to rate a slim lead, was met into the backstretch and kept the edge over Weavinyouinthedust from the half
mile pole, dug in determinedly through the stretch and earned the nod. MAY MAYS CASTLE saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced
near the rail on the far turn, drew close mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD raced off the pace in the two and three
paths, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, remained close in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. I SHALLBE RELEASED settled
off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. IHEARTRAINACOMN saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and ran near the rail on the far turn, angled to the three path toward the head of the lane but showed little further. TAPTAP
rounded the opening turn in the five path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little more. NINETY
PROOF rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.
WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST angled in and raced with the early pace two deep, drew to even terms and challenged leaving the half mile pole, but dropped
back toward the quarter pole and gave way on the far turn. ROO showed little response.

HEATED chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and held on under steady handling.
PAISLEY SINGING gave chase, rounded the turn two deep, angled to the five path leaving the turn and dug in through the lane to take second the final
yards. GOOD KARMA chased and raced close two deep between horses through the turn, took the nod into the lane but was caught mid-stretch and
flattened nearing the wire. WILLOW MOON chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened later yards. MANAROLA gave chase, rounded the turn in
the five and six paths and showed little in the lane. MY LOVELY GIRL chased toward the inside but lacked a clear path leaving the five sixteenths pole.
DING DING broke through prior the start, drew clear at the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail leaving the turn and gave way.
