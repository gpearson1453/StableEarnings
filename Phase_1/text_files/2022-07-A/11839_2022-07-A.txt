HIGHLY DISTORTED stumbled leaving the gate, chased three wide into the turn, came out and entered the lane five wide, rallied widest in the stretch and
drove clear late. DARK PROOF attended the pace three deep early, lost contact with the leaders around the bend and chased four wide into the lane, re-bid
midstretch but got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. SOUL PRODIGY set the pace from inside under pressure, maintained a short lead through
the turn, drifted out some past the three-sixteenths pole, lost command with a furlong left to run but stayed on to save the show. HARPER'S GEM pressed
the pace from outside early, came three wide into the drive, got floated out slightly past the three-sixteenths pole, took a narrow lead with a furlong left to run
but faltered in the final sixteenth. SHARP WARNING was rank leaving the gate, dropped back and angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn, gave
chase through the lane but needed to find more in the late stages. SURPRISE FASHION tracked off the rail, trailed four then five wide into the stretch and
failed to menace.

outside rivals early then moved into the two path, was closet in pursuit through the turn, put in a bid from outside in the final furlong but lacked the needed
late kick and had to settle for second best. MARIE was fractious in the gate and had to be reloaded, broke a few lengths slow at the start, trailed four wide
through the turn and was along for the show. KELANI KIM chased the leader inside pair of rivals, got brushed early then had to pause when the leader took
his path near the nine-sixteenths pole, traveled along the inside then two wide on the turn and got edged for the show. MALIBU MISTRESS was a bit
fractious in the gate, bobbled a bit at the start, got put in tight and brushed between rivals early, went three wide around the turn and weakened.

STAY GOLDEN sped to the front in the two path, took pressure from a pair of rivals then moved clear nearing the five-eighths marker, met the bid from
FULL OF LUCK (CHI) on the far turn, maintained a short lead through the lane and held gamely to the wire. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) raced up close three
wide then went up to press from between rivals, lost contact with the leader approaching the five-eighths pole and chased to the far turn, bid from inside
around the far turn, fought the winner through the length of the stretch but could not get by. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was off slow from inside, went three
wide around the first turn, rounded the second bend two wide and bested the rest. UNBROKEN STAR broke a step slow, went up to be forwardly placed
four wide on the first turn, pressed three deep into the backstretch, lost contact with the leader nearing the five-eighths pole, chased three wide around the
far turn and flattened in the lane while holding a minor award. THE BEAT stalked the pace from inside early then dropped back to last on the backstretch,
continued along the rail to the stretch and made no impact. FRONTIER MARKET broke a step slow, went four wide around the first turn, traveled three wide
into the second bend, tipped out to the four path late on the second bend and weakened.

FOUNDER'S DAY fractious in the gate, pressed from outside early, chased the leader past the five-eighths pole, got floated out while challenging for
command on the far turn, lugged inward in the final furlong and drew clear. BLOSSOMING sped to the front in the two path, cleared up the backstretch,
drifted out on the far turn and was challenged from outside into the stretch, dueled from inside then got forced in when the winner came over and yielded
late. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH tracked the pace from inside, moved to the path on the far turn, steered out in the lane, could not summon the needed
response but finished a clear third. ROCK THE BOURBON dropped back early and moved inside, moved out on the backstretch, angled out and came six
wide into the stretch and improved position. ICE COLD GOLD stumbled leaving the gate, chased four wide through the clubhouse turn, rounded the far turn
three wide and weakened down the lane. TMORROWISALONGTIME was fanned six wide on the first turn, tracked widest up the backstretch, went four
then five wide on the second turn and weakened. ICE QUEEN got caught five wide through the first turn, tracked between rivals on the backstretch then
three to four wide on the second turn and tired. NISHICO broke a bit slow on the outside, chased seven wide into the first turn then angled down to the two
path, moved closer in them middle stages, dropped back on the far turn and came up empty in the lane.

SHORTMAN chased two then three wide early, went up to vie between rivals, battled inside a pair and three wide into the stretch, then powered away in the
final furlong. PAPALE brushed the gate in the beginning, drifted out to the five path on the first turn, went three wide into the second bend, angled out and
came six wide into the stretch and rallied to gain the place. MAXIM MOMENT broke a step slow, angled out on the first turn, chased four deep leaving the
backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn, entered the lane five wide, could not kick on with the winner with three-sixteenths remaining and got edged for
the place. ALL FOUR WINDS veered out leaving the gate, pulled early while showing speed in the three path, vied three deep at the halfway point, between
foes on the far turn, then weakened in the stretch run. TAKEITTOTHEBANK sped to the front and moved inside, got headed by a pair of rivals at the
half-mile pole, lost ground through the far turn and faded down the lane.

inched away late. QUINTECENTS sped to the front from inside, cleared past the nine-sixteenths pole, challenged by a pair of rivals on the far turn, lost
command past the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on through the lane and was able to edge MO THEM DOWN for second place. MO THEM DOWN pressed
the pace from outside early, chased leaving the backstretch, challenged again from between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, fought into the final furlong,
could not kick on with the winner late and lost the place. LAW ABIDING got bumped leaving the gate, floated out a bit by LAFORGIA on the first turn,
chased two to three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. LAFORGIA bumped leaving the gate, drifted out and steadied into the first turn, trailed into
the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

PROCRASTINATION broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, went to set the pace with company alongside, maintained a short lead through the turn,
roused entering the stretch, put to left-handed urging and powered away. FUNKHOUSER prompted the pace from outside, three wide into the lane, could
not go on with the winner past three-sixteenths pole and stayed on to secure the place. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE got brushed by the winner leaving the
gate, chased along the inside into and around the bend, could not produce a bid in the drive and churned on to hold third. FREE AND HUMBLE chased the
speed outside a pair of rivals, came four wide into the lane and lacked a late bid. CANDY CARAMEL hit the gate and came away slow, moved closer four
deep on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. DADDY CLASSY DILL chased between foes early, two to three wide into the stretch and
could not rally. BIZZY GAL hit the gate to break slow and inward, trailed three then four wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
BECCA TAYLOR dueled for command outside BRANDON'SMYLAWYER disposed of that rival past the three-eighths pole, led three wide into the stretch,
met the bid from ELM DRIVE in upper stretch, responded nicely and moved clear with a furlong left to run and edged away in the final sixteenth. SAMURAI
CHARM got crowded between rivals early, moved into range between runners, tipped three wide around the turn, put in a mild bid inside the top pair in the
stretch and gained the place. ELM DRIVE hit the gate but still came away well, stalked outside the top pair early, traveled four deep on the turn, bid four
wide into the stretch but faltered in the final furlong. COVER VERSION was off slow to begin, dropped back early, trailed five wide around the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and finished with a mild rally to round out the superecta. LADY MYSTIFY bumped leaving the gate, raced up close on the inside,
chased the winner through the turn and weakened in the lane. AIN'T EASY got shuffled between rivals early, chased three deep then four wide into the
stretch, moved out at the top of the lane, lugged in midstretch and weakened. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER bumped with LADY MYSTIFY at the start, dueled
inside BECCA TAYLOR to the three-eighths pole, chased two wide leaving the bend and tired.
