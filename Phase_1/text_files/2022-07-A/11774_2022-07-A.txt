Footnotes
BUTTERED NOODLES bumped at the start, was never back, advanced inside on the turn, shifted out, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up
late and won going away. BAD BEAT got away well, vied two across, inched clear near the sixteenth pole, was outclosed and vanned off. AVALON KING
broke in the air and bumped at the start, trailed the field, put in a steady effort and was along for show. AWHITESPORTSCOAT vied inside, faltered near the
sixteenth pole and dropped back. PROVOST settled off the pace, lacked a stretch response and dropped back. Hand timed.
