Footnotes
FOREIGN PROTOCOL stalked the pace to the turn, advanced nearing the quarter pole, overtook HIT THE SEAM in upper stretch and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. HIT THE SEAM was hustled leaving the start and sped to the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper
stretch and gave way in the final stages, while holding safely in the end for the place. WHOA BUDDY chased the solid pace from the inside, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and was outkicked in the drive, while clear of the rest for third. THEYREMINISCEOVERU stumbled at the start, recovered and was forwardly
placed to the turn, gained ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
TOMMY SPECIAL was slow into early stride and lacked speed to the turn, lost contact nearing the top of the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EVENEREVENWORSE tracked the early pace to the turn, overtook SIERRA MELODY along the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and was kept to
task in the end to prevail. SIERRA MELODY broke alertly and took a narrow early lead through the opening stages, was overtaken by the winner along the
turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages but earned the nod for second in the final jumps. SATANTA chased the early pace,
improved position while two wide nearing the quarter pole, was outfinished in the drive and was just edged out for the place. EMERALD MAGIC broke with
the field, lost action nearing the half-mile marker, was pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MIA SOLINA took back off of the early pace, was roused on the turn and made a three wide bid into the drive, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch and
responded to firm urging in deep stretch to edge away in the end. HALF HOPING stumbled at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn,
came three then four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung widest into the drive, mounted a good late rally, was unable to reel in the winner in the end but
was best of the rest. AMBA chased the early speed from the inside, lacked room along the turn while gaining ground, was able to find racing room in upper
stretch and made an inside bid nearing the furlong marker but was outfinished in the final furlong, while clear of the rest for third. AFTER SUNDOWN broke
alertly and was forwardly placed early on, tracked the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. I'M SO
ADORABLE was hustled leaving the break, set the early pace to the turn, carved out moderate fractions approaching the quarter pole, was caught in upper
stretch and faded in the final furlong. FOGGY BOTTOM was a bit slow into early stride, lacked speed through the turn, came four wide nearing the quarter
marker and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SWIFT NONNI broke out at the start, was asked to show early speed and was close to the pace into the turn, engaged with the dueling pacesetters and vied
for the lead with that pair nearing the quarter pole, continued to duel in upper stretch with STOIC LUNA and kept to task in the final furlong to inch away in
the end. STOIC LUNA broke in at the start then was hustled to be forwardly placed, dueled for the early lead to the turn, was engaged by SWIFT NONNI
approaching the quarter pole to vie between horses, dueled with that foe into upper stretch, could not match strides in the final stages and was outfinished,
while holding for second. TURA LURA settled just off of the early pace, gained ground from a four wide path on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but
closed well in the final furlong to secure the show. BLUE WILDCAT was sent leaving the break and dueled for pace duties into the turn, vied for the lead
while head and head with two other foes nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DR WYSONG chased the
early pace from the rear, ran evenly while trailing through the turn and could not muster a late rally.

Footnotes
BANDEENA settled off of the early pace, gained ground along the backstretch run, went four wide on the far turn while chasing BOLD ARTICLE, gained
ground on that rival in upper stretch and closed determinedly in the final stages to prevail. BOLD ARTICLE settled off of the early pace while saving ground,
made a middle move to overtake MORNING ADDICTION nearing the half-mile pole, raced to a clear lead nearing the quarter pole, came under pressure in
mid-stretch and was overtaken by the winner inside of the furlong marker while besting the rest. MORNING ADDICTION showed good early speed after
breaking alertly, became erratic nearing the half-mile marker and was firmly urged on by the rider to continue, kept on while well behind through the far turn
and re-rallied in the stretch to be clear for third. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR stalked the pace early on, vied for the lead approaching the half-mile marker, lost
ground while three wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive. DANGEROUS ILLUSION was shuffled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled
off of the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, lost ground while five wide on the far turn
and weakened in the final stages.

STRAUS'S PLACE traded bumps with SUBITO SLEW leaving the break and was off slowly, settled three wide off of the early pace, improved position on
the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid into the drive, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch and drove clear in the final stages. SUBITO SLEW
was bumped and shuffled leaving the break and was away slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, rallied three wide on the far turn, closed well
in the drive, could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. CANDYBOX broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions
through the backstretch run and into the far turn, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch and could not hold off that bid but stayed on in the late
stages to be clear for the show. SLIGHT APPROVAL broke out at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, came two wide to the
quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch but could not sustain that bid and flattened out in the final sixteenth. FRISCO KID broke in at the start, came
four then five wide into the first turn while just off of the pace, ran evenly to the half-mile marker, maintained position while four wide on the second turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally. OMMANEY BAY showed early speed and stalked the pace on the first turn, maintained position
through the backstretch run and into the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. LAGO DI BRACIANO stumbled at the start,
raced in the second flight while four wide into the backstretch run, lost position nearing the second turn, stopped in the stretch run, was eased through the
final stages and walked off under his own power. PLAYER OPTION was forwardly placed early on, shifted to the rail leaving the first turn, lost ground
nearing the half-mile marker, stopped along the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.
