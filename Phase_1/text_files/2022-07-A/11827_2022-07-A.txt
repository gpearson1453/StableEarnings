void of early speed, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position. TOP ROCKET raced in the back, offered a mild bid inside and had
nothing left. UNCLE FLOYD vied between horses early, dropped back and faded. Hand timed.

ROUGE SUNSET rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out, closed willingly, dueled late and proved best. BRON AND THE BROW bumped at the start,
vied inside to the turn, drew clear, responded when challenged to duel late and was outfinished in a game effort. GONE SOMEWHERE bumped at the start,
was unhurried early, bid inside leaving the turn, had little left and settled for show. RANCHER raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked
the needed late response. SOLEROCKER vied three across to the turn, fell back and weakened. BEAR BRIAN was not a factor. ILLUMINATE D STORM
stumbled at the start, vied between horses to the turn, stopped and was not urged late. Hand timed.

RACE HOME was unhurried early, rallied between horses, assumed command and drew off on the turn and extended the lead while ridden out. RAIL
HUGGER bobbled at the start, raced close to the pace, bid willingly, had little left and finished second best. WE'RE JUST SAYIN passed a tiring rival.
OSTINI sprinted clear to set the pace, tired on the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LILA'S LUCKY LADY saved ground while close to the pace, bid inside on the turn to challenge, dueled for the lead, drifted late and proved best. TIZ
TOFFEE pressed the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. MOUNTAIN PASS was
steadied at the start, was taken outside, raced wide, found her best stride late and got up late for show. TOTHEMOONANDBACK set a pressured pace,
bore out leaving the turn, weakened late and was caught for third. RUN FOR BELLE was never far off the pace, bid and came up empty. TWIRLY GIRL was
outrun in an even effort. BIGGER THAN YOU pressed the pace two wide to the turn, stopped, was eased and walked off. Hand timed.
