Footnotes
PEACEFUL VISION within striking distance along the inside, moved a bit closer late in the turn, in tight, squeezed through just inside the furlong marker,
edged clear under firm handling. FOR REAL ALICE forwardly placed off the rail, three wide into the lane, challenged on the outside of the first flight inside
the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner late, drew clear for the place. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY broke sharp, showed the way out of the
chute toward the inside, continued to set the pace through the turn, kept the winner pinned along the rail nearing midstretch, allowed that rival the inside
past midstretch, weakened from between that rival and the runner up late. GILDED APPLE lacked speed toward the rail, asked along in the two path turning
for home, finished up evenly in lacking the needed response. CAJUN SHOTS broke back, raced four wide through the turn, also failed to muster a rally
through the lane. AMERICAN REBEL last to leave, moved up to race in mid pack early, had little left late.

GREELEY WENT WEST allowed the pace to go early, continued to stalk the dueling leaders up the backstretch, challenged three wide turning for home,
drew well clear then finished up in hand to win ridden out. INCA WARRIOR broke in the air, raced back in trailing for over a half, came four wide for the
drive, rallied down the middle of the course to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. HERE COMES MAGIC away in good order, vied up front
between rivals for just under a half, dueled into and through the final turn, proved no match for the winner when that one challenged nearing the furlong
marker, nipped late for the place. CITADEL vied up front three wide early, dueled into the far turn, between rivals into the lane, gradually weakened through
the lane. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN with the early pace along the inside, stopped in the drive.

RUNAWAY TRACY away in good order, stalked the leaders into the turn off the inside, three wide bid entering the stretch, kicked clear late under steady
handling. GIMMEASOUND broke sharp, dueled up front closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner
to the wire, proved determined to save the place late in game fashion. EASY TO MISS behind the pace along the inside, continued behind traffic into the
stretch just off the inside, dropped to the rail when straightened for home, inside bid for the place late, outfinished. SHANGHAI RONNIE one paced off the
inside, came three wide for the drive, roused, displayed some mild interest to be closing the gap on the top three late. ROCKDALE last to leave, trailed most
of the way, picked off a singular tiring rival while not a serious threat. PAPA BRO dueled up front in the two path, gave way from between the top two into
the stretch.

OAK HILL LG with the pace from the start, pressed the issue in the run up the backstretch between rivals, shook clear turning for home, held the runner up
safe late under steady handling. IDE LIKE HAWAII settled off the pace inside, covered up along the rail into the turn, between rivals entering the stretch, set
down, closed the gap on the winner late, clear of the others. HOPE FOR CHANGE pressed the issue up the backstretch outside, vied three wide and
between foes turn, fell back into the lane, came again for the show, not a threat to the top pair at the end. K T'S JILTED GROOM in the second flight off the
inside,moved closer four wide into the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. GOTTATAKEHIMTO
back off the early pace well out in the strip, moved closer five wide into the turn, remained within striking distanced exiting the turn, had little left late.
CLEVER PRINCE broke back and failed to menace. MAGNOLIA RIDGE narrowly set the pace for a half closest to the inside, gave way in the drive.

FLASHBACK WIND off the early pace and the inside, dropped to the rail before a half, tracked the leaders through the second turn while continuing to save
ground, challenged up the rail and inside the leader nearing midstretch, dueled to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. MO CREDO bobbled at the
start, quickly righted to show the way into the first turn, clear before a quarter, maintained a daylight advantage up the backstretch, allowed the winner the
inside nearing midstretch, dueled to the wire outside that one, stubbornly. RUN ON ACES last away, lacked speed, shaken up in the three path entering the
straight, finished up willingly to be getting to the top two late. MONITOR MILLS lunged prestart, broke sharp, chased the runner up off the inside, three wide
into the lane, weakened through the lane. JIMMIE'S HALO lacked speed, failed to muster a rally when called on. JAYS HOLIDAY fell back to trail after the
start, showed little.

Footnotes
FLASHBURN broke alertly, well clear out of the chute, continued to hold a comfortable advantage into and through the turn, stayed clear through the lane
while being kept to task. TIN DELAY lacked early foot, moved a bit closer along the inside far turn, angled out three wide into the stretch, finished willingly to
be clearly second best, no real threat to the winner. DOCTRINAIRE off the early pace outside, improved in the three path stretch, chased the winner upper
stretch, proved no match for that one or the runner up late, narrowly preserved the show. CALLTHEWOLFE closest to the winner up the backstretch and
turn inside, had little left for the stretch run, outfinished for the show spot. THE BIG IRISHMAN last away, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of
faltering rivals well after the issue had been decided. CARRIES MAN in the second flight early, gave way. COACH HUDSON stopped after a half, jogged in
far back.

Footnotes
AKIANE'S SOLDIER last away, outrun in the early going off the inside, steered out and was five wide into the straight, steered out a bit wider for the run to
the wire, finished with good resolve to be up in time. BUCKLEY BUNNY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, second flight while saving ground
turn, continued inside for the drive and displayed good mettle late to earn the place, not enough for the win. GATOR PROUD void of speed for over three
furlongs, three path into the lane, made a late run through traffic to be going well at the end. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN set or forced the pace just off the inside,
two path upper stretch, drifting in a bit to put a stalled HUSHED COURT ROOM in tight with just over a sixteenth to run, nipped for the show late. FLASHY
MEG broke best of all, dueled up front off the inside, three wide for the drive, lacked the necessary closing punch. GIGABLAST forwardly placed outside,
four wide turning for home, fell back a bit nearing midstretch stretch then finished up evenly. HUSHED COURT ROOM within striking distance between
horses, continued in traffic into the straight, in a bit tight when going one paced with less than a furlong remaining, steadied, weakened. RACE WAS HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

GRAND PRODUCTION pressed early leader from outside, dueled turn closest to the rail, shook off that foe when straightened for home, held the runner up
safe late. BIG TIME BANDIT back off the pace toward the inside, moved a bit closer late in the turn, three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late
while well clear of the others. CHELSEA'S GLORY fell back along the inside soon after the start, steered out three wide when roused turning for home, well
clear of the others, no threat to the top two. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY broke back, lacked speed, came four wide into the stretch, improved a bit without posing
a serious threat. ISLE CALL U LATER broke sharp, fell back behind the top two into the turn, tired through the stretch. BIG RUSSSS forwardly placed up the
backstretch, dueled in the two path outside the winner through the turn, gave way entering the stretch, continued to fade in the run to the wire. HIGH
COCKALORUM off slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun.
