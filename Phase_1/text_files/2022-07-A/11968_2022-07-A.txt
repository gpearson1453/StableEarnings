Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three path on the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, continued to gain from
the three or four path and was up in time. PRICE TALK chased from the three path into the far turn, bid four wide in late turn, led into the lane, cleared with
an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. BLUE SKY KOWBOY was void of speed while in the two path, moved through the three to the five path
on the turn, swung into the lane from the five path and steadily gained to the wire. LEADING THE CHARGE tracked the pace while along the inside, waited
on the turn to get the inside, waited again entering the lane when leader dropped to rail, tipped into the two path and looked a serious threat with an eighth
to go then flattened after the sixteenth pole. BETWITHBOTHHANDS vied for the lead along the inside, gained the lead into the far turn, continued with a
short lead through the turn and into the lane when dropping to the rail then weakened. BAYOU CAT pressed the pace along the inside early, continued to
chase the pace into the far turn and was done. REGULAR GUY vied for the lead two wide into the far turn, continued close up through late turn then was
empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
METALLIC MAN vied for the lead two wide into the turn, shook clear into the lane then held while being kept to the task. GO RODNEY was in the two path
through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three path and just got up for the place spot. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE vied with the winner
through the turn while two wide, lost contact with that one into the lane, stayed on to chase the top one through the final eighth, could not gain on that one
and lost the place spot on the final stride. WHAT NOW DARRELL was in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path
and finished evenly. EVEN MONEY was along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. JUST PHIL raced in the two path through the turn when
trailing, straightened in the lane from the six path and never was a menace. CAPTAIN HARVEY stumbled badly on the second stride and lost his rider,
continued behind the field while rider less and was caught and walked off after being caught after the finish line. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START
OF THE RACE FOR NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
SOLID COUNTRY GOLD was bumped at the start, raced along the inside through the first turn, advanced from the three path on the far turn, came into the
lane with momentum with aim on the leader, caught that one soon after the eighth pole and drove clear. SMARTY ALEX was in the two path through the far
turn, gained energy after entering the lane from the four path, gained through the final eighth and finished clear for the place spot. BOONE'S SPIRIT broke
to the outside and trailed early, gained momentum through the far turn while advancing along the vacated rail, cut the corner and gained the lead once
straightened, maintained the lead with an eighth to go then weakened. TROPICAL TORNADO was off to a clear advantage into the backstretch, raced
under restraint while still clear, was still on top through mid-turn then gave way entering the lane. BRENTSPENCE chased the pace into the far turn, was in
the four path in mid-turn then faded entering the lane. SPRING CHANNEL was along the inside into the far turn and was done in mid-turn. SAINT
COMMISSAIRE stalked the early pace while in the three path into the backstretch, began losing ground in mid-backstretch and was done soon after.
CANDELIVER bobbled outward at the start, raced in contention into the backstretch and steadily lost ground.

BROADWAY BLAZE led inside in the two path and held sway under steady urging. IZZY EM pressed early in the four path, settled inside, bid at the
three-eighths pole, pressed and couldn't get to the winner. SASSY SAGEY pressed in the four path, then was no match in the stretch while drifting out.
ADMIRAL'S GARNET pressed the early pace in the three path, was checked at the three-eighths pole, then lacked a closing bid. QUEEN IN THE NORTH
stalked the pace in the five path with no late bid. I'M NO BALLERINA raced evenly. RUN AWAY FEVER raced in the three path and passed tired rivals.
SILENCING stalked the pace in the five path and faded in the stretch. INCENTIVIZED (GB) saved ground to no avail.
