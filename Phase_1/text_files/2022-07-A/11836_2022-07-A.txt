Footnotes
PRINCESS LENNY chased the early pace, moved to the lead entering the turn, was joined by the runner-up into the late turn, cleared outside the eighth
pole then held while being kept to the task while remaining clear. EXPRESS LADY chased the pace from the four to the three path through the turn, bid into
the lane, appeared a threat outside the eighth pole then could not gain further while clearly second best. SISTER JUSTICE tracked the pace while saving
ground through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing kick. WICKED JUSTICE was near the rail through the turn while trailing through the turn,
came into the lane from the four path and moved up while not a threat. SHES MY TREASURE was in the three path through the turn and into the lane when
in mid-pack then weakened. KATIECAN'TKEEPUP never a factor while in the three path through the turn. MUDDY BOOTS saved ground through the turn
and then faded. STORMY'S HERO set the early pace, continued to chase through mid-turn then retreated along the rail.

Footnotes
KENDAL GRACE vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared into the far turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane, was asked a couple of times once
straightened in the lane and widened to the wire while wrapped up late. KEEN LADY was unhurried while racing in the two path through the turns, bid into
the lane from the two path, was no match for the winner while finishing clear for the place spot. BAYOU WIND chased the pace into the turn, was three wide
through mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path to get closest to the winner, could not gain further and just lasted for the show spot. SAKONNA
trailed for half while off the inside, raced in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and gained belatedly. TROUBLE
MAKING was in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. DOMITIA LUCILLA was never a
threat while saving ground. MS MERRABEL vied for the early lead while near the inside, chased the winner into the far turn then was empty through the
lane. LADYBELUCKY was along the inside into the far turn then and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
NIGHT LIVIN broke with several others and raced between into the turn, cleared through mid-turn while in the two path, continued in the two path into the
lane, was challenged near the eighth pole from the inside, repulsed that bid, cleared and stayed on late. PASSIONFORJUSTICE vied for the early lead
while along the inside, settled back to chase the winner through mid-turn, was shuffled back when others raced wide, came into the lane from near the rail,
shifted off the inside approaching the eighth pole then was gaining to the end. DULCE VICTORIA raced five wide into the turn when never far back, shied
from rival near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on while still in the five path, came into the lane from well off the rail and moved up from the five or six
path late. IMAGINE THE MOON settled off the pace while near the inside, quickly bid into the lane from the two path, moved to near the winner from along
the inside with an eighth to go then could not sustain the effort. HECTORS TROJANWIFE chased the pace from the three while between rivals through the
turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path then weakened. TWIRLING JUSTICE raced four wide through the turn and into the lane when never far
back then weakened. GLORIOUS JUSTICE was bothered and checked to the back spotting the field some four or five lengths, stayed interested into the
lane from the two path and was gaining through the lane. LASER SPEED never a factor while along the inside. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE was outrun while in
the two or three path. RHYTHM FOREVER was never a factor while in the three path.

Footnotes
LOADEMUPJUSTICE trailed for half while off the inside, bid four wide through late turn, came into the lane from the four then the three path, stepped in a bit
to brush with tiring rival then gained the lead and cleared. GRAND IN BAY was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through mid-turn when
appearing to be a serious contender, came into the lane from the five path losing some ground then came again to be gaining late. CIELO BLU tracked the
pace while along the inside through the far turn, shifted off the inside into the lane and moved up while turning in a perfect trip. NATES HEARTTHROB set
the pace into the lane, lost the lead outside the eighth pole then yielded to the others. BOOK OF ROMEO was moving three wide into the turn then steadied,
continued three wide through late turn to appear a menace then weakened inside the eighth pole. MEMORY IN MOTION was in the two path through the
turns when well back, came into the lane from the five or six path and never was a threat. ME AND CHILI chased the pace from the three path through the
turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead between calls, was brushed by the winner just outside the eighth pole then tired. RAPA NUI was not a factor while
saving ground through the far turn. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then lacked a closing response. GO RODNEY
chased the pace from the three or four path and was done on the far turn. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN DID NOT RESULT IN A
CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
SKIPPINJUSTICE was unrushed early between foes, bid on the far turn in the three path, rallied late four wide and was clear under steady urging. BOTOX
KATIE raced in the five path throughout, bid at the quarter pole, led at the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner. I MATTER saved ground, went three
wide at the quarter pole around traffic but couldn't close late inside. SIGNATURE STREET pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the quarter pole,
then couldn't hold off the closers. SAHARA PRINCESS saved ground to no avail. QUITE WHIMSICAL raced in the four path, then faded in the stretch.
SHOTGUN KATIE was clear early, then couldn't last. BEYOND JUSTICE stalked the pace inside but faded on the turn. CONTAGIOUS GIGGLE was not a
factor.

Footnotes
MINER'S QUEEN pressed the pace inside, three wide at the quarter pole and was up in time under steady urging. NEON SUMMER was clear early
between foes, then was caught. GIFT WRAPPED saved ground to no avail, bid at the quarter pole but had no late gain. TAKE THE BACKROADS was six
wide at the quarter pole and closed late. NAY SAY (IRE) went seven wide at the quarter pole and had a mild late bid. AWESOMELY SHY stalked the pace
in the three path but had no closing bid. IRON LADY AWAY pressed the pace in the four path, bore out slightly at the quarter pole, then faded. NINJA
KITTEN was not a factor.
