Footnotes
SOUTHEAST ASIA was off a step slowly, recovered and tracked the modest early pace, was roused from a four wide path nearing the quarter marker, vied
for the lead nearing the eighth pole, was kept to task under firm handling and proved best in the end. GOVERNOR ARTHUR was forwardly placed into the
first turn, attended to the pace through the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, made contact with KALINE in deep stretch and was outfinished in
the final sixteenth, while just holding for second over an oncoming rival. ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried, saved ground through the backstretch run, mounted a
three wide rally into the drive and just missed for second in the end, while just securing the show. SUGAR BEETS settled off of the early pace, came five
wide into the backstretch run, maintained that five wide path into the far turn, gained ground in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final stages and just
missed for the minor awards. KALINE was hustled leaving the break and cleared the field into the first turn, set pedestrian fractions while prompted by
GOVERNOR ARTHUR into the second turn, was overtaken inside of the eighth pole, drifted out in deep stretch and weakened in the final stages.
TWIRLING DERBY stalked the early pace from an inside position, ran evenly through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and did not mount
a late rally.

Footnotes
OUR EXPECTATION chased the early pace to the turn, was roused to go five wide into the drive, came within aim in upper stretch, drifted in inside of the
furlong marker and carried in MINOSO in that action, straightened in the final sixteenth and drew clear in the late stages. MINOSO showed early speed and
contested the pace to the turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, was confronted by OUR EXPECTATION nearing the furlong marker, was
carried in by that rival inside of the final furlong and was outkicked in the end, while besting the rest. UNPOSSIBLE was asked to show early speed and vied
for the early lead to the turn, was between rivals while disputing the pace approaching the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the
final stages. POTENTE ALBA stumbled slightly leaving the break, was sent to vie for the early lead, dueled for the lead to the quarter pole, lost a bit of
ground in upper stretch, steadied off of heels in deep stretch and weakened in the late going. KING EDDIE chased the pace from the rear to the turn,
improved position nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and was not a factor. BERNIE'S BIG BOY was close to the early pace, lost
ground on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT OUR
EXPECTATION IMPEDED MINOSO AND POTENTE ALBA IN THE FINAL FURLONG AND AS A RESULT, OUR EXPECTATION WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH.

SMILING LADY tracked the pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, overtook the runner-up nearing the eighth pole and drew
clear in the final stages. BET DE VRON broke alertly and showed good early speed while contesting the pace, was confronted by SMILING LADY nearing
the quarter marker, battled against that one to the furlong grounds but was outfinished in the end, while besting the rest. JERSEY STAR chased the pace,
ran evenly through the turn, angled out at the head of the lane and was outkicked in the drive, while getting up in time to secure third. GENTLE JULIA was
hustled to be prominent in the early stages, contested the pace through the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and weakened in the late going.
SUE GENEROUS hit the gate and broke in at the start, chased the pace, came three wide through the turn and was not a factor. PANDEMIC GIRL was
away slowly, lacked early speed, was steered outside of rivals on the turn to go four wide into the stretch run and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHEZARUNAWAY was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the backstretch run, angled out leaving the quarter marker and mounted a four
wide bid into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole and drew away in the late stages. LOTSABLING was forwardly placed to the first turn then
took back off of the pace, settled through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn, vied for the lead approaching mid-stretch and could
not match strides with the winner in the end but was best of the rest. MOMMA MOCCA tracked the solid pace, advanced along the backstretch run, ran in
pursuit of PROOF OF JAZZ into the second turn, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages while holding safely for third. PROOF
OF JAZZ broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch run and into the second turn, was confronted in upper
stretch and weakened in the drive. DISTORTED QUEEN bobbled a bit at the start and was hustled to forwardly placed into the first turn, was close to the
pace through the backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn and came up empty in the drive. CARASYNTHIA stalked the early pace, lost
position along the backstretch run, stopped along the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
DICK BEST tracked the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch, closed in deep stretch when MACHO
CHROME ducked in and was up in time to secure the win. MY LITTLE TAYLOR broke out at the start and crowded SHE THINKS IM CUTE, chased the
pace from midpack, advanced four wide on the turn, rallied in the drive and missed for the win in the end while getting up in time for the place. MACHO
CHROME was asked to show early speed and was sent to the front, set solid fractions through the turn while opening a clear lead, drew off in upper stretch,
was green and erratic in deep stretch while reacting to firm urging, ducked in sharply inside of the sixteenth-marker and was overtaken while saving third.
THE CALABRESE KID chased the early pace, came two wide through the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but showed good late interest while unable to
impact the top three. SHANGHAI WILD CAT raced in midpack early on while just off of the pace, lost ground on the turn and could not muster a late rally.
SHE THINKS IM CUTE was crowded at the start, was close to the pace to the turn, gave ground to MACHO CHROME nearing the quarter marker, was
outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a late response. SIERRA SNOW STORM chased the pace from the second flight, lost ground while four deep on the
turn and did not offer a late bid. ROYAL HEART was away slowly, chased the early pace, drifted out midway through the turn and came six wide to the
quarter marker, lacked a late rally and was not a threat.

Footnotes
TROPICANA GIRL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn and extended the lead nearing the quarter marker,
was confronted by LIGHT UP in upper stretch, dueled with that rival, came back on when LIGHT UP edged to narrow lead and determinedly dug in to
prevail in the end. LIGHT UP settled just off of the early pace, gained ground on the turn, tipped out at the head of the stretch, confronted TROPICANA
GIRL nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that rival, got a head in front inside of the sixteenth-marker but was denied for the win and was gamely bested
while well clear of the rest for the place. SHOUT IT OUT chased the early pace, came five wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch
but kept on to be clear for third. BREAKFAST BALL tracked the pace to the turn, ran evenly to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and
weakened in the final stages. ENGEE OMBEE broke a half-step slowly but recovered nicely and showed early speed while tracking the pace to the turn,
came three wide between foes along the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. BANDON BRIDGE chased the early pace, steadied
in tight nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COOL MOUNTAIN LAD settled just off of the early speed, lost ground on the turn, mounted a two wide bid into the drive, overtook CAROLINA MIA inside of
the eighth pole and determinedly prevailed over the quickly oncoming runner-up. ULTIMATE BANGO traded bumps with OUR BOLD PRINCE leaving the
start, chased the pace to the turn, gained ground while four wide midway through the turn, was impeded and carried out by the loose horse nearing the top
of the stretch, recovered and made a bold late rally in the drive and just missed for the win while besting the rest in a game effort. CAROLINA MIA tracked
the early pace while avoiding the loose horse nearing the half-mile marker, lost ground on the turn, took command into the drive when WAR GAMES was
impeded, was overtaken by the winner inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked in the final stages, while holding safely for third. OUR BOLD PRINCE
exchanged bumps with ULTIMATE BANGO leaving the break and was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position while five wide
nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to the stretch run and lacked the needed late response. DARNQUICK was forwardly placed in the early going, gave
ground to WAR GAMES nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. WAR GAMES broke alertly and sped to the early
lead, set quick fractions and was clear nearing the quarter marker, was impeded by the loose horse nearing the top of the stretch and could not muster a
late response. HOWBEIT stumbled sharply at the start, lost the rider and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START INVOLVING HOWBEIT AND RULED THAT RUNNER CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE BREAK AND THAT THERE WOULD BE
NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH. PER RULING #17 FROM THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD, ULTIMATE BANGO WAS
DISQUALIFIED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
SHEZAGHOST broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was engaged by RUN FOR MY HONEY on the first turn and was prompted by that rival through
the backstretch run and into the far turn, shook free from that foe in upper stretch, was never able to gain a clear lead in the drive but held sway in the end
under steady urging. SACRED BEAUTY was forwardly placed early on, came four wide entering the backstretch run, lost ground along the backstretch run
and into the second turn, swung widest into the drive and rallied in mid-stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but held safely as second best.
RUN FOR MY HONEY engaged SHEZAGHOST on the first turn and prompted the solid pace by that rival through the backstretch run and into the far turn,
lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while just holding for third in the end. PREMIUMONSATURDAY was allowed to settle,
improved position on the backstretch run, rallied in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and just missed for the show. SPARKA (IRE) settled just
off of the pace while running in midpack, saved all of the ground to the second turn, gained in upper stretch but could not sustain that run in the late stages
and lacked a final response. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was shuffled back while in tight entering the first turn, settled off of the pace through the backstretch
run, came three wide on the second turn and was not a late threat. HOLY ZAGS was shuffled leaving the break and was away slowly, went four wide into
the first turn while lacking early speed, trailed through the backstretch run, was steered to go four then two wide nearing the top of the lane and could not
muster a late bid.

Footnotes
CYCLONE SLEW raced in midpack while five wide on the first turn, ran evenly through the backstretch run, loomed five wide on the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, made a late surge and overtook the runner-up inside of the sixteenth-marker and edged away in the end. ROSEBUD RYDE showed early
speed and stalked the early pace on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, overtook STORMY SIERRA midway through the second
turn, pulled away to a clear lead in mid-stretch, was overtaken by CYCLONE SLEW inside of the final sixteenth and held safely for place. CHELINA lacked
early speed and settled at the rear early on, trailed through the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, rallied in upper stretch and could not reel in
the top pair in the final sixteenth but was well clear of the rest for third. DARK INTENT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was content to settle in
the early going, improved position on the backstretch run, was roused on the far turn and mounted a four wide rally into the drive, swung widest into the
stretch run, was no match for the top three in the final stages and passed tiring rivals in the end. EASTER GRACE was allowed to settle in the early stages,
was unhurried through the backstretch run, came three wide nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals in the stretch run. STORMY SIERRA broke
alertly and was sent to the early lead, set reasonable fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, was collared by ROSEBUD RYDE nearing
the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run. COUSIN NIECEY was hustled leaving the break and was forwardly placed to the first turn, was rank and hard
to place entering the backstretch run, maintained position to the half-mile pole, lost position on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch run. KID
DEELITES bobbled at the start and hit the gate leaving the break, raced three wide in the second flight on the first turn, improved position along the
backstretch, lost position on the second turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power. ACTION FOR
AUTISM was off a step slowly, recovered and raced midpack to the first turn, dropped back on the backstretch run, lost action leaving the half-mile marker,
was pulled up entering the far turn and was vanned off.
