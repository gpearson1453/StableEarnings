Footnotes
CHESTER SLEW allowed to settle early, swung out four wide at the head of the lane, lugged in early stretch gaining a nearing advantage over MEAN
STREAK, and held under a drive. MEAN STREAK hurried three to four wide into the opening turn, led the field through the backstretch, responded to
challenge from CITY WOLF'S GUY, was overtaken at the head of the stretch, kept on under urging inside but was unable to regain the control late. WIDE
EYED WILEY reserved off the early pacesetters, took closer order in the far turn, and lacked the closing response needed. REMAIN CALM trailed the field
leaving the backstretch, raced wide leaving the final turn, and bid belatedly. AMIGO QUERIDO offered little. CITY WOLF'S GUY pressed the early pace
from the three path, was unable to move on with rival and gave way.

Footnotes
TRICKY SPEEDSTER settled near the back of the pack, angled out to the four path at the head of the stretch, dug in at the sixteenth marker and got by.
TAKE NO PRISONERS attended the pace while three to four wide, gained short advantage into the lane, and was caught late. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR
stalked while four to vide wide, dropped back leaving the backstretch, and closed gradually outside to get up late for show. ESTIFRAAD contested the pace
from the rail, and gave way grudgingly inside in the final yards. AMEER broke slow then was rank in the early stages, and failed to threaten in the stretch.
SOMETHIN HAPPENIN attended the pace under a snug hold between rivals, was set down at the quarter pole, and came up empty in the drive. GOLD'S
UP outrun throughout.

Footnotes
THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI sat in striking position, was given her cue nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and was kept under
steady handling. QUEEN RHONDA trailed the field early, chased through the final turn from rail, shifted out to the three path then bid steadily outside and
improved position late. CAPA BELLA vied inside early, chased through the far turn, angled out and was outkicked for place honors. MOON AMOUR sent for
speed then showed the way through the backstretch, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and yielded. CORDILLERA lacked serious bid. SUGAR
MOON sat in range early, and failed to menace. JODEAN settled four wide early, and failed to threaten in drive.

Footnotes
ADDYDIDIT led the field into the backstretch under a snug hold, took pressure inside of LILBITSPICY, then turned back challenge from LA PALINA at the
head of the stretch, and held under a drive. LILBITSPICY bumped while three to four wide into the opening turn, prompted the pace outside of ADDYDIDIT,
was roused at the head of the lane, kept under determinedly outside, dug in late to secure place honors. LA PALINA sat in range from the three path, waited
inside on the far turn, was roused when opening appeared along the rail, moved up menacingly but was unable to stall the winner and was edged out late.
FAVORITE trailed leaving the backstretch, and closed well late. MIDNIGHT TAKE chased inside, and improved position in stretch. SASSY BUT CLASSY
bumped LILBITSPICY in the first turn, stalked four wide, and lacked a closing response. LITTLE HARPER loaded without the rider, and lacked a bid.
SECRET HAVEN chased four to five wide early, and stopped.

SASSY CINDERELLA broke sharply then sat in striking distance, drove three wide sweeping the lead, and pulled away. STUBBORN LOVE saved ground
inside, chased nearing the quarter pole, wore down SKYWARD BOUND but was no match for the winner in the stretch. SHAKINOFFTHERUST was under a
strong hold leaving the chute, settled inside, lodged a rail bid and was along in time for show. SKYWARD BOUND sprinted clear at once under a strong
hold, saw margins diminish leaving the backstretch, and weakened in stretch. KEEPMEINPOWER closed gap late. DYLAN'S SAVE chased three to four
wide and tired.

Footnotes
SILVERFOOT chased inside, gained closer order in the far turn, angled out sharply at the head of the stretch, wore down rival and edged clear.
INCREDIBLE HARLEY clipped heels with TOLUI in the early stages, shifted out to the two path, struck the front approaching the stretch, and weakened in
the final yards. LAST OF WAR stalked three wide, chased hard on the final turn, and lacked the kick needed. AMUSING WAY sat outside while mid pack,
fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and flattened out through stretch. VIRTUAL SILVER steadied approaching the backstretch, trailed the field and
lodged a mild bid. TOLUI showed the way leaving the chute, angled in clipping heels with INCREDIBLE HARLEY, was under attack at the head of the lane
and gave way. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH steadied on the backside in traffic then shifted outside, and was done early. HANDSOME HENRY stalked four
wide, and faded steadily. *JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of INCREDIBLE HARLEY alleging interference late stretch was not
allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
EXHI KID allowed to settle inside, was set down at the head of the lane then angled out to the three path, and run down rival deep stretch. CHARMING
VINTAGE settled outside while in range, fanned three wide in the far turn, went in pursuit of the leader, gained the lead and was caught late. LITTLE
CHICAGO raced wide on the final turn, drifted in under right handed encouragement, closed late and missed. STRONG AND FREE advanced quickly
through the far turn, circled into the lane, and rallied belatedly. BRADYDABOSS chased inside and lodged a late bid. FAST EH fractious in gate, set the
pace from just off the rail, held a short lead through the final turn, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and yielded. CAPITAL CALL chased outside,
launched a bid at the quarter pole and came up empty for the drive. FIRST BASE sat just off the early pace, and faded steadily. HUNGARIAN JOE stalked
the pace from the four path, and tired early.
