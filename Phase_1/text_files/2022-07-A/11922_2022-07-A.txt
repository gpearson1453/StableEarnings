Footnotes
SWEET PEARL settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained down the center of the track, took over nearing
the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. RAIN stalked the pace in the three path, bid nearing the quarter pole, inched closer to the pacesetter through the lane,
reached near even terms between foes nearing the sixteenth pole and was second best late. REAL DOOZIE set a clear pace well off the rail, continued to
lead in the two and three paths around the turn, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. LOVIN LIVIN failed to menace while racing four wide.
SHADILEE played no factor while racing two wide. CELESTIAL CHEETAH chased the pace inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole and came up
empty in the lane. TEN PIN ALLY was outrun while racing two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTIONS

Footnotes
PORK CHOP tracked the pace outside, swept to the front nearing the turn, drew clear in the two path leaving the three-eighths pole and held clear under a
drive. DAKOTA BOY was off slowly, advanced inside under a hard hold down the backstretch, angled four wide nearing the three-eighths pole, advanced
four wide around the turn and was clearly second best in the lane. CAMPTOWN RACES pressed the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner
around the turn but churned on to hold the show. GHOST FIGHTER had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace outside, steadily angled in around
the turn and finished evenly inside. MILLENNIUM CONDO chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. VOICE OF NOW set the pace along the rail
and was through after a half. REGIO was outrun while racing two wide.

ORIENTAL PARK settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command leaving the quarter pole, drove clear in upper stretch
and held firm. AWKWARD PAUSE lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and rallied through the lane. SIXTY ONE raced well back in the two
path, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. WHISKEYONHISLIPS was very reluctant to load, trailed in the three path, swung widest in
upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. LORD DARNLEY saved ground and failed to menace. LIL ANNIE ROSE chased the pace three wide and lacked a
closing bid. ETERNAL REST chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. GEOSCIENCE set a pressured pace inside and tired in the lane.
CALCULATED BREEZE pressed the pace two wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
PICKING UP PENNIES set the pace in the two path, drew well clear in upper stretch, drifted out throughout the stretch and held clear under right-handed
urging. HERCULES prompted the winner three wide, ducked out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under right-handed urging and
was clearly second best. THE SKIPPER TOO raced off the pace outside, entered the turn four wide, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole and bested
the rest. BATTER UP BUD had only brief speed two wide. IF NOT FOR LUCK prompted the pace four wide and retreated after five furlongs. SKIPPERINI
played no factor while racing three wide. POSITIVELY AWESOME was up close inside and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, drifted four wide into the lane, forged ahead nearing the eighth
pole and held firm under a drive. MERLIN settled off the early pace while racing three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and was slowly
gaining on the winner in the final furlong. CASHIER CHECK soundly bumped with EMPIRE BUILDER at the start, raced two wide in midpack, steadied
midway around the first turn, advanced inside around the far turn, bid inside of foes in upper stretch but was outkicked. FARM BOY stalked the pace three
wide between foes around the first turn, steadied when in tight early on the backstretch, dropped back under a drive around the far turn then churned on
through the lane to improve position. ASTROTURF slammed EMPIRE BUILDER at the start, was in range inside early, advanced three wide around the far
turn and failed to sustain that bid in the lane. BACKCHAT set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the quarter pole. MISTER LEONARDO lacked
speed while racing two wide around the first turn, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. OUR STUIE played no factor while racing two
and three wide. MORGAN POINT had speed four wide and was through after a half. EMPIRE BUILDER was bounced around then pinched back at the
start, saved ground well back, checked entering the far turn and had no further bids.

Footnotes
STEAL SUNSHINE was devoid of speed, saved ground around most of the swung six wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up and clear late.
STRIKE HARD bumped with CATTIN at the start, raced well back two wide, angled out turning for home and finished well to gain the place. CLAPTON
saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch, rallied and was outkicked. KING CAB set a clear pace in the two path, held clear past the eighth
pole and tired late. CATTIN bumped with STRIKE HARD at the start, raced in range four wide and was one-paced through the lane. REDDINGTON hit the
starting gate, chased the pace four wide, steadied when in tight near the eighth pole and had no further bid. OCTANE stalked the pace in the three path and
retreated after a half. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF REDDINGTON AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTEFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
KING THEO tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained through the lane and was up in the final strides. BENEFACTOR set a clear pace in the two path,
held clear to deep stretch and was nailed. POCO CHARLIE raced off the pace three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the
winner through the lane but was outkicked. KOBLA MAS lacked speed while saving ground, swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly.
OUTSHINE raced closest to the pace in the three path and came up empty in the lane. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT saved ground and failed to menace.
DEVOTED KITTEN played no factor while racing two and three wide. PICCADILLY BEAU was outrun while racing four wide around the first turn and two
wide around the far turn. PAPA HONOR chased the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn.
