DAZZLING MIST drew clear on the turn and extended the lead under mild left handed urging. SO ELUSIVE was unhurried early, found her best stride late
and got up near the wire for place. AVA K'S GIRL vied to the turn, fell back, went evenly late and just lasted for show. MISTY MATT contended along the
rail, dropped back on the turn and lacked the needed late response. AWESOME GALAXY showed speed to the turn, weakened and dropped back steadily.
PARTY POLICE stumbled at the start and raced evenly. Hand timed.

CARELESS STAR moved up inside, assumed command, drew off and was ridden out. BELLE MY BELLE settled off the pace, lacked the needed rally, was
no match for the winner and finished second best. MIRACLE OF HOPE set a pressured pace to the turn, dropped back, went evenly late and held for show.
LUCY K raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. HOT ROD MAMA broke slowly, lacked a bid and was outrun. PRINCESS AMANDA pressed
the pace to the turn and gave way. TOP REFERENCES was not a factor. LOW DOSE was rank and checked at the start, raced in the back, was eased and
walked off. Hand timed.

was unhurried early, raced inside, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and gained late. MAD LUTHER raced close to the pace, raced inside, bid and
hung. STOCK DEAL raced mid pack in a steady effort and failed to menace. JEDI WARRIOR was unhurried early, bid inside to get within striking distance
and came up empty.. LINEMANS CHECK raced in the back and improved position in an even effort. CHECK AND RAISE was not a factor. KONA COAST
was hustled along outside, set the pace to the second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was outrun. KICK IT showed
speed to the second turn, tired and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
BIG HEAT led throughout and held safely while kept to task. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE advanced inside on the turn, bid willingly, couldn't gain ground and finished
second best. GO GO SADIE pressed the pace, lacked a late response and held safely for show. FIRST PROMISE was off slowly and improved position in
an even effort. WHISTLING HOME was not a factor. MACLEAN'S BELLA stalked the pace to the turn, swung wide and gave way. LOTSA LACE pressed
the pace along the inside, was steadied on the turn, angled out, stopped and was not urged late. Fractional split of 5773 was removed. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LIP'S OF WINE lagged early, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. STOLEN HALO rallied on the
turn, swung wide, dueled for the lead, led late and was outfinished in a good effort. SKY HIGH VERONIKA was never far back, bid inside to duel for the
lead, faltered late and held for show. SWEET LADY LANA set a pressured pace, inched away on the turn, dueled to late stretch and gave way. ELLE
VICTOIRE broke in the air to be off slowly , raced mid pack and lacked a rally. K P KRYPTON hit the gate and was off slowly and failed to threaten in an
even effort. FACE OF GRACE had brief speed only. VEGAS BEAUTY showed good early speed, was taken back on the turn and lacked a stretch response.
SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE veered out at the tstart, pressed the pace two wide to the turn and stopped. ALEMOON was not a factor. DIXON DOLL was outrun.
Hand timed.
