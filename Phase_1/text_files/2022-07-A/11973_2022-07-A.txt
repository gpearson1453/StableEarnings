CLOUD PLAY allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew off the
final furlong. MARK THE MOOSE well placed and off the rail, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed
well for the place. WROTE IN STONE set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. GUN LAP rated
outside the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch and held a share. CREATIVE CHOICE never far back, angled
out into the turn and moved up three wide, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
HOLD ME CLOSER stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to take command through the second turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the
task. MOTITO rated inside, angled out mid way of the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader, then could not threaten that one, while clearly best of
the rest. VACCINA unsettled in the gate, was rated back in the early going, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the
stretch, drifted in and could not gain the final furlong. GEARED UP allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch
and got up for a share. HIDDEN SPRINGS well placed and off the rail, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane
and had no rally. RIO DEL ARMOUR passed a tiring rival. TUNED UP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded into the stretch.
