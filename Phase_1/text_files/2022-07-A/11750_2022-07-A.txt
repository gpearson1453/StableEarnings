ASH FLAT pressured early on the lead, settled to clear clear, held sway. CONTINUATION took up chase from the turn, could not get past, good effort.
SAMURAI SAINT in tight on rail early, angled well off rail turn, on for show. TEQUILAS RANGER saved ground entire trip never far back, could not gain
late. POWELL never menaced. BREEZY MONEY speed inside to turn, shuffled back steadily from that point. MAJESTIC VALLEY off tardy outside, never
menaced.
