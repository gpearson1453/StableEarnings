Footnotes
ROADSIDE stalked the pace in a perfect position came two wide entering the stretch to get on even terms with the pacesetter while not asked then steadily
edged clear for the win. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT showed the best early speed and had the rail throughout but could not match strides with the winner through
the stretch while clearly second best. CASH CRUZER was well off the early pace and came through on the inside through the stretch for third while never a
threat to the top two. BOLD IMPACT raced mid pack along the inside in a strung out field early but never mounted a serious rally. DEACON BEACON
showed some early speed to chase the pace while two wide up the backstretch got to the rail into the turn but then backed up through the stretch. DADDY
JACK was well off the pacer the entire race and never mounted a rally. GABBY TOM was mid pack going into the turn then faded was eased through the
stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GREY ROGUE was quickest away from the gates to bounce out to a clear lead from the outset was given a quick breather onto the main track increased
the margin up the backstretch and steadily held the margin while under mild urging to win as much the best. SCOOTER'S BOY was along the rail up the
backstretch angled out on the turn to be four wide entering the stretch made a mild bid for second while never a threat to the winner.
KNOWYOUROPTIONS chased the pace in the two path to be closest to the leader but could not make up any ground through the stretch and was caught in
the final jumps to finish on even terms for second COWBOY DON chased the pace on the inside in the turn came through along the rail for the stretch run
but could not make up the needed ground. THE GREATEST EAGLE was well off the early pace came six wide turning for home but could not make up
ground. LADDIE BOY raced three wide the entire race while up close and faded into the turn. DEWEY was closest to the pacesetter in the two path but
began to back up turning for home and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
FERRARI ROAD showed good speed away from the gates to battle for the lead from the two path took a clear lead at the head of the stretch and was able
to get to the inside then was all out in the final stages to hold on. PANIC BUTTON made a bid three wide on the turn to get into contention was well handled
through the stretch while making up ground but could not get to the winner in the final strides. LOOKING FOR BULL was in the two path on the turn and was
carried a bit wide entering the stretch while in tight quarters finished well in the stretch to get third. The rider of Looking For Bull lodged an objection against
Panic Button for the incident at the top of the stretch but the stewards ruled that Panic Button maintained his path and there would be no change in the order
of finish. I'M LUCKY showed good early speed along the inside but was challenged from the outset and gave way entering the stretch. CHERUBIM chased
the pace on the rail but dropped back as the field headed for home and was not a factor. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

the frontrunner and drew clear for the victory. SPELL WINDER was in the two path on the turn then went to the inside in the stretch and was up for second
while no threat to the winner. LIL MISS DE BUY was off a step slow to trail a few jumps out of the gate moved up while four to five wide on the backstretch
and turn and was up for third. SWANKY was the quickest early and made the rail into the turn took a lead turning for home but then steadily faded.
OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL was up close to the pace along the inside for the first quarter then faded into the turn. SHIVERHERTIMBERS was in the back of
the pack early while wide and never mounted a serious rally. GARNETS GAL was mid pack while three wide early then dropped back into the turn and was
