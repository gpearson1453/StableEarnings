pole, was in the two path into the lane, drew clear in the stretch and held safely in the final stages. HIGHLY DEVAUXTED chased the pace early, was in the
four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane and was slowly gaining on the winner in the final stages. SPRING MAGIC tracked the pace early, made a
bid nearing the quarter pole, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. CLASSIC COYNE set the pace early, was on the
inside into the lane and faltered down the lane. A KITTEN FOR KATIE was never a factor. SAINT SISTA stalked the pace early on, was checked nearing

Footnotes
AALIYAH EZRI stalked the pace early, took over command, was on the inside into the lane and drew away in the stretch under a steady drive. SIGNADORA
chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. LADY PELE was steadied in the first turn and trailed
the field early, raced in the two path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. ROSALITA raced back early along the first turn, made a middle move,
was in the two path into the lane and weakened late in the drive. OVERCOOKED was never a threat. GHOST BAYOU tracked the pace early, was checked
hard nearing the seven sixteenths pole and faded. RED BEE broke awkwardly, chased the pace, steadied near the five sixteenths pole. VERY WEALTHY
was checked hard entering the backstretch. LOVE PERFECTION set the pace for a half then folded up.
