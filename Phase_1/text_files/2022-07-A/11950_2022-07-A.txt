DYNA STRIKE chased the pace from the inside on the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn, gained command mid stretch and held on well to
prevail. MANOR BORN set pace down the backstretch, was headed briefly at the top of the far turn, gained the lead again on the far turn then continued to
dig in gamely in upper stretch but gave way in the end. MUNDACIOUS was allowed to settled while two wide, was gaining ground coming into the far turn to
menace while five wide then continued to bid down the lane but it was not enough. WHISKEY NOT WINE chased the pace while three wide then rallied
while four wide on the far turn, angled in the two path to bid in the stretch but was no threat. NOMADIC FIGHTER was off slow then chased the pace while
two wide into the far turn then rallied mid stretch but was no threat. WESTERN STAR stalked the leader while three wide then bid on the far turn then faded
in the final furlongs. SEATTLE SOUL was unhurried early then bid along the rail on the far turn and was no factor. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY stalked the leader
while two wide then dropped back on the backstretch and never menaced. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, the rider of MUNDACIOUS claimed foul
against the rider of MANOR BORN for interference on the stretch drive. After review, there was no changed to the order of finish.

RIVER KAT chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn then was gamely gaining ground in the stretch to duel with an inner rival
and was up by a nose to prevail. HESACALENDARBOY pressed the pace while two wide then continued to bid in close on the far turn, rallied in upper
stretch, gained command at the eighth pole but was challenged by an outside rival and lost by a nose in the end. TRUE DAKOTAN was unhurried early then
bid three wide on the far turn, angled in upper stretch to rally along the rally and was closing willingly in the end. HE'S A PRINCE settled while two wide then
made a mild bid while four wide on the far turn into the stretch and missed the show prize in the end. HE'S GOT CHROME set the pace from the inside, was
in a long drive then faltered in the home stretch. CONGO'S TALE chased the pace from the inside then flattened out coming into the far turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
MISS EMPIREMENT was well rated on the inside on the backstretch, then menaced while three wide on the far turn into the stretch, gained the lead in the
last sixteenth and held on for the win. DIAL TEN FOR G pressed the pace while three wide, gained command in late back stretch, cleared the far turn then
continued to rally in the stretch but was caught in the end. DUTCH TREAT chased the pace while four wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn, then bid in
the stretch and was closing well but it was not enough. TESUQUE was unhurried early then rallied while six wide coming into the lane and was closing well
but it was not enough. RCAPTIVATING tracked the pace while three wide, then bid mildly while five wide on the far turn into the stretch but was no threat.
FLOWER HOUSE was unhurried early and no factor. SEEING DOUBLE settle along the inside then swung out seven wide on the far turn and failed to
menace. TOO MUCH IRISH set the pace on the first turn into the backstretch then was headed by an outside rival coming into the far turn then weakened
coming into the stretch.
