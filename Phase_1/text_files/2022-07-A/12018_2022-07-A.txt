path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under late threat and held
well and safe to prevail. SPELTERINI coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled
five to six wide into upper stretch and closed well to latch on the top one as she hit the wire. CHOCOLATE GELATO coaxed from the start, raced four then
three wide in pursuit coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home, ran on to secure the show honors. TWO MINUTE DRILL
chased four wide advancing at the three-eighths and coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide for home and weakened in the late
stages. WILL BE FAMOUS bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside, floated out four to five wide midway on the turn, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home and went five to six wide at the head of the stretch but was unable to make an impact. THIRTY THOU KELVIN coaxed from the

HIGH TIDE broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, went three wide around the opening bend, settled at the rear, was roused while moving from the two
path to the four path around the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch then moved out more and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth. GRAND
JOURNEY moved in while going to the front, showed the way in the two path with a clear advantage, was asked under threat in the two path on the final
turn, drifted out into upper stretch, came out under a left-handed crop and brushed with a foe into the final furlong then switched to a right-handed crop and
was overtaken while able to hold the place. ATTENTIVE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was coaxed along passing the half-mile
pole, chased three wide around the far turn, stayed inside the leaders under a drive in upper stretch, pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was
out-kicked while able to get the show. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS moved in early, went two to three wide around the first turn, was rated just off the pace on
the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path around the far turn, was carried out while on even terms with the leader into upper
stretch, brushed with that foe while carried out some more into the final furlong and weakened. STREET COPPER was reserved while inside to the two
path, came under urging on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch, moved in under a drive around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick.
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was bumped soundly at the start, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was given his cue on the final turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SNOW'S ISLAND broke outwards at the start striking the off side stall forcing the rider from the right iron briefly, settled just off the inside near the rear of the
field, tipped three wide five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and commenced a strong four wide bid through the turn into
contention when swinging three wide for home, took over command outside the top pair at the three-sixteenths, edged away under a drive, then dug in and
held gamely and safe to prevail. TIZ A GIANT tracked the pace along the inside from a loose pocket, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path straightened away, had REMOTE tip out to his inside and was leaned on a furlong from
home, leaned back in on that rival nudging him inwards and forcing the backing away AFJAN to steady a sixteenth out, rallied willingly to secure the place
honors latching on the winner as they hit the finish. REMOTE veered in at the start forcing TIMO to steady off his heels, then got checked about a sixteenth
in the race when rivals tucked directly in front, settled saving ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, tipped out two paths and attempted to lean his way out against TIZ A GIANT a furlong out and gained some of the lane, had that
rival lean back inwards and forced AFJAN to steady off his heels at the sixteenth marker while running on to secure the show honors. VINTAGE YEAR
showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded
the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. TIMO steadied off the heels of the veering inwards REMOTE at the start, saved
ground in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and passed tired rivals. AFJAN coaxed
from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside before advancing to attend the leader down the backstretch five furlongs from home, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was in the midst of weakening when forced to
steady off the heels of REMOTE a sixteenth from home, then continued to back away to the finish. GOOD SOLDIER three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. GRAND CAY stargazed early on rank under restraint of the rider
just off the inside, settled comfortably past the stands the initial time, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
MAJORITY PARTNER was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, raced just off the pace under a snug hold, was asked while two then three wide
on the turn, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole, gained to take the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in some while moving clear under a
right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. TOMMY GUN showed good speed, contested the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner just inside the furlong marker and proved no
match while clear for the place. CATCHING CUPID showed speed then was eased back just off the pace, came under urging around the nine-sixteenths,
chased inside to the two path around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved out behind horses in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, chased
into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. SENSIBLECONCLUSION dropped well behind under urging, moved from the rail
to the two path midway through the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then angled further to the outside and improved position. COLD WALKER
contested the pace between horses, vied in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. WARALO settled on the outside,
was roused in the three path on the turn and failed to rally. HEREBY settled on the inside of a rival, was asked three wide on the turn, came five wide into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. THE INSTITUTE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path around the turn, dropped
back into upper stretch and faltered then was placed under a hold for the final furlong. CLINGMAN was urged along towards the back, traveled around the
turn in the two path and failed to respond.

WINTER SON broke in a step at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide from mid pack, swung three wide into upper stretch roused for the
drive, rallied to split foes a furlong from home seizing command just inside the eighth pole, then dug in gamely to fend off the runner up to the wire. JUST

Footnotes
TARABI was coaxed along in the three path through the first turn, followed the leader down the backstretch, moved closer near the seven-sixteenths,
ranged up to make a bid in the three path on the final turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, gained the advantage inside the three-sixteenths and
proved best under strong urging. GODDESS OF FIRE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the final turn,
gained into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and finished willingly to get up for the place. ANGITUDE broke very fast and went straight to the font,
showed the way in hand while off the rail with a clear advantage, spun three wide into the stretch then was set down coming to the three-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner shortly thereafter then swapped to her proper lead, fought on well into the final sixteenth but was outfinished then just lost the place
but was well clear for the show. GINA ROMANTICA broke out and bumped lightly with a rival, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the
pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground while in dead-aim of the leader around the far turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole,
chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. FAVOR was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came
under urging in the four path around the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. ST MAARTEN GIRL was
bumped lightly at the start then taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground around the far turn, shifted three wide
at the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. A MO REAY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged five
wide around the far turn and failed to respond.

came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and held sway to the finish. LADY PUCHI
came in slightly after the start nudging LOVE TO RUN into CUSTOMER LIST and in turn BIG TENTATIONS and in turn MYRISKYAFFAIR, forcing that
quartet to jostle for a pair of lanes and squeezing back a pair, raced three wide in aim of the front and was clipped behind seven furlongs from home by
CANDY LIGHT, settled latched on to the outside of the aforementioned foe coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in
under a drive running on willingly to the finish but was ultimately staved off to the end. MYRISKYAFFAIR got leaned on after the start when trying to hold her
lane against a trio to the outside, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, kept on under a drive to secure the show honors. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) brushed at the start by BIG TENTATIONS, who broke outwards, got
jostled between foes and squeezed back a sixteenth into the race among a quartet, then bobbled when clipping the rear of LOVE TO RUN, settled tracking

kept on to the wire. LINDA'S GIFT three to four wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. BRAVO KITTEN just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside
for home and weakened in the late stages. CANDY LIGHT pulled rank under restraint early on and clipped the back of LADY PUCHI bobbling with seven
furlongs to run, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response.
SANTA GIULIA (FR) altered out a path seven furlongs out from in behind the aforementioned foe when that rival clipped the back of LADY PUCHI, then got
nudged four wide into the first turn by that same rival CANDY LIGHT, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
for home and offered no kick. LOVE TO RUN jostled with rivals a sixteenth after the start, then got clipped behind by CUSTOMER LIST after squeezing that
rival back, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened. BIG TENTATIONS broke in

Footnotes
JUST CINDY was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside early on the turn, moved out with three furlongs to run then shifted four wide,
gained to make an outside bid at the quarter-pole then took a short lead in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong then moved
clear under strong urging. SUMMER PROMISE chased the pace on the outside then three wide around the turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths,
lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. JANIS JOPLIN broke in and was off a bit slow,
was urged along near the back, went three wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the
show. ME AND MY SHADOW was urged along on the outside, chased three to four wide around the turn and tired. VEDAREO bobbled at the start then
bumped hard with a foe, raced between foes while off the pace, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went around the turn in the two path and came up
empty. MUSICMANSANDY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage outside the five-sixteenths and faded. ADORA was bumped hard at the start and slow into stride, raced a bit greenly at the rear down the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond.
