Footnotes
HOMETOWN HERO prompted the pace two wide, led entering the lane, repelled ONCOMING TRAIN's inside bid leaving the furlong grounds, and drew
clear through the final sixteenth. ONCOMING TRAIN stalked in the two path while in the pocket behind the leaders, searched for racing room while following
HOMETOWN HERO as that foe claimed an advantage entering the lane, tipped in and committed to split rivals two wide at the furlong grounds in hopes of
bidding for the lead inside of the aforementioned foe, but failed to match strides with that one entering the final sixteenth. THUNDERHEART set the pace
inside of a vying HOMETOWN HERO, but was headed at the quarter pole, and yielded while losing place leaving the furlong grounds. NINETIES
COUNTRY stalked outside of the top pair, but only managed to chase them in upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. MULBERRY STREET
trailed early on, took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, shifted out to the five path turning for home, then failed to factor while hanging on his left
lead. MR. HALFTIME laid off of the pace in the three path, tucked to the rail nearing the turn, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
DIVINE HOPE stalked three wide, came under urging approaching the three furlong pole to sustain pressure on the top pair, ranged up to a leading SOLID
TUNE entering the lane, sparred with her through upper stretch, inched an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. SOLID TUNE vied two wide,
led between horses turning for home as DIVINE HOPE menaced outside, resisted that foe's bid entering the lane, dueled gamely through upper stretch, but
was headed at the furlong grounds, and gave in shortly after. LANTERN'S CANDY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace three to
four wide, gained turning for home to be within striking range of the top pair entering the lane, but drifted out while failing to keep pace in upper stretch, and
chased them home. FROSTED DIAMOND veered in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, was outmoved by
her outer counterpart turning for home while tipping three wide, kept on through upper stretch in hopes of bidding for show, but failed fended off by an outer
rival. LAMASCO took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to threaten in the five path in the final furlong. SWEET TRUFFLES raced far
back in the four path, and improved. AZAMANA EMPIRE broke slowly, but avoided trouble from an outer rival by doing so, stalked two wide and between
horses, then from the two path while just behind the leaders around the turn, but faded through the lane. GIN N SIN tracked along the inside, but faded.
ONE FULL MOON vied along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. DINGLE HARBOR broke in a tangle, and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
LI'L TOOTSIE prompted the pace two wide and between horses in the scramble for the lead leaving the chute, sustained pressure outside of THE MARY
ROSE down the backstretch, vied around the turn, led nearing the lane, drew clear entering it, and inched further away through the final furlong. ROC'S
PRINCESS trailed via multiple lengths off of the rest of the field leaving the chute, cut the gap two wide while picking up stride around the turn, sustained a
rally through the lane to bid for place inside of WILL'S SECRET at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed for that position. WILL'S SECRET contended three wide
and between foes leaving the chute, chased the leading pair from the three path while under moderate urging around the turn, inched closer in the five path
entering the lane, claimed place in upper stretch, but failed to threaten the clear leader, failed to keep pace with that one inside the final furlong before
meeting ROC'S PRINCESS's inside place challenge at the sixteenth pole, and was bested late. SYLVIA Q participated as the widest contestant in the
four-way battle for the lead leaving the chute, tracked inner rivals before tucking to the rail at the nine sixteenths pole, then faded turning for home. THE
MARY ROSE showed the way from prompting outer rivals early on, continued to dictate terms down the backstretch as LI'L TOOTSIE supplied pressure,
vied inside of that foe around the turn, but was headed turning for home, and weakened passing the quarter pole.

feeling pressure from a pair of outer foes into the turn, vied inside of a bidding PURRFET MISTRESS turning for home, got headed entering the lane, fought
on gamely thereafter, battled through midstretch, but yielded in the closing stages. KLIMT'S MUSE took a mild brush from an outer foe at the start, settled
off of the pace in the four path, inched closer in the five path to be within striking range of the top pair entering the lane, but only managed to chase them
home. TIZMISSBETTY reared and lost her rider when trying to be loaded, then splayed her feet when the gates opened, chased along the inside, and
faded. NOGRATZ prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but yielded leaving the three furlong pole. OLIVIA'S JOY bobbled a bit at the start and
brushed an inner foe, tracked two to three wide turning for home, but tired. MAYA'S WISH showed little.

Footnotes
THE JUDGE AND JURY broke sharply and a bit outwardly, laid close up inside of the pace setter, backed off to stalk at the half mile pole, pursued the
leading pair from the pocket around the turn, tipped outside of them and to the five path entering the lane, bid outside of YOUNG TURK at the furlong
grounds, dueled with that foe through the late stages, and prevailed. YOUNG TURK stalked three wide, engaged the leader two wide into the turn, vied
while being floated back to the three path at the quarter pole, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an outer THE JUDGE AND JURY menaced, met that
foe's bid in midstretch, dueled gamely through the final furlong, but was bested. DOUBLE DEALER broke slowly, tracked from midpack in the two path,
slipped inside of foes while picking up stride turning for home, grinded away in pursuit of the top trio in upper stretch, aimed to split those rivals three wide
approaching midstretch, but lost that option when THE JUDGE AND JURY closed the door at the furlong grounds, altered course outwardly costing him
momentum, then chased the top pair home well through the late stages. MAD MAGIC lagged well behind the field in the three path around the turn, swung
to the seven path entering the lane, and rallied with a good kick in the final furlong to reach a minor placing. VERSATILE was urged along in the three path
and between horses while off of the pace around the turn, inched closer while shifting to the six path turning for home, and stayed on but failed to menace
before getting outfinished for fourth. WHEN IN ROME hesitated at the start, recovered to track along the inside, tipped to the three path entering the turn,
chased the main group from the four path entering the lane, but faded through the final furlong. BAR ON THE BEACH set the pace two wide, cleared his
inner counterpart into the turn, shifted back out to the two path while meeting YOUNG TURK's challenge, but was headed upper, and weakened at the
furlong grounds. FUTURO raced far back in the two path, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. BRIGHT SPARK broke a step
slowly, was hung out in the four path around the turn while off of the pace, and never got involved. UNCLE NICK tracked two wide, got floated to the four
path entering the turn, then faded turning for home. BIG REDWHITEBLUE saved ground off of the pace, but to tired.

SOROS set the pace in the three path, tucked to the three path into the far turn while feeling stern pressure from an outer NOTABLE EXCEPTION, shook
free of that foe in upper stretch, met RED KNOBS' rail challenge at the furlong grounds, and fended off that foe through the late stages. RED KNOBS
stalked in the two path, came under a drive while committing to a rail charge nearing the lane, grinded away to bid for the lead inside of SOROS leaving the
furlong grounds, but flattened out late, and hung. NOTABLE EXCEPTION pressed outside of the pace setter and from the four path around the first turn,
tucked to the three path into the far turn while ratcheting up the pressure, vied turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, chased the top pair home,
and fended off an inner foe for show through the late stages. ISTHMIAN tracked from midpack in the three path, got outmoved by an outer MOUNT KENYA
at the three furlong pole while chasing between horses, but sustained stride in the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, vied for show inside of
NOTABLE EXCEPTION in the closing stages, but did not have enough. MOUNT KENYA trailed in the three path early on, moved out of last at the five
furlong pole, gained in the four path around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and tired on his left lead. WEST WARPATH stalked along the
inside into the first turn, but failed to sustain position nearing the backstretch, raced at the rear at the five furlong pole, and was outrun. MALIBU TIME laid
off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
RING ME DARLING raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, bid for the lead in the three path at the three furlong pole as an outer MY MY
MUNNY forced her hand, vied among foes turning for home, led in the four path entering the lane as an outer SPARKLE OF HOPE menaced, but swiftly
kicked away from that foe leaving the three sixteenths pole, and drew off. SPARKLE OF HOPE tracked in the two path, shot to the five path entering the
turn to be outside of the top trio, pulled closer to those foes to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied outside of RING ME DARLING entering the lane, but failed
to keep pace in upper stretch, and remained clear of show. LEGERITY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path while between horses
entering the lane, and stayed on. ON THE RISE tracked in the four path, got floated to the six path entering the turn by an inner foe, failed to keep pace with
the leaders while in the seven path entering the lane, yet kept on through the final furlong. SHELL SHOCK stalked along the inside under a snug hold into
the turn, got shuffled back behind a tiring BIZZY ECHO nearing the lane, straightened outside of that foe, then chased the leaders to vie for show in the final
furlong, but flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth, and faltered. MY MY MUNNY stalked three wide, pressed in the four path into the turn,
vied approaching the five sixteenths pole an outer SPARKLE OF HOPE ranged up, but faded entering the lane. SWEET CONFUSION broke a step slowly
and never got involved. DESIGNED BY KITTEN bobbled a bit at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, and faded. BIZZY ECHO set the pace in the
two path, was confronted by a pair of foes into the turn, got headed turning for home, and caved entering the lane.

Footnotes
GUNITE stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turn, committed to a rail charge as the leader vacated it nearing the lane, slipped through
and bid for the lead in upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage before dueling inside of a battling HOIST THE GOLD through midstretch, bumped that foe
entering the final sixteenth, and doggedly resisted to the wire. MY PRANKSTER trailed, came under urging in the four path into the turn, swung six wide
entering the lane while picking up stride, then rallied through the final furlong to bear down on the top two approaching the wire, but missed reeling them in
while achieving place at the wire. HOIST THE GOLD tracked three wide, bid four wide entering the lane, shifted inwardly in upper stretch to engage a
bidding GUNITE, sparred with that rival through midstretch while not quite at that foe's throatlatch, and was fended off through the closing stages, before
being nailed at the wire for place. TEJANO TWIST tracked two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, stayed on while inside of MY PRANKSTER, but was
outkicked for show at the furlong grounds. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE pressed two wide, but yielded between horses while getting floated three wide entering
the lane. OVERTAXED set the pace along the inside, but weakened two wide and between horses at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
READY TO POUNCE tucked soon after being last away, saved ground off of the pace while grazing the fence around the turn, improved inside of foes
entering the lane, produced a rail bid approaching the furlong pole, led leaving that junction, gamely clung to a margin as outer foes took shots, and
remained steadfast to the wire to last via a tight photo. A C EXPRESSWAY tracked five wide, pursued four wide around the turn, floated to the six path
entering the lane, then rallied outside of foes with a good kick in the final furlong, surged to bid at the wire, but just missed. VERB chased in the two path,
tipped to the four path and between horses entering the lane, grinded away to bid along with an inner READY TO POUNCE at the furlong grounds, vied
through the late stages as other rivals on either side closed in as well, and got outfinished for place. BOURBON CALLING trailed in the three to four path,
shifted inwardly in upper stretch, rallied between horses in hopes of joining the fray in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough. MUCH BETTER set the
pace two wide, came into the lane in the three path, but was headed by rivals on either side leaving the furlong grounds, and yielded minorly.
STRONGCONSTITUTION laid off of the pace three wide, but only managed to chase through the lane without menacing. COLTONATOR laid far back two
wide and between horses, trailed turning for home, then surpassed tired foes. KADRI broke a bit outwardly, chased from midpack in the four path, took the
turn in the five path before shifting to the seven path entering the lane, but offered no rally. BANK pressed three wide, came under a drive to sustain position
into the turn, did so before drifting to the five path entering the lane, and tired in upper stretch. DEVIL'S TOWER vied along the inside, but weakened at the
five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SEAL BEACH stalked three wide, vied outside of the top pair while in the four path around the turn, dueled through midstretch, and drew off at the sixteenth
pole. BOLD LOOKER settled far back in the two path, came into the lane in the five path, shifted in to rally between horses, split foes at the furlong grounds,
sustained a charge after flopping back to his left lead, and reached place at the wire. DRINK THE WIND prompted the pace two wide and from the three
path, vied between horses around the turn, dueled through midstretch, but proved no match for his outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole, gave way, and
got nailed at the wire for place. STAND FOR FREEDOM broke a step slowly, rated far back in the three path, swung to the six to seven path entering the
lane, and rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to miss reaching show. CYCLONE laid far back in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane,
and stayed on between horses late. AMERICAN MAYHEM set the pace, showed the way from a pair of vying foes around the turn, but was headed in upper
stretch, and gave way at the furlong grounds. EDGE OF GLORY was very reluctant to load, then raced off of the pace in the five path, improved turning for
home, but tired on his left lead through the lane. FILM STAR bobbled a bit at the start, raced midpack in the three to four path, then chased through upper
stretch, bumped with an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and faded. ANARCHIST stalked along the inside, chased from the two path turning for home, but
failed to bid before bumping with an outer foe at the furlong pole, and weakened. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE saved ground in midpack, but to no avail.
THACH tracked two wide and between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole. MOUNT KISCO chased briefly for a furlong, but folded early.
