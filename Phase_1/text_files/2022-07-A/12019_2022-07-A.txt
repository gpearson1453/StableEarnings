Footnotes
MARVIN'S EXPRESS was bumped hard at the start, stalked the pace for a half, rallied three wide through the far turn, made the lead at the top of the
stretch then finished full of run to win as much the best under strong handling. NOT JUST GEORGE never far back, rallied in the five path through the
stretch, finished clear for second, pulled up injured past the wire and was vanned off. INTO GOLD also bumped hard at the start, battled for the lead two
wide into the far turn, inherited a clear advantage then was used up. JUST INSPIRED bore out badly bumping hard with rivals at the start then failed to
menace. EL CONDOR CAZA well placed, failed to respond. AFLEET O ME was no threat. ORLEANS STORM dueled for the lead along the inside into the
far turn, stopped abruptly, was pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off.

AT THE BEACH dropped inside soon after the start, was always within striking distance, circled rivals four wide through the far turn, made the lead late and
drew clear under confident handling. KING ANDRES sped to the lead along the inside soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was no
match for the winner. SKYLIME trailed into the far turn then had a mild late rally in the three path. GOD'S WILL BE DONE was hung five wide into the
clubhouse turn, offered a mild bid two wide into the stretch then leveled off. TRACKING GOLD four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide into
the stretch then faded. JACK'S DREAM chased the pace three then two wide, dropped inside nearing the stretch then came up, empty. AXIS pressed the
early pace two wide and stopped on the second turn.

Footnotes
ITASCA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, edged clear, drifted out when struck with a left handed whip in deep stretch then drew
clear. FAT DADDY stalked the early pace, rallied three wide into the stretch, was shut off by the winner past the furlong marker causing his jockey to check
then finished clear for second. ZITMAN trailed through the far turn then closed rapidly in the four path through the stretch. NOBLE BEHAVIOR broke in front,
set the pace along the inside into the far turn then was outfinished. LATIN SPICE close up along the inside, failed to respond. LAST DROP OF WINE failed
to menace. PAT DADDY drew closer two wide before a half then came up empty. DOUBLE THE LAUGH was no factor. STATESBORO raced widest and
was no threat. THE RIDER OF FAT DADDY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ITASCA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ITASCA AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
PANAMANIAC broke in front, set all the pace, shook clear in upper stretch and just lasted under right handed urging by the narrowest of margins.
CATABOUT stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly two wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the six path entering the stretch giving up ground
then came on again late in the four path and just missed. SWEET EVY GRACE stalked the pace and went evenly. KIST failed to menace. POWER
BANKER hopped at the start and was no threat. CHLOES ANGEL pressured the winner two wide into the far turn then gave way in the stretch. CAT'S
RHYTHM was no factor.
