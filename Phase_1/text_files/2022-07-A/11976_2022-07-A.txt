WHAT I MINA, opened up, held well. BYE Y'ALL chased winner inside, held the place. CABO DORADO, bothered, steadied and bumped early, stalked
outside, moved inside on the turn, rallied up the rail to make a place bid. KNOW WHAT I MINA, bumped early, chased winner off rail, tired stretch. FAT N
BITTER, back early, advanced inside. ENJAY'S BRASS steadied mildly early as a a result of the squeezing, dropped back, passed a tired rival. GOLD
DIGGIN DARLIN, shaved early, stalked widest, faded. The riders aboard KNOW WHAT I MINA and CABO DORADO both lodged a claim of foul against the
rider of LIA'S ON TUNE for early interference. There was no change.
