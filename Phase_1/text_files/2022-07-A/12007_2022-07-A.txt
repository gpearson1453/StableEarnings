Footnotes
MAGIC CASTLE broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, edged forward racing through the turn and went clear
under firm left handed encouragement, then was geared down approaching the wire. PURE ROCKET was rated just off the first flight between foes racing to
the turn, shifted out five wide entering the lane and proved best of the others. CHICKEN TRUCK was urged three wide between foes prompting the pace
through the backstretch into the turn and weakened in the drive. CANDY PRINCE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, was urged to press the
leader while shifting inwards nearing the lane and gave out leaving midstretch. SOUTHERN PECAN, urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace
to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. XTREME MAYHEM, forwardly placed five wide tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, emptied out into the
lane. VALLEY VISTA proved no factor.

Footnotes
CANDY WOMPUS was settled last along the inside on the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady, late rally to
prevail in time under firm right handed pressure. SILVER DASH exchanged bumps with RANGER GUS at the start, was settled out of striking distance
racing to the bend, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with late interest to challenge for command between foes while failing to match the
winner's kick. OUT RUN'M tracked off the first flight in the five path on the backstretch, steadily advanced four wide, then three wide nearing upper stretch to
challenge for command, gained the advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the top pair. BLAME BISHOP joined the pace three wide in the opening
stages, pressed the issue outside a rival through the turn to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. TWILITE LIASON tracked off the first
flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked a rally. SAHM TEQUILA was urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch
but emptied out early. RANGER GUS broke slowly while exchanging bumps with SILVER DASH, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn
and gave out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SISTER, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance, split foes
in late stages challenging for command and prevailed under firm left handed pressure. WITHHERBOOTSON settled outside foes in the last flight to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide on the far turn, moved to challenge three deep leaving midstretch but was outkicked. SHE'S
XTREMELY HOT ducked out at the start, was reserved along the inside in early stages, split foes after a half, advanced with a sharp move to challenge for
command outside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, went clear entering the lane but failed to sustain that momentum. CANTERBURY GOLD, urged
along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dictated terms into the far turn and gave way once headed racing into the lane.
TEMPORARILY, off slowly, shied outwards at the start, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. FULL SPEED ASTERN angled
to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch but faded after a half. TOUR FOR GOLD switched outside the pacesetter prompting that
rival into the backstretch and gave way early.

Footnotes
THAT'S NOT FUNNY was rated between foes in second flight to the backstretch, pulled his way to contention three deep between foes nearing the far turn,
lost some ground to the pacesetter while being fanned to the four path entering the lane but produced a solid late response to wrest a clear advantage in
time under firm handling. ANGEL'S MAGIC, pulling against light rating along the inside in early stages, tipped outside the leaders racing into the backstretch
to press the issue, dictated the pace between foes into the far turn, held sway to midstretch but couldn't contain the winner late. TAHKODHA KNIGHT
angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the leaders, dropped off the second flight on the backstretch, came around foes nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance, angled back to the rail racing through the stretch and continued with interest to gain a share. STAGECOACH BOYS, off slowly,
was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the lane and found his best stride late. OPTION was
urged prompting a rival's pace to the first turn, gained the advantage entering the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn to
midstretch and gave way late. MINNESOTA RED tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress
four wide racing into the far turn but soon emptied out. DYNAMOMETER angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted
inwards under pressure nearing the lane and steadily faded. FLY WITH CLASS flashed brief pace inside rivals racing to the first turn and emptied out after a
half. SLIM CHANCE was settled while angling to the inside in early stages but failed to menace thereafter. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL broke slowly, then was
caught wide throughout while proving no threat. LL'S CLASSY DUDE broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALL SING BABY was settled off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, gathered some late
momentum tipping off the inside leaving midstretch and narrowly prevailed between foes under firm encouragement. EXODUS AND HOPE tracked the
pacesetter three deep in second flight in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the stretch while steadily closing the gap on the leaders, gained
the advantage between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. ROSEHILL ROAD, inside foes in the second flight in the opening stages, switched off
the inside racing into the turn while being urged in pursuit of the pacesetter, was fanned to the four path challenging for command midstretch but was
outkicked by the top pair. TIMBER LADY off slowly, was settled along the inside on the backstretch, swung out racing into upper stretch and made some
belated progress five wide in the closing stages. CHARLIES MISSILE broke sharply, sprinted well clear of the field racing to the turn, held sway on a
commanding margin into upper stretch but faltered leaving the furlong marker. LITTLE LUNA tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight in the
opening stages but steadily faded racing into the turn. ALITTLEBITALEXIS proved no factor.

FEEDING FRENZY was rated off the second flight while angling to the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came through when
presented an opening to challenge for command inside rivals midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. LORING PARK
hopped at the start losing position to the leaders, switched outside foes racing to the first turn, steadily gained on the leaders three deep after a half, was
fanned four wide on the far turn advancing to striking position, moved to challenge in that path racing through the stretch but was outkicked. BUBBA BOB
tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, continued between foes into the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued
willingly to close the gap on the top pair while edging a rival for a share. TRI SPOT, off slowly, was settled along the rail, saved ground through the far turn
to upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to improve position. IMA HARLEY TOO, reserved off the second flight outside to the backstretch,
was fanned six wide racing through the stretch but continued to make mild progress. GABRIEL'S LEGEND tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival to
the backstretch, was urged to challenge for command three deep racing into the far turn, dueled in that path to midstretch but came up empty late. MAGIC
REVOLUTION settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and failed to menace while passing some tiring foes. BROTHER HAROLD, forwardly
placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, tipped out to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn, was caught in close quarters racing into
the lane and proved empty in the drive. SAINT CHARLES sprinted to the lead along the inside to the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn, briefly dueled
for command while shifting about into the lane but came up empty midstretch. DIRECT ACTION proved no factor.

Footnotes
RAY'S ANGEL sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the turn, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch and maintained the advantage
under firm encouragement. HURTS SO GOOD, forwardly placed between foes pursuing the leader, continued with a steady effort just outside that foe into
the lane and proved best of the others. MAY WE ALL was rated off the second flight along the inside in early stages, lost some position when shuffled out of
close quarters racing into the bend, tipped off the inside racing through upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share late. GIANT
GAMBLE, forwardly placed inside foes in the opening furlong, was held up momentarily racing into the bend, saved ground to upper stretch while being
prompted to advance but had no final kick. FAYETTE WARRIOR was urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way late. PALACE
PRINCE broke awkwardly while getting away last, saved ground into the bend, shifted out on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch but had no closing
bid. RAOFTHESUN tracked off the second flight racing five wide early, then shifted back to that path in the stretch while continuing evenly into the lane. BIG
LEAGUE BENNY was outpaced early despite pressure. OUTRUN THE POSSE tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn and steadily faded into
the lane. ROCKTIZWAY, reserved between foes to the turn, offered no rally. KENHEDOIT settled between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide on the
turn and emptied out in the drive.
