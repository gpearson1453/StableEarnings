MY BOBBY MCGEE was forwardly placed on the first turn then vied outside of STORMIN JJ up the backstretch, took on the challenge of BET YOU A BEER
midway around the far turn, shook free entering the lane and finished going away. BET YOU A BEER prompted the pace three wide through early stages,
vied with the winner at the quarter pole then failed to match strides heading into the lane but stayed on and secured second best. COOL CAT CHARLIE
tracked in close contention, waited for a clear path entering the far turn, came three wide into the lane and churned on for a share. STORMIN' J. J. led the
way into the first turn then dueled for the lead with MY BOBBY MCGEE, battled with rival into the far turn, could not maintain equal terms past the five

IVY ABAD GIRL prompted the pace in the opening quarter then took over the lead at the three eighths pole, saved ground into the lane, widened to a clear
advantage and kept to task under steady pressure. RUDY TOOTY was slow into stride and lacked early speed, trailed in the back and came five to six wide
into upper stretch, rallied along the outside through the lane and got up for place. TAPIT'S LADY tracked the early pace along the inside then waited
patiently for a clear path mid-way around the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and ran on for a share. DIAMOND OF EKATI
raced three wide in range around the turn, given cue at the head of the lane but failed to kick on. FREEIA TAP hustled up four wide and gained closer
contention midway around the turn then flattened in the lane. TROUBLE IN RED chased two wide between foes in early stages, stayed on two wide at the
quarter pole then faded through the lane. G. I. JAYNE failed to move into contention. PALACEDANCER pressed the early pace, chased inside around the
turn then retreated turning for home.

Footnotes
ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW tracked the pace through the backstretch then launched a three wide bid on the turn, roused forward to challenge FRANKLY
EPIC for the lead at the head of the lane, dueled into the final furlong and kicked clear at the sixteenth pole. FRANKLY EPIC sped to the lead at the start
and showed the way around the turn, came under attack from ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW at the head of the lane, dueled past the furlong marker then failed
to match late. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW tracked the pace through the backstretch, hustled up three wide at the quarter pole then came four wide into the lane
and ran on for a share. BOTTOMLESS got bumped repeatedly at the start and raced in the last flight, continued off the pace around the turn, hustled along
three wide a furlong out and improved position. BLUE PARADISE raced near midpack in early stages, chased four wide around the turn then evened out in
the lane. MILTON STREET got bumped repeatedly at the start and raced in the last flight, was ridden along off the pace, came four to five wide into the lane
and passed tiring foes. SCORPIO ROAD was forwardly placed through early stages, chased in contention around the turn then gave way. FLAT SPOOKY
raced in the back, came three wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. SOLE SURVIVOR saved ground in early stages, cut the corner and

NEW YEARS LOVE was well placed tracking the embattled trio through early stages, crept closer four wide late on the turn then given cue at the head of
the lane, gained command leaving the furlong marker and finished going away. JAVISTHA tracked in good position into the turn, roused for response two
wide at the quarter pole, sustained three wide bid through the lane and finished second best. PRINCESS TRINA dueled three deep for the early lead and
battled on around the turn, shook free turning for home, led the way to the furlong marker then got collared by the winner. JAZZ BRUNCH raced off the early
pace, urged four to five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. BIND ME UP was not too far back early on, saved ground around the turn, tipped two
wide for the drive and needed more for late impact. MISS INVASIVE raced off the early pace, came wide into the lane and failed to rally. G KATE dueled
inside of a duo in opening stages, battled on around the turn then tired in the driive. SOYBEAN dueled between rivals and retreated in the lane. MINGO
MAGIC failed to move into contention.
