Footnotes
ARQUEBUS was hustled on the break to be away alertly for the lead, opened up through the turn and early stretch and held well nearing the finish. BORN
HAPPY trailed early on, roused and commenced his rally inside through the turn, angled out to the four path for the drive and closed well to be a clear
second. MAN OF STEEL chased the leader throughout the backstretch and turn, ran evenly through the lane and held on to show at the wire. FORITTABLE
tracked inside, was coaxed and retreated on the rail through the turn and offered an energetic rebid down the stretch just missing third in a close photo.
RED ZEPPELIN broke in at the start hitting the gate, was ridden early on the backstretch and turn to get into contention and faded between runners the final
eighth. SECTION TEN stalked near the back down the backside, dropped back on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
IMA DAREDEVIL settled between runners off the leading group, began to advance some two wide on the turn moving out four deep late on that bend, took
aim in the stretch, wore down the leader to get the lead past the eighth pole and kicked clear. ONEZY'S DREAM settled inside rivals off the pace, saved
ground inside on the turn just coming out late on that bend, angled six deep at the top of the stretch, kicked on late to get up for second. AIRY FAIRY set the
pace under moderate rating tactics racing just off the fence, moved clear into upper stretch, weakened late and just held show honors. CEFALO stalked
from outside the pacesetter going two to three wide, kept on under urging and just missed show. GELATO AMORE stalked from outside, moved out from
three to five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. AFANDI broke outwardly bothering a rival, raced outside rivals off the pace, went two to three
wide on the turn, came out seven deep turning for home and ran on. GOLDEN GARTER tracked from inside, saved ground near the rail through the turn,
failed to rally in the stretch. ANITA GRIGIO was forced out at the break, outpaced early, never a threat.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN TIME took command after the break, was well rated down the backstretch and shook loose turning for home to hold on the last sixteenth from
fast closing rivals. BAYOU BELLE was near the back in the beginning, waited on the far turn between runners to find a seam, found the two path turning for
home splitting runners and closed well winning the battle for second money. ANTIGONE was near the rear to start, was asked on the far turn while going
five wide around runners entering the stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner in the six path between horses through the lane. LIL'S TURN trailed in
the beginning on the rail, stayed inside on the far turn and showed some good late interest weaving through fading traffic in the stretch to garner a small
share. VENENOSA chased the leader early inside, saved ground throughout and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. MACHISIMA stalked four wide
throughout, roused on the far turn and levelled out the final eighth of a mile. CHEEKY PINT chased the leader between runners through the first part of the
race, was in contention turning for home and stopped through the lane. CARIBBEAN KITTEN chased the winner while racing three wide on the turns and
had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
ICING was urged forward inside to press, eased back and switched out leaving the backstretch, bid three wide turning for home, struck the lead past the
three-sixteenths, drew clear and was kept to the task. MOMENT OF PEACE was bumped after the break, advanced outside five then six wide on the turn,
bumped with a rival four times in upper- to mid-stretch, drifted in late and got the nod over that rival for second. LOVE THE GAME switched out heading to
the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, exchanged several bumps and was then bumped by the aforementioned rival, forced in by that one a little bit
late and lost the nod for place. BLACK SUN shifted in, saved ground inside through the turn coming out three to four wide at the top of the stretch, kept on
for the minor award. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI tracked from between rivals mid-pack heading to the turn, was bumped at the half-mile marker and tapped on
the brakes slightly, continued two wide on the turn, came out to pass a rival in the stretch and ran on. ALL TIME CLASSIC broke a step slowly, raced
without speed between foes toward the rear into the turn, angled five wide at the top of the stretch and improved position. CONFIDENT N ELITE set the
pace from off the rail, moved nearer inside on the turn, came out a bit turning for home, faltered and faded. MAYOR OF ESSA bumped the outer rival at the
start, settled at the rear, raced outside foes on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, failed to menace. SPANISH PRINCE stalked outside three to
four wide, bumped a rival about the half-mile marker, was within range between rivals in mid-stretch, steadied when in tight at the sixteenth and was not
asked thereafter. PHILZANO gave brief pursuit inside then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
STORMY SILENCE broke on top to lead, was ridden confidently around the turn and into the lane, repelled a mild challenge from an outside rival mid
stretch and when asked at the sixteenth pole responded well drawing away late. SYSTEMATIC was away alertly, stalked mid pack inside through the turn,
angled out to the four path to offer the winner a mild challenge at the eighth pole and finished well to be a clear second. BODACIOUS MISS was allowed to
settle near the back, roused inside on the turn, angled out to the five path for the drive and had some good late energy to get up for show. AMERICAN
GAMBLE chased the winner just outside, made a mild bid at the quarter pole between runners then drifted inwards while under left handed urging at the
eighth pole and levelled out in the final stages of the race. ALLPAIDUP chased the winner on the rail, steadied for a moment around the five eighths pole
while on the inside and faded down the stretch. FOURTEEN DAYS was mid pack while five wide on the turn, was widest turning for home and never got
involved. PHILLY EAGLES (IRE) had a sluggish start and never reached contention.

NICE COMPANY attended the pace from outside, moved to challenge three wide from the three-eighths, dueled till late then inched away under strong
urging. FRERET set the early tempo inside the aforementioned, dueled with that one but just off the rail, kept on gamely but was simply outfinished.
SOMEONE ELSE stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, kept on for show honors over SPEAK ENGLISH, who stalked in behind the leaders off
the inside, moved to the rail about the three-eighths, saved ground, missed third. WHAT A BEAUT raced in behind two to three wide and between foes into
the turn, ran on evenly. MORE SAVVY raced outside off the pace going four to five wide on the turn, needed more. ROYAL CITY REIGN tracked up close
inside early, dropped back into the turn, angled seven wide into the stretch, made no late bid. SAMURAI FIGHTER raced at the rear two to three wide on
the turn, came out five wide turning for home then shifted in, failed to menace.

Footnotes
EVERYDAY MAGIC tracked the speed just outside, assumed command at the three sixteenth pole and was never challenged the final eighth of a mile
winning comfortably. VOLATA was brushed at the start, rated mid pack down the backstretch, waited behind runners on the turn and split rivals through the
lane closing well to be a clear second. LETS RUN TWO was mid pack racing three wide on the turn, angled out to the five path in the stretch running on
belatedly to get up for third. VESPOLINA was at the back early on, saved ground through the turn and showed some late energy rallying in the stretch in the
two path between runners to get a minor share. GOLDSTORM GLORY was brushed at the break, made a mild run inside to be third on the turn and levelled
out while on the rail through the stretch. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH trailed in the beginning, asked through the turn while four wide, angled out widest in the
stretch to the nine path and passed tiring runners. ARRA GO WAN showed good early speed to lead, opened up on the turn, was collared at the three
sixteenth pole and backed through the field in the final eighth of a mile. GOLD FORESTER was mid pack outside of runners, roused on the turn and had no
response. CARPE HORSESHOE stalked while four wide on the turn and had nothing for the run down the lane.
