challenged, repelled a bid from COUNTRY MILES in midstretch, then dug in gamely in the two path to the finish. ROYAL COUP raced three wide off the
pace, moved up on backside, chased on the far turn, rallied mildly outside in the final furlong. CASH KID raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the
lane, closed belatedly outside and got up for fourth at the wire. COUNTRY MILES stalked two wide, moved up on the far turn, bid three wide passing the
quarter pole, dueled with SMITHWICK'S SPICE and weakened. GONE ASTRAY KISS raced two wide off the pace, failed to threaten and tired. PAL tracked

Footnotes
GREEN UP took command soon after the start, rated the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter pole, drifted
out a bit entering the stretch, then pulled away under some mild urging and coasted home. RADIO DAYS had a three wide trip racing off the pacesetter, bid
three wide on the far turn, was floated a bit wide entering the stretch, dug in gamely but clearly second best. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER pressed the pace
racing close up in the two path, bid between rivals on the far turn, steadied a bit turning for home and weakened. ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK stumbled at the
start, raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and tired.
