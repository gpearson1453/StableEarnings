Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY set the pace in the two path through the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, met the challenges from SHANE ZAIN and ME LIKEY and held
gamely. SHANE ZAIN got bumped from outside leaving the gate, stalked outside the leader early, came four wide into the stretch, bid three deep in the lane
and lacked the needed late punch to get by. ME LIKEY broke in, chased the pacesetter from outside, went four wide into the turn, took aim three wide
leaving the bend, bid between with three-sixteenths remaining but faltered in the end. BAM BAM AGAIN chased along the inside to the stretch and never
produced a bid. DERBY STORM got crowded between rivals in the beginning, chased two then three wide on the turn and failed to menace. ELUSIVE
VIRTUE broke in and bumped rival then lost his path, navigated the turn four wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MR FREEBIE vied for the lead from inside then two wide into the stretch, cleared outside rival nearing the eighth pole, then held gamely over the late charge
from the runner-up. ARICKAREE settled off the pace, saved ground along the inside, rallied next to the fence through the lane but could not get by the
winner. ERIK THE VIKING chased inside the leader early then got shuffled back entering the turn, came two wide into the stretch and finished willingly to
earn the show honors. DIVINELY DIVERSE broke out and bumped rival, chased from outside then bid three deep on the turn, drifted five wide into the
stretch, shifted in upper stretch then drifted in, fought to midstretch and flattened to fourth. HELICOPTER PILOT chased off the rail early then went up to vie
between rivals, fought around the turn and three wide into the stretch and faltered in the late stages. ALEX'S DREAM hopped and got sandwiched between
rivals at the start, spun three wide into the lane and was not a factor. MACHO SAM bumped leaving the gate, rounded the bend four wide and weakened.

JIN TONG chased off the inside, angled five wide leaving the turn, rallied under left-handed encouragement and got up in time. PACIFIC STATES dueled
for the lead from inside, fought two wide into the stretch, regained the lead past the quarter pole, got bumped by MAJOR NYQUICST in the final sixteenth
and was overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. MAJOR NYQUIST dueled for command outside PACIFIC STATES, inched ahead around the turn
and led four wide into the drive, lost command past the quarter pole, continued to battle from outside entering the final furlong, drifted in and bumped rival in
the final sixteenth and stayed on between foes to the wire. CASTLEKNOCK chased two then three wide on the turn, finished willingly near the inside and
earned a minor award. GAS ME UP broke slow and hit the gate at the start, traveled four wide into the turn, angled six wide entering the stretch and needed
to find more late.

DISCO BALL dueled for command from outside, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole and held well under right-handed urging. TRUTH SEEKER hopped at the
start, trailed off the rail early on, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out into the lane, drifted out at the gap and rallied to gain the place while
unable to threaten the winner. HOCKEY DAD dueled for command from inside to the turn, chased the leader past the five-sixteenths pole and saved the
show. SELF TAUGHT tracked off the inside, came five wide into the drive and missed the show. JOKER BOY broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate,
forwardly placed in the early going from inside, tipped two wide leaving the bend and failed to produce a bid. ALBIZU hit the gate in the beginning, raced
near the back well off the inside, entered the turn five wide, angled down to the three path and failed to rally. PRIANO was off a bit slow then got brushed
from inside, chased off the rail then four to five wide on the turn and weakened.
