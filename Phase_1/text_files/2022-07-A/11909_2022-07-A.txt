EL CHAVO DEL OCHO set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and was kept to task. RONAMO was never far back, rallied on the turn, couldn't
gain ground and was no match for the winner. CHASING FAME raced in the back, put in a steady effort and was along for show. THIEF IN THE NIGHT was
hustled along inside to show speed to the turn and gave way. TAPPED TO THE MAX pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. TIGER BY

MORE HONOR rallied around the turn, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. GOT EVEN SMARTER was crowded into the
turn, advanced along the rail, challenged for the lead, dueled to mid stretch, inched clear and was caught late. THE PUBLIC HALO vied to mid stretch,
faltered and was all out for show. LIL LATIGO was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. ROLL OUT was off slowly, raced in the
back, went widest in the drive and closed well. THEY'RE GRRREAT vied to the turn and stopped. RED HOT CAT was checked into the turn, raced evenly
and was not a threat. CHEF was pulled up and vanned off. The riders' of GOT EVEN SMARTER and RED HOT CAT claimed foul against the rider of MORE
HONOR for alleged interference on the turn. No change was made.

LARRY'S LEGEND set the pace and drew off in the drive while under urging. TOX raced in the back, went widest in the drive and closed to get up for place
while no threat to the winner. A GEM IS A GEM lagged early, offered a mild bid near the inside and earned show. ADD ON was never far back, lacked a
stretch response and dropped back. TRACK BOUND pressed the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. SMOOTHING IRON was not a
factor. ZIPPING BOMBASTIC was off a step slowly, moved up inside, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. Hand timed.
