Footnotes
POW POW showed the best early speed to get the lead from the outset was allowed to relax in the turn then drew clear on his own without asking to win as
much the best. BIG CALI GIRL chased the pace along the inside came out a bit entering the stretch to make a bid but could not match strides with the
winner through the lane and was second best. COUVERTURE was well off the early pace came out to the two path to get up for third in the final furlong
while never a threat to the top two. MYSTIC WIND chased the speed along the inside and then was outfinished for third while never a serious threat. NO

ground stayed along the inside through the lane and was passing horses while finishing with interest. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA raced along the inside while

Footnotes
SILVER MAKER was slow to settle but saved ground along the inside in the early stages swung five wide turning for home to find a clear path and was just
up in the final yards under a strong ride. JIMBO'S BIZ raced along the inside after the break came through along the rail on the turn lacked room for much of
the stretch run then came to the two path late and was moving well in the final yards. WRATH was away in good order and settled on the lead along the rail
took the lead into mid stretch then weakened just a bit and could not finish with the top pair. RANDOM AFFAIR raced along the inside while well of the pace
in the early stages came through at the top of the stretch and was finishing with interest. GOOSE DRANK WINE raced three wide the entire race to get into
contention going into the turn and then gave way. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD was up close to the lead in the two path but gave way through the stretch.
YOUNG PHILLIP was in tight quarters between foes up the backstretch and had to back out a bit came wide ion the turn and had nothing left in the drive.
MAXIMUS THE GREAT was away in good order but lacked early speed dropped back quickly and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TRICKY LEE was well back of the pace into the turn while along the inside angled out to the center of the track turning for home and was steadily making up
ground on the outside to be up in the final jump. QUICKTRIP VAN showed good early speed while three wide took a clear lead at the eighth pole while on
the inside but was caught in the final jumps. ROCKY JACK was four wide entering the stretch while engaging for the lead but could not go with the top two
in the final stages. PICK A LANE FRANK came five wide entering the stretch to get into contention but could not sustain the bid through the lane and
weakened late. THE BIG SHOW was up close along the inside entering the stretch was behind horses but had no rally when a hole opened and was
outfinished. TULSA TIME was in the two path and close to the leaders but had little to offer in the stretch. FOR REEL was off a step slow to trail in the early
stages and never mounted a serious rally. STREET N SOUR was able to get to the rail up the backstretch to save ground but never offered a rally.
KEARNEY was well behind the field up the backstretch and into the turn and had little to offer in the stretch. JONO set the pace along the inside but gave
way quickly midway on the turn. MUCHO GIFTED raced in the middle of the pack but gave way on the turn and was never a serious factor in the stretch.
