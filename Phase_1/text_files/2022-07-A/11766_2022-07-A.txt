Footnotes
COCOA ICING raced off the pace inside, waited between rivals for room on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, quickly responded with a big run,
closed willingly to gain command and moved away under a hand ride. KAZACHAN set the pace on the inside, shook free at the top of the lane, dug in
gamely and held on narrowly to save the place spot. OFFICE ETIQUETTE raced off the pace, had an inside trip, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside
and just missed for second. WI FI raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the far turn, made a bid and was outkicked. PRINCESS LEAN
stalked close up two wide, then moved inside, rode the rail in the stretch run and was outkicked. WAR IN PARADISE pressed the pace racing close up two
wide, bid two wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LUNA'S TREASURE raced two wide off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and failed to
threaten. HARD ROCK WARRIOR trailed the field, made a four wide run on the far turn and then faded.

Footnotes
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch, closed steadily in the final furlong and was up
late for the win. DOC AMSTER dueled inside of QUICK TEMPO for the lead, continued heads apart with that rival, dug in gamely in the two path in the
stretch drive and got second. QUICK TEMPO dueled two wide for command, battled with DOC AMSTER into the stretch, dug in gamely through the lane
and earned the show spot. PRESS MY BETS was steadied at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and closed belatedly outside. LEGAL DEAL chased
the pace, raced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished evenly. BANK ON SHEA raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the
turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. RITHM BOX was outrun.

Footnotes
POP POP SUSI dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew clear, driving. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS chased two
wide, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied outside for second. PELLEGRINI chased on the inside, came three wide into the lane,
rallied mildly outside and was up for third. TAP EM dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn and weakened. NOT A POSTINO raced off
the pace inside and failed to threaten. MARSICO was a bit reluctant to load, outrun early and dropped back in the stretch.
