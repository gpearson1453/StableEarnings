JUST JEREMY stalked the pacesetter, commenced his bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of U KANT WHIP IT, drifted in bothering that rival at the gap in
midstretch, then drew clear under urging. U KANT WHIP IT set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled with JUST JEREMY in upper stretch, was forced
inward by that rival at the gap in midstretch, then dug in gamely to hold second. RECKLESS PLACE tracked on the inside, moved up entering the stretch,
lacked room behind the leaders at the eighth pole, angled out and closed late. SUIT OF ARMOR steadied between rivals leaving the chute, raced off the
pace inside, angled out and rallied mildly outside. NINTH OF APRIL was outrun early while two wide, came three wide into the lane and improved his
position. DIABLO DADDY was outrun early on the inside and failed to threaten. BAYOU SHACK chased three wide, chased on the turn and tired. RULER
OF BRABANT raced off the pace and did not factor. TAPPED OFF stalked two wide and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider
of U KANT WHIP IT, JUST JEREMY was disqualified and placed second for interference in midstretch.
