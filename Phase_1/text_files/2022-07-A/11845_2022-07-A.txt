UP IN ARMS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead and
held under steady pressure. VAVITE sent from the gate, sprinted clear quickly, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the
winner late and held the place. KICK OUT THE JAMS stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position and bid outside the leader three wide into
the stretch, then could not match strides, weakened and held the show. DOMINANT STRANGER never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, bid
four wide into the stretch and evened out.

ENJOY THE MUSIC unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was
kept to the task. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match
for the winner the final furlong and held the place. GUACO well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into
the lane and weakened the final furlong, holding the show. STEVIS MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch, stayed
on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. FUEL THE BERN tracked the pace well back, moved up inside
through the turn, came through into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
