Footnotes
HUNTERS GHOST dueled with Lightning Star for the early lead from along the outside, took the lead after three furlongs, dueled with Whisper and Wink
from that point to the stretch and then gradually drew clear. LIGHTNING STAR disputed the early pace from along the inside, dropped back on the turn,
angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and rallied late to earn the place. WHISPER AND WINK stalked the early pace in hand, moved up three-wide
nearing the half mile pole to join the winner, dueled with him into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. FANTASTIC DREAM went evenly while
saving ground. LUCKY SNAKE was forwardly placed for a half mile and gave way.

TOO TALL TO CALL sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. TAP THE BANK was prominent from the start
racing three-wide outside of horses, responded to pressure during the drive and while unable to reach the winner finished well for the place. BET THE
HOUSE ducked about after the start, then came in slightly leaving the five-eighths pole, was between rivals throughout and finished willing. R N' R ATTHE
BEACH was forwardly place while racing along the inside but lacked the needed late response. SENOR FABULOSO steadied leaving the five-eighths pole
in traffic, then was in tight nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, came five-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover.

Footnotes
TUMAC MOUNTAIN was bumped at the start by Dieci, then moved up between rivals on the backstretch took the lead nearing the turn and was ridden out
to increase his advantage. TRIBAL IMPACT was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch then angled further out and finished fast.
PROUDTOBESICILIAN was forward placed racing along the inside and finished willingly. STANLEY RYDER prompted the issue while racing three-wide,
was four-wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. SHOCKAZULU was allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into the stretch to
offer his bid and then flattened out. BENNY THE JET failed to seriously threaten while racing four-wide. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN gave way after showing
brief speed along the inside. DIECI broke out at the start to bump with the winner, then dropped well back and was outrun.

RODEO ROSE was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up three-wide nearing the turn to join Fly Robyn Fly, dueled with that one to the wire and
prevailed in a stiff drive. FLY ROBYN FLY set the pressured pace slightly off the rail, responded when asked and just missed in a game effort. PAISLEE'S
PULPIT prompted the early issue along the inside, steadied leaving the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back, angled out three-wide entering the stretch and
finished fast. COASTAL QUEEN broke out at the start, then raced four-wide on the turn and finished willingly. MY MACHETE ROSE was pinched back
shortly after the start and then failed to threaten while saving ground. AMULET failed to menace while racing two-wide.
