Footnotes
LOVING CUP lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear.
RIBALDRY (IRE) saved ground on the turn, swung to the three path turning for home and passed tired horses. BETTER CALL MAMA sprinted to the early
lead, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened late. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR , a forward factor three wide turning for home, took aim on the lead in
mid stretch then gave way. WILLING was never a factor. BELLA BETTINA raced in the two path entering the turn, was forwardly placed leaving the turn and
gave way. SALAGADOOLA was outrun after breaking sluggishly. HOV LANE , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
SAGRADA RAY quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away to lengthy advantage after six furlongs, came into the lane three wide,
responded to asking, wandered outward in deep stretch and prevailed. MAXIMUM IMPACT , in range between runners past the five eighths, dropped in
pursuing around the final turn, came back out for the final furlong and closed steadily to gain. ONE TEN , four wide early, settled in the clear while not far
back past the five furlong marker, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, advanced four wide and to the inside of a rival into the lane and kept on
with interest to slowly bridge the gap. JARDANI , sluggish away, settled well back, commenced a run while off the rail past the three eighths, gained five
wide into the stretch then failed to sustain through the final furlong. GOD IS LOVE stalked two wide and to the inside of rivals, failed to kick on while under
pressure leaving the far turn and faded. BURGEE , five wide outside rivals around the first turn, stalked three deep past the five eighths, lacked a kick when
ridden past the five sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
DADDY'S COZY stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path mid way on the turn, eased out three deep entering the stretch, gained the
lead in mid stretch and drove clear. EMPHASIZE , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path between horses in mid
stretch and closed strongly. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA , three wide the first turn, chased the pace two wide around the far turn, gained a short lead in upper
stretch and weakened. CLEVER FELLOW lacked speed behind horses, raced inside rivals in the stretch and passed tired ones. SEVILLE ROW , five deep
leaving the far turn, lacked a rally. STRAIGHT UP GUY bore out leaving the starting gate impeding EMPHASIZE, hugged the inner rail stalking the pace for
six furlongs then weakened in the drive. TIJUANA BRASS offered a mild three wide move on the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. ANTIPOISON
drifted in leaving the starting gate bumping with EMPHASIZE, sprinted clear approaching the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered
approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
BERNIE'S ON FIRE disputed the pace three deep outside foes, emerged in a battle outside DEGAS past the three eighths, wrested command soon into the
lane, spurted away under strong handling in mid stretch then held firm. AMEN CORNER rated off the dueling leaders, saved ground leaving the three
eighths, angled out four wide for room into the lane, straightened away and closed willingly. DESHACKLED dueled between rivals early on, failed to keep
pace with the leaders nearing the quarter pole and faded a bit. SHOULDA HAD IT , four wide stalking the dueling trio, was under pressure when shifting out
six wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. DEGAS had speed inside a pair of rivals, sparred to the inside of the winner from the three eighths to the
quarter pole, failed to kick on with that one past the three sixteenths, weakened in the final furlong and was eased late.

Footnotes
FAST LANI bumped SO GRACIOUS when bearing in at the break, accelerated to the front, drifted out in mid stretch, drifted to the outer rail near the
sixteenth pole and remained well clear of the others. A GIRL NAMED JAC ,a forward factor two wide around the turn, failed to rally and held the place. MISS
IS ZIPPY saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail in mid stretch and rallied between horses. TRIKKI NIKKI , along the inner rail around the turn,
angled out near the three sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. BOUND FOR BROADWAY circled foes on the turn, moved to the six path mid stretch
and was not a factor. GREEN EYES hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way the final furlong. OIL ON CANVAS , steadied in traffic soon after
the break, was no factor. MY SUPER SALLY , no factor, drifted in inside the eighth pole. SO GRACIOUS , soundly bumped leaving the starting gate, trailed.

MAJESTY'S FREEDOM , urged chasing the loose leader, raced off the inside into the lane, drifted in a bit to be very close to the rail, edged up past mid
stretch, was angled outward and responded to firm left handed asking, reeled in the leader late and drew clear while in hand at the wire. LADY SERENITY
sprinted to a long lead soon after the break, set the pace towards the rail, remained clear while under pressure past the furlong grounds, failed to contain the
winner inside the sixteenth pole and weakened. FIVECOMMATWO , snugly rated early, moved up towards the rail mid turn, eased out and closed steadily.
SPENCERIAN steadied at the break, was taken wide early and rated, shifted out five wide making headway into the lane, straightened and finished with
good energy. TRAININWITHKRISTEN , three to four wide pursuing, finished evenly. ITALIAN WAR CRY , bumped at the break, saved ground leaving the
three eighths, angled out and came up empty. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, dropped off the pace while saving
ground, raced under rating and never threatened.

Footnotes
BOSS ANGEL rated kindly three wide, cruised up past the five sixteenths then bid to engage HOT SPICE from the outside, secured command soon into the
lane, pulled away under a steady hand ride and drifted out some late. POLISH COOKIE chased the pace, angled out leaving the far turn, came four wide for
the drive and finished willingly. LOOKIN SPUNKY settled well wide, came under a ride leaving the far turn, circled four wide and offered a mild kick. TILTED
TIARA edged up inside early, chased two to three wide in upper stretch but failed to muster up a solid finish. DOOMSCROLLER , off the pace while saving
some ground, eased out and had a belated response between runners. HOT SPICE quickly went clear, set the early pace under a snug hold while saving
ground, came under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner entering the lane, stayed on to mid stretch and weakened.
HEARTBURN broke slowly and was outrun.
