SWINDLE prompted the early pace three wide, made the lead entering the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and drew off to win under
confident handling in the five path. PISTOL PACKIN BOS never far back, improved position into the stretch and finished second best along the inside. HIGH
CUPPER slow early, found her best stride late in the three path. OPULENT contested the early lead along the rail, had speed into the stretch then
weakened. ALL THE BEST passed tiring rivals. DISCREET ENERGY was no factor. SANIBEL stalked the pace four wide into the turn and flattened out in
the stretch. SO GO MY LUCEILLE battled for the early lead between horses two wide then was used up.

UPTOWN close up from the start, rallied three then two wide through the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch, battled the balance of the trip
and proved best under strong handling. FUEGO CALIENTE unhurried early, closed rapidly three wide on the far turn, dueled to the wire with the winner and
just missed. GIO SAMMY chased the pace two wide into the stretch, shifted out to the four path late and finished with good courage. FU ROO broke in front,
set the pace to the top of the stretch, dug in determinedly but was outfinished. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE hopped at the start, trailed into the stretch then had
a mild late rally two wide. ROSAS WAY chased the pace two wide into the far turn, swung wide then weakened. SAMMY DA BULL was no factor.
KATHERN'S JOY was no threat.
