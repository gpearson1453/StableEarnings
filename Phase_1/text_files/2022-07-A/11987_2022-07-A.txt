stretch, made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong. ZILLION unhurried in the early going, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that
path into the lane and closed well for the place. PAID THE PREACHER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, the faded late and held the show. MAGICSTICK ran evenly for three quarters and had no stretch rally.

GOODTIME ARTIE allowed to settle, looped up two and three wide to gain position through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain,
edged ahead and held. GOT FLOFFY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn and held that advantage to the final yards and was
outfinished. BREWING STORM never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild gain in the lane.
DUN RIGHT well placed, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then drifted in and flattened out. PITON tracked the pace
well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and weakened. ANVIL well placed, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded in the lane. NATHANIEL'S HOPE sent from the gate, led in the early going, stalked
the leader to the turn and faded. TASTY'S BULLSEYE was never involved.

Footnotes
EMPEROR'S SONG well placed, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and
lasted under steady pressure. LA REINA DEL NORTE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
then lacked the needed late kick, while gaining the place. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE unhurried in the early going, moved up on the two path through the turn,
came through on that path into the stretch and edged up for the show. KEEP SCROLLING mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled
out carrying a rivals widest into the stretch, then closed for a share. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER rated inside, held position through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late. HERE COMES MEG improved her position, inside. SHEZA HOOT passed tiring rivals.
NORTHERN TRANSIT never far back, looped up four wide through the turn, was carried out into the stretch and faded. SATURDAYS VAPOR sprinted to a
clear lead soon after the start and faded into the stretch. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, EMPEROR'S SONG WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

into the stretch, bumping SUMMER PLACE, shook clear, then lasted. BEACH HOLIDAY unhurried in the early going, moved up on the two path through the
second turn, came through on that path, angled out, made a steady gain and missed. SUMMER PALACE well placed, gained position on the two path
through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, was bumped, edging ahead, then weakened late and held the show. THE BLACK STRAT sprinted to
a clear lead soon after the start, drew away from the field while pulling, then weakened late and held a share. SUN DADDY was no factor. INCITATUS

Footnotes
ADIOS BOBBY well placed, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was
kept to the task. JINGLE BELLS allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, drifted in, bumped,
then made a steady gain and edged up for the place. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL mid pack and off the rail, looped up three wide through the second turn,
came four wide into the stretch and closed for the show. WHOOPS mid pack, looped up four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch,
was bumped, then edged up for a share. SUMMER BOSS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew away from the field, stayed on when challenged
into the stretch, then weakened late. BAHAMIAN PARK allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
improved position. GOLDEN OAK allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through, then angled out and passed tiring rivals. DECEIVER ran
evenly. BRYTON'S D J tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded. KIANG well placed and outside, faded through the
second turn.
