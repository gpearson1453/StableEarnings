FROGGY pressed the early pace from a three wide stance through the opening quarter, gained command along the backstretch, saved ground around the
final bend, was challenged to a stretch duel at upper stretch, and warded off that challenger for the victory. SECRET PICASSO tucked to save ground in the
early going, angled out along the backstretch and advanced on the leaders, rated close up at the eighth pole, locked into a stretch duel at upper stretch, but
was outdueled in final sixteenth. I CAN'T TELL YA stumbled at the start and trailed the field from outset. GOSPEL BUZZ flashed early speed and led the
field around the opening turn before weakening in the crucial stages from a ground saving pose.

REACH THE CIRCLE proved best in stretch duel after breaking alertly and sharing command from between rivals around the bend. SPANISH HOMBRE
established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, stalked the pacesetters around the bend, then surged late to share the place. BAPTISM rushed
form outset to gain first command and establish a ground saving stance, shared the lead around the turn, locked into a three way stretch duel, but was
edged in closing strides. KID SLIPPER pressed the pace as the outer most rival of three abreast along the backstretch and through the bend, rated close up
at upper stretch, dueled in the final sixteenth, but was nipped for the place by the late late rush of rallying rival.

POP CULTURE trekked the three path and settled into mid pack through the opening half, advanced to gain command along the backstretch, tucked to the
inside around the final bend and kicked clear in final furlong for the score. TOTALLY TIGER earned the place with a late rush and was gaining on leader at
finish after saving ground early and angling out at upper stretch. HUNTER QUICK settled into the two path shortly after the start, led the second flight from
that track, was a clear second at upper stretch, but was unable to defend the place from the late charge of rallying rival. JOHN ALLEN came up empty and
failed to sustain the bid after flashing early speed and leading the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance. FORT KNOX failed to menace
while giving chase as the widest rival and tiring in the closing strides.

ROSIE FLASHBACK forced the early pace from between rivals, gained sole command along the backstretch and drew clear in closing furlong for the score.
WOW WOW ITS MAGIC pressed the pace from a three wide pose through the opening half and finished a clear second but was no match for tough winner
in the end. DERBYSHIRE travelled widest of all and finished best of rest to secure the show. MOONSHINE PRINCESS broke alertly and shared early
command into the first turn before checking mid turn and then giving chase and finishing evenly. LANDALAFFIT failed to threaten from a back rated pose.

FROSTED PRAYER rushed from outset to assume first command, opened up a comfortable margin on rivals, and led every step of the way for a gate to
wire score. CANDY BARON trekked the two path, gave chase to the front runner, and was clearly second best. THE UNION FOREVER earned the show
with a late rush after showing reserve in the early going. MONET'S DEVIL established a ground saving stance, rated in the second flight through the
opening half, then steadily faded. PERFECTOMUNDO was unhurried from outset, tucked to inside to save ground, and tired in the closing stages.

Footnotes
SERENDIP RULER hustled away from outset and led every step of the way while slowly widening the margin for a gate to wire score. IM THE MAN NOW
finished a clear second and was unable to run down leader after stalking the front runner from a two path position. CITY OF HOPE secured the show and
proved best of rest after settling in behind the front runner and angling wide at upper stretch. GOD HELP US settled into mid pack along the inside, saved
ground around the bend and finished with no gain, no loss. TIZ STRONG was unhurried and rated mid pack, trekked the two path and battled with an inside
rival for position. OUTCASHED lost ground to front runners with a wide trip. FLAT OUT AVENGER was a little menace to outcome after showing reserve
from outset and giving chase from a back rated stance. CROSSBOW CIMARRON trailed the field and was no threat.

SELLING SHORT pressed the pace from a two path pose, gained command inside the quarter pole, then refused to lose the stretch duel to procure the
victory. BEAR DEN showed reserve from outset, was forced to change lanes in the first turn, then closed with a rush to earn the place.
SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN was nipped in closing strides after settling into second flight, saving ground, then taking part in the three way stretch duel.
LEDOUX WHAT IT DO rushed form outset to lead the field as the inner rival of two abreast, relished command inside the quarter pole, locked into a three
way stretch duel, and was edged in closing strides.

J LOVE showed reserve through the opening half before rallying and splitting foes in upper stretch to win the stretch duel. SMOKING GUITAR trekked the
three path and stalked the early frontrunner, gained command at upper stretch, locked into a stretch duel and was edged in final sixteenth. GOSPEL
CARLOTTA travelled widest, closed with a rush and earned the show. QUICK CALISIA stalked the pace while trekking the two path, advanced on the
leader and led the field at the midway point, saved ground at upper stretch, but was outfinished in final strides. GEORGIANO motored away from outset and
gained first command, led the field from a ground saving pose through the opening bend, then eclipsed in the closing strides.

EURONTHEMONEY set the pace in unison from a two wide stance, was headed by advancing rival between calls, locked into a stretch duel with that rival
and came again in final sixteenth for the score. HUNTER'S LEGACY stalked the pace from a wide stance through the first turn, advanced with a three wide
move along the backstretch, led between calls, then was outdueled in final furlong. ORNERY AS HELL rushed from outset to share early command as the
inner most rival around the opening bend, rated close up at the midway point, but gave way to dueling duo in closing strides. CRAFTY HEAT lacked a
needed rally after giving chase from a two path stance. AWESOME THUNDER failed to threaten while giving chase from a wide position. MY REAL
DIAMOND saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS BREEZE rushed form outset, gained first command and steadily widened the margin while never relishing command for a gate to wire victory.
NORTHERN ORBIT broke alertly and loomed boldly on the heels of pacesetter through the opening half, was roused inside the quarter pole and finished a
clear second but was no match for the gate to wire winner. GRANITO DE ORO earned the show with a wide advancement after showing reserve through
the opening bend. LANGMEAD stalked the early pace and led the second flight at the midway point before weakening in the closing stages. OCTAGON
lacked a closing bid after being unhurried in the early going and giving chase from a two path stance. KILKENNY trailed the field through the opening half
and passed tiring foe in the late strides. UNCLE O. G. steadily faded in the latter portion of contest after settling into mid pack through the first turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ZIP proved best in duel after steadily advancing position from a three wide stance. ST PATRICKS SWORD rushed from outset to lead the field
from outset and through the first two calls, saved ground around the turns, was on even terms at upper stretch, but was outdueled in final sixteenth.
MAHOMEITE came up empty and was unable to match stride with top pair in final furlong after rating close up from outset to upper stretch. GOSPEL
DANDY lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack and taking a two path journey. HES BIG CHIEF trailed the field from outset and was no threat after
being unprepared at the start. MR. SMOKEY was unhurried, rated back, and failed to menace.
