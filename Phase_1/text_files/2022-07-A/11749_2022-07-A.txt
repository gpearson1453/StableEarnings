Footnotes
U CANT HANDLE THIS broke in front while grabbed with the left-rein to correct a slight outward movement, showed the way on the inside, responded well
when asked at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into the stretch, was pulled in by the rider to encourage a lead change inside the three-sixteenths and
swapped to the proper lead, extended the advantage under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and proved much the best. TOOSWEETTOBESOUR
was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while moving from the inside to the two path around the turn, thought about moving outside the front
duo inside the five-sixteenths but opted to remain in the two path as ROZ was getting out slightly in front, paused off heels then was roused for more outside
the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. LORDHEARMYPRAYER broke a bit slow then was pinched back,
was ridden along towards the back, shifted from the two path to the four path at the three-eighths, drifted inward in upper stretch and came up empty while
best of the rest. DANCE FOR BOURBON came away in good order, was urged along just off the pace, dropped back under stronger encouragement in the
two path around the turn and capitulated. ROZ broke out and hit the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while needing extra
left-rein pressure around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. ICE KREEM SUNDAE stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the
front several lengths, went three wide around the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. THATSJUSTLOVELY was
checked while taken up by the rider early, dropped back to the rear, saved ground under urging through the turn and was distanced in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE ATLAS tracked the front three then two wide patiently handled until roused angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from
home, dug in under threat from a quartet and held gamely to prevail. LUCKY PERIDOT just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside rivals and missed at the end. JUXTAPOSE prompted the leader
to the outside in the two path, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, dug in under threat and was
headed a furlong out, fought on inside to the finish to preserve the show honors. CHARGE ACCOUNT just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack,
remained patiently handled until let out angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was out-finished in the late stages. WAR CANOE
tracked the pace along the inside, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to the finish but was out-finished. JASMINESQUE
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from JUXTAPOSE to the outside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages. CHOOSE HAPPINESS
coaxed from the start, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
ZUZUDINI was well spotted down the backstretch, drafted in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole then was asked, gained
to make an outside bid in upper stretch, lugged in some while on even terms with the runner-up, gained the advantage inside the furlong marker, continued
to lug in slightly, was put to a left-handed crop late and prevailed under good handling. CHEEKY TICO showed speed between horses then prompted the
pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path around the turn, took the advantage near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final
furlong, lost the advantage to the winner shortly thereafter and was outfinished while clear for the place. NORTH POLE went to the front, showed the way on
the inside, was asked against the rail on the turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear
for the show. NO CODE was coaxed from the gate then settled off the pace, went five wide while roused on the turn and came up empty. NORDIC LIGHT
moved out early, was ridden along towards the rear, went around the turn in the three path and failed to respond. PAPI ON ICE bumped with a rival at the
start and was off a bit slow, had the rider take repeated looks down to the outside in the opening furlong then dropped to the rail, saved ground around the
turn and was no factor. RIVER OF NO RETURN bumped with an opponent at the start, showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, rounded the
turn in the four path, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and faltered.

RECKLESS SPIRIT three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command
straightened away, dug in under threat from flanking challengers, got collared just inside the sixteenth pole and battled on to the finish. PRACTICE SQUAD

aforementioned foes while keeping on to preserve the show honors. CATCH THAT PARTY two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went three to
four wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FRONT MAN two

Footnotes
OXYMORE broke very fast and went straight to the front, dictated terms while near the rail through the turn, responded well when set down into upper
stretch, extended the advantage under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, powered away under the crop until just outside the sixteenth-pole then was
placed under a solid-hand ride to the wire in an impressive debut. DR OSERAN was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside then in the two
path on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the
place. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) was bumped hard at the start, raced on the outside under urging, went three then four wide around the turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. ROYAL VELVET was urged down the backstretch then taken in hand while
moving from the inside to the two path around the turn, came out while roused into upper stretch and just missed the show. SON OF A BIRCH stumbled
inward at the start and bumped soundly with a foe, raced on the outside at the rear with his head cocked to the outside, dropped in to race in the two path
around the turn, came three wide into the stretch then moved out a bit, dropped in around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. TWO MINUTES APART
was urged along off the pace, dropped back while a bit green with five furlongs to run, saved ground around the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
bobbled some near the furlong marker and was no factor. FUNTASTIC AGAIN was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging in the three path on
the turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated. CARA'S PRINCE was hustled from the start, raced towards the front, rounded the turn in the two path while
between horses, dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left. ALCAZABA (IRE) was away alertly, chased the winner on the inside, dropped back
while hard ridden around the turn and faded. LEGAL CATCH lugged in some at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn, came four
wide into the stretch then moved well out in the course and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
EMPIRE HOPE coaxed from the gate, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and got let out angled four wide into upper stretch, came inwards towards the rail with three-sixteenths to go and had TIZZY IN THE
SKY come over to look her in the eye, took command a sixteenth from home and inched clear to the finish. TIZZY IN THE SKY coaxed from the start briefly,
raced four to five paths off the inside just off a pace dispute up front, went four wide through the turn advancing under her own power to take command just
inside the three-eighths marker and began to shake clear going five wide into upper stretch, was in hand straightened away and got roused to urging when
the rider spied EMPIRE HOPE rallying up the inside, got directed in four paths to look that foe in the eye being show the crop to the off side and was
collared at the sixteenth pole, ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best while not fully extended and tepidly handled. HOODOOLAND broke in
brushing the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. EMMYLOU hustled from the start, vied inside a pair
from the get go, began to shake off one of those rivals when joined four deep by TIZZY IN THE SKY, got displaced from command just inside the
three-eighths pole, came under coaxing through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish.
MATTAPOISETT hustled from the gate, vied three to four wide outside a pair down the backstretch between briefly vying between foes when joined to the
outside midway on the turn, swung three wide for home, drifted in straightened away and tired. TWILIGHT DREAMS coaxed from the gate, chased three to
four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and gave way. JABBERWOCK hustled from the start, vied three then two
wide between foes coming under urging three furlongs from home, retreated through the latter portion of the bend and went three wide for home, then

Footnotes
SAINT SELBY broke in while going straight to the front, showed the way under some pressure from the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear
near the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage under his own power into upper stretch then was shaken up coming to the three-sixteenths, drew off into
the final furlong, was given one pop of a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a brisk hand-ride while much the best. RYAN'S CAT
dropped back under coaxing, moved from three to five wide around the turn, advanced into second position near the furlong marker and safely secured the
place while no match for the winner. REGGAE MUSIC MAN was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
dropped back near the five-sixteenths and weakened. CAPONE was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back in the two
path around the turn and tired. DON'T WAIT UP was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and
capitulated. STRIKING SPEED stumbled severely at the start and nearly unseated the rider, had the rider show impressive strength to right himself in the
saddle after hanging off the outside of his stead, lost the left iron for several strides then regained footing, saved ground at the rear through the turn and was
no factor. UNIKEE broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, dropped back fast while three then four wide around the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and faltered then was eased but walked off. RYAN'S CAT RACED FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY

Footnotes
DYNADRIVE tracked the pace along the inside from a loose pocket early on before advancing into the pocket proper into the far turn, remained on hold in
behind the leader and cut the corner into upper stretch scraping the paint, tipped out to the two path nearing the eighth pole roused and rallied to issue a
challenge inside that station poking a head in front with seventy yards to the finish and prevailed kept to task. SPACE LAUNCH coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat running
on willingly to the finish and was caught seventy yards from home while along safe for the place honors. KURAMATA (IRE) got bumped at the start by
TIBERIUS MERCURIUS due to pressure from SLICKED BACK veering outwards, chased just off the inside through the first turn before chasing four then
three wide, got let out angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild belated bid to procure the show honors. SLICKED BACK veered out at the
start bumping TIBERIUS MERCURIUS into KURAMATA, raced forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the front, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. OFFLEE NAUGHTY coaxed from the gate, chased along
the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish.
BLUEGRASS PARKWAY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no late headway. KINENOS broke a beat slow and avoided the bumping begun by SLICKED BACK veering outwards, chased just off the
inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and offered no response. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS got bumped at the start by
SLICKED BACK and in turn bumped KURAMATA, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. AVIANO coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CUSTOM BOBBY'S tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, was asked in the two path on the turn, gained three wide into the stretch then made an outside
bid at the three-sixteenths, took a short lead inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging.
FAST N FEARIOUS was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, was asked while
dropping closer to the rail at the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a drive in upper stretch, was headed by the winner inside the furlong marker,
fought on gamely with that foe to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. OUR TROUBADOUR settled towards the rear on the outside, went three
then four wide around the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. STANDUP settled off the pace, moved in outside the
half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch and improved position. GASLIGHT was well placed on the inside, saved
ground around the turn, was asked while swinging four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BIG WONDER was hustled from the gate,
dropped just off the pace then was well positioned, saved ground around the turn, shifted to the two path just after being asked near the quarter-pole,
chased into the final furlong then moved out and weakened. STEELERSFANFORLIFE was reserved while tugging at the bit, saved ground on the turn,
steadied off heels near the five-sixteenths and was no factor. CHARGER settled at the rear, went two then three wide around the turn, came five wide into
