Footnotes
AUTOSTRADA was unhurried off of the inside, took closer order through the second turn, shifted out entering the stretch, quickened once clear, reeled in
LENNI BE LUCKY inside the furlong marker and edged clear. The latter tugged to contention three deep, came to level terms after a half between rivals,
forged command leaving the second turn, kicked on well but was unable to resist the winner. RAINBOWS ARE FREE attended the pace along the inside,
worked her way to the outside leaving the second turn and kicked on willingly to earn the minor award. FAST AND FEMININE tracked the pace outside,
inherited the lead when JIMENA failed to negotiate the first turn, disputed the issue to the stretch and gave in. NO COMMENT was unhurried toward the
inside, advanced between horses on the second turn, came three wide into the lane but failed to make headway. AVARIE came away a bit slow, was
allowed to settle and failed to threaten. JIMENA was away alertly, flashed good early foot into the first turn, bore out and relinquished the lead, was
straightened away and vied outside down the backstretch, but bore out again on the second turn, dropped well back and lost all chance. THE CAT CAME
BACK was allowed to settle three deep, mounted a middle move to range into striking distance, but came up empty after six furlongs and retreated.

SENOR BUSCADOR chased the pace while four wide, was steady urging on the turn to take command at the eighth pole to draw off under strong hand
drive to prevail. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN dueled while two wide, gained the lead on the turn, was in a hard drive, then was headed by an outside rival mid
stretch and was up for second place. SPEIGHT AND MALICE chased the pace along the rail then continued to bid mildly on the turn, was gamely coming
down the stretch drive and was up for the show prize. ROSIE'S OUTLAW dueled for lead from the inside, was in a steady drive on the turn into the stretch,
was used up and gave way in the end. MORNING SNOW raced while three wide into the stretch and was no factor. CHARLIECANDO was unhurried early
and failed to menace. GODDARD was off slowly and was out run.
