Footnotes
KONG LOVES A FIGHT coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tipped three then four wide through the far
turn advancing under his own power outside rivals into contention when let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside
the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held safe to prevail. ADDICTED TO YOU just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK three wide in pursuit from mid
pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when advancing on the front, continued three wide for home and took over command straightened away,
dug in confronted by the top one and was collared just outside the eighth pole, fought on inside to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the end. LOOKIN
GRAND tracked the pace along the inside coming under a prolonged drive with seven-sixteenths to run, swung three wide for home and kept on one paced
to the finish. BUSTIN UP hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. WHISKY WARRIOR saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch and improved position through to the wire. SECRET SANCTUARY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. DON BERNARDO coaxed from the start, chased three wide until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and had no kick. ZAP MAN chased two to three wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch, tired. KIMBO DANCER coaxed from the gate, dueled along the inside of UNCLE
BRUCE from the get go widening away as a pair from the rest of the field, shook off his main pace foe six furlongs from home and spurted away in sole
command, had the field take closer order through the far turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and
was overhauled straightened away for home, then tired through to the finish. TONALISTIC chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to
four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and made no impact. UNCLE BRUCE dueled from the three path
with KIMBO DANCER to his inside widening away from the rest of the field, got shaken off six furlongs from home and backed away tucking to the two path,
came under brief coaxing midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
LIL COMMISSIONER was forwardly placed on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, took the lead just inside the three-eighths, moved clear passing the
five-sixteenths while the runner-up was held up behind horses then dropped to the three path, responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the
furlong marker, drifted out after being switched to a left-handed crop into the final sixteenth and held to prevail. ZAEVION was coaxed along towards the
front, saved ground on the turn, was held-up behind horses while the winner made a decisive move from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths, shifted
three wide to go around a tiring duo shortly thereafter, picked up stride in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch, chased that foe under a drive into the final
furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but was too late while well clear for the place. HANDY settled off the pace, was urged while moving from the inside to
the three path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SOMEBODY
jostled with a rival early then was in tight briefly, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide around the turn then driven five wide into the stretch
and also lacked the needed response. SICILIA MIKE settled at the rear, saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
TRAPPEZOID was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then two wide around the turn and came up empty. MISTER
WINSTON went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead just inside the three-eighths and faded. MANIFEST
DESTINY broke in then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, was ridden along on the far outside, went five wide around the turn then came six wide
into the stretch and was no factor. MY FIRST GRAMMY bumped with a rival at the start, jostled with another foe early, went four then three wide around the
turn and faltered then pulled up with a left foreleg injury after the wire and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC ONE angled in around the first turn, made his way to the two path in the process, tugged some on the bit while reserved behind horses early on
the backstretch, continued in reserve at the rear, was roused with a half-mile to run, gained three then four wide around the far turn, made an outside bid
passing the five-sixteenths, took a short lead outside of two foes at the three-sixteenths, fought determinedly with those rivals to the wire and narrowly
prevailed under strong handling. FIRST CAPTAIN went four wide around the opening bend, was lightly rated on the outside, came under urging with a
half-mile to run, ranged up to make a bid outside the three-eighths, took a short lead just inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner at the
three-sixteenths, battled gamely between horses to the wire and was denied while able to get the place. UNTREATED went to the front on the inside, came
off the rail leaving the first turn, showed the way while remaining off the inside down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the final turn, lost the
lead just inside the five-sixteenths, fought on well with the top two to the wire but missed while well clear for the show. MAX PLAYER stalked the pace on
the outside, was urged three wide early on the far turn, dropped back under the crop with three furlongs to run, floated five wide while continuing to drop
back into the stretch and narrowly earned fourth money on the outside while far behind the top three. FOREWARNED dropped from the three path to the rail
around the first turn, settled comfortably down the backstretch, was roused along the rail early on the far turn, came out four wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed response then just missed fourth money.

BIG EVEREST (GB) coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat gamely and stubbornly battling on to rebuff the challenge to the finish and prevail on the line. EYES ON TARGET coaxed from
the start, raced forwardly placed three then two wide in closest aim of the leader to the outside, remained patiently handled until let out spinning three wide
for home, dug in latched on through the length of the stretch fighting gamely to the finish but was ultimately repelled at the end. COLD HARD CASH tracked
the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path at the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing forcing HIEROGLYPHICS to steady off his heels and in turn forcing
GRADED ON A CURVE to steady in behind that rival, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE)
two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. SOULMATE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when offering up a bid, swung four wide for home and weakened in the
late stages. GRADED ON A CURVE coaxed from the gate, tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the field, got forced to steady off the heels of
HIEROGLYPHICS at the five-sixteenths and was shuffled back two lengths when that rival was impeded by COLD HARD CASH tipping out directly in front
from off the rail, swung three wide into upper stretch placed to urging, made mild headway in the late stages. NEVER EXPLAIN just off the inside at the tail
of the field, altered three wide at the five-sixteenths put to coaxing as GRADED ON A CURVE backed up in tandem with HIEROGLYPHICS due to COLD
HARD CASH tipping off the inside, went six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. ADVANCED STRATEGY coaxed from the start, chased
along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HIEROGLYPHICS just off the inside in pursuit
from just off the pace, came under coaxing briefly at the three-eighths, then got forced to steady off the heels of COLD HARD CASH when that rival tipped
out directly in front impeding him and in turn forced GRADED ON A CURVE in behind to steady off his heels and shuffled that rival back briefly, went four
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NOVEMBER REIN tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with five furlongs to run, vied outside in the two path around the turn, gained a short lead in
the three path into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up under a strong hand-ride, bumped lightly with that opponent late and narrowly prevailed.
BABA was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied close to the inside around the turn, lost the advantage in the two path into upper
stretch, fought back gamely inside of the winner under the crop, bumped lightly with that foe late and just missed while well clear for the place. TO A T was
urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then angled further out near the three-sixteenths and
just got up for the show. MONSHUN broke out and brushed the gate, was urged early then taken in hand between horses outside the five-eighths, steadied
slightly off heels shortly thereafter, chased two then three wide around the turn and weakened. FIGHT ON LUCY was urged along at the rear, moved from
the rail to the three path around the turn and was no factor. RUVIES IN TIME dropped back off the pace under urging, chased three then four wide around
the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. CHASING CARA broke out at the start, was urged early then taken in hand while just off the pace, saved
ground while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. HAPPY SOPHIA was urged along on the outside, dropped from
the three path to the rail near the seven-sixteenths and failed to respond.

patiently handled until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, dug in under

CLASSIC CAUSEWAY bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, came under light coaxing and established the front showing the way just
off the inside through the first turn under pressure from ROYAL PATRONAGE to the outside, was under a light hold into the backstretch and had his closest
escort back off and tucked inside, remained safely in front settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits, had the field get buy in behind midway
on the far turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole in response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged away
under a drive to the eighth pole as a wall of rivals stacked across the track behind him, dug in gamely holding well to the finish to score. NATIONS PRIDE
(IRE) coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide into the first turn before settling just off the inside briefly in pursuit from mid pack, tipped three wide
down backstretch and continued three wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch
and rallied with good energy the outermost of a quintet stacked across the track behind the top one, came in slightly causing a chain of bumps through to
ROYAL PATRONAGE just inside the sixteenth marker and was up for the place honors just latching on the winner as he hit the wire. STONE AGE (IRE) five
then four wide into the first turn, tucked three then two wide midway before angling three to four paths off the hedge down the backstretch, tucked inside
through the far turn and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and rallied willingly between foes, got bumped
by NATIONS PRIDE just inside the sixteenth pole and in turn bumped GRAND SONATA into ROYAL PATRONAGE, and ran on to get up for the show
honors. GRAND SONATA broke in at the start bumping CLASSIC CAUSEWAY, tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace, came under
coaxing in the two path at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on between foes to the finish and was bumped
just inside the sixteenth marker due to pressure outside from NATIONS PRIDE and in turn bumped ROYAL PATRONAGE and kept on to just get the last
major share. ROYAL PATRONAGE (FR) forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn disputing the pace and then prompting the leader early
on, came under a light hold and eased off to tuck inside and track the front from a loose pocket, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between rivals, got bumped solidly just inside the sixteenth marker due to pressure outside and was
out-finished in the late stages. SY DOG broke out at the start, chased just off the inside early on until tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home, dug in under a drive inside a quartet just in behind the leader a furlong from home, then got
out-finished in the late going. LIMITED LIABILITY broke in at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn before settling four then three wide
down the backstretch at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, made some
ground while making no late headway in position. MACHETE (FR) four wide through the first turn, raced six paths off the inside in the clear down the
backstretch and pulled his way keenly and eagerly to be just off the pace heading into the far turn, went four wide through that bend coming under coaxing
three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. TIZ THE BOMB coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was unable to make an impact. IMPLEMENTATION brushed the rail and was in
tight early on with nine furlongs to run as STOLEN BASE and he jostled for position as rivals outside tightened the quarters for them, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. NAPOLEONIC WAR broke out at the start bumping
CLASSIC CAUSEWAY, tracked the front just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and tired. STOLEN
BASE jostled early on with IMPLEMENTATION for position, raced three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped four wide into
upper stretch and faltered.

FRANK'S ART broke a bit slow then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide early on the turn,
moved to four then five wide late on that bend, was roused eight wide into the stretch then moved further out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed
fast to win going away. HEYMACKIT'SJACK tracked the pace on the outside, tucked in behind the leading trio inside the five-eighths, went two then three
wide around the turn, made a bid in the four path into upper stretch then took the lead, drifted out into the final sixteenth and bothered a foe then was
overtaken while just able to get the place. DREAMPOINT settled towards the rear, moved from the inside to the two path around the turn, came three wide
into the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. FEATHERS ROAD was taken in hand early then moved out towards the
back, went three then four wide early on the turn, moved to five then six wide late on that bend, brushed with a rival in upper stretch, gained into the final
furlong, checked when HEYMACKIT'SJACK came out into the final sixteenth and lost any chance at the victory then just missed the show. BORN DANCER
settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out, chased into the final furlong and
lacked the needed kick. BRADY'S LEGACY broke a step slow, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while two then three wide around the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out and also lacked the needed kick. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF was hustled from the gate, angled
in abruptly in front of several foes, contested the pace on the inside of two opponents while along the rail, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.
EXCURSIONNISTE showed speed then stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and
capitulated. BERT BERT BERT was taken up when RIPE FOR MISCHIEF cut in front early then hit the rail, raced very greenly outside the five-eighths,
saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. SALT CAY settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, shifted three wide at the
quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, raced between horses into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. OUR SON JAKE
showed speed between foes then contested the pace, vied in the two path while still between rivals on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
INDEPENDENT PAUL was taken in hand early, dropped back to the rear of the field, fell well behind while faltering on the turn and was eased but walked
off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, HEYMACKIT'SJACK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED
FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH-POLE

Footnotes
SHERIFF BIANCO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down continuing in the two path into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. AFTER FIVE chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DEREGULATION (GB) coaxed from the start, chased along the inside, got let out spinning three wide into
upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. GIRAMONTE just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide for home and stayed on one paced to the wire. B C GLORY DAYS got bumped between foes and pinched back after the start when HE'S
GOT IT and UMBRIA each came his way, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. COURAGEOOUS OH LA got bumped at the start by HE'S GOT IT, who broke inwards then got bumped by HUDSON OVERPASS back outwards into
HE'S GOT IT, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HUDSON
OVERPASS broke out at the start bumping COURAGEOOUS OH LA into HE'S GOT IT, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and weakened in the late going. SIXTY THREE S chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. HE'S GOT IT broke in at the start bumping COURAGEOOUS OH LA, then got bumped
by that rival due to pressure coming outwards from HUDSON OVERPASS, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. HEZASTONECOLDFOX coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. UMBRIA came out after the start and bumped B C GLORY DAYS in tandem
with HE'S GOT IT, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch and tired.
