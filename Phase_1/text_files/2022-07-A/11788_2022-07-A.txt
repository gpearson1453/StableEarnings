Footnotes
SUPER CHOW sped to the front, set the pace in the three path, drifted further out nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and held
clear under a drive. COMPANUEVO lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and finished strongly. GRAN SLASH bumped soon after the start
and then again near the half-mile pole, gave chase four wide around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. CAJUN GEM chased the winner three
wide and weakened through the final furlong. CLASSIC CAR WASH failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BORIS was bumped soon after the
start then again near the half-mile pole, chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. CHEERFUL CHARLIE was outrun inside. ZONAL was reluctant
to load, broke slowly and made little impact while racing four wide. I'LLSMILEAGAIN was fractious behind the gate and trailed in the two path. THIS WAS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE BACKSTRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
VANDALIA stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a brisk hand ride. MISS MAMBA settled off the pace while
racing three wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn and stayed on to gain the place. RAISON THE GLASS set the pace along the rail, was
collared by the winner near the quarter pole, fought on inside of that foe to midstretch and just lasted for the show. DONTMESSWITHTESS was off slow,
trailed in the two path early, advanced four wide around the far turn and finished willingly outside to just miss third. MISS BETH'EL failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. LADY MECHANIC was outrun inside. ALWAYS EDEN was steadied repeatedly while rank between foes around the first turn,
saved ground around the far turn and retreated through the lane. C'EST PARTI chased the pace inside and was through after a half.

RACING COLORS settled off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, shifted further out in upper stretch, closed outside, seized
command near the sixteenth pole and won going away. CAPRIDREY lacked early speed, advanced five wide around the turn, angled into the three path
nearing the head of the lane, continued on the left lead, took over nearing the eighth pole but was overwhelmed by the winner soon after. HOLIDAY
PRINCESS advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch but churned on to regain
the show. ROUGH ENOUGH set the pace two wide, was collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. FEARLESS GIRL
pressed the pace from the rail and faded around the turn. MORENA DANCER saved ground and failed to menace. PATH TO VICTORY was outrun inside.
LEMONADE LADY chased the pace four wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole. RIDE LITTLE GIRL chased four wide, was eased through the lane and
was vanned off. SUSPICIOUSLY SWEET never reached contention, saved ground and was eased through the lane. SHOW ME LOVE raced well back
three wide and was eased through the stretch. JAH was up close inside, was through after a half and was eased through the lane. THIS RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI stalked the pace four wide, took the lead in upper stretch, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and held firm under steady urging. PUDDING raced
off the pace four and five wide and finished willingly widest. ABSOLUTE GRIT saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on to gain the
show. DRAIN THE CLOCK had his head turned at the start, pressed the pace three wide, took the lead between rivals around the turn, vied inside of the
winner to midstretch and weakened. GATSBY had early speed between foes, steadied near the three-eighths pole, angled wider near the quarter pole and
lacked the needed rally. YES I'M A BEAST set the pace in the two path and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ONE EYED JACK set the pace in the two path, bumped with TONE FEELIN entering the far turn, edged ahead in the two path around that bend, drew clear
in upper stretch and dug in to hold off a late charge. MEADE was strung out six wide into the first turn, raced mostly five wide around that bend, advanced
four wide around the far turn and finished well to narrow most of the gap. BOURBON WISDOM raced five wide around most of the first turn, vied outside of
the winner down the backstretch and around most of the far turn, could not quite pace in upper stretch and lasted for the show. TONE FEELIN stalked the
pace inside, bid inside of the winner midway down the backstretch, shied out when put in tight near half-mile pole and bumped with the winner, dropped
back inside, re-bid inside in upper stretch then flattened out. LUSITANO tracked the pace two wide and faded around the far turn. IL FARAONE raced four
wide around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and was outrun. NACHO PAPA played no factor while racing three wide. AN OBJECTION
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TONE FEELIN AGINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
KING CAIRO settled off the early pace outside, moved to the lead leaving the half-mile pole, drew clear in the two path around the turn, continued on the left
lead in the lane and widened under a drive. THE RED MAN broke in a tangle, rushed up between foes early, set the pace along the rail, could not match
strides with the winner from the seven-sixteenths marker, chased inside around most of the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and kept trying
through the lane to hold a clear second. SPRING THE BEAST prompted the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and bested the rest.
NEVERSTOPDREAMING failed to menace while racing five wide. POWER (BRZ) never threatened while racing five wide. BEINFUN played no factor while
racing two wide. PROSPECT PROJECT was outrun inside. MERZAZ chased the pace four wide and faltered in the lane. ROYAL WAR had brief speed four
wide. VALHALLA AIR BASE made little impact while racing two wide.

CE CE settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command turning for home and readily drew off while ridden out. SPIRIT
WIND prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on
willingly for the place. MAKE MISCHIEF set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and held well
enough for the show. COREY chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. GLASS CEILING broke a bit awkwardly, raced in range inside and
lacked a closing bid. ALLWORTHY trailed in the four path.

Footnotes
OUR NOBLE ORTEGA stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, drew clear around the far turn, continued on the left lead in
the lane and held clear under a drive. POETIC CODE settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, could not threaten
the winner in the lane but won a late battle for the place. GLORY AND VICTORY raced off the pace three wide around the first turn and four wide around
the far turn, rallied through the lane and just missed second. GRAVE DANGER tracked the pace four wide, bid three wide around the far turn and flattened
out in the lane. J P CORNETTA failed to menace while racing three wide. PAPA CHARLES played no factor while racing four and five wide.
SEVENTYTIMESSEVEN was off slow, steadied incessantly and never threatened. BROADWAY RUCKUS chased the pace two wide and retreated around
the far turn. JOHNNIE GOT JETS was up close inside and was through after a half. GOLDEN WONDER set the pace in the two path, was collared entering
the far turn and retreated inside.
