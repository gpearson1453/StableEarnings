EROTIC vied for the lead while racing two-wide, took command nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. SHIFTY DANCER saved ground setting
the pace, responded when headed, was no match for the winner but continued on well for the place. PARTY FOR ONE stalked the pace while racing
three-wide but lacked a response when asked. CLARENCE HEADS dropped back early, saved ground and failed to threaten. SMOKE AND BURN was not
a factor while racing three-wide.

YES YOUR GRAZE dueled for the lead from along the inside and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive. IT'S CURLIN TIME disputed the pace
throughout from along the outside, wasn't quite good enough but continued on gamely for the place. SACAGEWEA stalked the pace racing three-wide and
was making up ground late. TYCHE AWAITS YOU dropped back early, saved ground and found her best stride too late. I AM YOURS was three-wide on
the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.

TENGO SED prompted the pace while racing two-wide, took the lead mid stretch and gradually drew clear. BRONY BOY saved ground setting the pace,
responded when asked but was no match for the winner. NORSKI saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch and finished in a
mild rally. TRIBAL IMPACT steadied briefly in tight between horses nearing the half mile pole, found room nearing the quarter pole, angled out and finished
willingly. MISO FAST was unhurried early while racing slightly off the rail, angled in for the drive and failed to threated. LICORICE DROP POPS was
forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and gave way after a half mile.
