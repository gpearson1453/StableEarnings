Footnotes
KLOEPATRA broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue
from the outside of that rival through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late over that stubborn rival to prevail.
AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS away alertly and broke outward to bump with CHABI in the opening strides, rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead from
the inside of KLOEPATRA entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, fought to match strides with
that rival entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while proving clearly second best. MISS THE HYPE settled at the back of the pace while racing
two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove best of the
rest. CHABI was bumped in the opening strides, but raced into a a stalking trip from just off the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. OKANAGAN GOLD was pinched back slightly at the start, before rushing
up four wide into the first turn to race into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, struggled to stay within a striking position in the run to the final turn, and
weakened over the final furlong.

final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while being kept to task to prove much the best. WALKINTHEWALK settled at the back of a compact field
while racing one out from the rail entering he backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly while drifting at least six wide in the

entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. GROOVY GIRL stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing
three out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, but hung in the stretch while unable to sustain her bid. DO YOU WANNA GO

KHAIKY'S COMMAND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
maintained his advantage into the final turn, and widened his lead through the lane while under confident handling. YOU DON'T OWN ME was pinched after
the start, but raced into a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from
the rail in the drive to prove second best. REPRIMAND away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied
two wide through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to hold on for a share. EUROPEAN settled well off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and improved his position one out from the rail over the final
furlong without ever threatening. THE CHANCES R settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backside, rallied four wide entering the
final turn, but was unable to male a late impact while finishing five wide in the drive. MARTELLO away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground throughout, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SIR BARCLAY tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing five out from the rail, continued with a wide trip into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. SWORD FIGHTER
unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the field in the run to the final turn, and failed to produce a late run in a
dull effort.

U DID IT broke sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing rank behind a troubled foe, held a tracking trip in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, collared the leader entering the lane, and proved best while drawing clear late.
BELCARRA PARK away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backstretch while appearing to stumble midway down the backside, maintained her advantage into the final turn, was collared by U DID IT soon
after straightening for home, was no match for the winner late, but battled gamely to hold the place. SHAMRA stalked the leaders into the lane the first time
while being briefly put in tight quarters from between rivals, launched her bid two wide into the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the
drive. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES stalked the leader from along the rail entering he stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. SILK STILETTOS stalked the leader into the first turn while
racing two out from the rail, the saddle slipped entering the lane the first time and the horse was taken four wide to avoid causing trouble, remained well out
from the rail through the second turn, and was pulled up by the rider on the backstretch. SILK STILETTOS walked off under her own power following the
race.

RICHARDS COMMAND unhurried early while dropping back to trail, continued to bide her time at the back of the field while racing three out from the rail
entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn while looping the field, collared the pacesetter leaving the turn and quickly
assumed command, and held MAKIN IT UP safely at bay late to prove best. MAKIN IT UP settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside
entering the stretch the first time, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly two
out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. HARLAN'S ANGEL raced to the lead three wide entering the lane the first time, set a pressured pace
from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was collared entering the lane, and outfinished late while
holding on for a share. ZETAMARIE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced her rally from
along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid while finishing two wide in the drive. TAKE CHARGE GWEN tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, forced the issue two wide from between rivals in the run down the backside, rallied two wide
into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. ANIMA away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the
rail, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. There was a
jockey's claim of foul following the running of this race. The rider of MAKIN IT UP lodged a claim of foul against the rider of RICHARDS COMMAND for
alleged interference entering the lane. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish. The one mile
split for this race was currently unavailable
