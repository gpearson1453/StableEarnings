THRILL OF THE NITE opened up early, challenged into turn, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, dug in gamely to turn back one rival and hold off
the other late. PRAIRIE MAGIC, well placed inside early, waited briefly into the turn, stalked duel off rail through the turn, gave best outside in the drive, was
gaining late. ARTISAN DANCER advanced to duel outside turn and stretch, gave way grudgingly. FLYTHROUGHTRAFFIC trailed to stretch, passed tired
rivals. DAZZLING GOLD stalked off rail, faded. MAIBELLA stalked wide, faded.
