stretch and gamely prevailed. BEING BLESSED bumped with RIVER TIBER at the start, dueled inside that rival for command to the stretch, fought back
from inside through the lane and finished gamely to the wire but had to settle for second best. TAKEITTOTHEBANK fractious in the gate, got crowded and
force to check between rivals early, went two then three wide on the turn, tipped out into the stretch and was along for the show. PAUL L chased the dueling
pair from inside, saved ground through the turn and lacked a late bid. HEY JASPER sat off the pace early, went three deep into the turn, remained off the
rail to the stretch and failed to menace. CALDER VALE saved ground near the back and never got involved. WINK AND A DREAM chased off the rail, three

Footnotes
THE BEAT tracked on the inside early, moved off the rail on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch, reached the front past the three-sixteenths
pole, cleared inside rival and held in the closing moments. VERRAGIO dueled for the lead from inside, got bumped from outside then steadied when forced
in tight by the riderless horse, continued to duel with GOING AWAY PARTY up the backstretch, disposed of that rival at the top of the stretch, lost command
past the three-sixteenths pole and chased the leader into the final furlong, then came back on late inside the winner but ran out of time. GOING AWAY
PARTY dueled for command outside VERRAGIO, got put in tight by the riderless horse and was forced to check at the five-eighths pole, resumed the duel
with VERRAGIO after recovering, fought through the far turn in the three path, lost contact at the top of the stretch and stayed on to secure the show. THE
BLACK ALBUM (FR) stalked four wide on the first turn then got floated out when UNBROKEN STAR unseated his rider and came out a bit, chased the top
pair four then five wide around the far turn and weakened. UNBROKEN STAR broke a step slow, chased in the three path into the first turn, jumped the
shadow from the light tower on the bend and unseated his rider, went up to bother the dueling pair at the five-eighths pole, ran around the track and was
caught following the race and walked off. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN AND RULED THAT UNBROKEN STAR
CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS BY JUMPING THE SHADOW OF THE LIGHTTOWER, UNSEATING THE RIDER IN PROCESS AND THERE WOULD
BE NO CHANGE.

BEIGNET broke inward then went up to take control from inside but became rank into the first turn, kicked clear nearing the half-mile pole, drifted out into
the stretch, continued to drifted out further in the lane, lost command with a sixteenth remaining, then dug in late and edged NO PEOPLE for the victory. NO
PEOPLE settled on the inside, coaxed while moving out to the two path on the far turn, bid inside the BEIGNET nearing the eighth pole, took over with a
sixteenth to go but was overtaken in the closing moments. PRINCESS CATERINA chased three to four wide on the first turn, angled to the rail on the

stalked the leader outside a rival on the backstretch, went three wide into the second bend, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and
weakened. BEA MISCHIEF tracked five to six wide around the first turn, went two wide into the second bend then steered to the rail, saved ground to the

Footnotes
EARLY RELEASE set the pace up the backstretch, met the challenge from HOT MEMORIES on the turn, inched cleared in the two path, tested again by
that rival in the lane and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. HOT MEMORIES chased off the rail early, bid outside on the turn, lost touch into the stretch then
came up to challenge again, could not kick on with the winner in deep stretch but kept on to hold second. ANTICIPATED broke in, chased along the inside
then two wide into the stretch, summoned a mild response and gained the show honors. MR. FIGHTER was off slow and came in at the start, raced off the
rail near the back, rounded the turn two to three wide, produced a mild rally in tandem with ANTICIPATED and gained a minor award. VENDAVAL forwardly
placed from inside early, came out leaving the turn and flattened in the stretch. SANTIAGO'S CAT broke in and bumped rival, tracked out of range to the
turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. ANGELA'S ANGEL got bumped from outside at the start, trailed three wide into the
turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. RUN JONESZ BEGONEZ traveled in mid-pack early on, rounded the bend four wide and came
up empty.

Footnotes
LIAR LIAR broke a step slow, went up to vie for the lead inside a pair of rivals, dueled with FORT BRIDGER around the bend, drifted three wide into the
stretch, brushed past the quarter pole, held a short lead into the final furlong and gamely prevailed. KIMMER scrambled leaving the gate, trailed early and
raced along the rail into the turn, saved ground then tipped out at the top of the stretch, closed fast inside the top pair and missed. FORT BRIDGER vied
between rivals up the backstretch, dueled outside LIAR LIAR on the turn, got floated out to the four path leaving the turn, brushed with LIAR LIAR in upper
stretch, kept the pressure on through the lane, lacked the needed late punch in the final sixteenth but finished a game third. FLYING CHARLIE tracked four
wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more in the final sixteenth. MR. TOUCHE vied three
deep to the turn, chased the top pair five wide into the stretch and was no match in the final furlong. MR. CLUTCH hopped at the start, chased the top trio
from inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
ACT OF SERENDIPITY pressed the pace three deep to the stretch, moved inside the leader in the lane, re-bid with a furlong left to run, took over shortly
after and edged away. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS broke a bit slow and came in, chased the top quartet in the two path through the turn, finished well in deep
stretch but ran out of time. A GOOD LAW set the pace under pressure from both sides, carried a short lead into the stretch, led four deep into the final
furlong, relinquished the advantage to the winner and saved the show. SPOOKY LADY raced up close four deep into and around the bend, fought five deep
into the final furlong and lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. WISHING ON A STAR was off a bit slow and came in at the start, went up to
press the pace along the inside, fought on into the final furlong and flattened late.

PEDRO PEREZ bumped at the start, pressed the pace from outside, chased past the three-eighths pole, re-bid in upper stretch, took over with
three-sixteenths remaining and drove clear. STAR ENTRY bumped leaving the gate, chased out of range off the rail, went four then five wide around the
turn, rallied late and gained the place. CATBERNAY took small hop at the start then went up to stalk the top pair from outside, bid three deep in upper
stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. RUNAWAY WYWY came away well from inside, set the pace under pressure from PEDRO PEREZ, cleared that
rival around the turn, challenged again in upper stretch and lost command with three-sixteenths remaining, then weakened in the final furlong. PERFECTO
AMOR stumbled badly at the start, chased five then six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
VELLA chased on the inside out of range, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied and drew alongside the top pair at the eighth pole, then drew clear in deep
stretch. ENSLEYS DREAM sped to the front from inside, challenged from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, resisted to the eighth pole then gave up
command and held the place. SPANISH CHANNEL bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, bid outside the pacesetter at the five-sixteenths,
contested the lead into the final furlong and could not summon the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. TIZZY TWISTER broke in and bumped rival at the
start, got crowded between foes shortly after, went two wide into the stretch and improved position. SWEET CALIFORNIA tracked wide up the backstretch,
raced outside the top trio leaving the backstretch, got bothered entering the turn, went five then four wide around the bend and could not summon the
needed response in the drive. PAWNEE lost his path early and dropped back, went three wide around the turn, tipped out into the stretch and failed to make
an impact. KETCHUP raced up close the leader early, drifted out around the turn, then faded down the stretch.
