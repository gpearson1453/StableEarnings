Footnotes
OUTOFNOTHINGATALL took command soon after the start, expanded that advantage late turn under a hand ride, steadily increased that advantage
without feeling the crop to win ridden out. STHEPANIE PRINCESS away in good order, chased the winner off the inside throughout, could do little with that
one, held sway for the place. LAST OF THE NILE off a step slow, trailed, moved out to the three path soon after, lugged in upper stretch, was straightened,
failed to muster a closing response. RAISE THE PRAISE went one paced throughout while saving ground.

Footnotes
HARLANS WARRIOR sprinted clear soon after the start, stretched that advantage out through the turn along the inside, continued to hold a sizable
advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to withstand the runner up. DA DUE RUN RUN reared at the break to spot the field several lengths, trailed
into the turn, came four wide for the drive and was steadily getting to the winner late, ran of of real estate. VELVET ISLE unprepared for the start, recovered
to race in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, lost some position in upper stretch, came back for the show while not a threat to the top two.
OPPS MY BAD back off the early pace, moved closest to the winner from between horses late in the turn, lacked a further response in the drive. POINT OF
VICTORY closest to winner early toward the inside, fell back turn, continued to tire stretch.

Footnotes
BLAZING CHARM allowed the two leaders to go early, in hand while still chasing up the backstretch, advanced and challenged that pair in the three path
turning for home, quickly clear, no threatened to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. GEORGIA DAWN last away, trailed while off the inside
outside the winner, followed that one into the stretch in the three path, roused, rallied steadily for the place, no threat to that same rival. TOTAL MALICE
moved up to duel off the inside, alternated up the backstretch in the two path, weakened when the winner went by entering the stretch, chased that one past
the furlong marker, caught late for the second spot. CATCAKE away in good order, showed the way into the first turn, dueled inside the middle half mile,
also faltered when the winner took over exiting the final turn.

Footnotes
MARVINS GOLD in the second flight outside, advanced three wide to challenge late final turn, four wide into lane, drifted in floating the runner up inward a
furlong out, light brush, displayed good determination to narrowly prevail in determined fashion. CHARLIE'S STAR off a step slow, moved up past the wire
the first turn, settled in the second flight inside the winner up the backstretch, moved with that one to challenge turning for home while between foes, dueled
past midstretch, floated in, light brush with the winner, outkicked by that one late, clearly second best. DARK MATTER set the early pace inside, dueled the
middle half closest to the inside, offered little resistance to the top two entering the stretch, comfortably saved the show. TOUGH START off a bit slow,
lacked speed, off the inside into the far turn, dropped to the rail and improved position without posing a serious threat. I'M A FLASHY KID fell back to trail
after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CONQUISTADOR GOLD underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke on top,
pressed the issue the opening quarter, moved up to duel afterward in the two path, gave way in the far turn. ROYAL SOLUTION in mid pack early, was
finished after a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

BUNKIE'S SONG broke with the field, chased the lead trio for a half, roused, drifted in a bit past the furlong marker, was righted, split foes late with good
determination and was up late in time. ENCHANTED MOON with the pace from the start inside, held a narrow advantage into and through the turn, shook
briefly clear in midstretch, nailed in the waning strides. MINISTER'S MEDAL broke with the field, vied up front between rivals and outside the runner up, fell
back off that one when straightened for home, coming again for the runner up spot. SR. CLARKY void of speed in trailing much of the way, came in the two
path for the drive, showed some mild, belated interest in traffic late to improve slightly. DESIARD with the pace outside, continued to vie while three wide
through the turn, gave way in the drive. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY back off the pace and the inside, was four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a closing
kick.

BRYKEN N MITCHELL pressed the leader in the two path, brief challenge from the outside turning for home, fell back slightly, rebid late, wore down that
same leader while fully extended and holding off a second foe from the outside at the wire. HILLCREST DRIVE moved inside to show the way up the
backstretch and into the turn, responded when challenged into the lane, expanded that advantage a bit nearing midstretch, responded once again when
challenged by that same foe late, gave ground grudgingly to narrowly miss. PEANUT N IKE last to leave, settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into
the stretch, steadily getting to the. LUCK OF THE STARS headed up the second flight while racing in the three path, came up empty for the drive.
QUADRAJET was finished early, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
MIZZEN MONARCH last away, remained unhurried the opening quarter, moved closer in the three path before a half, moved to challenge on the outside
turning for home, took over just before a furlong remained, headed soon after by the runner up, battled back and dug in late to narrowly prevail. MS. CAJUN
QUEEN lacked early speed along with the winner, angled out to be four wide into the straight, outside bid, briefly put a head in front just inside the furlong
marker, outgamed by the winner while outside that one. HERE COMES LOVIE back off the pace in the second flight, moved closer to lodge a brief
challenge between rivals exiting the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. LUTIE MO dueled early closest to the inside, put that rival
away turning into the stretch, was challenged by the top two soon after and faltered. START WELL dueled up front in the two path, gave way late from
between rivals late in the final turn.

RESPECT ALL with the early pace three wide out of the gate, dueled into the turn, put that foe away midway on the bend to be clear, continued to hold a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, found more when challenged late to prevail in game fashion. CUSTOM GUITAR behind the lead pack outside,
raced three wide through the turn when beginning to advance, challenged outside the winner late, denied. T J'S SUNSHINE dueled up front early inside the
winner, fell back off that one turn, no match for the runner up in the drive, remained clear of the others. SABERFIGHT off slowly to trail early, advanced a bit
off the inside into the lane, lugged past the furlong marker, finished up evenly in failing to pose a threat to the top three. LA LOLA in the second flight early,
had little left for the drive. DIAMONDS SHINING mid pack, bore out badly late in the turn and did not recover. COZZY KISS remained back to be always
outrun.
