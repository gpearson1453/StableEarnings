Footnotes
UTTERLY COURAGEOUS was taken to the inner rail in the opening sixteenth and settled off of a contested pace, moved up while saving ground in mid
stretch, altered out for room with a sixteenth remaining, closed determinedly outside rivals and got up under a drive. IN VAIN got engaged in a pace battle
toward the rail soon after the break, got the better of SILVER'S GIRL entering the lane then dug in when confronted by QUEEN SHEBA, carried that battled
to the wire and stayed on gamely while getting the bob for the place. QUEEN SHEBA broke a step slow, edged up soon after and tracked the leaders, sat
patiently mid turn, eased out and moved to join IN VAIN soon into the stretch, dueled valiantly to the wire and just missed between rivals. FLIMSY , in the
clear mid turn, angled five wide for the drive and closed steadily. DIVINE FASHION , away forwardly, drafted back off the pace, raced two wide into the lane,
edged up past mid stretch and churned on. SMART EULEE , off the pace, angled six wide for the drive and had belated action while not threatening. LADY
MOSLER , well placed stalking the leaders three wide, shifted four wide into the lane, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. FASHIONISTA ,
outside a rival and under asking mid turn, failed to rally. SILVER'S GIRL had speed and dueled outside IN VAIN, stayed on past the three eighths, wandered
outward a bit entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
HAYNE'S FEVER sprinted clear soon after the break, saved ground around the turn, was under urging in the drive and lasted. CAMP PENDLETON stalked
the pace, was four deep leaving the backstretch, circled horses three wide around the turn, had aim on the leader in mid stretch and flattened out. JAMMIN
STILL , in the two path chasing the winner around the turn, finished evenly. EXCALIBUR chased the early pace, dropped back a bit on the turn, swung to
the six path turning for home and lacked the necessary rally. AL BROWN hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
weakened. MAMAIGOTTHIS was outrun.

Footnotes
WHISPURRING KITTEN broke sharply then was rated back off the pace and saved some ground, moved up under a light hold while two wide nearing the
lane, swung out to about the five path for a clear run leaving the quarter pole, closed strongly under asking to take command a sixteenth out then eagerly
drew clear. DENDROBIA settled off the pace while saving ground, was guided outward leaving the three sixteenths and rallied. MATTITUDE broke a step
slow, was hustled up and quickly reached and tracking spot outside the leader, moved up under asking and bid for command in mid stretch, dueled to the
sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. ELLANATION stalked three wide, shifted out in the drive but needed more between runners. EPIC IDEA , off the
pace and three wide approaching the stretch, swung out widest past the quarter pole and offered a mild run. CAN'T BUY LOVE , well placed while tracking
inside, edged up past mid stretch, made a brief bid between foes then faded. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA sped clear, set the pace towards the rail, was
confronted heading to mid stretch, dueled briefly then gave way.

Footnotes
NO ANGEL prompted the pace outside HE ROLLS, overtook that one in upper stretch then drew away under steady handliing. SUPERSTITIEUX saved
ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and had a slight rally. HE ROLLS saved ground around the turn setting the pace, lost the
lead in upper stretch, raced in the two path through the stretch, remained on his left lead and weakened. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS , four deep leaving the
backstretch, circled hoses around the turn, failed to switch to his proper lead until approaching the sixteenth pole and gave way. LAW OF THE JUNGLE
lacked speed, swung outside mid way on the turn and was not a factor. DOMINGUEZ was no factor. QAADER , outrun, swung to the four path leaving the
turn.

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE , nudged off the rail and within range of a three way scramble up front, swung five wide into the lane, leveled off to a nice stride
when put to left handed asking near the three sixteenths, moved up outside rivals to challenge soon past mid stretch, gained command late, switched over
to his left lead and was edging away. MOMOS broke well and dueled inside a pair of foes, held a slim advantage entering the stretch, responded when put
to firm encouragement nearing the furlong grounds, dug in when met with fresh challenges, kept on with the advantage past the sixteenth marker and
finished gamely. LOVE YOU MUCH , in the clear stalking the embattled leaders, angled four wide into the lane, moved up between rivals to threaten in mid
stretch, fought on past the sixteenth pole then hung. WHERE YOU WAS , off the pace three wide, moved up nearing mid stretch then failed to seriously
sustain. TOMMY SHELBY lacked speed, saved ground into the lane, moved up to be in range past the eighth pole then came up empty. NUCLEAR
OPTION , away alertly, disputed the pace between runners and held a short lead into the turn, ceded the lead approaching the stretch, stayed on to spar
outside MOMOS past mid stretch then weakened. BLESSED ARION , off the pace while saving ground, steadied briefly into the turn, angled out but failed to
muster up the needed run. VALUED NOTION forced the pace three deep to upper stretch then weakened.

KOBE TOUGH , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up turning for home and was under brisk urging late. SUE LOVES
BARBADOS lacked speed, was behind horses entering the turn, swung five deep entering the stretch and closed outside rivals. BY THE SEY SHORE , off
the rail leaving the turn, worked between horses through the stretch and rallied. MONSTER MASON , four wide on the turn, chased the winner through the
stretch and faded. BOURBON AND ICE raced in the four path between horses in mid stretch and lacked a rally. HE'S ORIENTATE , well off the rail chasing
the winner around the turn and in upper stretch, drifted in approaching the eighth pole when tiring. PRINCE PERE , snugly rated down the backstretch,
steadied at the head of the stretch, hugged the inner rail and was checked in tight quarters behind HE'S ORIENTATE in mid stretch. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN
, three wide on the turn, chased the pace, weakened and was caught in close quarters near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
FREE SQUARE stalked outside the leader, moved the challenge three wide nearing the quarter pole, was floated out a bit entering the lane, dueled under
strong handling, kept on doggedly to get the better of LANTAU in deep stretch and prevailed. LANTAU broke sharply and was urged clear, set the pace near
the rail, dug in when confronted approaching the stretch, wandered out a bit then straightened, held a tenuous advantage battling past the sixteenth pole
then wasn't quite good enough in a sharp effort. YO NESSROUNDONKERN , off the pace while saving ground, edged up a bit as the duel developed past
the three sixteenths but needed more through the final sixteenth. KOZY'S WILDCAT , taken to rate off the speeds, stalked inside, shifted out nearing the
quarter pole, gave futile chase past the eighth pole and faded. NEVER SILENCED , bobbled then was in tight at the break, dropped well back into the turn,
was under asking three wide into the lane, shifted in some and continued with effort. MR. MOX , three to four wide with pursuit, gave way through the drive.
