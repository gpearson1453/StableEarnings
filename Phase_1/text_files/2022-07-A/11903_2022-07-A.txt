Footnotes
LYINATTHEBAR was sent to the early lead, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting moderate fractions, was clear approaching the quarter
marker, lost the lead in upper stretch to LAKAYA, came again in the final furlong and held safely in the end to prevail. LAKAYA settled three wide off of the
early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, overtook LYINATTHEBAR in upper stretch to lead
nearing the eighth pole, could not hold off the winner when she re-rallied in the final stages and was outfinished, while besting the rest. MOTHERS DREAM
settled just off of the early pace, gained ground along the backstretch run, was outrun on the far turn and was no match for the top pair in the drive, while
clear of the rest for third. ON VACATION was forwardly placed into the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn and
did not offer a late response. LEFT EYE was off a bit slowly but recovered to be close to the pace into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter through the
backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

AWAY FROM THE SUN broke alertly and showed good early speed while in hand, vied for the lead nearing the turn then took command midway through
the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and was hand urged to the wire. DO YOU HEAR THAT took back off of the quick early pace and tracked the
speed into the turn, came three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in the drive and just held for second. TIP TOP GAL contested the quick early
pace with AWAY FROM THE SUN, gave ground to that foe along the turn, made a mild late rally in the drive and just missed for second at the end while
holding for third. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN lacked early speed, came two wide to the quarter pole while trailing, was able to mount a mild late rally in the drive
and just missed for third in the final strides. HOT RAGEOUS chased the early pace, came three to four wide approaching the top of the stretch, was put to
steady urging in the lane and could not find the needed late response.

Footnotes
MISS MAIA was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, ran evenly to the quarter marker, mounted an inside rally in upper
stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker and bumped DADDYS NINA, edged to a narrow lead inside of the eighth pole and was kept to task in the end
to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. TAMANTARI showed speed while close to the early pace, lost ground while four wide nearing the quarter pole,
closed in upper stretch, continued that advance through the final furlong and was held at bay by the winner in the end, while well clear of the rest for the
place. QUICK TAKE chased the early pace to the turn, ran evenly while five wide nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a
late rally, while holding for third in the end. OH TRUTHY contested the early pace, vied for the lead along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. DADDYS NINA showed good early speed and was sent leaving the break, set contested fractions through the turn, came
under pressure leaving the quarter pole, was bumped and shuffled back nearing the eighth pole and gave way in the final furlong. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING MISS MAIA AND DADDYS NINA AND IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER BASED ON THAT INCIDENT.

A BIT MUCH was hustled leaving the gate and set disputed early fractions, inched away on the turn while showing good speed, extended the lead in upper
stretch and kicked clear in the end. SEIGE THE DAY tracked the quick pace to the turn, ran evenly to the quarter pole while saving ground, was outkicked
by his stablemate in the final stages but stayed on to be best of the rest. MOTHER'S PRAYER took back and stalked the quick early pace, gained ground
on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong, while clear of the rest for third. PREM ON SATURDAY lacked early speed, came
three wide to the quarter pole and could not muster a late rally. OLD SEVENTEEN broke out at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the quick early
pace and was not a factor. IRISH IMMIGRANT was crowded a bit at the start by A BIT MUCH and contested the early lead with that rival, pressed the quick
pace through the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
SAFE COMBINATION was hustled leaving the start and stalked the early pace, made a middle move to take command into the second turn, was confronted
by OH GREAT in upper stretch, lost the lead to that foe nearing the eighth pole, determinedly came again in the final stages and won the nod on the line.
OH GREAT (IRE) settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, made an inside rally nearing the quarter pole, headed SAFE
COMBINATION in upper stretch and inched to a narrow lead nearing the eighth pole, battled with the winner to the line and was nipped for the win in a
game runner-up effort. PERSEVERANCE stalked the early pace while four wide, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground along the
second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but the top pair and just saved third over an oncoming rival. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was unhurried in the early
stages, gained ground while trailing along the backstretch run, continued that steady gain on the far turn, closed in the drive and just missed for the show.
ROARING TIGER settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground on the far turn, was in tight and lacked room
nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. FULL OF LIFE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was
overtaken by the winner nearing the half-mile marker, stayed on in pursuit of SAFE COMBINATION through the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DANCING SOUL broke in at the start, tracked the quick pace to the turn, came three wide while maintaining position to the quarter pole, was set down for
the drive and wore down rivals inside of the final furlong to prevail. HARD TO FOOL broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions through the
turn, came under pressure nearing the eighth pole, was all out in the final stages and was overtaken by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker, while
holding for second in the end. BACKSTREET AFFAIR was off a bit slowly, chased the pace from the second flight, saved ground through the turn, advanced
in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final stages, while just missing for second. GOVERNOR SPECIAL
chased the quick pace from a three wide path, ran evenly through the turn and into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. DELIA MO was off slowly and
lacked early speed, came widest through the turn and was not a threat in the late stages. MILITARY PRINCESS tracked the quick early pace, lost position
while two wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. TRUE COMFORT was off a bit slowly, chased the early pace to the turn, gained ground from a
four wide path nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain that run in the drive and flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SACRED RIDER stalked the pace from a three then four wide path on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused along the
far turn and mounted a five wide bid into the drive, overtook the leading pair approaching the eighth pole and pulled away in the final stages. PAINT ME
LUCKY settled off of the early pace while outside of rivals, ran evenly through the backstretch run, was asked for run on the far turn and made a six wide
move into the stretch, came within aim in mid-stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong, while securing second at the end. CLAIM OF PASSION broke
alertly and led the field into the first turn, took back off of the lead and prompted the pace through the backstretch run, chased in pursuit of the pacesetter on
the far turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished while holding safely for third.
HOLY GHOST was unhurried early on, gained ground along the backstretch run, was asked for run on the far turn and could not muster a late rally in the
stretch. NOWHERE MAN settled off of the early pace while never far back, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn
and did not offer a late bid. J T'S WATCH was sent leaving the break and took command of the early pace along the first turn, set moderate fractions
through the backstretch run and into the second turn, was confronted in upper stretch, stayed on to the eighth pole and faded in the final stages.
