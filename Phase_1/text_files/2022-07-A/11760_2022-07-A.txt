nearing the turn, mostly saved ground well back, angled four wide near the quarter pole and had no rally. LIGHT AND PATH played no factor while racing

LOGICO set the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn and widened under steady urging. RUTHLESS INTENT chased the pace four wide and stayed
on to be clearly second best. ANTHRACITE prompted the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn and held well enough for
the show. SOUTHERN BREEZE steadied while appearing to try to duck into the gap leaving the chute, vied inside of the winner down the backstretch and
retreated around the turn. TARAASHOQ stumbled at the start and was always far back. TACTICAL CHEECH had only brief speed while racing two wide.

PURE SPEIGHT dueled two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. SI COMO NO stalked the pace three wide, steadied near the
quarter pole, idled in upper stretch, shifted further out leaving the eighth pole and rallied for the place. STARTING UP bumped with ON JET HEIR twice
early, tracked the pace two wide, swung four wide near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane and lost second late. SUMMER
ASH was off slow, was bumped early, raced three wide around the turn and rallied belatedly. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES advanced four wide around the turn, bid
near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. ON JET HEIR bounced around early, raced four and five wide and never threatened. FEDERAL
EXCHANGE failed to menace while racing two wide. PERFECT PICTURE dueled inside of the winner to upper stretch and tired. THE RED WRAITH trailed
inside.

LET'S BE HONEST stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared and held clear under a drive. STARSHIP
NUGGET lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. NO DECAF threw her head at the start
then came out and bumped PACIFIC PRINCESS soon after, had early speed, chased three wide around the turn and held well enough for the show. FOXY
LADY gave chase two wide and lacked a closing bid. EMIRATES AFFAIR prompted the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, was
soon collared by the winner and faded inside. PACIFIC PRINCESS was bumped soon after the start, raced three wide and made little impact.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN was outrun inside and was easing through the lane. CHITIENNE set the pace along the rail, stopped after a half and was eased in
the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
WITH LIBERTY set a clear pace inside and widened under a drive. MUDSHAFT chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
stayed on to be clearly second best. ULTIMATE BREEZE raced four wide in midpack and was along for the show. TRULY A DREAM failed to menace while
racing two wide. UNCAPTURED FAITH saved ground to no avail. PANTHER COMMAND chased the winner two wide and tired in the lane. THE JOKES
ON ME broke out and bumped SHE FOOLED YOU at the start, raced very wide while getting out most of the way and never threatened. SHE FOOLED
YOU was bumped at the start, saved ground and was never close.
