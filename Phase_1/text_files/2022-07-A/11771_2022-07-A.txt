Footnotes
WRAPPED lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards to be going away
late. WILLY TELL HIM was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly opened a
clear margin, drifted out late and could not resist the winner from over the top. FABOZZI pressed the pace from between foes, steady late and lost chance
for better placing. COYSTER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. STELLARSBLUERIBBON
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SILVERS BLING was forwardly placed from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF FABOZZI IN
THE FINAL YARDS AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED WILLY TELL HIM HAD DRIFTED OUT AND CAUSED THE INCIDENT AND
DISQUALIFIED WILLY TELL HIM FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM THIRD. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
drew clear. BAND OF GLORY was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out approaching the stretch, drifted in to bump rival nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly when clear. ALLIE'S PAL sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by
GRACEANNE nearing the quarter, and gave way in the final sixteenth. GRACEANNE was hustled along to offer a three-wide bid nearing the quarter, vied
with ALLIE'S PAL, was bumped nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. FI FI D'ORO lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. TIZ MY HOUR broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE RIDER OF GRACEANNE LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST BAND OF GLORY CONCERING THE BUMPING AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
