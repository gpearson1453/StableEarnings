MR. K W bumped on both sides at the start then raced back to the turn made a bid going into the turn and took the lead at the quarter pole to draw clear and
held on. TOOCAN DANCE engaged the leader from the inside to deep stretch then gave a late effort and missed the win. HALF A BUCK tracked the
leaders from the three path to the turn then made a four wide rally but was no match for the top two. LIT A SHUCK broke out and bumped foe at the start
then was hustled to a pressured lead from the two path and gave way in mid stretch. SHANKINSTINE broke in slightly and was void of early speed but was
never a factor. PETEY slipped at the start and lost traction behind and was never in contention.

JOEBOY saved ground around the first turn and steadily advanced up the rail to the final turn then gained the clear lead in upper stretch and held sway. RY
DONT LIE vied for the lead from the four path through the first turn and down the backstretch made a three wide bid in the middle of the final turn, engaged
the leader around the quarter pole but couldn't match strides in the drive. THISGUYCANFLY broke outward at the start then raced in the middle of the pack
made a mild bid on the final turn to prove best of the rest. GUARDSMAN PASS was unhurried to the final turn but was never a serious factor. BAYOU
SARGE was in the five path around the first turn and raced back but was never a threat. OBVIOUSLY TOO tracked the leaders from the two path for a half
and retreated. TAPPED OUT went to the lead from the three path for three quarters and gave way.

paced. DREWSILLA was forced out slightly at the start then was in the four path on the first turn settled in the middle of the pack in the three path and raced
evenly. JAZLA was in the five path into the first turn, was unhurried but was never a threat.

GUNNER PAUL dueled from the two path and inched away at the five sixteenths pole and pulled away at the quarter pole to prove best. STEALING
APRIORITY dueled from the inside to mid turn couldn't match strides with leader and was clearly second best. MY BOY SAM stalked the pace from the
three path made a bid into the turn but was no match for the top two. SIR OVERANALYZE trailed the field into the turn then made a three wide bid went
even wider into the stretch but was not a factor. OSO NEGRO tracked the leaders from the inside but failed to menace. EXCLAIM was never a threat.
