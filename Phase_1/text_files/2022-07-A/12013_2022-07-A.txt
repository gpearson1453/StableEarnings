Footnotes
THE FEATURE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, remained in the three path while gaining momentum into the lane while still in the
three path, caught the leader outside the eighth pole, cleared and held. SHIPSHAPE was in the two path through the turn when moving closer, came into
the lane from the four or five path and rallied for the place spot. HARD NIGHT was unhurried early while in the two path, came into the lane two wide,
guided to the four path through the lane and finished with good energy. RECKLESSNESS was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from
the six path and finished evenly. ALPINE GHOST chased the pace from the three path through the turn, had aim on the leader when straightened then tired.
RHYTHMIC RULER set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way along the rail. CAN MAN DO raced in the three path through the turn then
trailing, swung into the lane from the eight path and never was a factor. OVERTHOUGHT saved ground through the turn and and was empty turning into the
lane.

FIFTY TWO PICKUP bumped at the start, moved up two wide through the turn to challenge for the lead, cleared into the lane while in the three path then
drew away while being kept to the task. KENZIE LOU trailed for half while in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
was gaining to the end while well clear of the others. TEQUILA REVOLUTION was near the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and
never was a threat while moving up a spot to gain the minor share. LILY'S TRUMPET set the pace into the turn while along the inside, dueled with two
others through late turn and faded. MY HONEY'S PERFECT stepped in at the start and bumped rival, hustled up to vie three wide through the turn then was
empty after entering the lane.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE set the pace while under pressure from along the inside, shook clear in mid-turn while rider peeked back, continued to extend the
advantage into the lane and was ridden out while not seriously threatened through the lane. SINGSONG BIRD was jostled between rivals at the start, raced
in the inside into the far turn, took off after the winner into late turn, could not gain on that one while finishing well clear of the others. SATIATE pressed the
pace three wide through the first turn, chased the pace through the far turn while in the two path and was not a threat while clear for the show spot.
TRAUMARAMA pressed the pace from along the inside into the far turn then faded after mid-turn. POLKA POLENTA was in the four path through the turns
when not far back then appeared disinterested when asked in late turn.

ANNA'S TRIBUTE pressed the early pace four wide into the turn, settled back to chase the pace into the lane from the four path, bid into the lane, caught
the leader inside the sixteenth pole and edged up. EXPRESS LADY dueled between early while in the two path, continued to vie for the lead through the
turn while still two wide, shook clear into the lane from the three path, was put under pressure with an eighth to go, dueled with that one to the sixteenth pole
and could not keep up late while clearly second best. Z'S LUCKY GIRL was in the four path through the turn and into the lane, moved up for the minor share
while not a threat to the top two. AMERICA RULES raced in the two or three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the three
path and offered a mild gain. SWEEPINJUSTICE raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. SISTER JUSTICE never a
factor while near the inside. BREAKUP WITH TITOS pressed the pace three wide into the turn then steadily faded. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE vied for the
lead along the inside through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
HENRIETTA TOPHAM set the pace from the two path from the outset, continued with a clear lead into the lane, rider asked for more while in a hand drive
and widened. COVENANT LADY tracked the pace from the inside throughout, was asked for more into the lane, could not gain on the top one and settled
for second best. MIZZEN ASH saved ground throughout and moved up for the show spot while not a serious threat. BE PATIENT stalked the pace from the
three path through the far turn, was asked for more into the lane and weakened. ONLY TIME raced in the two path through the turn while in mid-pack, was
in the four path through the far turn and into the lane and lacked a bid. MORE ROMANCE saved ground throughout and tired through the stretch run.
RICHEBOURG was in the two path through the turns and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
MISS LUV SHACK set the pace while under pressure into the turn, shook clear after mid-turn, widened into the lane when in a drive, extended to inside the
eighth pole then was kept to the task until late. TAP THE LINE was in the four to the five path through the turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from
the six path and moved up for the place spot and was clearly second best. MOLLY'S WARRIOR raced in the three or four path through the far turn when
never far back, straightened in the lane from the five path and moved up for the minor share. DARNELL in the four path through the turn when near the back
then improved position through the lane. HER WAY saved ground throughout and moved up while not a threat. VIVIJO was off awkwardly, raced near the
inside through the turn, was shuffled through late turn, came into the lane from the two path, shifted to mid-track and passed a couple.
UNFORGETABLENATALY was close up early, dropped back into the turn to chase the pace and had nothing to give after entering the lane. JACK'S
SUMMER bumped early, raced in back while in the four path, came into the lane from the eight path and never factored. SNUGGLER steadily faded from
the two path. SHOTGUN KATIE staled the the pace through the turn when well placed then was empty. ALLIE MAES REVENGE was outrun while racing in
the four path. ANGELSNDISGUISE was bumped at the start, tracked the pace along the inside into the lane then retreated.
