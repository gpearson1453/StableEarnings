Footnotes
ROSY CARTEL broke in two paths at the start, corrected, went straight till asked right handed, asked right handed once again and lugged in three lanes,
and held on under a hand ride. IM DELIGHTED off a bit slow, maintained a straight path throughout under constant right handed urging. KNOCK YOUR
FAVORITE away cleanly, kept to task under right handed urging in a improved effort. CORONA SUPRISE a bit fractious in the gate, broke well, drifted in
early, in tight late when being outkicked and took awkward steps approaching the wire. VELOZ restless in the gate, off a bit slow, stumbled and lost action
early, and under a tight hold to the wire. REMEMBER A GODDESS had head turned down and to towards the inside, came away slow while hitting the gate
and losing all chance.

drifting in two paths at the start, and finished well under a hand ride. HAY SHAKER bumped at the start, lugged out three paths early, and kept to task while
showing mild interest. HEATHER DENISE broke out and bumped rival at the start, bumped by same rival couple strides later, floated in a bit midway and
lacked rally while being in a uncomfortable spot. IWONTGIVEUPTHEPRIZE away cleanly, bumped off stride in second stride, the bump caused him to drift
in and bump with rival again, and lacked rally under mild urging and failed to fully extend. NOMAD TOO step slow while breaking out and bumped rival at
