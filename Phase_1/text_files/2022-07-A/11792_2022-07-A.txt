CAJUN GUMBOW broke out at the start, and brushed rival, then was quick to take the lead into the turn, then dueled with an outside rival, came on again
and kept on to the wire. APPROPRIATED FUNDS pressed the leader while two wide, was in a hard drive to duel with an inside rival in upper stretch, then
continued to dig in gamely but it was not enough and was second best. BOLD CONNECTION was squeezed at the start, then raced while five wide, was
gaining on the turn to make a mild bid in late stretch but it was too little too late. TEQUILA EMPIRE was unhurried early, then made a mild bid while five
wide n the stretch but was no threat. MISS CONTINENTAL bid while four wide in to the turn then flattened out in the end and was no factor. MO SILVER
chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back on the turn and failed to menace. HOT COOKIE was in close early then dropped back and was no
factor.

Footnotes
PRETTY IN PINK was unhurried early, was saving ground while three wide on the backstretch to rally on the far turn, gained command in upper stretch and
held on till the end to prevail. PRINCESS PAULINE settled in the two path to bid on the far turn, then angled out to the five path in the stretch and was
closing belatedly in the end. MIDYEAR was unhurried early then was in a steady drive to rally four wide on the far turn, but gave way for second place. CHA
CHA MISSION was unhurried early on the backstretch, then was gaining ground while five wide on the far turn then continued to close well in the end.
KEEP THE BLING raced while two wide into the far turn then rallied between rivals mid stretch and was closing willingly. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) settled
while two wide to bid on the far turn then came out six wide in the stretch and was no threat. STELLACZAR chased the pace from the inside into the stretch
and was no menace. PUMPKIN BREAD was unhurried early and no factor. TAYLOR'S SECRET set the pace on the backstretch, was hard used on the turn
and tired in the final furlongs. SWEET ADELINE stalked the pace while two wide then dropped back and failed to rally.
