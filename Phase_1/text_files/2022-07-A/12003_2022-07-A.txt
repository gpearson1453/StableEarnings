STUCK UP stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
and edged ahead in the final strides. TIDAL WATERS rated back in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead late and was outfinished. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to inside
the furlong marker, then weakened and held the show. BEAT THE DEALER never far back, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. HE'S ON THE FLY unhurried in the early going, looped up three and four wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. WHISKEY DASH ran evenly. AJZAL well placed, steadily lost ground.
