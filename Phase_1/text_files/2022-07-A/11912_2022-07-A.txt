Footnotes
SECRET HIDEAWAY was rated tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, was prompted to steadily gain on the leader in the three path racing through the
stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to narrowly prevail in time. NINE CROWNS was urged to force the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch, edged clear racing into upper stretch but was collared in the final strides. USA USA USA settled into stride racing out of striking distance off the
inside to the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch but had no closing bid. MIZ GISELA ducked in slightly at the start, was urged inside a rival
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. FAST N FEARLESS broke awkwardly, then was held up out of
close quarters just after the start while going a bit erratically on the backstretch and trailed the field into the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR BEA was rated off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out three wide entering the far turn while being prompted to
advance, was fanned four wide racing through the stretch challenging for command and drew clear under firm encouragement. WILDWOOD MAGGIE was
settled last to the backstretch, shifted outside foes racing four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to
narrowly prevail for the place honors late. BEYOND BROWN was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside
entering the far turn disputing the issue on a narrow advantage, dueled a bit off the rail into upper stretch and faded in the drive. CSILLA, forwardly placed
along the rail in the opening stages, saved ground to the lane tracking just off the leaders but had no closing bid. TIZ WONDERFULLY hesitated at the start
while breaking in the air, was prompted to advance on the leaders with an early move three deep after a half, pressed the issue in that path to upper stretch
striking the front but flattened out in the drive. REINA DEL SUR tracked off the first flight between foes to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MASTER GUNS broke readily, was urged pressing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage in upper stretch, then
continued with a grudging effort to hold RIDING THE TRAIN to the end under firm encouragement. The latter was rated just off the first flight near the inside
racing into the turn, tipped out three wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap to the end but just missed. THE Z MAN tracked off the first
flight outside a rival racing in the three path to the turn,, angled four wide midstretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. YANKEE INDIAN was
urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into upper stretch but weakened in late stages. GLASS EATER settled outside foes in early stages, was
fanned five wide racing through the stretch but made no impression. NAME REJECTED settled along the inside racing to the turn and proved no factor.

Footnotes
ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA broke readily, was rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance to the backstretch, gradually drew
into range along the inside nearing upper stretch, tipped outside the leader entering the lane, then took over and went well clear under firm handling. KAL
EL, bumped at the start, was righted to track the leaders outside foes in second flight racing in the three path to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into
upper stretch, exchanged some brushes with STRABELLA in late stages and just edged that foe for the place honors on the wire. STRABELLA was rated
off the second flight while shifting inwards to the two path racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position between foes just off the inside racing
into upper stretch, drifted a bit under pressure in the closing stages brushing a rival and was outkicked for second. AMARETTO DI AMORE broke sharply,
sprinted clear of the field along the inside racing to the far turn, held sway into upper stretch and abruptly gave out once headed by the winner. TEN
THOUSAND TIDES, reluctant to load, was settled into stride racing well off the leaders a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch and passed inside some
tiring rivals late. BACK TO SELLING, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the far turn, emptied out nearing
upper stretch, then lost some momentum when held up avoiding close quarters midstretch. HUNTER JUMPER was off last, settled along the inside and
failed to menace thereafter. TIGER HUNTER broke outwards bumping KAL EL, was switched out four wide racing to the backstretch while being prompted
to contend but emptied out early.

Footnotes
PAPA RIZZO broke inwards momentarily putting RIVER ROSE in tight quarters, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch,
held sway into the lane and was kept to firm right handed encouragement while maintaining the advantage. RIVER ROSE, caught in tight quarters at the
start, was urged three deep racing to the first turn to gain a forward placing, shifted inwards to track the pacesetter just off the inside to the far turn, couldn't
close the gap on the winner but proved best of the others. REMEMBER THE MAINE was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, tipped out
three wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. CASHANOVA tracked off the second flight outside a
rival to the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing into the stretch and continued with a mild bid while being outkicked for a share. JILOTEPEC came
through close quarters at the start to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. GAINER settled
last shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge. HOLY VOW angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part
of the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded after a half.

NACHO S broke inwards, was urged to gain a clear advantage while shifting inside racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace on a clear margin into
the bend, was headed racing into upper stretch but responded to strong handling to turn back MASTER RED in the final sixteenth. The latter, caught in tight
quarters, then held up momentarily at the start, was prompted to advance with a sharp move three deep racing into the bend to gain terms with the
pacesetter in upper stretch, moved to strike the front in the stretch but was outkicked to the wire. TIME TO SKIP TOWN tracked off the leaders four wide
between foes in the opening stages, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and was going well late. NEW DICE tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight, shifted out to race five wide between foes through the stretch but continued with interest to improve position. COAL TOWN ROAD, forwardly placed
along the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside racing into the turn to make brief pursuit of the pacesetter between foes, angled three wide
entering the lane and lacked the needed final kick. BON DEUX brushed the gate while getting away slowly, was prompted to gain position along the inside
racing to the bend, was held up momentarily in close quarters leaving the midway point of the turn, shifted out four wide entering the stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. DIABLO CUERNO settled between foes and continued evenly near the inside into the lane. VLOCK, hopped, then was immediately forced
out at the start while shifting into the path of MASTER RED, settled outside rivals in the last flight and proved no threat. SILLY BILLY ducked out at the start
bumping VLOCK and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MASTER RED LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE BREAK WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

the inside tracking just behind the second flight racing to the far turn, tipped out racing into the stretch while making steady progress between foes but was
outkicked for second. TREASURE RUN was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into upper
stretch but weakened late. NOBLE PURSUIT stumbled at the start, angled to the rail racing in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the
lane and continued evenly between foes. WHERE'S JORDAN was settled last while shifting off the inside to the backstretch, was fanned six wide in upper
stretch and gained some position while making no impact. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM switched outside foes tracking the leaders in second flight to the
backstretch, was caught four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and gave way. NORTHCUT was urged along the
inside disputing the pace inside a rival, dueled into upper stretch and gave way abruptly nearing the furlong marker.

Footnotes
DREAMING BIZ was settled last along the inside racing to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and rallied stoutly to the front to go clear under
some left handed encouragement. YELLOW DRESS, bumped at the start, angled inwards to track between foes, shifted out three wide entering the lane
and continued with a steady effort between foes to prevail for the place honors. HEART ON THE RUN sprinted to the lead along the inside racing to the
turn, dueled for command nearing upper stretch and weakened late. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME, forwardly placed pursuing the pacesetter outside foes racing
to the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and gave way. MICKEY DOBBS angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the
bend, shifted out while held up momentarily in traffic racing through the stretch and finished evenly late. AND ISLES, reserved along the inside in early
stages, saved ground to upper stretch but made no impression. HEATIN UP stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out to
make a brief bid between foes on the turn but lacked a closing response while being shuffled in traffic late. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE ducked inwards
bumping YELLOW DRESS at the start, dislodging her rider momentarily from his irons, then raced wide throughout while failing to menace.

Footnotes
EVEN PANDURA, off a step behind the leaders, was urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, tipped out to the three path
racing through the stretch and held SILLY NOTION on a safe advantage under firm handling. The latter tracked just outside the first flight five wide in the
opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. MIDNIGHT GARDEN was rated off the
first flight along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and edged rivals for a share late. VISUAL MAGIC, urged between foes pressing the pace from the
outset into the bend, gave way into the lane. IKNOWYOURFACE vied with the first flight four wide between foes into the turn, lost some ground to the
leaders while being fanned five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. LYRICAL was urged three wide between foes contesting the pace in the opening
quarter, was shuffled back out of tight quarters entering the bend and quickly emptied out. TICK TOCK dropped out early.
