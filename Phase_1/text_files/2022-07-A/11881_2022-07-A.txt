Footnotes
FAST FASHION tracked the pace, angled out through the second turn to gain position, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
drove clear late. RUNAWAY BREEZE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up and shook clear through the second turn, drew off in the stretch, then was
no match for the winner late and held the place. BAROLA unhurried in the early going, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled four wide
to bid into the stretch, then drifted in and had a mild gain. SUMMER HELPER well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane and flattened out. NOW PRAMELA rated mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
evened out the final furlong. BIG LIZ allowed to settle, looped to position three and four wide through the second turn, then ran evenly in the lane. SHES A
THREAT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and passed tiring rivals. BELLE GOSSE was no factor, inside. SIDE
ACTION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
COUNTY COURT allowed to settle, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drove
clear late. SIDE TRACKED stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. MARSAC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin down the backstretch,
drew off through the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. C THE KING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. SPETTACOLI (ARG) broke slowly from the gate, looped four and five wide moving up through the first turn,
gained position four wide through the second turn, bid, then evened out and missed a share. WHISTLE ME HOME well placed and off the rail, was through
after a half. CAKE AND EAT IT TO well placed, steadily lost ground. CLOONTIA well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path through the second
turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no rally.
