show. COPPER BEECH between horses first turn, shuffled back, rallied outside stretch. GRIZABELLA no speed to far turn, rallied far turn to improve

raced back outside with no response when needed. CALI DREAM no speed throughout showed little. STARRY JAYLEN steadily faded from outside,
dropped far back. ANGEL'S SASSY tried to keep up to the half with a steady fade, dropped far back.
