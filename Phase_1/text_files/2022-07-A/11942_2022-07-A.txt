Footnotes
SUNSHINE FEVER broke readily, was urged between foes to force the the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch under firm
encouragement and was taken in hand nearing the wire. RUNNERS HEAT, carried out at the start, was quickly righted while being urged to a forward
placing just outside the leaders in early stages, continued in that path while losing some ground to the winner on the turn but continued with interest to edge
a rival for the place honors late. VOODOO FIRE ducked out at the start, was settled while angling inside on the backstretch, tipped out nearing the lane and
continued evenly between foes. MY DIAMOND RUNS was urged inside the eventual winner pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and
gave way into upper stretch. MISS KITTY RUSSELL proved no threat. OH SO BLEU was rated off the first flight in the opening quarter, angled to the rail on
the turn and gave way early.

Footnotes
TWIRLING SAVI angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, came through inside that foe when presented an opening entering
upper stretch and moved to wrest command under firm handling. MORGS WORLD, off last, raced a bit wide to the first turn, was reserved last while angling
to the inside nearing the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening while shifting off the inside nearing the lane, then angled back to the rail in the closing
stages while continuing with interest for the place honors. ROLLIN BLACKOUT broke readily, was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a
narrow advantage to the far turn, tipped off the rail resisting challenges racing into upper stretch but yielded to the to pair while lasting for a share. INTENSE
COMPANY (IRE), reserved off the second flight along the inside to the first turn, gained some position between foes nearing the second bend, shifted out
four wide racing into the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. GOLDEN GOPHER was steadied avoiding close quarters in the opening furlong, switched
outside the leaders to track those foes three wide to the far turn, lodged a brief bid in that path on the second bend but came up empty in the drive. LAC
VIEUX DESERT broke readily while shifting in sharply racing to the first turn, was urged prompting the pacesetter between foes into the far turn, was fanned
three deep into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker. WAR MUSIC, held up between foes in the last flight racing in close quarters in the
opening stages, switched outside foes to race four wide into the far turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
HEELS TO THE FIELD, in touch with the leaders three deep prompting the pace through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the turn to press the
issue outside a rival through the turn, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and drove clear. PLANETARY broke readily, was urged inside rivals
disputing the pace through the backstretch, contested the issue inside the eventual winner into upper stretch but proved no match late. GRANDIOSE
SUMMER stumbled badly at the start, settled last racing well off the inside to the turn, swung out to the five path entering the stretch and gathered some late
momentum to prevail for a share nearing the wire. CHAMA, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, lost terms with the top pair
entering the turn, faded into upper stretch while shifting out three deep and exchanged some contact with MISSEN THE POINT while giving way. MISSEN
THE POINT, restless in the post parade momentarily dislodging her rider, switched out to the three path on the backstretch tracking off the first flight to the
turn, had no closing response while being fanned four wide nearing the lane, then exchanged bumps with CHAMA while dropping out last entering the lane.

Footnotes
DANZIG STAR broke readily, angled inwards to prompt a rival's pace to the backstretch, took over on her own courage racing into the far turn, held sway on
a clear margin to midstretch, drifted out markedly under left handed pressure in the closing stages, crossing the paths of several rivals but maintained a
clear advantage under pressure. WANDA STRONG, carried out by SCARRAZANO at the start, was righted to track off the first flight outside a rival in the
opening half, was prompted to advance three wide into the far turn, gained striking distance in that path nearing midstretch, altered course inside the drifting
winner in the final sixteenth but failed to gain even terms with that foe. SCARRAZANO ducked outwards bumping WANDA STRONG at the start, was
righted to track off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out avoiding a tiring foe racing into the far turn to advance on the pacesetter
between foes racing into the stretch, momentarily lost her path to that foe in late stages but lacked the needed final kick. GOLDIE'S DELIGHT, off a step
slowly, then held up out of close quarters just after the start, was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and
continued with an even effort. ANNIE M tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the first turn, continued outside a rival just off those rivals on the
backstretch and steadily faded on the far turn. FINAL TABLE proved no threat. THUNDER ISLAND was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace
on a narrow margin to the backstretch but gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
YESTERYEAR was urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening furlong dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, edged clear midway
through the turn, shifted off the inside racing past midstretch, angled to the four path nearing the wire but held the late challenge of AMERICAN UNION to
the end under firm encouragement. The latter raced in touch with the leaders four wide racing past the chute, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
into the turn, steadily advanced on the leader tipping outside that foe with a quarter mile to go, continued willingly while being fanned to the five path in the
closing stages but just failed to gain even terms with the winner. SKY CONFIDENTIAL vied with the first flight three wide between foes through the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the top pair in that path into upper stretch and weakened late. KNIEVEL settled outside foes in the last flight on the
backstretch, then continued evenly three wide between foes into the stretch. OUR BUBBY BOY, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch, gave way early. HOLY MUCHACHO was settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, tipped a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch
but never mounted a serious challenge. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN proved no factor.

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE broke readily to gain the advantage just after the start, conceded some position to track off the first flight three wide on the
backstretch, lost some position racing in close quarters entering the bend, shifted out four wide midway through the turn, continued in that path to upper
stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. WHITE LIES angled to the rail tracking the leaders from just out
of striking distance on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped out leaving the sixteenth marker to prevail for the place honors between
foes nearing the wire. PRINCESS LIVIA, caught momentarily in close quarters at the start, was urged along the inside disputing the pace in the opening
quarter, shook clear racing through the turn, held sway on a commanding margin past midstretch but was collared late. ALQWANI, restless in the gate prior
to the break, was pinched back out of tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes to make a brief, three wide advanced racing into the turn, continued
between foes in that path to upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. LATER DAYS ducked out at the start, was reserved off the second flight a bit off
the inside, was urged to make a brief advance between foes nearing the turn, checked off a tiring foe midway through the bend and had no further
response. CHRISTMAS POEM was urged pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch and gave way abruptly entering the turn.

Footnotes
LATIN NIKKITA was rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, tipped three deep on the backstretch, was fanned four deep entering the
second bend while coming under prompting to advance, pressed the issue three deep into the lane and edged forward late to prevail under firm handling.
RUN SLEWPY RUN was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn, pressed the issue between foes into the second bend, dueled inside
rivals to upper stretch, drifted out under left handed pressure bumping LOOKIN SO LUCKY in late stages and just failed to contain the winner. LOOKIN SO
LUCKY stalked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out after a half to advance three deep between foes racing into the far
turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, was bumped by RUN SLEWPY RUN, then steadied in late stages while losing terms with the top
pair. AUNT RUTHIE was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, faded racing into the lane, then shifted four wide in the
closing stages. DISTORTED VIEW, held up off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, offered no rally. SLIME QUEEN tracked off the second
flight outside foes, was caught five wide after a half, continued wide into the far turn and lacked a closing bid. STREET OF DREAMS, held up in the last
flight racing four wide to the backstretch while avoiding SKY HIGH SUSAN, proved no threat. SKY HIGH SUSAN was held up in close quarters while rank
racing to the first turn, switched outside foes after her saddle had apparently slipped, made an early, five wide move on the backstretch to briefly gain the
lead, angled inside nearing the far turn and abruptly emptied out into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF LOOKIN SO LUCKY LODGED
A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RUN SLEWPY RUN FOR INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A
CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED RUN SLEWPY RUN FOR INTERFERENCE,
PLACING HER THIRD.

Footnotes
PLANE TALK, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the turn, was urged to challenge while being fanned three deep entering the
stretch and continued with a game effort to just collar CHESS MASTER on the wire. The latter was rated stalking just off the pacesetter along the inside
racing into the bend, tipped outside that foe to gain the advantage in upper stretch and just missed on the wire. EXPROMPT (FR), off last, was settled
between foes racing to the turn, then found his best stride in the closing stages to prevail for a share between foes. JAZZY TIMES, forwardly placed three
deep tracking the pacesetter into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and continued evenly between foes to the end. COLLEGE PARTY was
rated off the first flight while shifting off the inside, raced four wide into the bend, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked for a share.
DENVER CITY was urged setting the pace along the inside racing into the bend and gave way into upper stretch. TIGER DAD was settled along the inside
in early stages but offered no rally. SHIP IT RED WAS SCRATCHED AFTER BEING FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE PRIOR TO THE START.
