Footnotes
SUPER ET broke with the field, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed late in the final turn, kicked clear into the stretch, remained well
clear to the wire under steady handling. ANN'S STORM off step slow, trailed early in racing back, began a steady advance before a half, came three wide
for the drive, wore down rival to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. HIGH VALUE TARGET away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner, fell
back off that one with just over a quarter remaining to prove no match, outkicked for the place late far clear of the others. CONNECT IT settled off the pace
and the inside, in some traffic early in the far turn, went evenly through the stretch when clear, no threat to the top three. GEAUX VOTE in mid pack inside,
continued to save ground through the final turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. SHOOTING STICK well back and off the pace, four
wide through the final turn, failed to muster a rally. GLENNEYMAX four wide through the first turn when forward, continued outside and within striking
distance up the backstretch, four wide again in the second bend, gave way in the drive. SECRET MOMENT fell back to trail after the start, was never a
factor.

MASTERLY away well, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear into the lane, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. LOUISIANA HERO
last to leave, trailed early, advanced four wide through the turn, closest to the winner when straightened for home, slowly getting to that rival late, well clear
for the place. ELISHER broke back, moved out and raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, finished up best of the rest without threatening the top two.
CURTIN'S UP closest to the winner early off the inside, fell back early in the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. OVERDELIVER in mid
pack early, moved closer while three wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG broke sharp, raced forward early, began
a steady fade before a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SPEED QUEEN broke up, alternated up front in the two path up the backstretch, shook well clear by late in the turn, held the runner up comfortably safe
under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. ANOTHER HOT MESS in the second flight off the inside, three wide when moving closest to the winner entering
the stretch, could do little with that one the final furlong, far clear of the rest. JACKIE FLASH broke best of all, dueled up front inside the winner for three
furlongs then could not keep up nor contain the runner up, saved the show. FIELD OF LIGHTS last to leave, raced back and outside, four wide into the lane,
failed to menace. MRS. NECAISE in the second group inside the runner up, remained back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CUSTOM MAIDEN forwardly placed early three wide, dropped to the inside second turn, challenged inside the leader approaching midstretch, spirited duel
to the wire, gained the nod late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. CZAR'S BALLERINA broke in, was quickly straightened to help set the pace closest to
the rail, continued to show the way through the final turn and into the lane, drifted out slightly upper stretch after putting away in the other speed just as the
winner moved to challenge nearing the furlong grounds, dueled to the end, proved game to just miss. LAWSUIT LUCY raced in mid pack early toward the
inside, steered out to be four wide into the straight, finished with good mettle to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. T R'S FIRST in the main body
inside, improved through the second turn continuing to save ground, closest to the top two with a furlong remaining, outkicked for the third position late.
STORM BREACH went one paced while racing outside, lacked closing response. ENOUGH HEART broke on top, dueled up front outside the runner up for
five furlongs and began to weaken. STOP SHOP N DROP back early off the pace, moved closer in the three path far turn, failed to sustain that advance
through the straight. DEVASTATING BEAUTY broke back, void of speed, was never a threat. ELIZABETH RENEE asked away from the gate, showed the
way into the first turn then bore out badly, fell back to trail, distanced through the stretch after losing contact with the field, jogged in. QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

US SECOND CUTE PIE off a step slow, raced back as a result, made a strong move three wide late in the turn to move into contention, challenged and
raced on equal terms with the runner up with a furlong remaining, wore that foe down late to be clear at the wire. VANCOUVER SNOW broke on top,
chased early, moved up to vie between horses into the far turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, dueled midstretch, no match late, held sway for the
place. ANNA CLAUSE void of speed, angled out a bit for the drive, finished up willingly to be clear of the rest while closing the gap on the runner up. LAST
DESTINY sprinted clear past the wire the first time, continued to show the way onto the backstretch, remained with the pace closest to the inside turn,
began to weaken soon after. ARCTIC GUITAR in the second flight early, pressed the issue three wide the middle half mile and then faltered.

FIRST I'VE SEEN bumped at the start, recovered to move up and contest the issue while between horses, edged clear by late in the turn and then drew off
with authority through the lane under intermittent urging. HANNAH'S HAVEN in the second group while racing off the inside, moved a bit closer four wide
turning for home, had little for the winner in the run to the wire, clearly second best. MARIAH'S CANDY widest of the second group, came five wide out of
the turn, improved a bit late while not a threat to the top two. ABSOLUTELY last to leave, raced in the main group along the inside, in some traffic turning
into the stretch, came up empty when clear. CRYPTO BRAVE pressed the issue up front in the three path for a half, faltered in the drive. VIV VIV VIV broke
alertly, raced with the pace inside, caved in down the lane. PATMEPATMEPATME broke out to bump with the winner, fell back to trail and was not a further
factor.

Footnotes
BIG SESSY never far back outside, ranged up to challenge on the outside turning for home, drove well clear then held the runner up safe late. ORPHAN
CREEK broke back, lacked speed off the inside, asked along four wide turning for home, finished up willingly to be getting to the winner. MR. E EDWARDS
broke awkwardly, raced back, angled out to be six wide out of the turn, rallied belatedly to be closing the gap late. GENES FEATHER moved closer up the
inside early, continued within striking distance turn, lacked a closing punch in the drive to finish up evenly. LULLABY BANDIT in the main group early off the
inside, closer three wide late in the turn, lacked a further advance through the stretch. BIG T broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch inside and
then into the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner turning for home, gave way when headed by that foe into the lane. NVRFORGET URDREAMS back
off the pace, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI back off the pace, two path the rail into the lane, failed to menace.
BULLETSREVENGE pressed the issue early in the two path and inside the winner, gave way before three furlongs. BIG AL'S HONOUR was always outrun
while racing outside. PER RULING DATED 8/11/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION (RULING #25010), BIG SESSY WAS
DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
