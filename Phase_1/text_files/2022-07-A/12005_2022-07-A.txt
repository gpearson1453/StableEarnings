dueled to the far turn, weakened in the stretch run. TIA FRIDA through after half, gave way readily. SONG OF STORMS through early, dropped far back.

Footnotes
RONNI'S STORM speed from inside, well rated throughout while ridden out to the wire. CONDEMNATION off tardy, outside to turn, roused into turn finished
up well. GIV'EM THE BIZ inside run throughout, came on to gain the show spot with a good effort. NEBULOSA dueled to the turn, could not handle winner
and weakened in the late stages. RUMBLE STRIP RON took the inside route to stretch, came out to finish up well. ELLIOT THE DRAGON raced along
evenly with no gain in the stretch run. CRYPTO COPY no speed, showed little throughout. FOREIGN lunged with a terrible start, never menaced
throughout. PLATE IT UP dropped far back quickly never menaced.
