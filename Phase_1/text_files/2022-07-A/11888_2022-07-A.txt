Footnotes
STEAMIN DEMON went four to five wide into the first turn, sat just off the pace through the backstretch, was asked to quicken then went in pursuit of the
leader, dueled through the final sixteenth and won the bob. SAVYSKYE saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, responded to
challenge from STEAMIN DEMON, was overtaken then battled back in the final yards and was narrowly denied. LASKA stalked the early pacesetter, lodged
a rail bid and improved late. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL took closer order leaving the backstretch along the rail, shifted outside at the head of the stretch and
closed late. LULABELLE sat four wide through the backstretch, bid outside at the quarter pole and dueled late for fifth. NO MORE RINGS pressed the early
pace outside of SAVYSKYE, and rallied evenly through stretch. SMILE MARY broke poorly, and trailed throughout.

DAD'S LEGACY settled in the five path, moved up into striking position, rallied five wide under encouragement and got up just in time. NEVVARE broke
awkwardly, chased three wide, found running room along the rail entering the stretch, and was outkicked. JULIUS THE GREAT hustled to the front, showed
the field through the backstretch, was showing signs of tiring at approaching the drive and was collared. RED CHOCOLATE trailed the field early, rallied
steadily outside through the stretch and missed. FIRST PRINCE stalked the pace from the rail, dropped back in the final turn, and was edged out in a
multi-horse scramble to the wire. BON PRIX stalked the early pacesetters, and finished evenly. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND sat just off the pace, chased the
leader through the final turn, and gave way late.

CHASKA sat in striking range, was set down between foes at the head of the lane, wore down BAR NO Q mid stretch and edged away. BAR NO Q
contested the early pace inside of PADDYSDAYCHARM, responded to challenge from CHASKA and was worn down deep streth. PADDYSDAYCHARM
contended the early pace, dueled outside of BAR NO Q, dropped back at the head of the lane and finished with good energy. ROLLIN SEVENS trailed the
field and lodged mild bid. VISION QUEST sat just off the pace in the five path, chased in the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
MARIA'S SONG vied inside for the early lead, gained the advantage over PULL THE PIN in the final turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held under a
late drive. CAB SAV stalked the dueling pacesetters from the five path, took closer ordering approaching the quarter pole, chased and was closing on the
leader late. DANCING WILLIE settled outside through the backstretch, was roused at the head of the lane, bid gradually getting up late for show.
LIGHTENING ANNA lodged a rail bid into the lane, and was bested late for show. HIGH KELLY SONG lacked early speed, bid belatedly and improve
position. HE'S CRIMSON CODE saved ground from rail, chased and failed to threaten. PULL THE PIN vied outside of MARIA'S SONG, was unable to move
on with the eventual winner and yielded.

DANCE SHOES settled well off the pace early, swung out at the head of the lane, moved up alongside SANGRIA to challenge the lead, edged clear of rival
and held sway. PLUM BLUE trailed the field, took closer order through the far turn, lacked room inside then angled out sharply near the three sixteenth pole,
closed gradually but was unable to reach the leader late. RUN LOLA RUN chased in the final turn, drove four to five wide into the stretch, and was along in
time for show honors. SANGRIA reserved off the dueling pacesetters, lodged a bid at the quarter pole, was collared at the head of the stretch and yielded.
MINE ME saved ground early, raced wide into the lane under urging and finished evenly. JOY IN GRACE raced at the back of the pack leaving the
backstretch, and offered a late bid. FLAT AS A PANCAKE settled inside, waited on the rail at the quarter pole then lacked room inside, and flattened. LUCY
TREASURE vied for the early lead, dueled through the turn, and gave way inside. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE set a pressured pace outside of LUCY
TREASURE, match strides in the far turn, and wilted abruptly.

Footnotes
MADE FOR MORE sat in striking position from the three path, drove four wide in the final turn, and won driving. CHATTY GAL sat off the pacesetters while
five wide, hustled outside on the final turn, and lacked the kicked needed. BLUSHING BROOKE saved inside, angled four to five wide leaving the final turn,
and got by late for show. BLACKBERRY LISA sat just off the pace along the rail, inherited the lead in the far turn, was roused into the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. ENTITLED STAR raced at the back of the pack and showed some interest late. EMERALD CANYON passed tiring rival. CAN'T TOUCH THIS
flashed early speed and tired. WE ARE FREE saved early and was outrun. CAGEY failed to menace.
