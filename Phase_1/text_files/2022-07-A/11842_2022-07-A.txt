dropped back early, swung wide in the stretch closing well too late. TENURE broke very slowly, bid inside on the turn, angled out and finished gamely.
DIESEL alternated for the advantage inside and weakened slightly late. CONQUISTADOR dueled in the two path, led briefly and tired slightly in the final
eighth. EMPIRE'S SCORE dropped far behind then finished with some late energy. MANOLETE close up early, faded on the turn then came again inside
while no threat. BREITHORN was urged just off the pace outside and faded in the stretch. MOON PISTOL dropped back inside and gave way readily.

EXIT RIGHT set a measured pace inside, pulled clear before the half, widened easily then was geared down late. KINGSVILLE pursued the winner
throughout, was no match for the winner but continued gamely for place. SECRET PATH saved ground behind the leaders and lacked a rally. SILVER
EDGE urged within range in the two path, angled out in the stretch and flattened. ICY DUDE lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. SCAR chased
close up wide for half a mile then was finished by the far turn.

Footnotes
FLASHNDYNAMITE vied briefly, took over before half a mile and pulled away under moderate urging. MIDNIGHT OBSESSION chased in the two path,
went after the winner on the final turn but proved no match. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE settled inside, made a mild rally on the final turn then flattened out.
LIKE A PRO dropped far behind then passed tiring rivals. PRECIOUS lacked speed outside and was never in contention. MISS MIKAELA led briefly outside
then began fading after half a mile. BILLIEANNE was fanned very wide into the first turn, remained wide and stopped.
