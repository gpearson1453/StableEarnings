Footnotes
BEYOND MY DREAMS tracked the speed just outside, pounced on the leader nearing the quarter pole and quickly opened up entering the stretch keeping
to the task late. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON stalked three wide mid pack down the backstretch, offered a mild bid while four wide leaving the far turn and
entering the stretch, could not gain on the winner but displayed some grit holding off an outside challenge for second money. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT was
allowed to settle early behind runners, commenced a rally angling out nearing the quarter pole while circling runners five wide and closed belatedly down the
lane for third. INCENDIO tracked three wide early, was roused between runners through the turn and ran evenly through the lane to get a small share.
RIGHT TO STRIKE stalked in the second flight while inside, asked through the turn with little response and angled out late to pass tiring foes. SPIRAL
STORM stalked between runners mid pack early, was roused through the turn but had little to offer for the drive. CINNAMONJAWBREAKER broke alertly to
take command leaving the chute, was headed on the outside nearing the quarter pole and faded on the rail through the field down the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND LIFE exchanged a fairly hard bump at the start, moved forward to force the pace, dueled two to three wide, edged clear leaving the turn while
drifting out a bit, extended the margin into mid-stretch while under urging and drifting in just a bit, held while being kept to the task. AWESOME BOURBON
bumped with the aforementioned at the start, chased from between runners, moved out three wide turning for home, kept on to close the gap but was only
second best. HOUSEBUILDER was urged forward from the break to set the early tempo but soon joined by the winner, dueled inside that one till late on the
turn, yielded grudgingly but held show. CRIMSON COMET hopped every so slightly at the break, had good forward position stalking three wide, missed
show honors. SECRET STORM chased from inside, steadied near the five-sixteenths and dropped back. BIG INVESTMENT chased from outside going four
wide on the turn and was unable to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HAYROLL settled nicely behind the pacesetter on the rail, angled outside for the stretch run and wore down that rival through the stretch edging away late.
SASKATCHEWAN broke sharp to dictate the pace, well rated through the backstretch, was challenged into the lane and fought on well giving away
grudgingly nearing the wire. POT COMMITTED chased the pace early on, was ridden in the far turn to keep up with the top two runners, could not quicken
with those foes but held on well to keep third place. STORMIN' HUMOR went three wide into the first turn trailing, saved ground through the backstretch and
far turn, then displayed some late energy splitting runners through the lane getting up for a small share. BRUTALITY stalked mid pack on the rail, saved
ground throughout but could not be a factor for the run down the lane. ACTION POINT went three wide stalking mid pack early, offered a mild run on the far
turn when roused and had little left for the stretch run. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was five wide into the first turn near the back, angled in to be in the two path
through the backstretch, was asked for run while three wide in the far turn and flattened out through the stretch.

Footnotes
DERZKII tracked the leading pair from inside a rival, moved out leaving the turn coming four wide into the stretch and put to urging, responded after
continued urging and edged clear late. FROSTED ICING stalked from outside the aforementioned, floated five wide into upper stretch, bid and made the
lead briefly, was outkicked but saved the place. STOP THE HUMBUG settled well off the pace shifting in near the inside, cut to the rail from just off it in
upper stretch, gained steadily and slowly inside but missed the place. POUND GREEN raced well off the leaders angling off the inside early on the turn and
going mostly three to four wide through much of that bend, advanced while swinging six to seven deep turning for home, kept on evenly. BOKERMIN
stalked from mid-pack racing off the inside, swung five deep turning for home and needed more. ENGLISH CLASSIC was never near enough to threaten
while racing mostly three to four wide through the turn and into upper stretch. CORRELATE trailed early along the inside, came out in late stretch and failed
to make a bid. BREATHLESSNTHESAND pressed the leader then dueled with that one edging to a narrow and brief lead late on the turn racing three wide,
faded in the stretch. CANOLA WORLD set a pressured pace inside then gave way.

Footnotes
JIMMIES BIG DAY stalked the pace while inside throughout, waited on the turn and angled out in the two path splitting rivals to take command nearing the
sixteenth pole and held on gamely repelling an outside charge. DISSECTOLOGIST was allowed to settle near the rear through the backstretch, advanced
on the turn angling out five wide at the quarter pole circling runners and loomed boldly at the eighth pole but could not sustain that drive levelling out the final
sixteenth. HERE BE DRAGONS trailed after breaking in sharply at the start, angled out to the six path for a stretch run and finished well on the outside
gaining steadily on the top two finishers late. CAPE COD took command soon after the break, was headed entering the stretch, fought on but surrendered
the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way late losing place and show. BEAU GUEST chased outside while three wide in the beginning, challenged
for the lead entering the stretch going four wide, and levelled out the final eighth. LAST DAWN was rated back down the backstretch outside of horses, lost
position on the turn and passed a tiring rival in through the stretch. THREE MILE LIMIT pressed the pace between runners early, was roused to keep up
through the turn and faded between foes through the stretch.

Footnotes
KAWACATOOSE pressed the pace three wide, bid between rivals in upper stretch, edged just clear of WESTERN TROUBLE and held that rival at bay
under steady handling. WESTERN TROUBLE angled out four deep leaving the backstretch, advanced on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, was
outkicked but second best and game in defeat. AIM FOR THE SKY tracked inside lacking some room late on the turn, came out a bit turning for home and
had an opening, kept on evenly. HAPPYMAC was forced to go five wide through the turn racing just off the leaders, kept on for the minor award. DOTTED
LINE angled in early settling at the rear, came out through the stretch and bumped and crowded a rival while improving position. FIELDER saved ground
near the inside mid-pack, failed to rally. CELEBRATORY raced toward the rear three wide on the turn, was carried out and bumped in the stretch. JIBARO
was mid-pack three wide on the turn, drifted a bit in upper stretch and came up empty. ANARCHY set a pressured pace inside just off the rail, gave way.

CALL MY BANKER stalked between runners in the early stages, started to advance going three wide at the quarter marker, took command at the eighth
pole on the outside and began inching away late. LUV TO WIN broke out at the start, led at the five eighths pole, surrendered that lead and tracked that
pacesetter on the turn, assumed command briefly at the eighth pole fighting on to the wire giving away the last few strides. BIG BAD BEAST trailed early,
started his run inside on the turn and angled out at the three sixteenths pole in the five path closing well late to be a clear third. SAILOR'S PASSION saved
ground throughout and finished with some intent down the lane to get a minor award. SUMMER SUNSET chased inside on the turn, offered a mild rally in
early stretch only to level out the final eighth. QUIET WYATT was three wide throughout, settled in mid pack early on, was ridden on the turn and had
nothing to offer down the stretch. LION OF THE SEA broke inwards at the start, quickly recovered to lead at the five eighths pole, was eager down the
backstretch opening up into the turn, was collared nearing the eighth pole and stopped abruptly on the inside.

Footnotes
HIGH HEAT stalked the leading pair from outside a rival two then three wide on the turn, swung five deep turning for home, engaged a rival in mid-stretch
for a brief duel then inched away under steady pressure. RAPID RELOAD pressed the pace from outside, bid in upper stretch, was then engaged by the
aforementioned, dueled with that one but was outfinished. AL HEYBAY set a pressured pace inside, fought on till inside the final furlong then yielded.
PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ tracked from inside just off the leaders, came out a bit late on the turn then again in the stretch and ran on evenly. EXCEED
settled inside, failed to make a bid. MR NARCISSISTIC raced outside toward the rear going three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
CITY LEGEND tracked the pacesetter early, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole to quickly open up at the top of the stretch, and was kept to the
task through the lane holding well late. TOO MUCH TALK was brushed at the break to trail down the backstretch, began his run at the quarter pole splitting
rivals weaving through traffic to finish strongest in the late stages of the race. DRAGON'S KEY made a seven wide rally through the turn, closed with late
interest down the stretch to just get up for the show money. FRAMED was four wide stalking the front group through the backstretch, advanced mid turn
splitting runners, threatened the leader at the top of the stretch but levelled out the final part for a minor award. PINK GELATO was near the back early,
circled runners going eight wide on the turn and evened out the final eighth of a mile. RAT PORTAGE was away alertly to dictate the pace, collared on the
rail at the five sixteenths pole and faded on the fence. CROONER made a mild rail rally on the turn and retreated between runners down the stretch.
SILENT RISK broke out after the start, tracked the pace while four wide through the backstretch and turn, and offered little in the stretch. OPEECHEE was
mid pack between runners and never got involved. BIG WARDEN broke in at the start, chased the pace and retreated between runners through the lane.
