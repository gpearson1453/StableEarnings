LUCKY LUKE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and
closed steadily two out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. JUVEE TOO away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing
five wide into the backstretch, continued four out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly while keeping in the five path throughout, and got
up for the place in the final strides. FOOT SOLDIER unhurried early while dropping back to trail while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied along the inside while awaiting room through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. BABY GRAND
away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR entering the first turn, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail
in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in deep stretch. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the
outside of BABY GRAND entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and into the
final turn, but weakened in the late stages.

REA MEA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn while continuing to save ground at the rail, and held the closers safely at bay late to prove best. KICK UP THE DUST broke sharply and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to
get the nod for the place in the final strides. FLORAL was slow into stride, but pulled her way into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from
along the rail entering the final turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to just miss the place.
BOUNDFORJAMAICA trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was always well back, and was only able to pass a tiring rival
over the final furlong. DEFINITE PLEASURE tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, chased the pacesetter to the final
turn, began to weaken entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
MT SEYMOUR away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace into the backstretch while racing just out from
the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, repelled a strong bid by KEEPINGTHEDREAM leaving the turn, and inched clear from that rival late to prove
best. KEEPINGTHEDREAM away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, set sail after the pacesetter while
racing three wide through the final turn to collar the leader leaving the turn, but was unable to match strides with MT SEYMOUR in deep stretch while
proving clearly second best. CAROLINA GENT broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, steadied from
between rivals when in tight quarters, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. EASTERS MEMORY stalked
the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. DONEGAL BOY settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, launched his bid three
wide entering the final turn, but flattened out in the stretch drive. ZULU POWER was devoid of early speed while trailing the field into the first turn, raced
three wide into the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive, but was unable to make a late impact. Following the running of this race there was a
jockey's claim of foul. The rider of CAROLINA GENT lodged a claim of foul against the rider of KEEPINGTHEDREAM for alleged interference entering the
final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish.

MUSTACHIO away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pacesetter two wide in the run to
the final turn, battled through the turn from the outside of CALAMAZEUS, began to get the better of that rival entering the lane, and pulled clear late. JACK'S
REIGN tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, shifted four
wide entering the lane, and closed well three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. CALAMAZEUS broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backside, battled through the
final turn from the inside of MUSTACHIO, struggled to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for a
share. CALGARY CAPER unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the
pack while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. PADDY D'ORO away
alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. The mile split for this race was unavailable at the time of writing

through the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay through the lane while racing one out from the rail under confident handling. DOUBLE SAW away
well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly
one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. REMARKABLE ANGEL chased the leader four wide into the first turn, and settled into a stalking trip three
out from the rail entering the backstretch, angled in to commence her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted three wide from the drive and
closed willingly through the lane to garner a share. BAKALLEY settled off the early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied one
out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with interest from along the rail in the drive. ROYAL AIR FORCE stalked the leaders into the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. DYNAMITER unhurried early
while trailing the field into the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but failed to menace. BARBERRY BANDIT settled well off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and failed to make a late impression.

the final turn, bore out through the turn and unseated his rider midway through the turn. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry

PLAYED away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, shifted in entering the lane and closed willingly one out from the rail in deep stretch to get up for the place. HE'S A SAINT broke sharply and dueled for
the lead two wide from between rivals entering the lane the first time, took a narrow advantage into the backstretch while racing two wide, maintained his
advantage into the final turn, and battled gamely through the lane, but was outfinished in the late stages. SLOOP JOHN B away alertly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, gave up the lead while chasing the leader down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
along the inside through the final turn, but needed more when called upon late. FAULKNER settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the
rail entering the lane the first time, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest while one out from
the rail in the stretch drive. STORMY BLUE pressed the leaders three wide into the stretch the first time while racing three wide, dropped into a tracking trip
two out from the rail entering the second turn, began to weaken in the run to the final turn, and wasn't persevered with over the final furlong.
