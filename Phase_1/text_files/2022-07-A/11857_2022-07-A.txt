HARD ASTRAY breaking sharply to clear at the get go maintained a healthy lead through the far turn drawing off on the inside in upper stretch winning as
much the best. UNCLE CARLITO tracked the pace chasing on the far turn being dispatched by the winner in upper stretch dueling between horses to save
place. PERFETTO stalked the pace racing evenly through the far turn traveling three deep in upper stretch lacking surge there. PIONEER DANCER slow
early saved ground moving up some in upper stretch hanging late along the rail. GALLANT STAR fractious while loading was slow to break. KITCHI was
never involved.

BLUE ROCKETTE sent to the front set a measured pace holding rivals at bay through the far turn widening in upper stretch holding firm in the two path.
INFO'S TREASURE stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch unable to angle out vying late from the rail saving place. SUM KINDA PRETTY stalked
the pace edging closer to loom on the far turn, wavered somewhat in upper stretch hanging late in the three path. MY WYNTER ECHO pressed early then
dropped off on the backside. LET'S TWIRL was never involved.
