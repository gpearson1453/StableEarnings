IMPERIAL DASH contested the pace outside of CITY WOLF'S GUY, edged away in the final turn, and held under a drive. CITY WOLF'S GUY contended
the pace from just off the rail, angled outside entering the lane, was all out through the stretch but was unable to get by. REMAIN CALM saved inside, rallied
belatedly and was up in time. AMIGO QUERIDO reserved off the dueling pacesetters, lodged a bid in the far turn, failed to threaten in drive and was run
down late. TOUGH LOVING never reached contention. PRIVATE ACCESS was not a factor and was eased then walked off.

VELVET GHOST rated well off the pace, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, found running room along the rail, and won driving. PHANTOM MAC
tracked the pacesetters from the four path, asked to quicken in the final turn, struck the front but was outkicked. WILDCAT WILLY trailed the field early,
swung out into the lane then moved up menacingly and flattened out late. SECRET HAVEN tracked five wide, chased outside in the final turn and weakened
late. PAULIE WALNUTS prompted the pace from the rail, dropped back in the final turn, and had little left in reserve late. PUMP THE BRAKES vied outside
for the early lead, moved clear in the far turn, and yielded.

Footnotes
MY LUCKY MARK broke in, attended the pace from rail, dueled through the final turn inside of EVER TRUE, and edged away late. EVER TRUE broke
alertly, contested the pace outside, matched strides outside of MY LUCKY MARK, and was out finished. BOLSANO bumped leaving, tracked inside, swung
out into the lane, chased through the stretch but was no match for the leaders and held safely for show. ITS ALL ON SLEW raced three wide leaving the
backstretch, was set down for the drive and was unable to improve position. VISIONS OF JOY bumped leaving then trailed, and bid belatedly. WEEKEND
WIZARD sat just off the pace from between rivals, and tired early. DEVILS COMMAND saved ground from the three path, and yielded.

Footnotes
EXACTLY lagged early, angled to rail leaving the backstretch, circled off the final turn, closed steadily outside and got by late. CONVINCE allowed to settle
off the early pacesetters, swung four to five wide into the lane, rallied determinedly through the stretch and was out finished. LIGHT FAST FEET stalked
inside, moved up to challenge the lead nearing the quarter pole, rallied inside through stretch and faded late. FLORIST attended the pace from the four to
five path, held a narrow lead into the final turn and faded gradually. CUVEE TEE hopped leaving then rider lost irons, raced wide in the final turn and passed
tiring rival. FLASHY BIZ pressed outside early, and tired with two furlongs remaining.

Footnotes
TONE IT UP sat in range from the four path, angled to the rail approaching the stretch, gained the lead at the sixteenth marker then edged clear, and fell
after the wire losing the rider. ADDYDIDIT sat just off the pace inside, dueled through the final turn inside of SHIP'S CREEK, inched away from rival and
was wore down late. SHIP'S CREEK set a pressured pace in the three path, match strides outside of ADDYDIDIT, was unable to move on with rival into the
stretch and held. LITTLE HARPER saved ground inside, raced in traffic at the head of the lane, and closed late. QUEEN RHONDA raced near the back of
the pack, advanced outside in the final turn, and flattened in late stretch. LILBITSPICY broke alertly to attend the pace while five wide, fanned four wide into
the far turn, and lacked the closing response. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL passed tiring rivals. DIPLOMATICA prompted the pace from the three path, and gave
way into stretch. CARAT'S SONG sat in range, lacked running room leaving the final turn, shifted out and gave way. STOLEN JEWEL stalked five wide and
was done early.
