Footnotes
ATLANTIC SUN (GB) tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
drove clear late. MAKES GOOD SENSE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final sixteenth, then weakened and held the place.
BLUE SKY'S ABOVE well placed and between, dropped back slightly through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. WAPITI WAY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then closed willingly and
missed the show. DETANGLER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final
furlong. SAMURAI ZIP ran evenly.

SURLY FURIOUS unhurried in the early going, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled in and got through inside the leader into the stretch,
shook clear quickly, then drew off and was kept to the task. OUTADORE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn,
gained a short lead three wide into the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place. THE SINNER IS YOU tracked the pace, raced boxed
through the turn, waited, found room four wide into the stretch, then evened out. SMOKY BLUES well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path
through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and weakened. GOODIE GOOMER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch and improved his position. SOUPER STONEHENGE mid pack, moved up into the turn, gained a striking position three wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. NATURAL POWER (IRE) allowed to settle, gained position three wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and had no rally. THE CONNECTOR set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong.

Footnotes
PEMAQUID PETE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. POLLOCK
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the place. RED CAT (CHI) tracked the
pace, held position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. GO HIPPO GO allowed to settle, moved up
on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and got up for a share. COOPER'S CRESCENT stalked the
pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. SHAKEDOWN
allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and improved position. LAUDERDALE well placed and
outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. ANOTHER SOFTBALL mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. HOUSE LIGHTS mid pack and off the rail, was through after a half.
