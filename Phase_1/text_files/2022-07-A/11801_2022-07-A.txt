Footnotes
U S ARMY CORPS was away alertly to briefly lead, settled just behind the early pacesetter leaving the chute, stalked that foe until the three sixteenth pole
where he assumed command and had enough late to hold off a closing rival. CRUDEN BAY loomed just outside of horses entering the stretch, finished well
on end closing determinedly late just missing at the wire. MAAKWA broke in at the start, quickly took command leaving the chute, was headed at the three
sixteenth by the winner and held on well for a clear third. I'M DASHING rated at the back in the beginning, roused on the turn, angled outside while widest
through the stretch to close belatedly for a minor share. OCELOT stalked inside just behind the leaders, made a mild bid into the stretch and stalled the final
eighth. KID FORESTER saved ground throughout and showed some late interest on the rail. CHAIRMAN BOB trailed outside early and never showed
interest.

Footnotes
BIG GINGER got away alertly and with mild coaxing was clear to dictate terms racing near inside, held sway while being kept to the task.
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS was coaxed forward, chased outside three to four wide, maintained the place. DOPPLER stalked from between runners then
inside a foe two to three wide, was outfinished for place. KEYSTONE LAW settled inside mid-pack, came out on the turn going two to three wide then
moved out further past the furlong marker and bumped a rival in the process, finished with good energy. TARA LUNA went four to five wide on the turn
coming seven deep into upper stretch, drifted in at that juncture and kept on late. LOADED SECRET tracked up close from inside under moderate rating,
failed to rally. TENPENNY NAIL raced off the leaders between foes, moved out from two to four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was
bumped and steadied past the furlong marker. REMEMBERING RHODA chased from between runners, dropped back into the turn and shifted to the rail
about the seven-sixteenths, failed to menace. STOLE THE RING chased briefly moving out from two to four wide on the turn, faded while seven deep in the
stretch. LILLZ HOPE hopped at the start and was in tight just after, raced outside five wide on the turn, was eight wide at the top of the stretch and never
threatened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF TENPENNY NAIL AGAINST KEYSTONE LAW
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SEVENTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
NO MORE DIAMONDS stalked the pace from the onset, angled out at the eighth pole to take command inside the sixteenth pole while drifting out in the
final stages under left handed urging to hold on for the win. WARWOMAN was mid pack on the turn between runners, rallied between horses entering the
stretch and closed well on the outside just missing the victory. MARDENE waited inside behind horses through the turn, angled out to the four path between
horses closing belatedly through the stretch and was steadied nearing the wire while between runners. DAWN PHAROAH set all the early fractions before
fading late in the final sixteenth. ANYQUIST was roused while going four wide on the turn, made a mild bid entering the stretch outside of horses only to
finish evenly. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL saved ground throughout but could not contend. BERAVINA stalked just outside horses into the turn, was roused through
the turn and offered little through the stretch. ZIPPITY DAY was near the back early and never got involved. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL...#1 MARDENE

Footnotes
LADYWEARSTHERING moved forward willingly to set the pace inside, kicked clear and was much the best while being kept to the task. VIVID VIXEN
settled off the leaders two then three wide on the turn, angled out at the quarter pole then moved out further in mid-stretch and ran on well to gain the place.
GAYELETTE was kept very wide early, moved in four deep heading into the turn racing just off the leaders, kept on to secure show honors. CAPPY tracked
in behind the pace two wide, moved out four deep at the top of the stretch, needed more late. TURF AND SURF was taken back early racing last but one,
fanned six wide into the stretch, shifted in once there and ran on evenly. SPIRIT DANCE broke slowly, trailed early, passed tired rivals. NOW IS A BREEZE
was reluctant to load, chased four to five wide, lugged in through upper stretch. FEW REGRETS chased the winner three wide and came up empty.
FIANNAS SONG went three to four wide on the turn, dropped back tired. ASHWICKEN broke outwardly and was taken up at the start, advanced along the
rail on the turn but could not sustain the effort and flattened out.

Footnotes
ANGELOU stumbled on the break, quickly recovered to assume command, was well rated down the backstretch, opened up easily on the final turn and
drew away the last eighth. LIDO KEY was well in range in the early stages, made a good rally outside of horses at the three eighths pole but it was not
enough late to challenge the winner through the lane. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL rated mid pack between runners through the backstretch, saved ground on
the final turn, angled out for the stretch run to close well outside for a show award. MACCOOL'S GIRL chased the pacesetter from the onset, offered a bid at
the three eighths pole, was quickly repelled and levelled off through the lane for a minor share. BIZYMALINE stalked inside just behind the pacesetters
early, contended on the rail at the quarter pole and faded while inside of foes through the stretch. TEACHER'S PET rated mid pack outside of runners
through the backstretch, had a mild turn of foot while three wide on the final turn and stalled down the lane. ADMONISH trailed early and was never a factor.
QUINTE ROAD was near the back early on and passed a tiring rival. WHO SAYS was ridden to keep up in the final turn while inside of horses and retreated
through the field.

WICKENHEISER settled off the pace two to three wide on the turn, weaved in and out through horses in the lane to engage the leader in late stretch and
edged past while wearing that one down. TICKER TAPE HOME tracked mid-pack, found room inside in upper stretch, struck the lead past the
three-sixteenths but was outfinished. BORN DAPPER raced mid-pack three to four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch, got up for show
honors. CAIRO CONSORT tracked inside, angled five wide turning for home, lost show. JOKES UP raced outside and off the pace coming six deep into
upper stretch, angled to the rail in upper- to mid-stretch and kept on. FORTYFIVESEVENTY got away very slowly and awkwardly spotting the field several
lengths, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, was in a bit tight at the quarter pole and kept on thereafter. LADY GABRIELLE set the pace racing just off the
rail, weakened in the stretch. GOLDEN TRAIN stalked in behind mid-pack two to three wide, angled six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. A GAL
FOR T J raced in behind rivals on the turn while off the inside, bobbled slightly about the five-sixtenths, moved out six deep turning into upper stretch and
was never near enough to threaten. DIOSA CATRINA stalked four to five wide and outside, came up empty. ALBERTA BE MINE was up close stalking the
pace three to four wide through the turn and came up empty. ONLY AT MIDNITE broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
SOUPER HOITY TOITY was floated six wide into the first turn, made a middle move outside of horses down the backstretch to get a good stalking position
just behind the leader entering the final turn, took command between rivals at the eighth pole and held on well repelling an outside challenge late. CATICHE
was fanned seven wide into the clubhouse turn, circled four wide on the far turn to sit on the flank of the eventual winner but could not get by that rival down
the lane. MRS. BARBARA rated kindly between horses through the backstretch, waited inside on the final turn, angled out into the four path entering the
stretch to finish with interest late to garner the third position. JOIN THE DANCE took command into the first turn, well rated down the backside, yielded the
lead at the eighth pole giving away grudgingly on the rail. PIONEER'S EDGE took a stutter step after the break, rated behind runners through the first half,
was asked on the final turn and had nothing to offer through the lane. EPHRATA (GB) loomed up to contend going into the final turn while three wide and
flattened out turning for home. ABSOLUTE JEWEL saved ground on the rail through the first turn, steadied slightly entering the backstretch, was shuffled
back to trail and never offered a threat.

Footnotes
LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE set the pace inside, was challenged turning into the stretch, headed in upper- to mid-stretch, dug in under stout urging and shared
the win. CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) stalked two to three wide in behind the leaders and outside a foe, moved out five deep turning for home, fought through
late stretch to inch up and share the win. OUR FLASH DRIVE steadily advanced outside three to four wide on the turn to challenge, took a narrow lead in
upper stretch, was outfinished. PLUM ALI tracked in behind the leaders just off the inside, came out four wide turning for home, ran on evenly in the stretch.
PEACE SEEKER settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out at the three-sixteenths for room, improved position between runners late. LA
LIBERTEE raced mid-pack four wide through the turn, came out in mid-stretch, needed more. DREAMING OF DREW stalked then pressed the pace two to
three wide and racing between runners late on the turn, weakened in the lane. BROADWAY LADY went four to five wide racing outside, was carried out a
bit in the stretch, ran on evenly and made no bid. LADY WAR MACHINE raced off the pace three wide through the turn and coming out a bit further into the
stretch, failed to menace. PERSEVERANCIA lacked early speed, moved out from three to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. SARATOGA VISION
failed to threaten after going five wide on the turn.

Footnotes
RONDURE was in a good tracking position just behind the pacesetter early, angled just outside to assume command at the quarter pole and drew away
easily at the end. DUKE OF LOVE broke a bit sluggish, rated mid pack between runners down the backside, split rivals leaving the far turn to loom up into
contention turning for home, could not catch the winner through the lane but ran on well in deep stretch to win the battle for place. IRONSTONE hustled for
the lead early while off the rail, was collared at the quarter pole giving way to the winner, but fought on well through the stretch for the place battle just
missing that position. MANNIX (IRE) saved ground getting to the rail entering the first turn, made an inside move on the far turn to contend, but had to
steady briefly coming into the stretch and angled outside late to finish willingly for a small share. ALLEGORICAL stalked just outside of horses down the
backside, contended entering the final turn while three wide, backed up through the far turn and made a rebid outside of rivals through the stretch to pass
tiring foes. FUERTEVENTURA broke out at the break, rated mid pack between horses throughout and never got involved. LAC MACAZA trailed in the early
stages, rallied mildly through the turn on the rail and stalled through the lane. UNRAPTURED was near the rear throughout while racing wide and never was
a factor. RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL #8 MANNIX AGAINST #1 IRONSTONE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
BOUND FOR NOWHERE stalked in behind the leading group going three to four wide on the turn, lacked room at the quarter pole, came out a couple paths
about the three-sixteenths for room, took aim and drove past late under steady handling. ARZAK settled off the pace, commenced a sweeping move five
wide and outside through the turn, took command at the three-sixteenths and was soon clear but outkicked late. WHITE FLAG settled at the rear, came out
turning for home then shifted in once in mid- to late-stretch and rallied belatedly inside. SILENT POET was forwardly-positioned four wide early, eased back
off the pace on the turn, was carried out a bit in mid-stretch and kept on well. VOODOO ZIP settled well back racing near inside, angled out at the
three-eighths then again in upper stretch lightly bumping a rival and ran on with some late interest. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) bumped a rival lightly at the start,
set a pressured pace inside coming just off the rail turning for home, weakened in the stretch. TAP IT TO WIN bumped just lightly with a foe after the break,
settled racing near the inside, angled out for room past the furlong marker. OLYMPIC RUNNER went four to five wide on the turn, was carried out a bit in
upper stretch and failed to rally. TURNED ASIDE tracked just off the leaders along the rail, lacked the needed late kick. ELEKTRONIC pursued the leaders
four wide, drifted in a bit in the stretch and came up empty. INTO THE SUNRISE had light contact at the start, was urged forward to press the pace three
wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
SUGAR RAY set the pace early, was pressed at the five sixteenths pole, repelled that challenge clearing easily to win going away. WHERE IS ESSA
tracked the leaders, was in range on the turn, took over second at the eighth pole and was all out to hold place. DRAGON'S KEY was bumped at the start,
settled off the pace, commenced his rally from three eighths pole gaining steadily to the wire just missing the place award. MR. DE advanced four wide into
range at the quarter pole, drifted in upper stretch and ran on evenly for a minor award. CHUNKY MONKEY was bumped at the start, between foes mid pack
on turn and offering a mild rally through the stretch. PRIMORDIAL FEAR was bumped at the break, quickly recovered to press the pace and faded mid turn.
BOXER BRIEF tracked the leaders inside and levelled out down the lane. HARDWARE GAP was inside mid pack throughout and retreated through the turn.
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER hopped at the start and never reached contention. IT WORKED was taken out at the break and could not recover.
SUPREMEACTION broke inwards sharply at the start impeding rivals and was never a factor. SEVEN IS A BREEZE was bumped at the start, near rear
early, steadied entering turn and was not a factor.
