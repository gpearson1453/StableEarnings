Footnotes
SHAOLIN tracked two wide, pursued the leading trio from the three to four path around the turn, rallied outside of them in the final furlong to bid entering the
final sixteenth, and kicked clear. MCMANSION leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked three wide and just off of the leading pair into the turn,
chased those foes through upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, led briefly entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked soon after leaving that marker.
OUT DANCING dueled for the lead inside of BLUE OYSTER, gamely clung to an advantage from that foe and an outer bidding MCMANSION through
midstretch, but gave way to a pair of outer foes a sixteenth from home. BLUE OYSTER dueled for the lead outside of OUT DANCING, continued to spar
between horses approaching midstretch, but yielded in the final furlong. JACCACI lunged outwardly at the start while breaking on top, tracked along the
inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, but failed to progress on the leaders through the lane. WILMORE was done early. START CLASS took a
bump from an outer foe at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
MO'S MOJO dueled for the lead inside of SAMURAI PRINCE, inched narrowly clear of that one in upper stretch as other outer rivals game chase,
tenaciously held sway into the final sixteenth, met a LONG TERM THINKING's late challenge approaching the wire, and just held via a very tight photo.
LONG TERM THINKING stalked along the inside, chased from behind the leading trio through midstretch, surged between horses two wide entering the
final sixteenth to bid outside of MO'S MOJO in the late stages, but just missed at the wire. ABUELO NUNO stalked three wide, chased outside of the
leaders and from the four path through midstretch, got outkicked by an inner rival for minor placings entering the final sixteenth, and kept on between horses
to prevail for show. SAMURAI PRINCE dueled for the lead two wide, briefly failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart while drifting to the three path in
upper stretch, sustained his pursuit from between horses through the lane, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, and lost show to an outer
rival late. TRAPPE VALLEY took the turn in the three to four path while off of the pace, tipped outside of the leaders and to the five path passing the quarter
pole, but hung on his left lead through the lane while grinding away, and did not have enough to reach a minor placing. DAVID'S GEM broke a step slowly
before brushing with rivals on either side at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and made little impact. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY saved
ground off of the pace, then failed to progress in the three path in upper stretch, and played no factor.

Footnotes
HOPE AND DREAMS nudged an outer rival at the start, rushed through to set the pace, showed the way via swift fractions in the two to three path while
well in hand around the turn, met PARISH BELLE's challenge entering the lane, repelled that foe in upper stretch, shook clear, and inched further away in
the final furlong. PARISH BELLE pressed the pace setter from the outside while in the three to four path around the turn, ranged up to attempt a bid entering
the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and remained clear of show through the final furlong. FABULOUS FANNY tracked in the four path, ranged
up outside of the leading pair while in the five path nearing the lane, but failed to progress on them thereafter, and was best of the rest. TWENTYTWENTY
HOAX chased along the inside, but failed to produce a bid. TRICKED OUT laid off of the pace in the three path, spun to the six path entering the lane, but
failed to menace. SPARE A DIME broke slowly while being bumped by an inner rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
MAHOMEBRED broke outwardly, took the turn in the five path while at the rear, and was outrun.

PROMISE OF HOPE vied for the lead outside of DOUGHTY, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure at the furlong
grounds. MYSTICAL FIRE chased the top pair from the three path, then from between horses around the turn, but stayed on through the final furlong while
requiring rider correction from lugging in, and reached place in the final sixteenth. DOUGHTY set the pace inside of a vying PROMISE OF HOPE, but failed
to keep pace approaching the furlong grounds, and lost place in the final sixteenth. FRIGID LADY broke slowly, chased while off of the pace in the two path
around the turn, and improved between horses in the late stages. AUDREY'S WILLOW tracked from the four path, but tired. SPARKLING ROSE tracked
along the inside, but weakened on her left lead. SONG OF STORMS was fractious in the post parade and dropped her rider twice, then raced off of the
pace along the inside, but was outrun. LIL CARRIE D broke slowly, was distanced around the turn, and eased through the lane while showing little, then
walked off.

Footnotes
AMONGST FRIENDS tracked along the inside, then from a path off of the rail around the turn, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane as SILK
TRADE grabbed an advantage, ranged up to bid for the lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe after inching an advantage leaving the furlong pole,
and edged ahead. SILK TRADE vied for the lead two wide, led entering the lane as an outer AMONGST FRIENDS loomed a danger, dueled with that foe
through midstretch, battled gamely after being headed leaving the furlong grounds, but failed to regain even terms. CRYO set the pace inside of a vying
SILK TRADE, but yielded to that rival and an outer bidder in upper stretch, safely held show through midstretch, but met SWIFT TAP's challenge for that
position in the closing stages, and dead-heated. SWIFT TAP broke a step slowly before being put to tight quarters between horses shortly after the start,
laid off of the pace four wide, spun into the lane five wide, stayed on in pursuit of CRYO for show in the final furlong, and reached that foe at the wire to dead
heat for that position. LEND IT TEWMEY took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and made little impact. MAMBA TWENTY FOUR stalked three
wide, chased the top pair around the turn, but faded between rivals after being floated four wide entering the lane, and was rank between horses
approaching the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
MISBEHAVED was slow into stride leaving the gate, trailed the field leaving the chute, picked up stride inside of rivals approaching the turn, awaited racing
room in the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, swung to the seven path entering the lane, rallied strongly in pursuit of a clear JONAS' DREAM
in midstretch, and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. BLOW TORCH bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked in the two path behind the pace setters,
then between horses around the turn, smoothly moved between horses to take aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong
grounds, kept on, and reached place late. JONAS' DREAM dueled for the lead along the inside while a bit off of the rail, showed the way from a pair of
prompting foes turning for home, shook clear of those rivals entering the lane, maintained a margin through midstretch, but proved no match for an outer
surging foe entering the final sixteenth, flopped back to his left lead while being left in that one's wake, and lost place nearing the wire. TWO BIRDS
improved inside of foes to a tracking position nearing the turn, saved ground around the bend, but only managed to chase through the lane. CLASSIC
MARK broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack, gained four wide while in the five path and under a drive around the turn, but stalled entering the lane,
brushed with an inner foe while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. STRINGS tracked from midpack, was called upon to
secure three wide pursuing position into the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a kick between horses after brushing with an outer
rival at the three sixteenths pole. THOUGHT dueled for the lead outside of JONAS' DREAM while in the three path, vied between horses turning for home,
but weakened in upper stretch. ONE MORE BABY was bumped between horses at the start, took the turn in the three path while far back, shifted to the five
path entering the lane, but failed to factor. POLSAR stalked three wide while in the four path, ranged up turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch.
ATOMIC TONE was hung in the six path while far back around the turn, and got outrun. RIKIO laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer around the
turn, but tired after being floated to the eight path entering the lane. CONSPIRACY FACT bumped an inner rival at the start, raced keenly between horses
through the chute, got caught in the five to six path while off of the pace around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY DECISION broke sharply, showed the way in the two path, bore to the three path entering the turn causing her rider to take a hold, met
challenges from a pair of inside bidders shortly after, vied while clinging to a narrow advantage turning for home, inched a further lead in upper stretch, then
drew clear approaching the final sixteenth. BABY GOT BACKSPIN stalked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of a pair of foes at the three furlong pole,
pressed outer rivals under urging turning for home, then chased her outermost counterpart through midstretch while dueling with her most immediate rival
for place, and prevailed for that position a sixteenth from home. SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM stalked two wide and between horses, decisively produced an
early bid for the lead inside of the drifting leader into the turn, vied between horses turning for home, but failed to match strides wither her outer counterpart
in upper stretch, then yielded at the sixteenth pole, but lasted for show. MALAWNIA saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on two wide and between
horses in midstretch, shifted outside of SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM in the final sixteenth in hopes of reeling that foe in for show at the wire, but ran out of
ground. PERSONAL PURSUIT laid forwardly placed in the three path, chased inner bidders into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leading group
entering the lane, and was outfinished by an inner foe for fourth in the closing stages. SUGAR MAMAS CAKERY laid far back three wide, came into the lane
five wide, and chased evenly. MARSANNE balked when originally attempting to load, tracked the leading trio from the two path around the turn, but only
managed to chase before fading through the final furlong. COLLECTED GLORY hung out in the five to the six path around the turn while off of the pace,
and failed to factor. DIVINE GRACE laid forwardly placed in the four path, but faded after getting floated to the six path entering the lane. ROJA LIGERA
leaned against the inner part of the gate and dwelt at the start, trailed along the inside into the turn, and failed to factor. DIAMOND DISTRICT balked
loading, then raced off of the pace two wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
HOT AND SULTRY set the pace, dictated terms while well in hand in the two path around the turn, drew clear from a pursuing DOWNTOWN ABBY entering
the lane, held sway from that chasing foe through midstretch, tired in the closing stages as that rival drew near once again, but lasted to the wire.
DOWNTOWN ABBY stalked three wide and between horses, emerged to pursue the clear leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane,
chased through upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong, closed in late as the leader tired, but did not have enough to reel her in. STREET JAM saved
ground off of the pace, chased in the three path through midstretch, and reached show late. GOLDEN SIGHTS tucked leaving the chute, achieved an inside
stalking position behind the leader into the turn, but only managed to chase her through upper stretch before fading. SUNNY ISLE BEACH raced at the rear
in the four path into the turn, gained in the five path and outside of foes turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch without threatening.
THANOZAPPER chase four wide, but faded entering the lane. KHULUQ pressed the leader two wide and from between horses, but faded into the turn, and
was done early.

Footnotes
SKRATCH KAT settled off of the pace two wide, shifted outside of foes down the backstretch, improved to a four wide tracking position approaching the far
turn, sustained her advance under her own power to bid for the lead three wide at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner COLORFUL MISCHIEF
through upper stretch as an outer RUNAWAY WIFE pursued, gained an advantage entering the final furlong, inched clear, and held sway from her outer
oncharging rival late. RUNAWAY WIFE stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer bidding SKRATCH KAT while awaiting racing room behind
the leaders around the far turn, tipped four wide to be outside of that one straightening into the lane, took aim as that foe led in the final furlong, but was
safely kept at bay through the late stages. COLORFUL MISCHIEF stalked outside of the pace setter while in the three path, bid for the lead at the three
furlong pole, vied between horses turning for home as an outer SKRATCH KAT loomed a danger, dueled with that foe through upper stretch, but was
headed at the furlong grounds, and yielded a sixteenth from home. SEQUIST trailed in the four to two path around the first turn, picked up stride into the far
turn to chase the leading group from the four path, floated six wide entering the lane, and stayed on to claim a minor share while not keeping pace with the
top trio. ZING settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging seven wide entering the lane, but failed to factor.
DELIGHTFULSYMPHONY tracked from the three path, stalked between horses into the far turn, chased in the five path entering the lane, but lugged
inwardly in upper stretch, and tired. MAMA RINA bobbled at the start, raced off of the pace three wide, trailed along the inside into the far turn, and never
got involved. STANLEY MARKET set a clear pace in the two path, met challenges from a pair of foes around the far turn, and weakened nearing the lane.
BIG JAVA tracked in midpack in the two path, chased the leading group into the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, took aim between the leading pair in upper stretch, emerged
through leaving the furlong grounds to lead entering the final sixteenth, and drew clear. DECISION MAKER trailed, picked up stride two wide and between
horses turning for home, swung six wide and outside of rivals in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead to reach
place at the wire. LAUGHING BOY vied for the lead two wide, led in the three path into the far turn, dueled with an inner game ETHICAL JUDGEMENT
through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival in the final furlong, and got nailed at the wire for place. SOY TAPATIO stalked four wide, pursued
in the five path around the far turn, then chased outside of the dueling leaders through midstretch, and stalled after flopping back to his left lead entering the
final sixteenth, and was outkicked for minor rewards shortly after. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT set the pace inside of a vying LAUGHING BOY, sustained vying
position after being headed into the far turn, dueled gamely through upper stretch, but faltered approaching the final sixteenth. ROYAL ACT pressed three
wide, then from the four path and between horses around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. SCARLET FUSION saved ground off of the pace,
but faded. SUPER CONSTITUTION laid off of the pace two to three wide, got floated seven wide in upper stretch, and made little impact. LEBLON settled
off of the pace three to four wide, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TEPEU pressed two wide, vied turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off. SHIPMAN broke a bit outwardly, set the pace, vied
inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, but proved no match approaching the furlong grounds, and remained well clear of show. AFJAN bumped
with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two to three wide, then shifted four wide in midstretch, and stayed on to reach show at the wire. BRIGHT
PROSPECTER stalked three wide, but faded in upper stretch, and lost show late. KENTUCKY MIST bumped with outer rivals at the start, then saved
ground off of the pace, and chased through the lane. PREDOMINATE was bumped by rivals on either side at the start, trailed along the inside, shied from a
troubled foe at the five sixteenths pole, and was outrun. BOONE'S PATH raced far back two wide, then three to four wide around the far turn, and was
outrun. STICKY ISSUE tracked in the two path, pursued the leaders into the far turn, but sustained an injury leaving the three furlong pole, was quickly
pulled up and dismounted at the five sixteenths marker, then was vanned off.
