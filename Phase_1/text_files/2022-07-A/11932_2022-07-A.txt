Footnotes
HE'SSOSUBTLE pressed the pacesetter, led into the stretch then held inside challenge safe through the final furlong. KANE stalked the pace inside,
continued well but could not get by the winner. SOCIAL JOE chased inside, moved wide in the stretch and closed well too late. TOUGH WORKOUT hustled
to the front inside, was collared into the stretch and weakened. DOWNTOWN CRUMLIN raced close up outside, bore out badly on the final turn and stretch.
GO SKIPPY GO lagged far behind and was never in contention. PREFONTAINE lacked speed and gave way readily.

DONT BREAK THE LAW hesitated at the start, steadied at the top of the stretch then again at the three sixteenths pole, split foes and was just up. E T'S
SUPER STAR dropped far behind inside, placed the winner in tight twice and surged to get up in time. DANGNABBIT quickly took control, remained clear to
midstretch then weakened. EXPLAIN prompted the pace wide throughout and finished gamely. INVENTIONIST raced outside, bore out on the turn and was
no threat. RUN HAPPY STAR saved ground and began fading after half a mile.

Footnotes
NINETYPRCENTMADDIE chased three wide early, bid into the stretch, dueled to the finish and was just up in a long drive. TATUM pursued the pacesetter
outside, led into the stretch, continued gamely but was nailed at the wire. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO advanced very wide on the turn but was no threat to
the top pair. SPY NOVEL dropped back inside then angled out in the stretch with a mild rally. RYAN'S FLEET was steered to the two path on the turn and
closed with some late energy. RETWEET dropped back early and failed to menace. JOSH'S HONOR hustled to the front inside, was collared at the quarter
pole and faded. HESFIREDUP chased inside and proved empty in the stretch. HOT LOVE broke very slowly and raced far back throughout. IT'S A PITY
was fractious in the gate then broke slowly and always outrun.

stretch. SENSE A MILLION chased outside, moved wider on the turn and lacked a rally. FLEETERTHAN raced near the inside early and flattened out in the

Footnotes
MY DIXIE LASS pressed the pace outside, led at the quarter pole then edged away through the stretch in a steady drive. ILKNUR stalked the leaders three
wide, loomed a threat and continued gamely for the place. FUNWHILEITLASTED set a pressured pace, lost the advantage on the final turn then gradually
yielded. LA LA LUCY trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PAGEANT PRINCESS wide into the first turn, angled inside soon after then
faded into the far turn. OUI MADAME lagged far back inside and was never in contention.

Footnotes
FAST INTENTIONS forced the pace outside, dropped back briefly in midstretch then came again late to get the decision. SNOW FORECAST set a
pressured pace inside, bid clear in midstretch then was nailed at the wire. BOCA ROYALTY chased off the leaders inside, swung wide into the stretch and
closed well. KNOCK OUT KID lacked speed then advanced inside with a gradual stretch gain. STORMBEAM dropped back wide and narrowed the gap
while no threat. TERPEYE trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. WALK ME HOME moved wide off the leaders and began tiring on the turn. HAY
NINETEEN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetters then gave way.
