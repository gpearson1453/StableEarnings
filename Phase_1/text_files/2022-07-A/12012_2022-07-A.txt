Footnotes
CHANGE THE WORLD stalked the pace then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled for the nod inside the sixteenth pole and contested the
edge two deep on the far turn, drew clear mid-stretch then widened the final sixteenth. WHALE OF A TIME rated a short lead inside, dug in to the challenge
of Change The World leaving the three eighths pole, ceded the nod to that one past the quarter pole, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the
turn but dropped back mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. PEARLY GHOST was a reluctant loader then steadied into the opening turn and settled
off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. BAYS CASTLE rounded the
opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and passed tiring rivals in the
lane. ELIANAGRACE saved ground on the frist turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
TIMETOGETUP broke awkwardly and rounded the first turn about the four path, stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
faded off the rail on the far turn. This race was hand timed.

SALTY SAUL took the lead on the chute and set a pressured pace, drew clear and widened at the rail on the turn then kept alert in the lane. NY BETH
GETSITDONE pressured the pace inside, steadied at the rail into the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BETTER BOAT gave close early chase but dropped
back in the three and four paths of the turn and showed little more. GRAM'S GAL dropped well back while giving chase through the opening quarter and
was never a factor. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Salty Saul, lodged by the rider of Ny Beth Getsitdone, though, found no
infraction.

NICE N' BROAD pressured the pace and drew to even terms two deep approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch then widened later yards.
COACH RUBE set a pressured early pace, was met at the rail toward the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and settled for second best. MISS
WAVE became fractious in the gate then gave close early chase inside, but dropped back toward the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and ran
evenly in the lane. CHIEFS KINGDOM chased outside, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened the final sixteenth. DISTORTED SPLENDOR
gave close early chase then faded nearing the quarter pole. CHEERFUL CHIMES was only briefly close then faded past the three eighths pole.

JEFFERSON NATIVE rated the early pace then came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and was steadily
handled to hold on well. SETTLEMENT DATE gave chase, raced close two deep on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. NOCASHREFUNDS chased the
early pace inside, angled to the outside into the lane and finished well to take third late yards. WARRIOR'S ESTATE bobbled at the break and raced well
back from early contention, but improved steadily, ran near the rail on the turn and raced evenly in the stretch. THE ILLUSIONIST gave chase, rounded the
turn off the rail then weakened later yards. SO COURAGEOUS chased, rounded the turn off the rail but drifted into the lane and showed little more.
