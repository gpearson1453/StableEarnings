the final strides. LA CORONA away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside and finished clear for second. FACTISIMFLASHY pressed the pace two
wide until deep stretch then faded late. EMERSON JONES was a sharp threat two wide into the turn then weakened in the stretch. GOLD APPEAL trailed.
BROWNIE ducked out a few strides out of the gate unseating her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CRAFTY CHIEF pressed the early pace three wide, took charge on the turn, drifted to the seven path and drew clear under right handed urging. JACK BE
FAST set the early pace under pressure along the rail then was no match for the winner. BOOT LEGGER hopped at the start and had a mild late rally in the
seven path. OHIO PLAYER was a sharp threat four wide into the turn, drifted out past the middle of the racetrack and lost ground. FIREUPTHEJET pressed
the pace two wide and weakened in the stretch. IT'S A MANS WORLD close up along the inside, angled out on the turn and gave way on the stretch.
PRECIOUS JULES was no factor. NOTHINLASTSFOREVER was no threat.

Footnotes
AMIGO'S AFFAIR broke in front and had speed from the start three wide, made the lead two wide past the three furlong marker, set the balance of the
pace, drifted to the six path, was struck with a right handed whip once near the sixteenth pole and won under confident handling. CUTLER raced on near
even terms for the lead two wide on the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the turn, angled outside rivals then came on again in upper stretch in the seven
path but was no match for the winner. ICONIC had a mild late rally in the five path. KHALFANI failed to menace. COTTON JIM settled four wide and lacked
the needed response. BIG TRIP was hustled to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail into the turn, kept pressure until deep
stretch then gave way. BOB'S CALLING trailed.

PASSIONFORTREASURE never far back, closed willingly in the four path through the stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. CIRCUS
RINGS pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace, drifted out to the six path late and couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner. EVER WONDER stalked the early pace, loomed boldly outside the leader into the stretch and was outfinished while being carried out
nearing the wire. TOTALLY OBSESSED broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the turn had speed into the stretch then weakened late. HERE
COMES JIGS was no factor. TWERK was no threat.
