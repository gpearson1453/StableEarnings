Footnotes
STANLEY RYDER saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out three-wide to offer his bid nearing the quarter pole, caught
Proudtobesicillan nearing the either pole and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive. PROUDTOBESICILIAN sprinted clear early, set the pace racing slightly off
the rail, responded when challenged and just missed. BENNY THE JET saved ground stalking the pace, found room entering the stretch and finished in a
mild rally. TUMAC MOUNTAIN bobbled at the start to get away behind his field, then was unhurried early, moved up split rivals nearing the quarter pole,
was four-wide entering the start and gained some ground late. INQUISITION raced three-wide on the turn, was five wide entering the stretch and lacked a
rally.

SWEET KATIE O broke out at the start to bump with Shirl's House, then set the pressure pace while racing two-wide, shook clear entering the stretch and
increased her advantage to the wire. CLUBHOUSE WAVE was pinched back at the start, then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and gained
some ground while improving her position. STEEL NERVES hopped in the air at the start, then rushed up along the inside to dispute the pace to the stretch
and weakened slightly late. SHIRL'S HOUSE broke in to bump with the winner at the start, was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, offered a
bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to sustain her rally.

MIXO saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to be two-wide nearing the quarter pole, wore down Cody's Choice to take the lead leaving the eighth pole
and gradually drew clear. CODY'S CHOICE sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged but could not stay with the
winner late and continued on well for the place. TOIL AND TROUBLE was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into
the stretch and was gaining ground late. CROOKED FINGER RAY was prominent early while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. ATTA BOY BILLY was not a factor while saving ground.

Footnotes
BLAME THE DEVIL vied for the lead from the outset while two-wide, opened a slight lead nearing the quarter pole, responded to pressure during the drive,
came out slightly nearing the wire and prevailed in a prolonged drive. MARKSMAN ON TARGET was never far back while racing four-wide, moved up to
join the leaders nearing the eighth pole, wasn't quite good enough but continued on for the place in a game trh. MAYHEM AND CHAOS was allowed to
settle in stride early, moved up between horses on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch to offer a bold bid, caught the leaders nearing the eighth pole,
was unable to stay with the winner late and steadied slightly nearing the wire when that one came out slightly. FIRING PIN unhurried early, improved his
position racing along the inside on the turn, checked nearing the quarter pole lacking room, angled out for the drive and finished willingly when clear.
HANDSOME HUSSAR dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SWEETWATER CLYDE disputed pace inside for six
furlongs and tired. RADIANT KITTEN failed to menace while racing five-wide. The trainer of Mayhem and Chaos lodged an objection against the winner, but
after viewing the films the stewards made no change in the order of finish.

MAJOR MUNNINGS was never far back while racing three-wide, caught the leaders nearing the sixteenth pole and was all out to prevail. MAKAH LANE
stumbled at the start to get away behind his field, then was unhurried, moved up along the inside on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and finished
fast. CANDY ZIP was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. GOLDIE'S HILLS saved ground while
being prominently place and finished willingly. NORTHWEST RAIN set the pace while racing two-wide into the stretch and weakened slightly late. THE
PRESS was forwardly placed while racing two-wide on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch, but lacked the needed late response.
