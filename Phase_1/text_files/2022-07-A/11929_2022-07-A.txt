Footnotes
MY SPY sat off the pace in the early going, went three wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair, took
over with a sixteenth left to run and drew away. VEGAS DREAM bumped in the beginning, sped clear and showed the way two wide into the stretch, led into
the final furlong, yielded to the winner at the sixteenth pole and held the place. DREAMER GIRL was closest in pursuit three wide around the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, continued within striking distance through the lane but lacked the needed final kick in deep stretch. PLATONIC stumbled leaving
the gate, chased near the inside then two wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response in the lane. PARCO hopped leaving the gate, trailed well off
the inside early, went four wide into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS broke in and bumped rival leaving
the gate, went two wide into the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace.

RHETORIC dueled for command from outside, inched clear around the bend, then drew off under right-handed urging and was ridden out to the wire. STILL
ON THE BOOKS stalked the speed from outside early on, put in a mild bid three deep on the turn, chased wide into the stretch and bested the rest.
WESTERN CAPE broke in then went up to duel for command from inside, lost contact with the winner with five-sixteenths remaining and stayed on to
secure the show. TENTH STREET DON broke slow and hit the gate in the beginning, advanced two to three wide around the turn but failed to threaten in
the stretch run. FACETIOUS raced up close between early then chased off the rail into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. OUR
JOURNEY got forced in leaving the gate, steadied off heels past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled off the inside after and failed to make an impact.
DOYOUSTILLLOVEME broke through the gate and was re-loaded, chased between early then angled to the inside on the turn and tired in the lane.

SELF ISOLATION pressed the pace three deep early then outside the leader on the backstretch, took over past the three-eighths pole, shook free with a
quarter mile left to run, drew away and was geared down while padding the lead late. HOT ON THE TRAIL stumbled badly in the beginning, settled in the
two path, angled out into the stretch and bested the rest. NORTHERN GEM pressed the pace from inside then chased up the backstretch, raced off the rail
into the lane and kept on to earn the show honors. GIANNA'S WILD CAT sped to the front in the two path, showed the way up the backstretch under
pressure, lost the lead past the three-eighths pole, could not kick on with the winner with a quarter mile left to run, came out past the three-sixteenths pole

Footnotes
BABY GRONK settled early, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane, surged clear midstretch and was
kept to task to the wire. SCRATCHY APACHE sat off the pace early on, angled in to save ground around the turn, rallied in the drive and was clearly second
best. CIRCLE WEST broke in and bumped rival, got crowded and lost his path early, angled out into the clear, went three then four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, steered inward in the lane and gained the show. RALLY CAT was closest in pursuit early, bid outside at the three-eighths pole,
drifted out into the stretch, overtaken at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) sped clear to take control, challenged by RALLY
CAT at the three-eighths pole, fought three wide into the stretch, then weakened down the lane. DEBT MONGER tracked wide up the backstretch, went five
wide then six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and weakened. BIG CHEDDAR brushed the gate in the beginning, chased four to five wide
around the turn and failed to respond when called upon. VERY IRISH bumped at the start, tracked from inside then moved off the rail around the bend and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
HIGH CONNECTION dueled for command from outside, battled four wide into the lane, shook free midstretch and was kept to task with left-handed urging
to the wire. SLOW DOWN ANDY dueled for command inside HIGH CONNECTION, eased off the rail and battled three wide into the lane, lugged in in upper
stretch, straightened course under the left-hand and chased the winner to the wire while proving second best. WIN THE DAY bobbled leaving the gate,
stalked the pace from inside, tipped off the rail on the far turn and bested the rest. DOPPELGANGER tracked four wide outside rivals on the first turn, went
three to four wide on the second bend, coaxed five wide into the stretch and weakened. GOT THUNDER broke a step slow in the beginning, stalked the top
pair between rivals or off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
