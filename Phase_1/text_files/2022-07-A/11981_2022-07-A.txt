FEDERAL LAW was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. SEAL TEAM TWO set the pace and
had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner. CONQUER THE BREEZE was well back, closed the
gap on the far turn and was up for show. KEEP GOING was off slow, chased on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
GIANT MINE was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.

Footnotes
M V SPEED set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. VOYANT forced the pace,
dueled on the turn, vied to mid stretch and was second best. GUNZIG STINGER was hustled early and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch needed more. TRINITY THUNDAH was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was well
back and showed little in a dull effort. TWICE AS SMART was in range but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

leveled off. MISS D'S PRIDE was off slow and closed the gap on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. SON OF MY FATHER
