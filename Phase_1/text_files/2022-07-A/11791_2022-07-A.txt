BACK SEAT BETTY chased the pace two to three wide, moved up under right handed asking and engaged the leader leaving mid stretch, took over soon
after and drew clear under steady handling. NEVER FREE opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, failed to contain the winner heading to the
sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. ALAS AND ALACK , three wide with pursuit, moved up between runners around the turn, shifted
out some near mid stretch and kept on willingly. MISS FUSSY PANTS broke a step slow, edged up off the rail into the turn, steadied off foes near the three
eighths, regrouped and made progress off the inside past the three sixteenths, steadied in traffic a furlong out, altered in and continued with interest. MEAT
SWEATS lost ground four wide, made a mild run outside rivals mid turn and faded. REPLICATED broke a step slow, was hustled up to advance inside rivals
leaving the far turn, stayed in touch while under a strong ride past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on soon into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
SILENT MALICE lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, found ample room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to
command approaching the eighth pole, was under urging until late and eagerly drew off. HONOR THE FLEET stalked the pace while three wide on the turn,
eased out, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch, had aim on the lead but was no match for the winner. FORTUNE'S FOOL , up close three deep on
the turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch and flattened out. CLUBMAN hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
lacked a rally. OUR HOISTED MAST set a pressured pace inside KNOWHOIKNOW, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. KNOWHOWIKNOW
prompted the pace outside OUR HOISTED MAST, was carried wide by that one turning for home and faltered. ONE TWO KID , outrun, was eased late.

Footnotes
STIMULUS MAKER , patiently handled while saving ground, edged up into the lane, steadied briefly near the three sixteenths, eased out and found a seam
between runners in mid stretch, took a short lead soon after then drew clear late under a drive. THE LAST SCIP , three wide outside rivals around the first
turn, was taken to rate then gained ground off the inside into the far turn, angled out and circled five wide after given his cue, ranged up to be on near even
terms a furlong out, failed to match strides with the winner but kept on willingly to hold down the place. PURSUING PACE broke sluggishly, settled well back
through the opening half mile, moved up some while off the rail into the far turn, angled six wide while under pressure into the lane and rallied. CLASS
WIZARD tracked three wide while outside a rival, moved to the attack nearing the quarter pole, wrested a short lead soon into the lane, dueled past mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final fifty yards. STEADY EDDIE stalked towards the inside, took closer order two wide into the lane, continued
progress between rivals past mid stretch and churned on. KING OF STING , between foes early, settled in the clear past the five eighths, steadily
progressed off the rail around the final turn, challenged between horses in mid stretch then flattened out. CAPTAIN QUINT settled well back while saving
ground, moved around a tiring foe around the final turn then lacked a serious stretch kick. IT BEAST ALL vied inside, moved clear into the far turn, met a
threat nearing the quarter pole, battled past the three sixteenths, failed to go on and steadied when in tight leaving mid stretch. OBOY , hustled up outside
rivals to join the pace fray, vied outside IT BEAST ALL for a half mile, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SHOW'EM WHO'S BOSS , well placed off the inner rail the opening three furlongs, eased out three deep leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch,
was challenged on her inside by MISS FOXANN near the eighth pole, battle with that one and proved best. MISS FOXANN saved ground on the turn,
remained along the inner rail in the stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch, dueled and hung. FORTES stalked the pace, moved to the four path in upper
stretch and flattened out. CANDY CORNER , steadied soon after the break, was four deep leaving the turn, drifted out and lacked a rally. IF THEN bobbled
leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was outrun. MICK'SBESTBETYET was not a factor. SPLENDID VIEW rushed up outside
horses down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path on the turn and weakened. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , outrun, drifted six wide leaving the turn.

SWAYIN TO AND FRO , brushed at the break, moved up in hand and prompted three wide outside rivals, took closer order past the five sixteenths then
engaged CLICK TO CONFIRM from the outside, dueled on a short lead between rivals through the final furlong and dug in tenaciously under solid handling
to prevail. CANOODLE rated along between rivals while stalking into the turn, eased back off of foes near the three eighths then eased out, came back and
ranged up four wide to bid in upper stretch, gamely battled outside foes but was kept at bay. WICKED HOT showed speed inside foes then rated back
leaving the chute to stalk, remained close up under coaxing past the five sixteenths, was afforded a clear run along the rail and moved through soon into the
lane, sparred on near even terms leaving the eighth pole then was out finished. CLICK TO CONFIRM cleared rivals after quarter mile and set the pace two
wide, took pressure approaching the lane, could not go with foes to each side leaving the three sixteenths and faded. DRY WELL , in range towards the
inside, swung five wide with a run in upper stretch, chased the leaders while on her left lead and came up empty. LITTLE MS SCARLET , four wide within
range, was fanned six wide into the lane and faded. DOTADA , off the pace towards the inside, was under asking mid turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STONY POINT prompted the pace outside MAGICAL LUNA around the turn, gained command in upper stretch, sprinted clear in mid stretch and lasted
under steady handling. ROYAL ENGAGEMENT , two wide on the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole, was taken
out soon after, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and rallied outside the winner. TRITONE GAL lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, angled to the five
path in mid stretch and rallied outside horses. LOLA FLO , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, was in perfection in upper stretch and flattened out.
BOURBON WILDCAT , unhurried early, failed to menace and passed tired horses. MAGICAL LUNA set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way
in the drive. KILLY START , no factor, was in the six path in mid stretch. LOOKS DON'T LIE hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened. SENSON
, three wide on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
HYBRID ECLIPSE advanced under rating while saving ground past the three quarter pole and engaged THE GRASS IS BLUE, gained a slim advantage
heading to the turn, remained under rating while dueling, responded to coaxing past the three eighths then was guided three wide entering the lane, spurted
away leaving the quarter pole, kept on under solid handing leaving mid stretch and held firm. THE GRASS IS BLUE , headstrong early while on the lead well
off the rail, shifted in some and was joined by the winner leaving the three quarter pole, contested the pace under firm rating into and around the turn,
remained under some rating as the winner cleared off soon into the stretch, came under a ride near the three sixteenths and gave willing chase to the wire.
GLOWSITY moved up while saving ground early on, stalked the top pair mid turn, failed to go on with the leaders while scrubbed on into the lane but kept
giving effort to be well clear of the rest. WHOLEBODEMEISTER flashed speed then rated off the leaders, stalked off the inside, was under pressure four
wide into the stretch, stayed on to the three sixteenths then faded. BIG CHEEKS , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, swung five wide for the drive but
lacked a serious run. BESS stalked off the inside, made a four wide run under pressure nearing the lane, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave
way. STAND FOR THE FLAG , off the pace, was under asking three wide into the lane and tired.

OLD HOMESTEAD disputed a fast pace outside SCARAMOUCHE, sprinted clear in mid stretch and was kept to his business in the drive. NIMITZ CLASS
stumbled leaving the starting gate, was behind horses while off the duel, swung four deep leaving the turn and rallied outside. SCARAMOUCHE showed
speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace, failed to keep up with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and drifted out in deep
stretch. DEFEND , snugly rated off the duel down the backstretch, eased out three wide leaving the turn, was lightly brushed by SCARAMOUCHE in
midstretch and approaching the finish. ALOTTAHOPE saved ground around the turn while off the duel, eased off the rail in upper stretch, lacked clear racing
room, moved back inside approaching the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. An objection by the rider of DEFEND against SCARAMOUCHE for alleged
interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

BARDOLINO sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, briefly lost the lead in mid stretch, stayed
on to duel under strong handling, wandered out some and got the bob. ROBEY'S BOY prompted the pace outside the winner, responded when set down in
upper stretch and went after the winner, gained a slim advantage past mid stretch, went head to head in game fashion from there and lost the bob.
SPITBALL rated off the pace, angled five wide for the drive and rallied mildly. BIG TALL DAWG , four deep and in range into the turn, was under pressure
while remaining wide into the stretch, drifted in late and faded. PHASE OUT , bumped at the break, pulled his way forward while saving ground soon after,
stalked the leaders mid turn then went evenly through the drive. JIMMY THE KID , three wide giving chase, lacked a stretch response.
