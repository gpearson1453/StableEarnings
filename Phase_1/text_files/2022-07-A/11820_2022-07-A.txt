Footnotes
SUPER DONNA G unruly in the post parade was coaxed to the starting gate, would break well prompting the pace dueling on the far turn shaking clear
along the inside in upper stretch angling out in mid stretch hanging on at the end. PEGGY O'PRADO raced evenly off the pace through the far turn rallying
to contention from mid track in upper stretch pressing gamely in the final yards. DESERT DOTTY tracked the pace saving ground to upper stretch vying
boldly late in the two path. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) came in sharply jamming rivals at the break, pressured the pace dueling through the backside then the far
turn ceding to rival in upper stretch weakening late. LADY KIM slow early came five wide into upper stretch angling seven wide while gaining late. FOR MY
MOM was squeezed back at the break. COME ON CITY (GER) slow early saved ground to upper stretch failing to menace there. COWGIRL NIGHT and
THIRSTY GAL were jammed back at the break. MIDNIGHT LEAP was always outrun.

Footnotes
PRINCE AMADEUS broke sharply clearing early widening on the backside taking a breather on the far turn drawing out along the inside in upper stretch
being ridden out. ITS BIG unhurried early advanced along the outside on the far turn chasing a loose leader from mid track in willing fashion down the lane.
QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW tracked the pace pursuing along the inside to upper stretch angling out a bit late while finishing evenly. YANKEE GO HOME
slow early saved ground to upper stretch showing some late interest along the rail. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS tracked evenly gaining a touch on the far turn
lacking surge while six wide down the lane. FLY HOME stalked a loose leader gaining on a measured foe on the far turn leveling off in upper stretch. BAY
DEFENSE played no factor. EDUARD folded up after a half mile. CLEVELAND POWER ran off delaying the start, was always far back easing through the
lane.

FAIT ACCOMPLI stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch angling out toward mid track mid stretch extending up in the last yards. FOOL FOR THE CITY
hustled out was pressured on pace dueling through the far turn shaking clear along the inside in upper stretch angling out when challenged late missing in a
game effort. EMBRACE THE GRIND slow early lost ground to upper stretch giving a mild rally there in the seven path. PAT'S FACTOR prompted the pace
dueling through the far turn weakening in upper stretch. CENTRE STREET tracked the pace wavering on the far turn racing evenly through the lane in the

extending down the stretch responded as a game second best. K P SILVER BULLET slow early lagged to upper stretch finding late response to move up.
TRIGZ TOO a step slow through the turn raced evenly down the stretch lacking more. JOCKO ROAD hustled along off the pace tired in upper stretch.
HARD FROST was never involved. CAPONE'S LOFT was always outrun. HEY SACH flashed early speed then faded on the turn.
