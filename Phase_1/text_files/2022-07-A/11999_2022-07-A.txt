the lane from the three path, shifted into the six path and was gaining to the end. HERE COMES DOC chased the pace from the three to the two path into
the lane, was still a threat when straightening then flattened late. NIGHT THINGS steadily faded while off the inside through the far turn. ITS MY BAG BABY

while in the two path, tipped into the four path for the drive and finished evenly. WANNA HAVE FUN chased the three rival duel through the turn, angled into
the five path for the drive, had aim on the top ones inside the sixteenth pole, was brushed late by AZURITA and needed more. C J S SUZIE BYU vied for

GO FOR SHERRIE settled off the early pace while off the inside, moved three wide to bid into the far turn, remained on nearly even terms through the turn,
inched to the front and cleared outside the eighth pole then kept on to hold. HE TAKES CHARGE raced in the three path through the turn when never far
back, bid into the lane from the three path, was gaining momentum when shifting to the four path when path closed, continued on with energy late and was
up for the place spot. WILDCARD PRADO was unhurried while off the rail, bid three wide into the lane, was in the five path when gaining through the lane,
loomed a serious threat inside the eighth pole and needed more. MOMENT chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid with the winner near
the three-eighths pole, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then weakened. KREWE CHIEF chased the pace from the two path into the lane and
weakened. COPPER KING was unhurried while near the rail, angled from the rail to the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the six path, moved to
menacing position from mid-track and flattened out. FULCO set the early pace into the backstretch then gave way entering the far turn.

Footnotes
LIVY B was unhurried while off the inside into the far turn, moved through the two or three path in late turn, gained momentum into the lane from the four
path, rallied from mid-track to draw to near even terms near the eighth pole, quickly cleared and drifted to the rail while widening. BLESSING THE FLAG
chased the pace from the two path through the turn when never far back, angled to the rail to loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go, was no match for
the closing winner but stayed on to gain the place spot. ORNAMENTAL settled off the early pace, moved up down the backstretch while under a hold, bid
two wide into the turn, dueled through the turn and into the lane while on a short lead, challenged by two newcomers at eighth pole and weakened late. I'M
BOX OFFICE was unhurried while saving ground, angled into the five path for the drive and moved up and was closing in on the place and show spot.
PEACH COBBLER vied for the lead down the backstretch, shook off dueling challenger into the turn, was joined by two others, continued in close proximity
into the lane and faltered. MARGARITA TIME vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn then gave way in late turn. TAKE CHARGE CHLOE steadily
faded from the two path. LUNA CLASICA was far back throughout.

Footnotes
CREATIVE CREDIT beat the other speed rivals to the lead, raced under pressure through the turn, cleared after straightening in the lane then kept under
intermittent urging through the final sixteenth to stay. ELLE Z pressed the winner two wide through the turn, lost some ground when straightening in the
lane, continued under a drive while also dueling for the place spot and was inching up late. CASHABLE chased the pace along the inside through the turn,
cut the corner and was a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not gain while clear for the show spot. NEW BOSS saved ground through the turn,
came into the lane from the two path and needed more. TOUCH OF CLASS was in the three to the four path through late turn, came into the lane from the
six path and offered a mild gain. LEMOS CUNHA was never a threat while in the two path through the turn. MISS MAJORETTE saved ground through the
turn, angled into the seven path for the drive and never was a factor. SIGNIFY chased the pace from the three path through the turn then faded after
entering the lane.
