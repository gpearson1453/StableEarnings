Footnotes
BLONDEONAMISSION rated kindly behind the early pace down the backstretch, split runners in the four path turning for home, took control around the
sixteenth pole and won going away late. JOLENE JOLENE rated back while going three wide into the first turn, was advancing around runners in the far turn
but was floated out to the six path entering the stretch, ran on well but could not match the winner late. BLU SKY SUNRISE chased between horses into the
first turn, stalked the pacesetters around the final turn and angled just outside for the drive but was outfinished by the top two in the final eighth.
FORESTERS PRINCESS took command on the rail entering the first turn, repelled an outside early bid at the half mile pole, battled on through the lane but
was collared just outside the sixteenth pole and faded late losing third. PRACTICAL GIZMO chased the speed while three wide into the first turn, made an
early bid entering the final turn, drifted out five wide entering the stretch and stalled down the lane. SMARTY ILLUSION was allowed to settle at the back
saving ground early, advanced into contention on the rail at the half, and retreated on the final turn.

Footnotes
I'M A CHI TOO settled off the pace tracking inside, came out for room at the quarter pole and was put to urging thereafter, struck the lead a furlong out and
quickly kicked clear. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked in behind the pace going two wide on the turn, tipped out a path in mid-stretch, kept on to get up for
second. BOUND LUCKY set the pace facing moderate pressure, moved clear three furlongs out racing on or just off the rail, was overtaken in mid-stretch
and lost place late. DOCTOR WU was forced out just a bit at the break, stalked within range going three to five wide on the turn, kept on with late interest
but ran out of ground for a better placing. CHANCEL pressed the pace early, asked for more three furlongs out, moved out from two to four wide on the turn,
weakened. BULLET SPEED broke outwardly and was urged along, steadily dropped back early, shifted in and faded. SOUPER PRONTO chased outside,
shifted in late on the turn and in upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
GOLDMINE CAT circled runners on the turn in the four path, assumed control at the quarter pole and quickly opened up mid stretch to win convincingly
while drawing away in the final stages. SEA SCOUT was rated back between runners after the start, waited inside of rivals entering the turn, roused mid turn
while three wide and angled out to the five path between horses while finishing well to clearly get second. OVER THE HILLS broke sharp to get the lead,
was collared at the quarter pole while inside of runners and finished with some late interest to hold on to the show. DIXIE GIANT chased the speed just
outside into the turn, was roused at the quarter pole to keep up with circling runners to his outside and finished evenly down the lane to get a minor share.
TOMCAT BLACK was near the rear early, followed the winner while advancing four wide on the turn, angled out even wider for the stretch drive but stalled
in the final eighth. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK broke well, was asked to keep inside position early down the backside, then was reined back entering the far
turn, saved ground throughout and passed a tiring foe through the stretch. PEPPERONI was away sluggishly at the break, quickly loomed into contention
between runners into the far turn and had nothing to offer for the drive backing away through the field in the stretch

Footnotes
CORDUROY ROAD tracked along the inside, found room to bid in upper stretch, took the lead past the furlong marker and was soon clear, held sway.
ANALYZER broke a couple lengths slowly then angled in, keenly pulled against the rider's restraint up on heels of those in front then was able to relax into
the turn going two to three wide on that bend, came out five wide turning for home, fought on to get the place. COMBATIVE stalked just off the pacesetter,
went two to three wide on the turn, moved to challenge in upper stretch, was outfinished for second. EPILOGUE stalked in behind three to four wide on the
turn losing ground turning for home, came out six deep in upper- to mid-stretch and kept on late. SWAMP SOUFFLE shifted in two wide about the half,
swung out four deep turning for home, moved out further in later stretch and finished with interest. DECIMATOR broke outwardly, raced outside to the turn
then angled in about the seven-sixteenths racing three wide then a little nearer the rail, came out in upper stretch and ran on. MARTEN RIVER got away
alertly, set the pace racing just off the rail, gave way in the stretch. SILENCE BREAKERS stalked three to four wide, was empty for the final eighth.

Footnotes
CUPID'S DUDE was gaining position steadily on the outside of runners through the final turn, held his position well entering the stretch and wore down the
leader just before the wire. RUNNINFORCOVER stalked behind the speed early, made a bid for the lead with a quarter to go and assumed command
nearing the eighth pole only to surrender the lead late nearing the wire. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE stalked inside on the far turn waiting for room behind the
pacesetters, tried to angle out for a clear path in the run down the stretch, had to negotiate a run between horses with a sixteenth of a mile to go and
finished with some interest late to get up for third. JUST START ME UP was away alertly to dictate the pace, opened up on the field through the backside,
was headed at the quarter pole and faded inside of horses while holding on for a minor share. LIARS CLUB advanced three wide on the final turn to be in
contention entering the stretch and stalled the final eighth of a mile. MAD DOG N JOE was squeezed at the break, settled at the rear in the early stages,
waited on the rail in the final turn to angle out to the seven path for the drive and levelled out through the lane. JMR PURE SENSATION broke in at the start,
trailed into the backstretch and never was involved. TARA TATTOO near the rear early, roused on the final turn and had no response.

UNABLE was a bit reluctant to load, broke outwardly then was keen to move forward, allowed to go after a time and forced the pace two wide into the turn,
moved clear and held under intermittent urging. SACRED DANCER reared at the start then was allowed to settle, moved four to five wide on the turn, fought
late to get the place. I HAVE AN IDEA was forced in at the break, tracked in behind inside rivals, moved out two wide on the turn, was outfinished for
second. MENAGERIE broke inwardly bothering a rival, chased the pace three to four wide and was asked for more about the five-sixteenths but offered no
late response. GOLDEN SUZIE was bothered at the break, settled at the back racing off the inside, came out in mid-stretch and ran on.
SASSYWITHATTITUDE got away alertly and set the early pace briefly before being overtaken, saved ground on the turn and weakened in the stretch.
CLINK CHEERS broke inwardly, tracked up close two to three wide, faded.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S TURN was just outside tracking the pacesetter throughout, engaged that foe entering the stretch, got level with the leader inside the eighth
pole and wore down that rival nearing the finish line. WENJACK took command after the break, set the pace entering the stretch where he was challenged
by the winner, battled stubbornly down the lane only to give way in the final strides. SOUPER COHIBA was near the rear outside in the beginning, advanced
outside of runners through the turn and was gaining gradually on the top two through the stretch. HALLIE'S HERO rated behind the pacesetters comfortably
through the half, made a mild rail rally in early stretch only to even out the final eighth. DR. SHANE was shuffled back briefly while on the rail entering the
turn and never offered a serious threat through the lane. DYNAMITE KARMA trailed in the beginning, was roused through the turn and was not a factor.
OUR ZUMA was between runners down the backstretch, ridden on the turn but could not keep up.

Footnotes
BODY OF LAW shifted in, raced toward the rear two to three wide on the turn, had room in upper stretch, took aim, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove
clear. VIVIAN ANN settled in behind rivals mid-pack shifting in, went two to three wide on the turn, altered to the rail turning for home, bid inside and
engaged in a duel but was outkicked by another foe while securing the place. MIDNIGHT MEADOW switched off the inside tracking two wide through the
turn, bid between runners coming to the quarter pole, had the lead in upper stretch then was engaged and dueled, was outkicked and lost the place.
HONOR AND DIGNITY was urged forward to chase three to four wide, lost ground into upper stretch but kept on late for the minor award. POSITIVE
chased outside four to five wide through the turn and needed more late. DEVIL IN HER HEART made a solid bid three wide leaving the turn but could not
sustain the effort. LAILA'S CHARM was urged clear to dictate terms inside, gave way and faded. IMPULSIVELY raced outside three to four wide and was
never near enough to threaten. FUNICULA altered course off the inside early then back nearer the rail, was not a threat.
