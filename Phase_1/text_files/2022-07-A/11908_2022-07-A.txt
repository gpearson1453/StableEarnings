Footnotes
KEEN SAMURAI was tracking inside early, took command at the half mile pole up the rail, opened up in early stretch and held well at the finish. PUGIN
made a middle move between runners through the turn, angled out widest down the stretch to best the rest by just getting up for the place award.
LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL took command leaving the chute, was headed by the winner on the inside at the half mile pole and showed some grit between
runners through the lane just losing second at the wire. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS was outside runners in the four path entering the far turn, ridden to keep
up mid turn and did not threaten through the stretch. TOO LEGIT stalked behind the pace on the rail, waited on the turn for a clear run in the stretch and had
no finishing kick to offer through the lane. YZERMAN hopped then bobbled at the break and could never get involved afterwards.

Footnotes
QUIET REBEL tucked in two to three wide in the back half of the field in the early going, tipped out and advanced four deep commencing a bid, took over
about the quarter pole, was clear and asked for run at the three-sixteenths and responded to draw away. DR CHROME broke just a tad slowly and shifted in
settling well back near the inside, fanned seven wide into the stretch, ran on to get up for second while no threat to the winner. FOREST SELECTION was
well-placed mid-pack between runners three wide through the first turn, bumped early up the backstretch, edged closer three to four wide on the far turn,
was in second till near the wire and settled for show honors. CHOICE PLAYER exchanged a bump at the start, tracked inside early, shifted out turning for
home, appeared to clip heels and stumbled past the quarter, came into upper stretch six wide and ran on evenly. ULTIMATE ANSWER appeared washy
heading to the gate, was keen after the break fighting restraint to stay off the lead three wide into the first turn, settled thereafter to stalk, shifted in before the
far turn and dropped back along the rail but kept on late inside rivals. MR. COMMISH sped clear on the first turn to dictate terms inside, raced off the fence
leaving the far turn and was overtaken, weakened in the stretch. IVICTORY exchanged a bump at the break, settled off the pace inside on or just off the rail,
was carried eight wide turning for home. DONTCALLMESWEETY advanced outside rivals four wide up the backstretch, was in striking distance coming to
the far turn going three wide on that bend but faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MI TORMENTA waited at the back in the beginning, angled outside just before the quarter pole for a clear run in the six path entering the stretch and wore
down her rivals late on the outside getting up just before the wire. SHISHKA took control soon after the start, was well rated on the turn to have have
something left for the run down the lane, battled with an outside rival in early stretch, briefly surrendered the lead while inside of runners nearing the
sixteenth pole and gave way stubbornly late to another runner closing well on the outside. LINDA LOVES LACE tracked the pace just outside entering the
turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, battled in early stretch to briefly get a nose in front, was then engaged outside by a closing runner and weakened very
late while in tight between runners. CALL ME KITTY made a mild move four wide on the turn and finished evenly down the lane besting a couple of runners.
MISS LANGSKIP was between runners throughout, roused through the turn and had little response for the drive. CORA chased the leaders on the rail and
had nothing to offer through the stretch.

Footnotes
SOLAR settled early racing two wide into the first turn and coming out a bit later on that bend, took closer order heading to the far turn, asked for more past
the quarter pole, swung six wide into the stretch, struck the lead in mid-stretch and kicked clear under solid urging. FIRST SPRING tracked inside on or just
off the rail, moved out four wide to commence a bid late on the far turn, was second best. GUITAR GEORGE bobbled into a rival at the start, lacked early
speed despite some encouragement racing three wide. JEGOS FIRE moved forward eagerly outside the leader four then three wide on the first turn to take
over near the six-and-one-half, moved in while clear to set the terms up the backstretch, was challenged on the far turn, kept on in the stretch but needed
more. D'S BEN had the early lead while shifting in heading to the first turn, ceded that lead to a rival and was content to stalk, bid two to three wide on the
far turn, dueled in upper stretch, was outkicked. SELF INFLICTED saved ground racing inside till upper stretch, came out a bit at that juncture, ran on evenly
and lacked the needed late kick. GLOVANNA was bumped at the break, failed to menace racing mostly two to three wide.

Footnotes
RECONFIGURE took a stalking position while three wide on the turn, commenced his bid while wildest in the stretch and finished well on the outside of
rivals to just win the photo at the wire. SILENT FLASH chased the pace just outside on the backstretch, challenged for the lead between runners in early
stretch, briefly took command around the sixteenth pole and lost the victory on the bob at the wire. SUNSPEAR quickly took the lead, fought on well in upper
stretch when challenged on the outside, was collared at the sixteenth pole and faded late holding onto show. SALVATOR MUNDI bobbled at the start, was
between rivals on the turn and finished with interest the final eighth just missing getting up for third. NIAGARA SKYLINE waited behind runners in the
beginning, roused mid turn and rallied mildly through the stretch but could not gain enough late. SOUPER SUCCESS was hustled for inside position down
the backstretch, weakened while saving ground through the turn and offered little for the drive.

BIG EXECUTIVE was bumped after the break, tracked inside on or just off the rail, came out four wide turning for home, altered out two more paths for room
past the three-sixteenths and drove past. THE GREAT OZ was forwardly-positioned early then eased back off the leaders tracking in behind and shifting in
a bit on the turn, rallied between rivals for the place. CLASSY WHISPER bumped a rival after the start, settled toward the back near the inside, came out six
wide in upper stretch and gained late on the outside. LOBBY BAR was taken back and angled in after the start, trailed near the inside through the turn,
gained mildly along the rail inside foes but was outkicked for show. JACKIE'S PRIDE was bumped at the break, dueled inside, came off the fence in the
stretch and had no extra. VICTORY JET bumped a rival at the start, chased three wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, made a mild bid near
the furlong marker but could not sustain the effort. REGAL INTENT was bumped into a rival at the start, dueled outside two to three wide and weakened in
the stretch. WOOD BE WILD broke outwardly, was forwardly-placed chasing three to four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
DANCING DOLL sat just behind the early pacesetters tracking going into the turn, angled out at the quarter pole to quickly pounce on the tiring speed rivals,
opened up in mid stretch and held on for the win comfortably. STARLIGHT RIDGE trailed in the beginning, angled outside on the turn and was widest
entering the stretch, closed well in the five path finishing strong for a clear second. TAKE IT EASY was off well, held position while on the rail in tight
quarters at the half, roused on the turn saving ground and ran on through the lane to capture the show. SWIRLING CANDY broke sharp to take the lead
while angling in at the half, was briefly challenged by an outside rival on the turn surrendering the lead briefly, regained command mid turn then was quickly
collared by a tracking rival into the stretch and faded inside late. EVER SO D'WILD broke sharp, was steadied while in between runners at the half mile
pole, fell back to trail, and rallied mildly through the stretch splitting tiring foes late. MY FINAL TRICK was in tight between horses down the backstretch at
the half mile, steadied briefly and lost a few positions, offered a mild run on the turn while three wide and weakened in the closing stages. CLASSY N'
SILENT broke poorly and trailed, was headstrong down the backstretch while taking command entering the far turn, surrendered the lead shortly afterwards
and stopped through the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #2 EVER SO D'WILD, #4 MY FINAL TRICK AND #7 SWIRLING
CANDY AT THE HALF MILE POLE WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGES

Footnotes
LIL BIT GANGSTA was caught outside foes three wide on the first turn off the pace, advanced between rivals leaving the backstretch and again later on the
far turn coming four to five wide into the stretch commencing a bid, dueled briefly then edged away under steady handling. MAXIMUM DANGER moved
clear heading to the first turn, shifted in a bit to dictate terms, was challenged at the top of the stretch while drifting out, dueled for a bit inside the winner and
kept on willingly. KILLARY was reserved early tucking in near the inside racing well back, moved out and advanced four to five wide on the far turn, kept on
to gain show honors. SAME AGAIN DOC tracked while getting out on the first turn racing from the two to the four path, continued to stalk into the far turn
just off the leader three to five wide on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SOLIS settled mid-pack between rivals early, shifted in heading up the
backstretch, came out nearing the quarter pole clipping heels behind with a rival and ran on. MIGHTY PELE broke inwardly, saved ground on both turns in
good position but had no late gain. DOINGGOODTROUBLE settled near the inside, failed to rally. MUCHO MAN broke a step slowly, was never a threat
and not persevered with late. SNOOKERED was forwardly-positioned chasing three to five wide early, began to drop back on the far turn, clipped heels,
stumbled and lost the rider about the quarter pole, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, SOLIS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND
PLACED EIGHTH AND LAST FOR INTERFERENCE WITH SNOOKERED.
