Footnotes
MISS GRANDSTANDER broke through prior the break, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the six path toward
the head of the lane and dug in to take the nod under the wire. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE rated close inside, eased three wide into the lane and dueled
through the stretch for second but was nipped for the win under the wire. TOY TIGER broke a step slow then gave chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn
then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SAFE REEZAN became a bit fractious in the gate then set a pressured pace, contested the advantage
nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. LOOKIN BACK gave chase, rounded the
turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. U S FUNDS pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but dropped
back into the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. SUPER WILDCAT's rider stepped off when she became fractious just as the gate opened, and was
detained in the gate. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race before posting the official.

SUGAR LIPS stalked inside on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, was urged away from the
quarter then kept alert to draw further away. CRISTIANO BOY stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
but ultimately had to settle for second best. COMEONTURNMELOOSE bore out into the opening turn and raced well back from the half mile pole, started a
bid toward the five sixteenths pole but showed little more in the lane. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN set the early pace inside, was caught approaching the
three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. LIMEHOUSE NEWS saved ground. GAVINS BOY raced just off the early pace in the two and three paths but
showed little response through the backstretch.
