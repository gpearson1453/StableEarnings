midway on the backstretch, took over three wide when allowed on the bend then steadily widened command under a mild drive in the lane. WAVE THE
GOLD raced in contention from inside, floated out behind TEARS ON A RIVER entering the stretch, moved back to the rail soon after and took over second
inside the last eighth. LAYTON THE DAY bumped shortly after leaving the chute, soon vied for the lead inside rivals, did not stay with TEARS ON A RIDER
through the turn, angled outside the latter upper stretch and steadily yield. WILLIE ATTACK displayed early speed outside LAYTON THE DAY, gave way
between horses on the bend, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MISS WINDY SLEW shared the lead between rivals, moved clear on the bend, stayed just off the inside, was asked entering the stretch and drew away
from the rest the last furlong under steady handling. TENSE bumped from the rear just after the break, disputed the pace from inside, did not stay with MISS
WINDY SLEW on the turn, was no match for that one the final eighth, began to wear down late but lasted for the place. MOON PIES IMAGE in contention
early from inside, advanced on the turn, angled out three wide for a clear path upper stretch, moved clear for third, came up short for the place but proved
easily best of the rest. LORI ATTACK prominent from outside on the backstretch, faded two wide on the bend. SHINE DOWN displayed early speed from
outside but began to yield three wide leaving the turn. SILVER EYES broke a step slow and inward, bumping TENSE, was moved to the outside, angled in
leaving the bend and had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
AUNT STELLA bumped with JOLIE RULER leaving the chute, took a clear lead before finishing the first furlong, showed the way in hand, was put to urging
in the stretch and gradually drew away from the rest. JOLIE RULER bumped with AUNT STELLA leaving the chute, moved outside that one midway on the
backstretch, came into the lane from path three and fought to hold onto the place. PRANCIPANTS raced in contention from outside, closed the gap outside
JOLIE RULER on the turn, battled for second in the stretch, lacked the extra needed late but was easily of the others. QUILTING PARTY flipped behind the
gate before loading, was walked for the veterinarian, inattentive when loaded in the gate, was away slowly and never a factor. ROMANTIC ATTACK was
hustled between horses to be an early contender, gave way from inside on the turn, unresponsive in the stretch and steadily faded.

GO MADI GO was bumped from the rear just after the start, rated two wide between rivals, edged ahead entering the lane, was put to urging, kept to task
until near the wire and proved much the best. RODEO MAN vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up after two furlongs, continued to saved
ground through the turn, was no match for GO MADI GO when set down for the drive but was easily best of the rest. ASTI SKY tried to duck out just after
leaving the gate, bumping GO MADI GO, was steadied, quickly recovered to vie for the lead three wide between horses, moved clear after a quarter mile,
stayed well off the inside on the turn, drifted out badly leaving the bend and lost all chance. FINE GRAYDAR was prominent from outside, three wide taking
the turn then steadily yielded through the stretch.

IT'S BELLAMY TIME rated along or just off the inside, was asked leaving the turn then gradually lengthened command in the stretch while under a drive
until nearing the wire. STOSH progressed from inside on the bend, took over second upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the last
furlong but lasted for the place. BABA LOU in contention early between rivals, made up some ground, though four wide, on the turn and could only hold his
position in the lane. ABSTRACT PAYNTER chased from outside, was widest taking the turn and had no serious stretch bid. RAHFEE TOWN broke outward,
was corrected and hustled up to prompt the pace outside IT'S BELLAMY TIME, began to yield from path three leaving the bend and steadily faded through
the stretch.

RACETOTHEFINISH rated from outside on the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, responded to vigorous hand urging the last furlong
and got up nearing the wire. DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT soon had the advantage, set a pressured pace two wide, was put to a drive upper stretch, fought
gamely in the late going but did not have enough left. I LUV THIS BAR pressed DANCING AT MIDNIGHT while in tight along the rail on the backstretch, did
not keep up on the turn, could only make up minor ground deep stretch but was easily best of the rest. DARING DAMSEL was a step slow at the break,
closed the gap some from just off the inside on the turn then could not sustain her bid in the lane. LAKE BARKLEY void of speed, saved ground taking the
bend, was unresponsive to urging in the stretch and allowed to coast the final furlong.

Footnotes
FOOT RUB LOVE stalked the early speed in hand from outside, made her bid three wide on the turn, angled in after gaining the lead nearing the end of four
furlongs, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, held a straight path the final furlong and lengthened command under steady handling.
GHAALEB'S MAGIC contested the early pace from inside, did not keep up on the bend, was steadied behind BOBBIE TOO TOO nearing the quarter pole,
got through three wide entering the lane and took over second just inside the seventy yard marker. BOBBIE TOO TOO bobbled as she broke on top and
leaned outward, soon recovered to vie for the lead outside GHAALEB'S MAGIC, edged ahead early in the turn, was soon overtaken from outside, angled in
some nearing the end of four furlongs, could not stay with FOOT RUB LOVE in the stretch and gradually wore down the last sixteenth. STORMY EMPIRE
forwardly placed early, came beside GHAALEB'S MAGIC on the bend, was forced out by that one into the stretch and was closing in on the weakening
BOBBIE TOO TOO in the late going. SHE'S A BIG STAR chased from between rivals, angled in some on the turn and showed some late interest. LIL BIT
TIPSEY hesitated at the break, gained a striking position three wide on the bend, lost ground fanning widest for the drive and was closing the gap on the
third flight deep stretch. DUSTY MILLER chased from outside, lost ground four to five wide taking the turn, angled out widest midstretch and also showed a
mild willingness to run in the late going. Due to equipment failure, the beaten lengths were estimated by the chartcaller.
