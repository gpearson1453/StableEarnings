Footnotes
CAMINO DE SANTIAGO stalked the pace in the early going, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
dueled with SCHIFFHAUER STRONG through the lane and edged ahead on that one in the final strides. SCHIFFHAUER STRONG unhurried in the early
going, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly edging ahead, then dueled with CAMINO DE
SANTIAGO and was outfinished by that one. I STRONG well placed and between, angled in and tracked the leader through the turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch, angled out and lacked the needed late kick. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch, then closed willingly and edged up for a share. DAWGMENTALITY sent from the gate, set the pace inside, shook clear into the
turn, then weakened the final furlong. SWELTER well placed, faded three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
DATA PRINCESS set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then held under steady pressure. AMAZON LIZZIE tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. ODD GAL well placed and outside,
moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. LETS RACE LADYS well placed and between, gained a striking
position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. WILD LOOKER moved up into the turn, gained position three and four
wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY unhurried in the early going, looped three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. AT LEAST passed a tiring rival. LITTLE CHRISTY stalked the pace on the outside,
held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
SNOW JOB sprinted away from the field quickly, increased his margin through the turn, then held under mild urging. LEBASI unhurried early, looped to
position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. TITHED well placed, moved up on the two path through
the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then flattened and held the show. SILVER TOKEN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and got up for a share. KICK IT CHARLIE well placed, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals and weakened the final furlong. ZAMAN passed tiring rivals. FIGHTIN PHIL mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. HOUSE LIGHTS was a brief factor.
