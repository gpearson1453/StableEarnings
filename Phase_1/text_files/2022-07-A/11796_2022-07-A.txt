COACH ADAMS stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, led into the stretch, responded when roused, drew clear under some mild urging
and was in hand the final hundred yards. DOUBLE THE HEART set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled
between rivals, dug in gamely and earned the place award. LUXERO raced off the pace inside, tracked on the backside, made a rail bid on the far turn,
dueled into the stretch and weakened. LOOK OUT LAMBO raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, chased and had no rally. GRIT'N'GRIND raced
off the pace between rivals, chased between foes on the far turn and lacked a rally. LONG GRAY LINE trailed the field in the early stages, raced off the rail
on the backside and failed to threaten. NOON TIME GEM had a three wide trip racing off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired.

run and battled to the end. NOBLE PRESENT chased outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled and weakened. DUSTED vied inside for the early lead,
chased midway on the turn and weakened. BRINGTHEWINE chased on the inside and failed to respond. ATLANTIC FRONT trailed the field and did not
factor.
