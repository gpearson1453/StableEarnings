Footnotes
VARTON cleared early while in the two path, continued to slowly widen through the turn and into the lane, was urged right-handed a couple times just inside
the eighth pole then galloped the final sixteenth while well clear. SECOND EXCHANGE was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, angled to the
rail after straightening in the lane and was gaining to the end. FEARLESS ANNA was never a threat while along the inside. LADY ATLANTIC was in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. COULD YOU was close up early while near the inside, came off
the rail and into the three path to chase the winner, swung into the lane from the four path and tired. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY never a factor while saving
ground.

Footnotes
KIDYOUNOT raced to a clear lead before the first turn, continued just clear into and through the turn while in the two path, was shook up entering the lane
then widened through the final eighth. RONITHELIMODRIVER raced in the four to the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path
and finished with energy to be clear for the place spot. BARSTOW stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane under a
drive and lacked a closing kick while losing the place spot late. INHERENT POWERS raced in the three path through the turns and lacked a closing
response. SCHENECTADY STAR raced in the two or three path through the far turn and never was a factor. MR. PETERKIN tracked the pace from the
inside through the far turn then faded after entering the lane. POWERFUL POINT slowly lost ground while along the inside.

Footnotes
JACKS SPRING BREAK stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid near mid-turn, was clear in late turn and into the lane, widened to the
eighth pole then held while being challenged late. ASHWINS ORB was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three to the four path on the far
turn, came into the lane from the four path, straightened with momentum and was gaining to the wire. JIM AND JIM in the two or three path through the far
turn, moved with the runner-up into the lane then could not sustain the effort while best of the rest. ROUNDER unhurried while off the inside, advanced from
the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and flattened out late. SUPER LIAISON never a menace while in the three or
four path through the turns. DANNY'S LIL DANA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn when trying to go with the
winner then was done entering the lane. LILY'S TRUMPET hopped then brushed outside rival, hustled up along the inside into the first turn, set the pace
under pressure down the backstretch and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
AARON'S CONQUEST raced in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane along the inside, gained momentum quickly inside
the eighth pole and was rolling late while near the rail. SIR RONALDO chased the pace from the three path through mid-turn, bid in late turn and into the
lane, dueled through the lane, led late and was caught by the fast closing winner. CONQUERED set the pace from the inside while under pressure through
mid-turn, was shaking off challenger into late turn when joined by another, dueled with that one down the lane and gave ground grudgingly. LITTLE RUSTY
pressed the pace two wide through the turn, came into the lane from the three path then could not keep up with the top ones late. HE GOES FOREVER
stepped into at the start, raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane and never was a serious threat. GENERAL AFFAIR bothered early and floated
out into the six path entering the turn, raced in the four path through the turn and was never a menace. LOGAN ATTACK was attempting to get out through
the turn when firmly handled to stay in the five to six path, continued in the seven path into the lane and never factored.

ZOLO pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the eighth pole and drew off under mild urging. PRINCE SHIM was clear early on an easy lead but
couldn't resist the winner. WHERE'S MOE stalked the early pace inside, gave way but held the show spot. AIR PAYNTER was off awkwardly and then
passed tired rivals. WHISKY RIVERS was off awkwardly, trailed, then passed tired rivals outside. PABLO'S SUN stalked the early pace between rivals but
gave way on the far turn. STUDENT PRINCE was through early inside.

Footnotes
ROOKWOOD settled inside, angled four wide on the far turn, rallied and prevailed under steady urging. HITCHPIN stalked the pace in the three path, bid on
the far turn, then was outfinished. GOT LOST was unrushed while four wide, rallied on the far turn, then couldn't gain late. GOLDEN RAPPER pressed the
pace outside of the leader, then gave way in the stretch. CONSIDER stumbled at the start, trailed, then had a mild late bid outside. MOTION TO ADJOURN
led inside but gave way at the quarter pole. CIRCLE INDY steadied repeatedly around the first turn, then faded. SMOOTH TALKING MAN stalked in the four
path before fading. TAP TAP COMIN THRU veered out at the start, then rushed up between foes, stalked the pace and gave way on the far turn.
