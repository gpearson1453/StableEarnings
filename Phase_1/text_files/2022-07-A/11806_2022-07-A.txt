Footnotes
BLACKTECA broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the rail into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch, then gamely held the
challenge of SUMMER ALL YEAR to the wire under firm handling. The latter broke readily, angled in prompting the pace outside the eventual winner racing
into the turn, lost some ground to the leader in upper stretch, but shifted out producing a solid second effort in the closing stages to dispute the issue to the
wire. FRANZ, off last, was urged to a contending position three deep tracking just off the leaders racing into the bend, couldn't match those foes on the bend
and faded into the lane. ROLLERCOASTER MAN, caught in close quarters between rivals in the opening furlong, switched outside foes to race four wide on
the turn but offered no rally. BIG TIME ROB gave way early.

Footnotes
MILLIGANMIKEANDME broke readily, attended a rival's pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn, took over racing past midstretch and
went clear under firm handling. NORA'S LEGACY, pulling between foes tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes
racing into the far turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. FULL SPEED ASTERN pulled
her way to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, but proved no match when headed by the
winner, then drifted out while giving way. MOM'S PASS was rated off the first flight inside rivals in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn.
PINK CHANNEL settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch and passed a tiring rival. SWEETNESS TO,
urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, gave way early.

IN THE RED exchanged bumps at the start with CURIOUS INJI, was righted while shifting inwards being rated off the second flight, steadily gained position
between foes after a half, split foes racing into the far turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch steadily gaining position, tipped out three wide racing
through the lane and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. PLUMA sped to the lead
while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but was collared late. STYLIN N PROFILIN tracked off
the first flight inside rivals under light rating to the far turn, advanced on the leader along the inside on the far turn, tipped outside that foe racing into upper
stretch while being urged to advance but finished evenly between foes late. IMMINENT THREAT, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. SARJENALLI tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three
wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late response. SHE'S WANDAFUL tracked
the leaders three wide between foes in second flight to the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders after a half, was urged to advance while being fanned five
wide nearing the lane and had no rally. BRAHMS IS WHO settled last to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but never proved a serious threat.
CURIOUS INJI exchanged bumps with IN THE RED at the start, was caught wide racing into the first turn and soon retreated. PHILLY WINS, caught four
wide between foes racing into the first turn, retreated early. DAIGLE was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
emptied out between foes racing into the far turn, was outdistanced leaving midstretch while being gathered up by her rider, then was subsequently vanned
off the course.

MARK OF VALOR, pulling hard against a rating hold between foes tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch
and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. SING N SPURS, in touch prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch, dueled for command between through the turn into upper stretch while gaining a narrow advantage but couldn't contain the winner. RUBY'S
RED DEVIL, off slowly, was settled last to the turn, then split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. GONE A LIL LU HU
tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing through the backstretch, continued in that path into the turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch while
continuing willingly and was just outkicked for a share. HOLDENTIGHT tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight on the backstretch, was
prompted to bid in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. HEAVENLY GAZEBO tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening
stages but faded early. HOT HABANERO, urged dictating the pace on a narrow advantage near the inside racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

THIRSTY KISS, reserved off the second flight three deep racing to the first turn, shifted inwards on the backstretch continuing under rating, switched outside
foes on the far turn , advanced four wide into upper stretch, then rallied to the front in time under firm encouragement. UNTOLD STORY, urged to the lead
along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, resisted several challenges racing past midstretch but was collared by the winner nearing the wire.
CYBER MONDAY, off slowly, settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and continued willingly. ARIES
REIGNS was rated between foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the far turn, steadily gained position along the rail to late
stages but was outkicked for a share. GRUNDER, pulling against restraint while shifting well off the inside racing to the backstretch racing as part of the
second flight, made some brief progress three wide between foes into the stretch, steadied out of tight quarters leaving midstretch and had no further
response. FLY WITH CLASS, reserved near the back of the field in the opening quarter, switched outside foes to make a sharp advance to contention three
deep after a half, pressed the pacesetter on the far turn, then drifted out nearing midstretch while abruptly giving way. BIG PETE was rated off the second
flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. BOSTON WALLY, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, tracked the leaders between foes into the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane. LANAKILA, forwardly placed along the rail in early stages,
tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. SHUWA FUNGA P proved no factor.

CIRCULODEGANADORAS was prompted to a position tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend, tipped out entering upper stretch
and continued with a steady late bid to narrowly prevail between foes under firm handling. SWEET HONOR broke readily, was eased off the pace dropping
off the second flight racing to the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch, continued with a steady rally while shifting inwards late but was just
outkicked. SAILSINTHESUNSET, urged three wide between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch
while gaining a clear advantage but was collared by the top pair late. CHA, bumped at the start, settled between foes in the last flight racing into the bend,
then split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to gain some position late. WILDLY DRAMATIC was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn
and gave way into upper stretch. AUTISM PRISM broke out bumping CHA, was righted to join the pace five wide in early stages, pressed the pace four wide
into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. JAGGED ARROW vied for command four wide between rivals, then three deep between foes into the lane
and gave way. PEARLE DE VEENE settled outside foes in early stages, raced wide throughout and proved no threat. JUST SPLENDID flashed brief pace
between foes and gave way early. PER STEWARDS RULING CIRCULODEGANDORAS HAS BEEN DISQUILIFIED FROM FIRST AND DEEMED
UNPLACED FOLLOWING A POSITIVE TEST.

I AM THE BOSS broke sharply, was urged to a clear advantage along the inside racing into the bend, continued with a steady effort to stave off challenges
from several rivals to late stages and prevailed under strong handling. A ROZE AND WINE angled in sharply to prompt the pacesetter into the turn, then
continued in steady pursuit to late stages while moving to close the gap. OFF RAMP angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing into
the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly inside the top pair. COST A FORTUNE was rated off the second flight along the inside into
the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position between foes. BEYOND PROPER, shuffled a bit at the start
avoiding close quarters, was prompted to gain some position along the rail racing into the bend, split foes in upper stretch and continued with a belated
effort to gain some position. HAMAZING LACE, off slowly, never gained contention. HEY HEY, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight outside a
rival racing to the turn and faded early. BETTY'S BAR was urged to a forward position racing three deep in second flight to the turn and emptied out into
upper stretch. TIGER BAIT broke inwards bumping HEY HEY, was collected off that rival, was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under her own
power.

Footnotes
REPASADO was urged clear soon after the break while angling inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch, then steadily
widened the margin through the last furlong while being kept to firm encouragement. MIA BABY was urged three deep between foes pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, continued in that path to late stages, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. CHAOS MAGIC tracked the
leader between foes in second flight in the opening furlong, angled to the rail entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid
while lasting for a share. RATTLEME ducked out at the start, tracked the leader four deep in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch.
WREXHAM tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, dropped back from that position nearing the bend, shifted off the rail racing through the turn
but had no closing bid. LUNA S, held up between foes in early stages, proved no threat. LAKE LADY broke slowly and never gained contention.
GRANDIOSE SUMMER ducked in at the start and dropped out early.

KOVACS, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, tipped out three wide entering upper stretch and continued with
a steady late response to wear down EYES FLYING BYE on the wire in an all out drive. The latter broke sharply, sped to the lead between foes, dictated the
pace a bit off the rail to the turn, angled to the inside entering the stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. TAHKODHA KNIGHT
settled last racing to the turn, angled outside a tiring foe entering the stretch, then continued to improve his position along the inside in late stages. R VOO'S
TABOO, in touch with the pacesetter three wide prompting the issue into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SOTA KING, caught in close quarters
between foes in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight near the inside and steadily faded into upper stretch. MIDNIGHT ROYAL AND SWEET
ANALYZER WERE FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE AND SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN.
