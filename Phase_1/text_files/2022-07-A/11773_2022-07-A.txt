Footnotes
H C HOLIDAY circled five wide on the turn with a rival on his outside, battled throughout the stretch with that same rival and was inching away in the late
stages. ENCHANT ME circled horses six wide on the turn and into the stretch, battled the winner through the lane on the outside just giving away late.
BLAST IN THE SNOW stalked mid pack in the beginning, angled out between horses to the three path in early stretch for a run, lost his path at the three
sixteenth pole and angled out further at the eighth pole running on end late to capture third. OCTOBER FROST settled at the back, was behind horses at
the quarter pole looking for a path, found room outside at the eighth pole and finished with some interest late. FULL SCREEN took command through the
backstretch, was engaged by an inside rival through the turn, headed at the quarter pole and finished evenly. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY was between horses
contending in the four path turning for home, lost his lane at the three sixteenth pole and levelled out the final eighth. UNCLE SPIDER engaged the leader
on the rail entering the turn and steadily retreated through the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY THROUGH THE LANE RESULTING

Footnotes
INGORDWETRUST took the lead into the first turn, was headed by multiple challengers on his outside at the three eighths pole, quickly repelled them to
open up entering the stretch and held on well for the win. PERLARANA stalked inside while saving all the ground, waited on the final turn for room, charged
up the fence in the stretch to run well but could not catch the winner. DOCTOR UPTOWN trailed in the early stages, closed widest in the stretch and was
running on end to get up for the show. MESA SKYLINE waited behind horses down the backstretch, angled out through the turn for the stretch drive,
loomed up but levelled out in the final stages. BOLD ANIMAUX made a middle move to contend for the lead while four wide down the backstretch and
stalled through the lane in the final eighth. CERRADO was hustled to vie for the lead entering the first turn, chased the leader down the backstretch and
offered little the final quarter. WHISKEY VICTOR chased the winner while three wide on both turns, vied for the lead between horses at the three eighths
pole and stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
KEEP GRINDING stalked the pace just outside through the turn, took command between horses at the quarter pole and had enough late to hold off an
outside challenge throughout the stretch. SHAMATEUR was brushed at the start, circled three wide on the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole and
was outkicked by the winner in the final eighth. BASKETBALL JONES set the early fractions, was headed on the outside at the quarter pole, gave way the
final eighth but held on for third. LA BELLEZA NEGRA chased the pace inside throughout and stalled down the lane while behind horses. DANFUSI was
between horses early near the back and never reached contention. FAST FEET broke out at the start, saved ground through the turn, angled outside for the
drive but offered little down the stretch.

Footnotes
FAY DAN set the pace racing off the rail, faced inside pressure up the backstretch, kicked clear coming past the five-sixteenths, extended the margin into
upper stretch then held off a late challenge while being kept to the task. COPINSAY bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward tracking in behind the
leaders three wide, raced between foes up the backstretch, went three to four deep on the far turn, gained steadily and slowly but was too late.
KOSMONAVT bumped with a foe at the start, stalked the pace from outside mostly three wide, was asked for more a quarter from home but had no extra,
kept on well enough to hold show honors. SUMMER SHANDEE was caught outside four to five wide on both turns, gained steadily in the stretch but was too
late to get third. THELONIOUS was forwardly-placed stalking three to four wide, ran evenly and lacked the needed late kick. J M R BEST OF TURF lunged
at the break but recovered to track the leader saving ground, moved up inside past the five-eighths to force the issue drawing on nearly even terms soon
after, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. CAM WOOLLEY tucked in settling well back racing two wide, passed rivals turning for home inside but
still just off the rail and went evenly. MORE HARDER settled early racing near the inside, moved out to pass rivals three to four wide leaving the far turn and
ran on. CONQUER HIM raced off the leaders three wide early, swung six wide turning for home, failed to menace. QUANTUM VELOCITY tracked close up
off the leaders, weakened in the stretch. INCENDIO broke a bit awkwardly and was squeezed back, shifted in and saved ground till late on the far turn
coming out past the quarter but was unable to threaten. RIGHT TO STRIKE switched out three wide into the first turn, raced mid-pack, dropped back and
tired.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was forced out at the break and bumped a rival but recovered to stalk the leaders racing off the inside, moved out four wide by the
end of the turn, took aim on the leader and ground that one down in late stretch to inch past under stout urging. CAUSES TROUBLE came out at the break
and moved forward to contest the pace, dueled outside two to three wide, was leading into late stretch then worn down late. MR. AGRO dueled inside on or
just off the rail, yielded late but saved show honors. COUSIN ROB was bumped after the break, angled in after clearing the gap, advanced inside foes into
and on the turn, came out in mid-stretch for room, ran on well but missed third. PAINTING THE MOON was well-positioned early, raced mid-pack four then
five wide on the turn and needed more. NGABE raced just off the inside mid-pack into the turn, moved to the rail about the quarter pole and kept on evenly.
SILVER SIGNATURE raced between rivals off the pace early going three to four wide into the turn, tucked in to the rail past the three-eighths and passed
some rivals. TWO YEAR CONTRACT went three to five wide on the turn, was brushed at the top of the stretch and never near enough to threaten. CHOICE
PLAYER raced outside four to six wide on the turn and failed to menace. WHERE'S NED bumped a rival just after the start, angled in and followed that rival
advance inside, came two wide past the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. WILKABEE RUSH broke in the air and a couple lengths back of the field
then was encouraged forward inside, was just off the fence through most of the turn angling four wide coming out of that bend and bumping a rival in the
process, did not threaten. OMEGNA was bumped after the break, chased briefly three wide then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
FROSTED OVER was urged just at the break to gain forward position, stalked the leader two wide into the first turn, took closer order heading to the far
turn, took a narrow lead past the five-sixteenths and was clear while drifting to the three path coming out of that bend, put to urging in upper stretch and
extended the margin then was taken in hand late once safely clear. ARTIE'S STORM exchanged a light brush at the start, tucked in heading to the first turn
settling off the leaders racing just off the fence, went three wide into the far turn then angled to the rail past the quarter pole, got up inside a foe to gain
second late under steady urging. MIGHTY HEART exchanged a light brush at the start, moved forward to set the pace inside, was overtaken late on the far
turn, came out a path in mid-stretch, lost the place late. SPECIAL FORCES exchanged a light brush at the start, raced outside three to four wide, evened
out in the lane. WAR BOMBER (IRE) exchanged a light brush at the start, stalked from outside three wide, flattened out in the drive. SKYWIRE tracked from
inside a rival on or just off the rail, was asked to keep up three furlongs out but offered no late response. TALBEYAH (IRE) broke a bit awkwardly and
slowly, raced off the rail and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MY GIRL SKY loomed outside while four wide on the turn and entering the stretch, took command at the quarter pole and was drawing away at the end.
KEEP IT NEAT was behind horses mid pack three wide on the turn, angled out for room entering the stretch and finished well on the outside out of trouble
to be second. LUZ DE LA LUNA hesitated at the start a bit, was behind horses into the stretch at the three sixteenth pole looking for a path, found a seam at
the eighth pole and split rivals late just missing the second money. VENENOSA was four wide around the turn, angled out widest to the eight path down the
lane for clear running and finished with interest to get a minor share. TEMPEREYA was tracking on the rail through the turn, waited inside at the quarter
pole for a path to open up, steadied at the eighth pole while in tight behind a fading runner and had no room late. HENRY'S GAMBLE chased the pace early
just outside, made a bid between horses at the top of the stretch only to fade in the final eighth of a mile. SWINGING MANDY set the early pace while on
the rail, was headed at the quarter pole, bumped while in tight quarters at the eighth pole and faded in the final stages. HALLANVAARA near the rear
throughout and never contended.

BET N WIN settled toward the rear two to three wide, moved out and advanced up the backstretch and far turn four wide, engaged the leaders in upper- to
mid-stretch, dueled late and prevailed. SPRING MOUNTAIN bumped with a rival at the start, tracked inside, came out in upper stretch, bid between rivals in
mid-stretch but was outfinished. WAR COURT bobbled ever so slightly at the start but quickly recovered, stalked three wide, dropped back on the far turn,
re-rallied in the drive to finish strongly but was too little too late. MORNING THOUGHTS broke inwardly then was urged forward to dictate terms inside on
the front-end, was challenged in upper stretch, yielded late. FIFTY THREE was bumped and in tight at the break then settled at the rear in the two to three
path, advanced four wide on the far turn coming five wide into upper stretch and in range but could not sustain the effort and evened out. GIANT ONE
settled in just off the leaders stalking two to three wide outside early, went three to four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. MILWAUKEE BAY failed to
threaten racing near the inside. CONDITIONAL stalked two wide and came up empty.

OHEAVENS set the pace till the quarter pole where she briefly surrendered the lead to a stubborn outside rival, battled gamely through the stretch and was
inching away late. GREEN GABLES chased the leader on the turn, challenged that foe at the quarter pole to lead briefly and battled to the wire giving away
grudgingly late. SHEZ A SEALY was mid pack through the turn, angled out widest through the stretch and offered a belated rally getting up for third.
MUSKOKA SUMMER stalked on the rail behind the pacesetters and ran even through the stretch to garner a minor placing. CEDAR VALLEY was in range
of the leaders turning for home but could not sustain her position late fading the final eighth. FLASHY GET EVEN rated mid pack throughout, angled out in
the stretch to the five path and passed tired horses. MOON POOL saved ground throughout and was picking up horses late on the rail.
THEODOROPOULOS broke out and bumped her outside rival at the start, was in range behind horses turning for home and had no response. RUM RAISIN
broke inwards bumping her inside foe at the break, loomed outside at the three sixteenth pole in the five path to contend and retreated the final eighth.
COURTINGCOURTNEY was sluggish at the start, quite wide on the turn and never factored. REINS OF PURPLE hopped at the break and never reached
contention. SKIPOVER was away slowly and never got involved. AT THE LYRIC near the back early on, made a brief run mid turn and flattened out down
the lane.
