Footnotes
ARIKARA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn,
took control entering the turn, held a clear lead into the stretch and was never seriously threatened late. BELLAROO saved ground through the first turn to
race into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive
to prove clearly second best. SKY FACTOR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside
of ARIKARA in the run down the backside, was unable to match stride with her pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong
while managing to hold on for a share. LIVING SKY dropped back to trail entering he backstretch while racing two out from the rail, angled in to save ground
approaching the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. DEVINE DANCING settled off the early
pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to drop back in the run down the backside while racing five wide, and had nothing to
offer over the final furlong in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CALAMAZEUS broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled through the final turn from the outside of
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR, got the better of that rival in mid stretch and held off a late bid by AIRAFFAIR to prevail. AIRAFFAIR away well and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied gamely three wide through the final turn, and battled determinedly two out from the
rail in the drive to get up for the place while gaining ground late. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering he
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly while shifting three wide in deep stretch to get up for a share.
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch,
battled through the final turn and into the stretch from the inside of CALAMAZEUS, was unable to match strides with that rival in deep stretch and was
outfinished late. DEBATABLE unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, raced four wide into the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late
bid when called upon. BETTIN' MAN stumbled badly in the opening strides and settled well off the pacesetters while racing three wide into the backstretch,
was always well back and failed to respond when called upon.

LEGACY SQUARE settled well off the dueling leaders while racing two wide into the backstretch, began to advance one out from the rail midway down the
backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to run down her stablemate late to prove best.
BAK TO LIBERTY broke sharply and stalked the contested early pacesetters while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied smartly three
wide entering he final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, was no match late when collared by LEGACY SQUARE, but battled gamely late to prove
clearly second best. MS. STANFORD away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering he backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run to the
final turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was no match for the top pair leaving the turn, but finished with late interest while shifting four wide
late to prove best of the rest. READYTOTAPNSING raced a bit erratic while being taken back off the leaders at the rail entering the first turn, settled well off
the pacesetters in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering he final turn, tipped four wide leaving the turn, and finished with late interest
while closing four wide in the drive. ASKMENOQUESTIONS stalked the pacesetters into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, commenced his
bid three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. LILSISTERLEE dueled for the lead from the outside of MS.
STANFORD entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. HONOR
THE QUEEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, was always well back and failed to make her presence felt.

INFINITE PATIENCE away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while racing out from the rail in the
run down the backside, maintained her advantage into the final turn, and held her rivals safely at bay late under confident handling. SOLARITY broke
sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to outfinish WE B THREE late for the place. WE B THREE away well and saved ground through the first turn
to gain a tracking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, attempted to slip through along the rail entering the final turn and appeared to clip heels
and stumble, continued from along the rail through the turn, and battled gamely through the lane from along the inside to just miss the place. QUEEN OF
ATTITUDE settled off the pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly
while finishing three wide in the stretch drive. HEIDI settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering he backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CHA CHING unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the
first turn, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, but failed to make a serious late
impact. BAYAKOAS IMAGE tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing three wide, continued with a wide trip in the run to the final turn, struggled to
maintain her position approaching the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong.

BE QUICK rushed up to duel for the lead two wide entering he first turn, forced the issue rom the outside of SIR BREGOVIC in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, held the narrowest of advantages into the stretch, and was all out to fend off a late surge by PORTER GENT to prevail. PORTER
GENT broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backside while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn,
shifted four wide for the drive and finished with a late surge to just miss. CASCADE BILLY tracked the battling leaders into the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, continued three wide while launching his bid into the final turn, and battled determinedly two wide from between rivals late to just miss. SIR
BREGOVIC away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rival entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. FORT LANGLEY settled off
the early pace while saving ground at the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four out from the rail in
the drive. EXPLODE away well and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final
turn, but was outfinshed over the final furlong. SET TO SHINE settled off the contested early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two
out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.

FLORIDA GATOR away well and rushed up to duel for the lead while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the
issue from the outside of MAKEITORBREAKIT in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, took a narrow lead into the lane, and held the closers
safely at bay late. VISENYA unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided her time at the back of the field in the run
down the backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing seven wide in the drive to get up for the
place in the final strides. HANKY PRANKY tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while under snug restraint at the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide into the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to just miss the place. MAKEITORBREAKIT
away alertly and vied for the lead entering the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of
FLORIDA GATOR in the run down the backside, rallied from along the rail while continuing to battle with that rival through the final turn, but was outfinished
in the stretch drive. TEXAS HUMOR was away awkwardly, but worked her way into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from
along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. BARNEY GOOGLE broke sharply, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail through the first turn, remained well back in the run down the backstretch and failed to respond over the final
furlong when called upon.
