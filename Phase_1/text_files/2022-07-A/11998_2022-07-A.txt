between on the line. CANDYROCK In hand close up along the rail, angled out into the lane, continued outside and finished with interest. ROYAL SUSPECT

responded when clear, rallied to take the lead and was under wraps through the final fifty yards. FLOWER MOON Away best, vied for the lead along the two
path, took the rail on the turn, kicked clear some, was soon collared and then was clearly no match. FROSTED BOURBON Broke slow, saved ground on
the turn trailing and then finished well inside. MRS. BANKS Forced the issue along the three path, two path around the turn and weakened. QUEENTIGUA
Close up along the three path to the turn, stayed on that path to the top of the lane and weakened. HEY MAMA Broke slow, close up along the rail,
appeared in tight at the nine-sixteenth pole, checked, three path midway on the turn and weakened. INOUAINTALKINTOME Four wide early, three path on
