was headed after a half fought gamely to upper stretch and drifted out but held the show. NINEJUANJUAN CALL bumped at the start, vied for the lead from
the three path to the final turn and weakened. GOOD OLD CHARLIE was positioned just off the pace in the three path to the final turn and lacked a late
response. FORTY THREE broke outward, was in the four path around the first turn, was not far back down the backstretch but was never a threat.

Footnotes
OKUDAH led from the inside to set all the pace just lasted. OREGON COUNTY vied for the lead from the two path throughout, held off the late closing rival
to hold the place. DUDE DROP KID raced in the middle of the pace from the two path, made a rail bid in upper stretch and missed the place. ACTIFDASH
tracked the leaders from the two path through the final turn and was pushed out slightly in upper stretch made a rebid to improve position in deep stretch.
PLENTY OF CENTS raced in the middle of the pack from the two to three path made a middle move on the backstretch, drifted out in upper stretch and
faded. CHOPPA STYLE was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch made a bid on the final turn then angled out in upper stretch but was
not a factor. DEALMEINBUD was allowed to settle in the three path around the first turn and down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the turn but failed to
menace. LUCKY CRUSADER was in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a three wide bid but faltered. DOUBLE PRIORITY was unhurried
from the two path but was never a threat. SPIRIT SOUL was positioned just off the pace while saving ground to no avail. SEVEN EIGHTHS FRACTIONAL
TIME WAS 128.30.
