Footnotes
REBA dueled inside of LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS heading into the turn, battled on holding a slight edge a furlong out, stayed on gamely under pressure and
held on. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS broke on top and dueled outside of REBA into the turn, continued to battle into the lane, dug in determinedly in final stages
and just missed. SLOOPY HANG ON tracked the embattled pair into the turn, chased three wide into the lane and dug in late to hold a share. REDNECKER
was off a step slow at the start, was ridden along in the back, chased two wide into the lane and just missed show. QUEEN OF THE SHIP raced off the
early pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
ROWDY RAY tipped out and moved up closer entering the turn, roused forward to challenge WE'RE ALL NUTS for the lead near the quarter pole, vied at
the head of the lane then kicked clear and finished going away. FREDDY J raced near midpack in early stages and chased four wide around the turn,
sustained an outside bid into the lane and finished second best. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced in contention along the inside, came four wide into the lane,
stayed on with response and finished on equal terms with LUCKYAPRIL. LUCKYAPRIL chased the leader two wide around the turn, sustained bid upper
stretch then flattened and finished on equal terms for show. RULING THE ROOST lacked speed, raced wide into the lane and never threatened. CHEETS
raced off the early pace, came five wide into the lane and failed to rally. WE'RE ALL NUTS sped to the early lead and showed the way into the turn, vied at
the quarter pole then came up empty a furlong out.
