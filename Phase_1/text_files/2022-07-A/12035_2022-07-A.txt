Footnotes
LUNA ANTONIA was well placed on the inside, made a strong two wide bid on the far turn, took charge, drew off in upper stretch and was ridden out.
OFFICE ETIQUETTE raced two wide off the pace, three wide on the backside, came in at the three eighths marker bothering CAPTURE MY DREAMS, then
moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied outside for second. SONOMA COUNTY raced off the pace inside, pulled entering the
backside, then advanced inside, came three wide into the lane and closed mildly. JUDGEMENT TIME set the pace on the inside, was no match when
challenged by the winner on the far turn, then dug in through the lane and stayed on for a share. CAPTURE MY DREAMS stalked two wide, then between
rivals, steadied in tight entering the far turn, then closed mildly on the rail in the stretch. SEA BREW raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, then
lacked a rally. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT trailed the field, raced off the rail and did not factor. SCHNUER WILL pressed the pace racing close up two wide,
then gave way on the far turn. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of CAPTURE MY DREAMS against the second place finisher,
OFFICE ETIQUETTE was disqualified and placed fifth for coming over at the three furlong marker.
