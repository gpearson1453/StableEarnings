Footnotes
CANDY TYCOON vied for the lead two wide, sparred in the three path entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drew off at the furlong
grounds. DOUBLE CROWN saved ground off of the pace, sustained a rail grind through the lane to bid for place inside of SANTOS DUMONT entering the
final sixteenth, and prevailed late. SANTOS DUMONT set the pace inside of a vying CANDY TYCOON, battled with that foe while tipping to the two path
entering the lane, but gave way at the furlong grounds, met DOUBLE CROWN's rail place bid shortly after, and lost that position nearing the wire.
INJUNCTION was taken in hand between horses after breaking half a beat slowly, tracked in the four path around the far turn, ranged up outside of the
leading trio to be within striking range at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with them into the far turn, chased them from the three path around that
bend, then sustained stride in the five path in the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reach show. CIVIL WAR trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path
entering the lane and failed to menace outside of foes. KEYSTONE FIELD stalked in the three path, inched closer to striking range approaching the half
mile pole, pressed the top pair around the far turn, then chased from the four path through upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
JUST LIKE MAGIC vied for the lead two wide, led at the three furlong pole, showed the way as an outer MOON MAGIC CHRISSY pressed entering the
lane, drew clear of that foe approaching the final furlong, and lasted late. MAGICAL LUTE was bumped and bothered by an outer foe at the start, saved
ground off of the pace, improved entering the lane before tipping to the four path in upper stretch, and offered a good late kick in the closing stages, but ran
out of ground. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY bobbled inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide, pressed the eventual winner entering the lane,
but failed to keep pace in midstretch, and chased. SHEZA SHINING STAR tracked in the three path, tipped to the six path entering the lane, and finished up
evenly. FRIENDLYPERSUASION stalked from the two path while behind the leaders, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a kick. FUN AND
FEISTY was bumped and forced inwardly by an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the two to three path, but failed to threaten through the lane.
HIGH FASHION LADY trailed along the inside into the turn, and passed tired. B G WARRIOR rushed after flat-footed beginning to set the pace inside of a
vying JUST LIKE MAGIC, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home. BOLTORO broke a step slowly, but avoided trouble by
doing so, and made little impact. BEST SELLER veered inwardly at the start took the turn in the four path while off of the pace before swinging to the seven
path entering the lane, but tired. BEA FLATTERED never got involved. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF was outrun.

Footnotes
MR SIPPI tracked four wide, bid in hand at the three furlong pole as an outer MOUNT ATHOS forced his hand, vied around the bend, gained an advantage
approaching the quarter pole, kicked away when set down in upper stretch, and held sway. MOUNT ATHOS broke a step slowly while last away, tracked
five wide, inched closer to striking range at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with inner foes before chasing in the four path turning for home,
floated back to the six path entering the lane, sustained stride before changing to his right lead leaving the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on well.
NEPOTISM stalked three wide, bid between horses at the three furlong pole, vied around the bend, but was outkicked by an outer foe nearing the quarter
pole, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, vied for place between horses through midstretch, but was bested for that position by an outer rival entering the
final sixteenth. PERFECT CUT settled off of the pace along the inside, chased from the two to three path around the turn, shifted to the five path entering
the lane but lacked a kick between horses. COLD AS HELL vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses at the three furlong pole, sustained vying
position inside of a pair of foes turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and faded through the final furlong. SPEND BENJAMINS trailed in
the four path around the turn, shifted to the six path at the quarter pole, but failed to factor. MUMAYAZ set a pressured pace along the inside, but headed at
the three furlong pole as a pair of outer foes joined the fray, but faded at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY GAL broke a bit inwardly at the start, dueled for the lead outside of STUNNINGLY while a path away from that foe around the turn, inched clear
turning for home, and drew off under hand urging. CHIQUITA MOSCA laid off of the pace in the three path around the turn, tipped five wide entering the
lane, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach place late. AUDACIOUSNESS bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the
inside around the turn, failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, tipped off of the fence while vying for show inside of a pair of foes, sustained his
chase to attempt a bid for place between horses in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked. STUNNINGLY bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for
the lead inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but failed to keep pace turning for home, gave way in upper stretch, and faltered inside of
place-bidding foes in the closing stages. FOREVER DIXIE broke a step slowly, shied from an outer rival, and bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked two
wide, chased under urging turning for home, vied for show through midstretch, but was outfinished by an outer rival for minor rewards late. EMPRESS
ISABEL saved ground far back, shifted two to three wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. AUNT MISCHIEF tracked in midpack three wide, came into
the lane four wide, but lacked a rally. RUN AND GUN settled far back two wide, floated four wide entering the lane and made little impact. CATHERINE
BLAZE tracked along the inside, but tired at the three furlong pole. BRISBANE ROAD stumbled severely when the gates opened before taking a bump from
an outer foe at the start, rushed between horses through the opening furlong, surged between foes at the half mile pole to achieve a midpack two wide
tracking position, but weakened turning for home. REDHAIREDCOLLEEN broke a step slowly before steadying once pinched between horses soon after the
start, and showed little.

SKYRO pressed three wide, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch before kicking clear at the furlong grounds, and inched further away
late. DOUBLY BLESSED tracked four wide, took aim outside of a leading SKYRO in upper stretch, and stayed on to prove second best. SHORTLIST
trailed, took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, came into the lane in the three path, chased through midstretch, but produced a late kick to reach
show at the wire. RODERICK set the pace inside of a pair of prompting foes around the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, tired through the final
furlong, and got nailed at the wire for show. GAGETOWN prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but faded in upper stretch. ERON DO
JAGUARETE (BRZ) lied off of the pace in the four to five paths, and made little impact. ENID stalked behind the leaders from the two path, but failed to
progress in upper stretch, then sustained an injury at the furlong grounds, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GULFPORT set the pace in the two path while feeling outer pressure from SIMPLY SUPER, showed the way in hand from that foe around the turn, glided
away from him entering the lane before being roused for run passing the quarter pole, and widened his advantage under steady hand urging to prove much
the best. OWEN'S LEAP settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on in pursuit of ANTHEWINNERIS for
place in the final furlong, and reeled that foe in at the wire. ANDTHEWINNERIS tracked in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, gained place at
the furlong grounds while nowhere near the leader, but flattened out in the late stages, and got nailed at the wire. SIMPLY SUPER pressed the eventual
winner from the outside, but swiftly proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and faded along the rail thereafter. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE stalked the
top pair from the three path while many lengths off around the turn, but was outmoved for show entering the lane, and tired. MR. GORDY was done early.

Footnotes
WONDER WHEEL set the pace inside of a moderately pressing EMPIRE OF MY OWN, easily shook away from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, built a
clear margin entering the lane, changed to her right lead via light rider encouragement at the three sixteenths pole, and widened her advantage under mild
urging through midstretch. SABRA TUFF trailed the field in the two path, surpassed an inner tiring foe in upper stretch before shifting to the rail, then
sustained a rail grind through the final furlong to reach place at the sixteenth pole. LES BON TEMPS stalked the top pair three wide, failed to keep pace with
the leader while bidding for place in upper stretch, sparred with an inner EMPIRE OF MY OWN for that position through midstretch, but was outkicked by an
inner bidding foe for show at the sixteenths pole, and prevailed for show. EMPIRE OF MY OWN bobbled slightly while leaning outwardly at the start,
prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, battled inside of LES BON TEMPS for place
through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe leaving the sixteenths pole, and was outfinished for show. EYES OF GOLD broke inwardly, settled off
of the pace in the two path, shifted out entering the lane before altering course to the six path and outside of foes at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a
rally, and made little impact. FRANGO ELECTRICO laid off of pace in the four path, inched closer to minor placings four wide turning for home, came into
the lane in the five path, but hung on her left lead, and flattened out without menacing. CRACKALACKING broke a step slowly while being last away,
avoided trouble from an outer rival by doing so, slipped inside of EYES OF GOLD through a tight rail seem leaving the eleven sixteenths pole to achieve an
inside stalking position, but chased under urging around the turn, and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CODY'S WISH pressed the pace three wide and from the four path around the turn, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an outer
THREE TECHNIQUE loomed a danger, dug in to resist that foe's bid approaching the final furlong, battled gamely while clinging to an advantage through
the late stages, and held tenaciously. THREE TECHNIQUE trailed comfortably into the turn, picked up stride with a swift four wide blitz turning for home,
took aim on a leading CODY'S WISH from the five path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel, battled stoutly while neck-n-neck through the
final furlong, but was denied. AWESOME GERRY tracked two wide down the backstretch, chased from the three path while a bit further off of the pace
around the turn, tipped to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on while shifting in, and reached show in the closing stages. WEYBURN tugged behind
the first flight while stalking along the inside leaving the chute, saved ground, but lacked a rail kick through a wide opening due to hanging on his left lead
through the lane, and lost show late. PLAINSMAN prompted the pace two wide and between horses while in the three path around the turn, but yielded to
those rivals leaving the five sixteenths pole, and tired. MISH set the pace in the two path while inside of a pair of pressing foes into the turn, but weakened
between horses passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GILDED AGE settled far back two wide, picked up stride in the six path around the far turn, came into the lane with many lengths to find, produced a strong
kick outside of foes in the final furlong to bear down on the leader late, and reeled in that foe on the wire. BRIGADIER GENERAL stalked the run-off leader
as that foe's closest pursuer, bid for the lead entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but worn down and caught at the wire. WAR CAMPAIGN
bobbled and bumped an inner foe at the start before nudged into an outer foe soon after, settled far back two to three wide, and rallied between horses
through the final furlong to reach show late. JUST CALL RAY broke a bit outwardly, settled off of the pace along the inside, rallied to split foes two wide at
the furlong grounds to claim place in pursuit of the clear leader, but faltered inside of foes late. WE ALL SEE IT tracked two wide and between horses,
shifted four wide entering the lane, and chased mildly. WARRIOR JOHNY tracked three wide, chased through upper stretch, but was outkicked for place by
an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and faltered between rivals late. BRITAIN'S KITTEN saved ground in midpack, grinded away two wide through the lane,
but encountered a wall of traffic nearing the wire. KEEPCALMCARRYON broke a step slowly before being squeezed back between horses after the start,
trailed early on, and never got involved. GLACIAL ran off entering the first turn, built a large margin entering the backstretch, but came back to the field
around the far turn, got headed entering the lane, and caved. EMIRATES ROAD laid off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the five path, and failed
to factor. SKATE TO HEAVEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly placed along the inside around the first turn, but weakened into the far
turn, and was done early.
