Footnotes
A CASE OF YOU was allowed to settle early in hand, moved up nicely while two to three wide, then made a four wide move on the far turn, was given one
pop left handed with the riding crop nearing the furlong marker, and took over leaving there and then was ridden out to prove much the best. NATURE
TRAIL was away alertly to set the early pace, got out a few lanes into the first turn, was corrected and moved to the inside, then was headed on the turn,
dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to come again for the place award. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT was well rated early and made a three wide bid on the turn
to go on even terms for command but flattened out in the final furlong, lost place award late. OUR JESSICA JOAN tracked the early pace on the inside, then
eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide into the drive and had no rally. AUTOMATED TELLER was reserved early and made a mild run on the
inside on the far turn but had no late rally. ECLIPTICALS SHORTY prompted the pace three to two wide and tired. SAW was rank early and failed to
menace. IVY chased the pace in between rivals and stopped.

Footnotes
BELLA PRIMA set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and edged clear to prove best under a drive. LIME
SQUASH prompted the pace and made a two wide bid to go on even terms with the winner but hung. MELODIA was settled back early, advanced on the
inside on the turn, angled out in the drive and closed. LA LIMONADA was reserved early, was advancing five wide leaving the three eighths marker and had
to check hard, then got back into stride, came widest into the lane and rallied on the outside. OH SO JAZZY chased the pace on the inside, swung out four
wide for the drive and had no kick. LOOP THE LOOP stalked the pace three wide and steadied by the three eighths marker and weakened. SKY OF
DREAMS was settled early and three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. NORTHERN CROSS was settled early, made a four wide middle move on the turn
and hade to check leaving the three eighths marker and weakened. UNION RALLY failed to menace. AMEN SYLVIA chased the pace in between horses
and tired. There were three jockeys OBJECTIONS but due to not having the correct available head on replay the race was left as is by the STEWARDS.
The objections were around the three eighths pole. Also these notes were made with just the pan shot as there was no head on replay shown for this race.

Footnotes
FREYSINGER set a pressured pace early two wide, then shook off that rival on the turn, then turned back the bid from VETO POWER on the turn and drew
off in the drive to prove much the best under mild pressure. CEETA pressed the winner on the inside early, fell back on the turn, angled out in the drive and
came again for the place. MISSING A SOCK was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and was along for the show award. VETO POWER
was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn and weakened. MORE TO FOLLOW was off slowly and broke inward, not a factor.

SHOWER THE PEOPLE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then had a long drive with
CHAIN REACTION and prevailed late under a drive. CHAIN REACTION stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, was between rivals leaving
the quarter pole, then had a long drive with the winner but was outfinished. FED CHAIR set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the quarter pole,
then gave way grudgingly. GALLINIPPER was rated along the inside, angled out in the drive and was slowly gaining late. TRUE SUCCESS was four wide
on both turns and had no late punch. RISEN SAVIOR was off slowly, then chased the pace in between horses on the first turn, tired.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN TIME was rated along three wide early, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention, then continued that bid to get up on the
outside in time, driving. ACT OF VALOR vied for the lead between horses, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the furlong marker, but was caught
late to just miss. VOY A TI vied for the lead on the inside, fell back leaving the turn, angled off the inside by the furlong marker, then rallied between horses
but was outfinished. WINNERS WIN was off a step slow, settled back early, came five wide into the drive and rallied. AWESOME YET AGAIN was well
placed early and weakened. PICKERING CIRCLE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. HOPE FOR GOLD vied for the lead three wide and
stopped.
