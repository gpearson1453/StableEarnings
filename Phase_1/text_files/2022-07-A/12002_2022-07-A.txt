Footnotes
FAVORITE IMAGE was away alertly and sent to the front to set the pace on the inside, then shook clear by the quarter pole, then was given a few pops left
handed with the crop by the furlong marker and drew clear, then was ridden out the final sixteenth to prove best while clear. CALL ON CLARA was void of
early speed on the inside, shifted to the outside and advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and rallied well. KINSALER prompted the
pace three wide and faded, bested rest. WHISTLE PLAYER was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked the needed rally. DREAMING THOUSAND was
four wide into the first turn, settled and made a mild four wide bid on the turn, but weakened in the drive. THINKIN OUT LOUD was well rated along the
inside, tipped out two wide for aim leaving the turn but came up empty. SUPER REIGN was reserved three wide and was not a threat. BUMMER chased the
pace three wide and tired.

LACCO AMENO was off slowly, reserved on the inside early, advanced two wide on the turn, then made a bid in the stretch, angled out for racing room
nearing the sixteenth marker and once clear edged away late under a hand ride. CATTY'S UNCLE vied for the early lead on the inside, then stalked the
pace and made a two wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole and led by the sixteenth pole but could not go with the winner late, second
best. AUCHINCRUIVE tracked the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled all the way back to last nearing the three eighths marker, then made a three
wide move on the turn, then checked hard by the furlong marker, altered course in the furlong grounds and was up for the show award on the wire, brutal
trip. MR DUBAI was reserved early and made a three wide move on the turn, loomed boldly by the furlong marker but had no late punch, lost show spot on
the wire. ARTIE CHILLER vied for the lead three wide, then went on to set the pace and move to the inside, then faded the final furlong. BUSTER BRUNO
chased the early pace from between rivals and weakened. MY MAN GEORGIO chased the early pace three to four wide and made a four wide bid on the
turn and weakened. FREEDOM'S START vied for the lead between horses early, then was on the inside chasing the pace by the three eighths and tired.

RAECHEL'S RISK set a pressured pace three wide, then drew clear on the turn, then drew off under left handed then right handed crop urging, then was
geared down late to prove much the best. COUNTESS SHANAKILL was rated along the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole, angled out six wide
leaving the turn and rallied well for the place award while no match for the winner. ABOVE THE LINE was with the pace early two wide, then dropped back
on the turn and came three wide into the drive, shifted to the inside and finished with interest to best the rest. NORA RADD stalked the early pace and was
four to three wide on the turn and then was empty. WOW FACTOR pressed the pace on the inside and stopped.
