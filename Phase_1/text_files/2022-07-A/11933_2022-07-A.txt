Footnotes
REFI NOW rated off of the quick early pace, mounted a three to four wide rally leaving the quarter pole, came within aim in mid-stretch, overtook
EXCESSIVE CAT nearing the sixteenth-pole and drew clear in the final stages. EXCESSIVE CAT was asked to show early speed and engaged with
DARKSABER soon after the break to contest the early pace, dueled with that foe while setting quick fractions through the turn, edged to a narrow lead in
mid-stretch, was overtaken by REFI NOW nearing the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished, while besting the rest. CONTINENTAL UNION chased the early
pace to the turn, saved ground along the bend, improved position in upper stretch and was no match in the final stages for the top pair but passed tiring
rivals to secure third. DARKSABER broke alertly and showed good early speed, was engaged by EXCESSIVE CAT soon after the break and dueled for
pace duties with that rival through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. HYPERSONIC stumbled badly at the start,
recovered to be not far off of the early pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TONI TWO POCKET tracked the solid early pace, made a steady advance on SWANEE along the turn and into upper stretch, responded to firm urging in
the drive, overtook the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged away at the end. SWANEE showed good early speed while in hand, sped to a
clear lead entering the turn, set solid fractions into the stretch run, came back to the field in mid-stretch and was caught and outfinished by the winner, while
holding safely for second. GOOD TIME DOLLY chased the solid early pace, ran evenly through the turn while two wide, improved position in upper stretch
and was outkicked in the final furlong, while clear of the rest for third. ZELAIA chased the early pace, came three wide approaching the quarter pole, swung
out to be five wide in upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. MAYCEE JO broke in the air, recovered to race in midpack to the turn while not far off of
the pace, gained a bit of ground nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CAN'THELPFALLIN
(IRE) lacked early speed to the turn, saved ground into the drive, was asked for run in upper stretch but did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ROSE settled off of the early pace while just off of the rail, lost position on the backstretch run, gained ground on the far turn and continued
that inside rally in upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole and responded to firm urging in the final sixteenth to prevail. GRIGORO settled just
off of the solid early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, mounted a five wide bid on the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, vied for
the lead in mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while well clear of the rest for second. DEL MAR FLASH broke through the gate prior to the
start, was sent leaving the start and set solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, led to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch
and weakened in the final stages, while holding safely for third. SILK ROAD SALLY was allowed to settle, improved position on the backstretch run, gained
ground while five wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. BOWLMAGEDDON was crowded by NORTHERN
ROSE at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried while saving ground through the second turn and was not a factor in the stretch run. FANTASTIC
SECRET was forwardly placed and attended to the solid early fractions, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, lost ground while four
wide on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave out in the final stages.

Footnotes
COOLCROSS was asked for early speed and dueled with UNPOSSIBLE on the front end to the turn, kept up that pace duel approaching the top of the lane,
shook free in upper stretch and dug in under firm handling in the end to prevail. OUR EXPECTATION rated off of the early pace, gained ground on the turn,
rallied four wide into the stretch run, advanced nearing mid-stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final furlong but held safely in the end for the place.
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, made a three wide move to vie for the lead nearing the
quarter pole, gave ground to the winner in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive, while clear of the rest for third. UNPOSSIBLE was sent leaving the
start and dueled with COOLCROSS for early pace duties, continued that duel through the turn while carving out moderate fractions, lost ground in upper
stretch and gave way in the final stages. AGENT ZERO chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn and was not a factor. HARDY CHISEL chased the
early pace, lost ground from a four wide path on the turn and was outrun in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUND OF THE SURF was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn while tracked by RAGTIME GIRL,
was confronted by that rival nearing the eighth pole, was put to steady urging in the final stages and determinedly held on in the end. RAGTIME GIRL
showed early speed and tracked the moderate pace, came three wide nearing the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch, made a steady advance in
the final furlong but could not get by the determined winner and was second best. RUNAWAY PRINCESS broke out at the start, recovered to be just off of
the early pace into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked the needed late response in the final furlong, while
well clear for third. DAISY DANCER was bothered at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace from midpack while never far back, lost position while
three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY chased the early pace, improved position while four
wide on the turn, could not sustain that run in upper stretch and flattened in the drive. WARNING SOUND was shuffled back at the start and spotted the field
several lengths, trailed through the turn, gained ground in upper stretch but was not a late threat in the drive. ZEPHYR CAT broke in and crowded rivals to
her inside at the start, chased the early pace, came five wide along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUPER BILL was sent leaving the break and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, came back to
the field a bit in the final sixteenth but held safely in the end. SMILING AT VAL tracked the quick early fractions through the turn, was outkicked in upper
stretch, was able to close a bit into the winner's margin in the final sixteenth but could not reel that one in and just held for second over an oncoming rival.
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE took back off of the early pace, improved position on the turn while four wide, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final
sixteenth and just missed for second in the end, while holding for third. BLAZING JAMIE was shuffled back soon after the start and chased the pace to the
turn, improved position nearing the quarter pole, continued that advance in upper stretch and finished well in the final sixteenth to challenge for third.
IMPRESSIVE CURLS stalked the quick pace from a three wide position, lost ground in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally in the final furlong.
YOU KIDDING ME chased the pace from the inside, maintained position through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. ONE
BROAD STREET chased the solid early pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter pole and was empty in the stretch run. VIVA LEON JODIDO was
slow into early stride and was climbing in the early going, lacked speed through the turn, came five wide to the quarter pole and was not a factor.

Footnotes
VEGAS MAGIC settled off of the quick early pace, came three wide to the quarter pole, advanced in upper stretch, closed with a rush through the final
furlong, split foes nearing the sixteenth-marker and was up just in time to prevail. FUMANO'S GIRL settled in the second flight early on, maintained position
through the turn, made a two wide move into upper stretch, took the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and was nailed on the line for the win, while holding
safely for the place. MAN OH MAN broke alertly and showed good early speed while setting quick fractions, extended the lead in upper stretch, was caught
in deep stretch and held on for third. STOLEN VOTE was a bit keen early on and steadied off of heels in the opening stages, improved position on the turn
while four wide, continued that advance in upper stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong and was outfinished late. ELECTRIC LETTUCE tracked the
quick early fractions, went four wide while maintaining position nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
PASSARANDO lacked early speed while in tight in the early going, improved position on the turn while four then five wide, swung widest into the drive and
found his best stride late. GOOD N THIRSTY showed early speed and disputed the quick early pace to the turn, pressed the pace to the quarter pole, was
outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KID AZTECA chased the pace from midpack, maintained position through the turn while five
wide, dropped back in upper stretch and did not offer a late response. CHUCKANUT BAY was off a step slowly but recovered to chase the quick pace from
the second flight, lost ground on the turn and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
THE LITTLE H MAN was reserved down the back stretch in a good position on the inside, was asked to pick it up passing the half mile pole, responded well,
gaining on the leaders through the turn, took the lead turning for home and powered on to an easy victory. AWESOME DUDE was bumped at the start and
was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, maintained position while saving ground along the bend, advanced in upper stretch and was outfinished
in the final furlong, while holding for second at the end. BIG BENO was a bit slow into stride early, quickened when asked heading to the turn, chased the
pace outside of rivals on the turn and loomed five wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not muster a final response, while
clear of the rest for third. ARMA D'ORO was bumped at the start and was away slowly, chased the early pace, made a three wide move on the turn,
continued that bid into upper stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the final furlong. SPEED GRAZY lacked early speed, passed a tiring
rival on the turn, came three wide into the drive and was not a threat in the final stages. ROYAL JESTER quickly opened up a two length lead on the field
into the turn, held the lead through the turn, was challenged on all sides entering the stretch and tired badly in the final furlong. WICKLOW HILLS lunged at
the start, recovered to stalk the pace from the outside, made a strong bid passing the three furlong pole but tired in the stretch while failing to change leads.
LESSONS OF AUTISM broke best of all from the gate but dropped back through the field after a furlong, was not persevered with from the three furlong
marker, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.
