MANHATTAN LADY never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch under left handed urging, made the lead late and drew clear.
SUNDRENCHED sprinted to a daylight lead on the clubhouse turn, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. VELVET SAMI was
bumped at the start, allowed to settle, loomed boldly between horses two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. MOTHERWELL close up from the start,
loomed boldly two wide on the far turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then leveled off. ANTHONY'S GIRL failed to menace. BE AUTHENTIC
chased the pace along the inside and was through after a half. WHOVILLE bore out hitting the gate and bumping her outside rival at the start then trailed.

Footnotes
TEAM HUCKY bumped his inside rival at the start, was taken outside soon thereafter, trailed into the stretch, circled his field with a burst of speed late and
got up in the final stride. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, rallied determinedly just inside the winner through deep stretch
and just missed. QUIET AMIGO was bumped at the start, rallied along the rail into the stretch, drifted out to the five path late and was narrowly beaten in a
game effort. IT'S YOUR CALL also bumped at the start, loomed boldly four wide into the stretch and was outfinished. ROMANTIC COWBOY bore in at the
start bumping his inside rivals causing a chain reaction of bumping to his inside, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter
pole, set the pace until deep stretch, was carried out late and faded. DENNY M stalked the pace three wide, offered a bid four wide into the stretch then
lacked racing room late. KONTAR was bumped by the winner at the start and no threat. OL' NED broke in front, set the pace along the inside for nearly a
half then gave way.

Footnotes
FORTUNATE GINA made the lead a few strides out of the gate, gave up the advantage soon thereafter, pressed the pace into the turn, made the lead
before the quarter pole, drifted out through deep stretch and won going away. SWEET EMPIRE was in tight at the start, loomed boldly three wide into the
stretch and finished well clear for second. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE stalked the pace and went evenly. EASTER PRIDE trailed into the stretch then passed
tiring rivals. BISCAYNE BAY swung wide and was no threat. HEIDI'S BACK away alertly, gained the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace two
wide through mid turn then gave way in the stretch. GRAZIA WHO had brief speed. WAFFLESORPANCAKES was through early.
