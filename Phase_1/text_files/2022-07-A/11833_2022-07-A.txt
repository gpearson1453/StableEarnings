lane and failed to take part. TRIGGER PULL Saved ground four a half mile, four wide into the last turn, two path out of tracking and tired. SOLAR ZEN

saved ground, checked midway on the turn and then closed well inside. BISTRITA Vied for the lead along the two path, chased in the lane and weakened.

placed, three path on the turn, chased and weakened. INHONOROFOWENJR Four wide on the turn, was outrun. LASAGNA Four wide on the turn, was not
