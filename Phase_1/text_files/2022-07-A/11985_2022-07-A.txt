SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) broke sharply setting a clear pace through the backside taking a breather on the far turn clearing again when cut loose in
upper stretch winning as much the best. HUNTER SCOTT went evenly through the backside moving on a measured leader to the quarter pole being
dispatched by said foe in upper stretch angling out six wide needing all late to save place. ALTMEISTER stalked the pace while saving ground getting closer
on the far turn being turned back in upper stretch extending along the rail missing place. K P SILVER BULLET slow early circled out to upper stretch vying
five then seven wide late. THE BEST DISTANCE getting out early was taken in hand on the first turn settling at the back, angled inside to upper stretch
showing good late response in the three path. RYEGATE STONE close up to the backside gave early retreat. RUSSIAN TANK was never involved.
