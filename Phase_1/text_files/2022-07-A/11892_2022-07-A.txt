ZATTER went to the front at once, saved ground setting the pace, drew clear entering the stretch and was ridden out to increase his advantage.
COASTLINE SERMON was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied along the inside into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished well for the
place. JERSEY RED was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was making up some ground late. POPPY'S C NOTE dropped back early
while racing along the inside and passed tiring rivals during the drive. PRINCE OF LUCK was forwardly place early, angled out to be three-wide nearing the
quarter pole but lacked a rally. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE prompted the pace from along the outside to the stretch and tired.

LOOKOUT TAYLOR saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through nearing the quarter pole, led entering stretch and quickly drew clear and won as the
rider pleased. KERRALIA saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but held on fairly
well for the place. COCOA CENTS was never far back, moved up three-wide to join the leaders nearing the half mile pole, could not sustain the bid but
finished willingly for third. CAMEO SHORES saved ground to no avail. NOUMEA was not a factor while racing three-wide. SMASHING SUCCESS dropped
back early and showed little..

DECIMATE stumbled at the start, then rushed up so set the pace while saving ground, settled into the stretch with a clear lead and maintained a safe
advantage under pressure. BOSS NINE was prominently place from the start while racing three-wide and finished strongly to be getting the winner late.
SUMMANUS was forwardly placed racing between horses throughout and was gaining ground late in a game effort. MISCHIEF ROAD stalked the pace
racing along the inside but was unable to find room late. ROCKED came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAN IN BLACK ducked in sharply
at the start to get away well behind his field, then moved up along the inside to be prominently placed for three furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
MAMACALLMEBOO saved ground setting the pace, drew clear when ready and won with something left. MOSQUITO FLEET saved ground stalking the
pace, angled out to come two-wide into the stretch, could not reach the winner, but finished well for the place. DEVILS WORKSHOP was off a step slow,
then saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. STARZAN prompted the early pace from along the
outside and tired. STREET DEMAND was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WESTERN RULE was not a factor while
coming five-wide into the stretch.

C JAXON vied for the early lead with Ghostfinder along the outside, opened a clear lead on the backstretch, responded to pressure and maintained a safe
advantage. GHOSTFINDER disputed the early pace along the inside, dropped back to stalk the pace on the backstretch, angled out during the drive and
was getting to thje winner late. ATLATL was unhurried after breaking a step slow, then rallied five-wide the final quarter and finish full of run. MOON
CIRCUMFERENCE dropped back early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole and was making up ground
late. PERFECT BLEND was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and went evenly. LUCKY CHAMP lacked early speed while racing along the inside and
gained his best stride too late. HAVARTI GOLD unhurried early, moved up along the inside to reach contention nearing the quarter pole and then flatted out.
COASTAL WONDER settled in the middle of the pack while racing three-wide and gave way after five furlongs.
