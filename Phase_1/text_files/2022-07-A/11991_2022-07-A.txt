Footnotes
FUTURO good position inside to turn, scurried up rail in time on wire. MASTER LEA set a pressured pace to stretch, cleared, run down late. ROCKA
BARRY chased to pair throughout, spurted up late not in time. Z FORCE MAJURE had a tardy start with no speed to the turn inside, roused outside stretch,
closed gap while finishing up in good order. J BOONE unhurried early, ran on late to improved position only. FOOT SACK raced evenly with no late
response when needed. TIZ DEJA BLUE hard used outside, pressed pace two path into stretch but gave way readily. WE THANK YOU never a menace.
LOCKDOWN LOVER far back at all calls, never factored. DISCOUNT DENNIS had a tardy start and always trailed.
