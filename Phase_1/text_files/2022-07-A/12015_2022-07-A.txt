Footnotes
I GOT A ROCK prompted the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn, dueled for command by the furlong marker and then slowly edged clear
leaving the sixteenth marker and then held on late to prove best, driving. BLOODPROF was settled early on the inside, shifted to the outside on the turn
andf came five wide into the lane while advancing, closed well late to just miss. HYMN'S SYLVIA set a pressured pace on the inside and dug in gamely in
the drive but faded late. MILITARY DRILL pressed the pace between horses and faded in the drive. DREAMING OF LOVE chased the pace and was two
wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no late punch. COOS BAY was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. MYSTIC
TIMES checked shortly after the start and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LA CIENEGA was away alertly to set a pressured pace while in hand, then drew clear leaving the turn and then drew off in the stretch to prove much the
best while being kept to pressure. OUR JESSICA JOAN was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and lugged in
through the stretch while finishing well to be clearly second best, no match to the winner. HEAVENLY HEART tracked the pace two wide and weakened
while besting the rest. QUEEN LUCKY passed the tiring rivals. PROVIDING pressed the pace four to three wide and weakened. NUMERATOR was settled
early, came six wide into the lane and had no response. NYX AND CHAOS chased the pace four wide and then was three wide on the turn and tired,
vanned off. LUCYS GIRL chased the pace on the inside and then checked by the three eighths pole and stopped.

TRUE HEIRESS prompted the pace three wide, made a two wide bid and edged clear by the furlong marker and then maintained a safe margin to prove
best under a drive. MY MASTERPIECE was rated early and was two wide on the turn, tipped out four wide for the drive and closed well late. LADY
MUNNINGS was away alertly to set a pressured pace two wide, then moved to the inside by the quarter pole and faded the final furlong, held show award.
RACINGINTHESTREET was settled early on the inside, shifted to the outside on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had abelated rally. ZIPPY JO
pressed the pace on the inside, steadied by the five sixteenth, angled out in the drive and was empty. FIRST FOREVER was bumped at the start, failed to
menace. BALI reared at the start, lost rider, then walked off after the race. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE START, BUT
AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, but faded late. EARLY FROST tracked the pace four wide, then was four to three wide on the turn and two wide
by the quarter pole, then was blocked by the furlong marker, angled out for racing room and then ran on. BIRD TRAFFIC was allowed to settle, then was
five wide by the quarter pole but needed a rally. FORGOTTEN ONE set the pace on the inside and gave way.
