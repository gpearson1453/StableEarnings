Footnotes
JIMTOWN was bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead two wide, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win going away under a strong hand
ride. MONSTER HUNTER stalked the pace three wide, improved position into the far turn, dug in gamely two wide late and gained second. DYNAMIC
REACH saved ground, offered a mild bid into the stretch then was outfinished for second. SEASONS END was bumped between horses at the start and
failed to menace. WEEKEND BUZZ bore out bumping KARAMEL CORN causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside then was through after a half.
KARAMEL CORN was bounced around between horses at the start, in a bit tight into the clubhouse turn, had speed for a half then gave way.

Footnotes
MALICED settled five wide soon after the start, rallied three wide through the turn and into the stretch, made the lead at the furlong marker while drifting in
slightly and drew off under a hand ride. DIVINE MARTHA pressed the pace two wide, was in a bit tight at the eighth pole, steadied then finished second
best. COMPANYS COMING broke in front, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out and was outfinished. BACKSPLASH trailed into
the stretch then had a mild late rally three wide. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL hopped at the start and failed to menace. SHELLEY'S GEM stalked the pace along
the inside into the stretch then weakened. MARIPOSA D'ORO had speed into the turn then gave way. MISS OVER THERE was no factor. THE RIDER OF
DIVINE MARTHA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH. AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

COURTLY away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and lasted under left handed urging. LITTLE MATILDA close up from the start, rallied four
wide on the far turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch giving up ground then came on again late. CLOSE TO ME was unprepared for the start,
loomed boldly five wide into the stretch then was outfinished. BLONDE BY NATURE chased the winner under a strong hold into the far turn, dropped back
to trail, swung wide then passed tiring rivals. JLO CAN DANCE never far back, moved closer along the inside on the far turn then came up empty. BLAZING
ZENNA close up, loomed boldly three wide before a half, had speed into the stretch then gave way. SHANNON'S GIRL away alertly, bid two wide before a
half, remained close through the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
OHIO MUNNY bore in badly bumping hard with DOUGS MORNING PICK forcing that one into RIDGE WEST, prompted the pace two wide into the turn,
made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch under right handed urging and prevailed under brisk handling. WOLFINE vied for the lead three wide into the
stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. WILDCAT BILL stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, angled out and drew closer
two wide then was outfinished. DOUGS MORNING PICK was bumped hard at the start, trailed through the turn then had a mild late rally in the four path.
DENNY M moved up four wide into the turn then came up empty. TRAITOR AMONGST US failed to menace. INTO THE OUT away alertly, set a pressured
pace along the inside for almost a half then weakened in deep stretch. ACCURATE was shut off at the start, drew closer along the inside on the turn then
failed to sustain that bid. RIDGE WEST was bumped hard at the start and had brief speed.
