Footnotes
HOT CAVIAR sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way into the turn, vied inside of TALLANDLONG at the quarter pole, shook free turning
for home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady urging. ANGIE'S REVRAC was allowed to settle off the pace in early stages then
made a three wide move around the turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and got up late for place. TALLANDLONG vied for the lead with the
eventual winner around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but ran on and got edged for place. SUE HAPPY broke in and bumped with
rival at the start, was reserved in the back, hustled along four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. SPITFIRE SUZIE tracked the
pace along the inside into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and gave way. CORAGEOUSCHRISTINE was not far back in early stages, chased two
wide around the turn then retreated.

END ALL GET ALL was well rated sitting just off the embattled trio up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the
lane and drove clear under steady pressure. HUNKA BURNING LOVE led the way around the first turn and dueled inside through the backstretch,
continued to battle for command around the final turn, shook free at the head of the lane then got overtaken in the final sixteenth. IRISH VALOR was
allowed to settle just off the pace in early stages, saved ground then urged two wide into upper stretch, shifted back to the inside and prevailed for a share.
ATTAIN SUCCESS tracked the leader around the first turn then dueled through the backstretch, battled for command around the final turn then tired in the
drive. RIVER CACTUS stumbled at the start and raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to threaten. DOWNTOWNER tracked the pace
around the first turn then advanced to engage rivals for the lead midway up the backstretch, dueled to the far turn then chased the top pair and came up
empty turning for home.

FLAT OUT STORMIN hopped in the air at the start and raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch and angled inside entering the
turn, roused forward along the rail in upper stretch to challenge KAYLOR for the lead, dug in gamely under firm handling and drove clear. KAYLOR broke
alertly, cleared and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, set the uncontested pace and maintained a clear advantage around the turn, took on the
inside challenge of FLAT OUT STORMIN at the head of the lane, fought back two wide a furlong out then got overtaken near mid-stretch and settled for
second best. LUCKYHOTSTUFF tracked the leader in early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn and churned on for a share. CAN'T MAKE ME
raced in early contention, sustained a two to three wide bid around the turn then gave way. PENNY EXPRESS raced two wide around the turn and had no
response. BLITZED saved ground around the turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
ZENCHUA SKY was allowed to settle in opening stages then hustled along near the inside late on the turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive, dug in
gamely under firm handling and got up in time. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK dueled inside of MILANA for the early lead and battled on around the turn, dug in
gamely and shook free upper stretch then got caught in closing strides. FAST SOPHIA got bumped and lost path at the start and raced in the back, picked
up the pace and rated near midpack going by the half mile marker, roused four wide in upper stretch, ran on through the lane and prevailed for a share.
PREF RIGHT lacked speed and raced in the back, launched a bid along the rail bid entering the lane and steadily gained. MILANA bumped with rival at the
start then dueled outside of PRESLEYS ARTWORK in opening stages, battled for command around the turn then failed to match strides past upper stretch
and steadily weakened. ARKANSAS INVASION took a solid bump at the start and raced off the early pace, shifted out five wide upper stretch and had a
mild improve. GOVENESS SHEILA raced in the second flight in the opening quarter, chased four wide around the turn then gave way. NO ONE CARES
chased the top pair through the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn the retreated.

Footnotes
CAESARTHERULER tracked the leader through the backstretch then launched a two wide bid around the turn, cleared command in upper stretch and held
firm under a driving finish. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE rated in early stages then hustled up three wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and
finished nicely. ABOUT OUR TIME raced near midpack through early stages, hustled along two wide into the lane and grabbed a share. LUCKY LOUIE
rated off the early pace then hustled up near the inside, shifted out heading into the lane and improved position without threatening. NOSBOR raced off the
early pace, urged three to four wide around the turn and never threatened. GONE WITH THE FINN set the pace and held clear around the turn, got collared
in upper stretch and faded. SAY IT NICELY broke alertly from the outside, chased the leader up the backstretch and around the turn then tired in the drive.
IOWA NATIVE failed to move into contention.
