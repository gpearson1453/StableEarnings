WEIGHT OF GLORY stumbled while breaking alertly, quickly moved clear, repelled a challenge at the quarter pole and pulled clear. CRAFTY JACK
prompted the pace outside, bid at the quarter pole, was turned back but held the place. DR ZRADA dropped back in the two path, moved wide in the stretch
with a mild rally. DEFIBRILLATOR angled three wide in the opening quarter and failed to threaten. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD saved ground off the leaders and
faded on the turn. CALL ME G Q lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention.

ALWAYS TALKING set a pressured pace inside, shook loose in midstretch and held on gamely from challenges on both sides. NURTURING saved ground
throughout and made a gradual gain in the stretch. BACK CHANNEL pressed the winner outside to the stretch and weakened slightly. MS CANELA broke in
a complete tangle then narrowed the gap rallying. THIS ROUND'S MINE stalked the dueling pacesetters outside, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened
out. GLOWING STAR lacked speed and was was never in contention. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. EMPRESS IRENE was
ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

SOUND THE CHARGE firmly rated, moved easily to the front on the final turn, drew away and lasted under steady coaxing. MR. EINSTEIN dropped back at
the start, advanced just off the inside and closed well. REPEATED PROMISE made a menacing bid on the final turn then flattened out in the stretch. RYE
SENSE OF HUMOR chased wide off the leaders and lacked a solid rally. NATAVALLI'S KNIGHT dropped far behind then offered some late energy. SKY
TEMPLE chased along the inside and was never a factor. DRAMATIZED was hustled to a clear lead to the final turn and weakened. BUCKS ARE MOVING
lacked speed and was always outrun. CURRENT HOPE moved close early inside then stopped after half a mile. LIBERTY RUNNER trailed far behind
throughout.

FAR MO POWER eased back early, angled wide to secure room on the turn, bid wide into the stretch and surged clear while geared down late.
MIDNIGHTCHARLY made a menacing three wide bid to the front midway on the turn then proved no match for the winner. GEEBERT was in tight briefly in
the chute, saved ground, moved wide in the lane and closed well. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE hustled to the lead inside, vied through the turn and weakened.
APPEALING FUTURE moved three wide to contention, dueled on the turn then faded. GET SET dropped back early and lacked a rally. FIRE'S FINALE was
always outrun and gave way readily.

PRINCESS GRACE controlled the pace under rating inside, repelled a challenge on the final turn then drew off through the stretch while put to urging.
FLIRTING BRIDGE (IRE) settled well behind, advanced very wide, bid into the stretch, continued well but was easily second best. LOVE IN THE AIR
stalked the pacesetter outside, went after the winner on the final turn, drifted out in the stretch then weakened. RUNAWAY RUMOUR settled close up
outside, was asked for run into the far turn, faltered but finished willingly. TIC TIC TIC BOOM urged close up early, angled inside down the backstretch,
lacked a solid rally but finished well. CLASSIC LADY reserved just off the pace inside, moved within range to the stretch then faltered. FED POLICY trailed
for three quarters then passed a stopping rival. FLASHNDYNAMITE steadied between rivals at the break then stopped abruptly.
