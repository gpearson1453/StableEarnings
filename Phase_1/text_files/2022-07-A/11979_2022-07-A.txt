Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE STOOPER came away behind rivals, advanced on pacesetters along the backstretch, travelled three wide around the bend, had the slightest
of advantage entering the homestretch, floated in slightly and proved best in stretch duel for the score. CHASE'S RAINBOW broke alertly and gained
command approaching the quarter pole, trekked the two path around the bend, was on even terms and between rivals at upper stretch, then was cutoff at
head of stretch, forced to take up, then rallied back and just missed the score. DON'T BUG ME flashed early speed and led the field along the backstretch,
saved ground through the turn, was in concert for the lead at upper stretch, bumped rival at head of stretch, then was nipped at wire and forced to share the
place. ONE PRETTY GIRL trailed the field from outset and lost ground to front runners with a wide trip. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION, THE
BOARD OF STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NUMBER 2, DON'T BUG ME, FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

BEAR DEN showed reserve through the opening half while saving ground around the opening bend, angled out to three wide, trekked three wide around the
closing while circling pacesetting duo, and got up in time for the score. PAID THE PORTER pressed the pace from outset while tracking the two path, was
on even terms between rivals at upper stretch, then was outdueled in final sixteenth. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE hustled from outset and gained first
command, saved ground through both turns, locked into a three way stretch duel at upper stretch and gave way to top pair in final strides. RAINBOWS
TREASURE failed to contend and trailed the field throughout.

front runner from a three path pose, closed the gap on that rival nearing the quarter pole, but proved no match for the runaway winner in final stages.
FETCHING FURY lacked a needed rally after looming behind the pacesetter and trekking the two path through the bends. C. F. SHELAUH failed to menace
while giving chase from a trailing stance.

MACHO COWGIRL trekked three wide around the opening bend, advanced on pacesetters with three wide move along the backstretch, gained sole
command nearing the quarter pole and drew off easily in closing strides. HONOR GRADUATE gave chase around the first turn from a three path stance,
tucked to rail along the backstretch, then rallied along the rail to ear the place. DA COACH'S WIFE came up empty in the final sixteenth after flashing early
speed along the inside and angling out at upper stretch. LISA G pressed the early pace while tracking the two path, was within striking distance at the
quarter pole, but faded in closing stages and was unable to muster a closing bid. BELLAS KITTY saved ground to no avail. ONE CLASSY CHICK steadily
weakened to end a ground saving trip.

Footnotes
ROYALLY pressed the pace from a two path position then came under stiff urging at head of stretch and got up at the wire for the honors. MEGA BOND
showed reserve from outset and through the opening bend, advanced to gain command along the backstretch, led the field at upper stretch and was caught
in final stride. PROUD MOMENTS was unhurried through the opening half before rallying three wide with fury to earn the show. SEDARIS settled into
second flight and lacked a rally to end a two path journey. TOAH saved ground to no avail.

PEARLY pressed the pace from between rivals around the first turn, gained command at the quarter pole, then drew off in final furlong for a clear score.
NAUGHTY NATALIE stalked the early front runner from a three wide pose, maintained that line throughout and finished a clear second but was no match for
winner in the end. ACERTIVE MISS finished evenly after settling in the two path and giving chase from second flight. DAKAMO ROSE failed to sustain bid
after rushing from outset and leading the field early from an inside stance. J LOVE showed reserve then late interest and was photoed out of the show.
RIVER LIBERTY was unhurried, rated back, and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ROCKPORT KAT came away alertly and battled side by side for command, was challenged mid stretch by rallying rival, and got the bob at wire for the
score. GUINESSEY rushed form outset and set the pace in unison as the inner rival, dueled the entire way, then was outdueled in closing strides and forced
to settle for place honors. CONCRETE FINISHER showed reserve early, angled out at upper stretch, and rallied to lock into a three way stretch duel but
was outnodded at wire. CANEY'S GHOST gave chase to frontrunners from an inside stance, was within striking distance along the inside at upper stretch,
but failed to match strides with rivals in closing sixteenth.

Footnotes
PARABELLUM hustled away at the start and gained first command, led the field through every call and just held off the late rush of rivals for a gate to wire
score. OFF AND BACK was unhurried early, closed the gap on leader inside the half pole, challenged that rival into homestretch and just missed the score.
BONES BRUIN missed the break and rated well back through the opening call, slowly reeled in rivals along backstretch, angled to be widest of all at upper
stretch and was gaining on leaders at finish. GREAT REALIZATION rallied mildly and improved placing to end a ground saving trip. OLE SOFTY rushed
form outset to force the pace through the opening half before eclipsing in the crucial stages. HERE'S YOUR DRINK settled into second flight as the lone
rival in the early strides before tiring in the closing portion of contest.
