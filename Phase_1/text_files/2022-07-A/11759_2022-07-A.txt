Footnotes
TWO MORE TIMES rated just outside RENDLAKE, did not stay with that one after a half mile, commenced her bid when let out on the second bend, was
asked to make her bid with two furlongs left, gained the lead upper stretch then steadily pulled away under mild urging the final furlong. RENDLAKE broke
alertly, was challenged from outside on the first turn, drew away from TWO MORE TIMES after a half mile, put to urging on the second bend, was no match
for the latter when set down for the drive but proved easily second best. UNIVERSIADE was a bit awkward and slow to break from the gate, settled inside,
was under urging through the lane and drew off for the show. BULU raced in contention from outside for a half mile then began to fade.

COMFORT ME NOW broke on top and was quickly clear, took the inside nearing the first bend, showed the way in hand, was let out some when challenged
on the second turn, asked entering the lane then gradually opened up under mild urging and was kept to task until the last seventy yards. LEMON BLITZ
hustled along in the early going, got through two wide into the first bend, stalked COMFORT ME NOW, went for the lead on the second turn, could not stay
with that one when the serious running started but was easily second best. AMERICAN SUCCESS raced in contention outside the top pair, did not keep up
after five furlongs, never relented but failed to have a late bid.

Footnotes
IT'S BELLAMY TIME broke in stride and was quickly clear, showed the way in hand, floated out some when asked for run entering the lane and gradually
widened command while ridden out the last eighth. CHANGE DIRECTION raced in contention just outside PO BOY, came into the lane from path five,
edged ahead for second with a furlong to go then could only just hold his position late. CROWNED LEADER void of early speed, was just off the inside
taking the turn, fanned out behind IT'S BELLAMY TIME for the stretch run, steadily advanced inside rivals and was closing in for second late. PO BOY
raced in the second flight from just off the inside, swung out to path four into the stretch, fought for second but slowly wore down inside the final furlong.
YALIKEANYTHING soon trailed, saved ground and showed a willingness to run the last two furlongs. E Z TAPIT chased running widest most of the way and
failed to menace.

KHOZAN'S SUCCESS moved clear on the first bend and took the inside, was relaxed and soon shared the lead on the backstretch, edged ahead under
urging in the lane and held off SEMINOLE BEACH under steady handling. SEMINOLE BEACH advanced two wide to share the lead on the backstretch,
was put to urging leaving the second turn, all out in the stretch, drifted out in the late going but was easily best of the rest. CO CONSPIRATOR hesitated at
the break, was urged up from inside, raced in contention for nearly six furlongs, could not stay with the top pair after that but was unchallenged for third.
DARE GOES DA DEVIL failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. SOME DUDE chased from not far off the inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SCAPITURE was sent to vie for the early lead, gradually drifted out on the backstretch, crowding those outside her, moved clear from path three on the
bend, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the lane, steadily drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the final sixteenth and proved easily best
of the others. DELTA LADY vied for the lead between rivals from the start, was caught in a very narrow path midway on the backstretch, jostled with CREAL
SUGAR from the half mile marker to the seven-sixteenths pole, was two wide taking the turn, took over second upper stretch then could only hold her
position late under steady handling. BURNING BUSH soon railed, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, made a strong move from path six the
last furlong and gained third with seventy yards left. CREAL SUGAR contested the early pace from outside, jostled with DELTA LADY from the half mile
pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, was three wide through the turn and lacked the extra needed from between horses in the stretch. STEPHANIE'S
MELODY disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not stay with SCAPITURE on the turn and gradually yielded in the lane. CYBERTAP was
soon well back, stayed off the inside taking the bend, came into the stretch from path four and made up minor ground the last eighth. BUMPER GIRL
forwardly placed from outside, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, failed to keep up on the turn, drifted out some midstretch and finished evenly.
ELLIE BLUE chased from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, altered inside when BUMPER GIRL came out midstretch and finished evenly.

Footnotes
PEACOCK MAN prominent from the start, gradually angled in on the backstretch, gained the rail midway on the turn, vied for the lead soon after that,
battled through the stretch, floated out some at the sixteenth marker, was corrected and edged ahead of MARCO'S DREAM with seventy yards to go.
MARCO'S DREAM forwardly placed toward the outside, went for the lead four wide on the bend, angled in some entering the lane, took a slight advantage,
fought to hold on, lugged in slightly as PEACOCK MAN came out with a sixteenth left and did not have enough left in the waning yards. ABSTRACT
PAYNTER rated just off the inside, picked up his pace on the bend, lost ground fanning out to path five entering the stretch, rallied belatedly the last furlong
but gained third with forty yards left. D'ARCHER vied for the early lead just outside KING TITO, gained the lead early in the turn, was challenged from both
sides nearing the end of a half mile and slowly wore down from between rivals the final furlong. LONG STATION away somewhat slowly, chased from
between horses, advanced on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, came six wide into the lane and made up minor ground the last eighth. BABA LOU soon
trailed from outside, was carried out by LONG STATION leaving the turn and failed to have a significant response from the middle of the track for the stretch
run. RAHFEE TOWN advanced from outside to prompt the early leaders, was three wide on the bend, began to fade leaving the turn, angled out slightly for
a clear path at the top of the lane then steadily gave way from between horses. KING TITO displayed early speed from inside but gave way before finishing
three furlongs.
