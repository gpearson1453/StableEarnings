Footnotes
GO SPEED RACER GO chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive on the backstretch then rallied on the far turn drifted out slightly in the last
furlong but kept on and was up at the wire. U S NAVY CROSS was unhurried early then swung out six wide in upper stretch to menace and was closing
belatedly in the end. CAIRO WARRIOR set the pace on the first turn, was in a long drive on the backstretch then steadied in late stretch and gave way at
the wire. COLOSI chased the pace while two wide into the far turn, was in a hard drive in the lane and was closing willingly but it was not enough.
METROPOL chased the pace while three wide, then bid mildly in the stretch but it was too little too late. SMOKEY HARBOR raced while four wide on the
backstretch, was gaining ground quickly on the far turn, then was used up and tired in the stretch. MIDAS CAT was unhurried early and needed rally. There
was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to inference in the stretch run. After reviewing the replay, there was no change to the order of finish.
