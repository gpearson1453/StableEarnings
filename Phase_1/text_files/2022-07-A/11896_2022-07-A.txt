THE GREAT KATH vied four wide through the early stages, took a narrow lead in the three path nearing the five-sixteenths poled, dueled outside of AUNT
NADINE from there and prevailed. AUNT NADINE dueled inside of foes in the two path and fought on inside of the winner to the wire. DREAMING OF
AUDREY had early speed between foes, settled back nearing the turn, raced three to four wide around the bend and rallied outside in the lane. HARD TO
CAPTURE vied between foes down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn and churned on through the lane. SIMPLY THE BEST went evenly while
racing four and five wide. ADIOS BABE vied three wide between foes and gave way nearing the five-sixteenths marker. SOPHIA'S STORM broke a bit
awkwardly and trailed inside.

Footnotes
QUITE READY stalked the pace two wide, took the lead between foes near the eighth pole and drove clear. HIGH PRESS settled off the early pace outside,
raced three wide around the turn, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied to gain the place in the final strides. HANDSOME PRINCE tracked the pace
three wide, came five wide into the lane, bid outside of the winner in midstretch, could not quite keep pace with that foe and lost second late. OFFICER
COUNTRY was pinched back soon after the start, trailed inside, angled out in the stretch and rallied belatedly. STAR WEAVER came in and bumped
OFFICER COUNTRY soon after the start, chased the pace two wide, bid between foes in midstretch but flattened out. SPAN OF CONTROL bumped
OFFICER COUNTRY soon after the start, sped to the front between foes, cleared and angled in nearing the turn, set the pace along the rail around the turn,
drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. FAMOUS GENT was up close inside and lacked a closing bid. COMPASS CAY was off a step slow, raced three
wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
VAL'S GAL checked trying to the avoid the fallen rider soon after the start, sped to the front once clear, set the pace in the two path, drew off around turn,
widened in upper stretch, drifted out a bit late and held safe under moderate urging. MAJOR PRYCE raced off the pace three wide, swung widest in upper
stretch and surged through the final furlong. LILY OF WICKLOW broke awkwardly, chased the winner three wide and held well enough for the show.
ANNA'S IMAGE went evenly inside. MARVELOUS LADY played no factor while racing two wide. SHILOH was outrun while racing four wide. MOVE TO
ORDER was hampered trying to avoid the fallen rider soon after the start and was always far back. RIPLEY was reluctant to load, broke on top but stumbled
and unseated the rider soon after the start and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT SOON AFTER THE
START AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LADY EMILY was bounced around early, raced off the pace two wide, circled five wide around the far turn, kicked in in upper stretch and blew past the field
nearing the sixteenth pole. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC tracked the pace three wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, rallied between foes but was no
match for the winner. LADY JAE lacked early speed while racing three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and ran on for the show. OGLALA
bumped with the winner at the start, pressed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, battled to the eighth pole and
weakened. YOLANDA'S PRIDE was up close two wide and faded in the lane. MIA CAMILA set a pressured pace inside and tired in the final furlong.
SHOOTLIKEAGIRL had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
THEREARENORULES raced well back two wide around the first turn, cruised up four wide around the far turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled
outside of EMPRESS ELLIE from there and prevailed. EMPRESS ELLIE settled off the early pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, took the
lead nearing the quarter pole, dug in inside of the winner through the lane and just missed. LOVE HER LOTS lacked early speed while racing three wide,
advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside. NANA FANNY was up close inside and was one-paced through the lane. ANATOLIAN failed to
menace while racing three and four wide. GRANDMA'S PUDDING tracked the pace inside and faded through the lane. RUNNING LEGACY played no
factor while racing four wide. SPECTACULAR GAL stalked the pace three wide, bid midway around the far turn and tired in upper stretch. MI NEGRITA set
the pace in the two path and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
WINNING AT EASE was unhurried early, angled into the two path entering the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the
quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted in in midstretch, drifted out late and held safe under a drive. SPLICER raced well back three and four wide,
swung widest in upper stretch and finished strongly. RUBYSA tracked the pace three and four wide, had aim in upper stretch but finished evenly. SWEET
ACTRESS raced off the pace three and four wide, made some progress between foes in upper stretch but flattened out. PARDON MY HEART failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. TWIN CAUSE steadied entering the first turn, stalked the pace inside around that bend, bid two wide nearing the far
turn, led in the two path around much of that bend and tired in the lane. GREEN GAL set the early pace in the two path, chased inside around the far turn
and retreated in the lane. SUMTING RIGHT was pulling through the opening half while racing two wide between foes and had no response. YEARS AGO
prompted the pace three wide, steadied nearing the quarter pole and had no further bids.
