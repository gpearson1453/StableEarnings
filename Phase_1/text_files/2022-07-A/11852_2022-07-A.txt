marker, battled some, checked when the winner drifted in some and then altered out late. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN Well placed along the rail on the turn,
eased out some and finished with interest. A MAIZE ZING RIP Well placed between along the two path midway on the turn, angled out and hung.
FULLFAITHANDCREDIT Close up four wide early, outside rivals while four wide midway around the turn and weakened. SKYWRITING Three path on the
turn and tired. REAL DAN Saved ground and tired. Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, also a claim of foul was lodged by the rider of
