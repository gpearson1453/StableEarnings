Footnotes
LITTLE MS SCARLET tracked near the rear of the field early, moved outside runners entering the turn, was swung six wide inside the quarter pole, closing
widest off all in the stretch, dug in game. BRUNELLA always well placed along the inside, held the rail through the turn, stayed on and finished willingly.
SHACKABOOM showed good gate speed, was asked to quicken the tempo nearing the three eights pole, was joined in side and out by rivals leaving the
quarter pole, and weakened in deep stretch. MAUREENLOVESFRANK gained a good stalking position while in the four path, was three wide moving into
the turn, and could not sustain a late bid. HUFFLEPUFF broke well, had speed while racing two wide, came under a ride nearing the three eights pole, and
faded through the stretch.

DRY WELL was allowed to settle early, eased out and made a three wide move on the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole and drew off in the drive
under mild right handed crop urging to prove much the best. STARTWITHABANG was void of early speed, advanced five wide on the turn and came six
wide into the lane, finished willingly to be clearly second best, no match to the winner'. BAD TEMPER was settled early three to four wide, advanced four
wide on the turn and then weakened, bested rest. BACKSTREET GAL vied for the early lead five to four wide, then was two wide on the turn and tired.
CHICAGO RIVER vied for the early lead between horses, then on the inside on the turn and gave way. MO FIRE was settled early between rivals, then
shifted to the outside on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, empty. OVERANDOVERAGAIN vied for the lead on the inside and folded.

Footnotes
GHOST GAME was rated along four wide, came five wide into the drive, closed well on the outside under left handed crop urging, hit the front about seventy
yards from the wire and edged clear late to prove best. STONE COURAGEOUS was settled early between horses, came two wide into the lane and rallied
well, gained place award at wire. RAHMER stalked the early duel three wide, made a bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, drew clear leaving the
turn and by the furlong marker, but proved to be not enough as was caught late and then lost the place award at the wire. HIDE THE RANSOM was bumped
at the start, dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the drive. HAIR OF THE DOG was bumped at the start, settled on the inside, angled out for the
drive and had no rally. LOOKATLITTLEFERRIS broke in at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and weakened.

MR THRIFTY was settled early on the inside, shifted out nearing the five eighths, then advanced two wide on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn,
closed well to slowly wear down the front runner late to get up in time, driving. SUGAR DADDY was away alertly to set the pace while in the two path, turned
back a bid on the turn to be clear leaving the turn, then dug in gamely but was caught late to just miss. LOST MY VOWCHER stalked the early pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn and drifted out leaving the turn and weakened, stayed on for the show award. O K GAME ON was rated along two wide
early, then dropped to the inside on the turn and lacked a late response. MUCHO MAS GRANDE was reserved early, came three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BREVIARY, last away from the gate, made progress while outside runners, moved four wide near the three eighths pole, gained control soon after leaving
the quarter pole and pulled away under a steady hand ride. CAROLINA ICE, away in good order, was running on the lead while under a snug hold, held
onto the lead entering the stretch and finished willingly. EIFS moved up on the inside to gain nice stalking position, traveled well around the turn, came
under a ride nearing the quarter pole then flattened out. LOVE IS STRONG stalked the leader while racing three wide, was asked for run between runners
on the turn, could not keep pace then finished evenly in the stretch. SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) rated off the pace early, secured the rail into the turn,
was asked for his run nearing the three eighths pole, waited briefly, went five wide at the quarter pole, angled inside at the eighth pole then finished flat. TIZ
SUSAN ANN took a three wide stalking position into the turn, stayed three wide when asked inside the three eighths pole, was shuffled back at the quarter
pole then faded in the stretch.
