leader with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. TEQUILA TIGRE bumped with the winner at the start, went up to duel for command from outside and
three wide on the turn, put away inner rival with three-sixteenths remaining, drifted inward midstretch and could not fend off the winner in the final sixteenth.
BLAZING BARDOT sped to the front from inside, dueled with TEQUILA TIGRE to the stretch, could not keep up past the three-sixteenths pole and held kept
on to hold the show. LUCY L stalked the top pair from outside, rounded the bend four wide and lacked a late bid. SHEZ OUR ARCH dropped back off the
pace, raced along the inside then a bit off the rail into the drive, moved out in the stretch and lacked further response. RYDER'S CANDY was off slow to
begin, went four wide through the turn and failed to menace. KEEPURSELF ALIVE was put in tight between runners early, lost path and checked just past

Footnotes
RED PANTY NIGHT got bumped in the beginning, was a bit rank while prominent early in the three path, settled outside the top pair on the backstretch, was
closest in pursuit on the far turn, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, led three to four wide into the stretch and kicked clear. TRAVEL SMART traveled five
wide into the first turn then moved into the four path, chased three wide on the far turn, tracked the winner through the lane and had to settle for second
best. DERBY QUEST took a bump leaving the gate then got crowded between rivals, went four wide into the first turn then angled down to the rail, traveled
two wide into the second turn, steered out and came five wide into the stretch and rallied for the show. ARDIS bumped with inner rival leaving the gate then
sped to the front on the inside, lost command on the backstretch and chased the leader past the five-eighths pole, saved ground around the far turn, tipped
out in the lane and lacked a rally. SEVEN EXES got pinballed leaving the gate, pulled three then two wide on the first turn, went two then three wide on the
second bend, failed to threaten in the drive, bled following the race and walked off. SHVERE ARBETER stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, chased the
leader early then pulled to the front, moved clear on the backstretch, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and folded in the stretch. ST HELENA chased
while a bit rank in the four path early, remained well off the rail into the second turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE broke a bit slow from outside, went up to press the pace leaving the backstretch, lost contact and chased the leader four wide to
the stretch, re-bid while drifting inward and wore down the runner-up in the closing moments. PROJECT LEADER sped to the front and set the pace under
pressure, cleared around the bend, led three wide into the lane, met the challenge from MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE, resisted through the late stages and got
nailed at the wire. RAWHIDE RAWLINS chased near the inside then two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and kept to task through the lane but
could not threaten the top pair. MUNNY BALL raced up close from off the rail, went four wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide and could not rally.
PEDRO PEREZ chased five then six wide on the turn and never responded when called upon. RUNAWAY WYWY trailed a bit off the rail into the stretch
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DISKO TRIBUTE was closest in pursuit to the outside of the leader early on, got carried wide into the lane and top of the stretch, cleared at the
three-sixteenths pole then drifted in and held well. STANFORD NORTH sped to front from inside, went two wide into the turn, lugged out leaving the bend,
continued to come out more at the top of the lane, relinquished the lead to DISKO TRIBUTE, lugged in nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly to prove
second best. GRAZEN IN THE PARK dropped well off the pace early, went two wide into the turn, came out and entered the stretch four wide and was
along for the show. RANCHO RED broke slow, raced outside a rival at the back, angled to the rail on the turn and saved ground to the stretch and could no
rally. BUTTONWOOD TREE chased off the rail, got put in tight between rivals and steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the drive and
weakened. UPTOWN WARRIOR chased five wide into the turn, moved in a path then came back five wide leaving the bend, angled out into the stretch and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON dueled for command from inside, got put in tight and shuffled early on the turn, remained along the rail chasing to the stretch,
summoned a rail rally and came back to outkicked BOX OF CHOCOLATES in deep stretch. BOX OF CHOCOLATES stalked four deep up the backstretch,
traveled four wide around the bend, bid outside rivals in upper stretch, carried a short lead into the furlong grounds but got outkicked by the winner in the
late stages. HEARTFULLOFSTARS broke a step slow, tracked two wide into the turn, angled out and entered the lane five wide, produced a mild rally and
bested the rest. JOE DON LOONEY forwardly placed in the early stages outside the top pair, spun three wide into the lane and flattened to fourth.
SUNRISE JOURNEY dueled for command outside the winner to the turn, cleared around the bend, showed the way two wide into the stretch, lost command
midstretch and weakened late. ZIMBA WARRIOR tossed his head leaving the gate and came away last, chased five then six wide around the turn and failed
to menace.

PERFECT ICE STORM pressed the pace from outside early, vied three wide between rivals late on the far turn, took over at the top of the stretch, held a
short lead over the runner-up through the final furlong and won the bob at the wire. SHE'S SO PRETTY chased two wide into the first turn, got floated out to
the five path around the bend, bid outside the top pair four to five wide on the far turn, pressured PERFECT ICE STORM through the lane and lost the bob.
OPERATIC rated early behind the speed in the two path, saved ground through the far turn on the inside, launched a bid from the rail at the top of the
stretch but faltered in the late stages. SONG OF FIRE pulled while taking control early near the inside then in the two path, set the pace under pressure up
the backstretch, vied with a pair of outside rivals two to three wide late on the far turn, relinquished command at the top of the stretch and weakened.
ODESSA was rank into the first turn and had to be taken off the inside around the bend, got shuffled between runners entering the far turn, lacked room

TAHOE SECRETS chased the top pair to the turn, bid three deep or four wide leaving the bend, dueled outside CONCH DADDY through the lane and
proved best in the final sixteenth. CONCH DADDY broke out, went up to duel for command from inside, vied with a pair of rivals two wide into the stretch,
battled the winner to the sixteenth pole and yielded. HIDING THE BRICK came in at the start, dueled outside a rival to the turn, vied between foes in the
three path leaving the bend, could not keep up past the quarter pole and stayed on to secure the show. KAI'S STATEMENT raced in range off the inside,
entered the turn four wide, exited three wide and could not offer the needed response. NO ICE CREAM broke slow and lost his path then came out and
bumped rival, began to climb briefly at the back and was guided out into the clear, traveled five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path and failed
to make an impact. MONGOL SONG broke slow, lost his path then got bumped from inside at the start, chased five then four wide on the turn and

Footnotes
IMPOSSIBLE TASK pressed the pace from outside, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, cleared in upper stretch and held well. HOUNDSTOOTH
bumped outer rival then took up between rivals shortly after the start, trailed near the inside then steered out on the backstretch, angled out to the five path
on the far turn, closed through the lane, drifted inward outside the sixteenth pole and could not get to the winner. EXPLOSIVE set the pace under pressure
from IMPOSSIBLE TASK to the outside, got headed by that rival past the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead late on the turn, lost contact with the
winner past the quarter pole, tipped out midstretch and kept on to secure the show. MORAWETH got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, tracked off the
inside, came three wide into the lane, drifted to the inside in the drive and lacked a bid. BUD KNIGHT chased along the inside, dropped back on the far turn
and weakened. VICENTE'S SHADOW got brushed from inside at the start, traveled three then two wide on the first turn, angled out leaving the far turn and
failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CAL dueled for command outside a rival then disposed of that one at the half-mile pole, met the challenge from MISS BAYLEE and dueled around the turn,
drifted out leaving the bend, maintained a short lead through the stretch and would not be denied. MISS BAYLEE bumped with inner rival in the early going,
chased outside rivals then bid into the turn, dueled from outside, got floated out into the stretch, kept the pressure on through the lane and faltered late.
SHEMAKESCENTS broke out and brushed rival leaving the gate, dueled briefly from inside then chased leaving the backstretch, drifted and came five wide
into the stretch and bested the rest. PIAZZETTA raced in range between rivals then off the rail leaving the backstretch, traveled outside a rival on the turn
then got floated out into the stretch and was edged for the show honors. TRULY A MESS brushed between rivals at the start, chased between foes then
tossed her head near the nine-sixteenths pole, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. PRINCESS CATERINA brushed between in the
beginning, chased along the rail through the turn and failed to menace. MIX AND MATCH threw her head and came away slow, rounded the turn four wide
and could not produce a rally. LADY SASSAFRAS bumped with outside rival then got shuffled between foes early, sat off the pace three deep leaving the
backstretch, came five wide into the drive and tired.
