FLY PATTI FLY Saved ground setting the pace under pressure and gradually increased her advantage late. CALIFORNIA HALO bobbled at the start, then
rushed up along the outside to dispute the pace into the stretch, but was unable to stay with the winner late. GOIN' COASTAL was allowed to settle in stride
while saving ground and went evenly. BOBBIE O raced two-wide and lacked a rally.

dueled for the lead throughout, could not resist the winner but continued on gamely for the place. ANTECEDENCE vied for the lead from the outset, but
wasn't quite good enough. SHEZ A GRINDER gave way early after showing speed racing three-wide.

ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL saved ground setting the pressured pace and was fully extended to prevail narrowly. LOVELY HUSSAR was never far back while
saving ground, angled out for room entering the stretch and finished strongly to just miss. SUSY'S HEART was forwardly placed from the start, came
three-wide into the stretch, but lacked a rally. FULLY COMPLIANT dropped back early, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. HER ROYAL DUCHESS
prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired after a half mile. QUICK TIME (GB) raced three-wide and gave way early.

NINE ONE ONE came in leaving the chute to bump with Forty Smooches, then saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win with something left.
MARCH ON LINCH unhurried early, rallied along the inside on the turn and finished well for the place. FORTY SMOOCHES was bumped by the winner
leaving the chute and steadied, then settled into stride, angled out to offer a bid entering the stretch but was unable to sustain the rally. ETHAN'S ANIMAL
was prominent early from along the outside and tired. HARBOR OUTLAW pressed the pace from along the outside to the stretch and gave way. TIG broke
thru the gate during the loading, then was reloaded, showed brief speed from along the outside, stopped and was eased in the late stages. The trainer of
Forty Smooches lodged an objection against the winner, but after viewing the films the stewards made no change in the order of finish.
