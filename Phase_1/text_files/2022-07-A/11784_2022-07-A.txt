Footnotes
RANCH WATER broke a step slow, raced back early as a result, moved off the inside, swung five wide exiting the turn when beginning to advance, briskly
roused with a repeated left handed crop when rallying, finished up willingly to collar the leader late and win going away. CUSTOMIZED SPACE broke back,
moved up quickly to clear before a furlong while in hand, expanded that advantage through the turn, continued to hold a comfortable advantage past the
furlong marker while still under a hand ride, proved no match for the winner late, clear rest. GOBOT balked a bit at loading, raced in the main group early in
the two path, dropped to the inside to save ground into the stretch, well clear of the others while not a serious threat to the top two. COLT'S BRIM lacked
speed, continued to trail through the turn, improved position up the inside, not a serious threat. TUCKER THE GRUMP broke through the gate prior to the
start, reluctant to reload, broke well, relinquished the advantage to the leader soon after, chased that one through the turn, weakened in the drive. PAYOFF
CYCLE broke back, lodged an early move to race in the second flight while three wide midway on the turn, flattened out in the drive. RACY BILLE in the
second flight for three furlongs off the inside, began to give way when in traffic turning for home, continued to fade.

ADIEU LE CHAT back off the pace and the inside, asked along midway on the turn, fanned five wide into the lane, bid when straightened for home, clear
past the furlong marker, responded when confronted by the runner up late inside that one, displayed good mettle to prevail late. MUCHO VELOCE broke
back, remained well off the pace for five furlongs, three wide late in the turn, steered out to be five wide for the drive, late bid outside the winner, denied.
NATE'S REVENGE last to leave, lacked any speed for a half inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, altered course to the outside nearing the
sixteenth pole, displayed some late interest to be in time for the show, not a threat to the winner. CHAPEL OF DREAMS in the second flight for a half while
three wide, moved closer in the four path between foes and inside the winner exiting the turn, chased that one past the furlong marker, flattened out and
was caught late for the show. MR. SNOWFLAKE in the second flight while racing in the two path, came up empty for the drive. BIG RESULTS forwardly
placed while racing on the outside up the backstretch, dueled turn, three wide into the lane, gave way. JUST PLAIN MAD sprinted clear out of the chute,
dueled toward the inside turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MYDEALOFTHEDAY away in good order, took over from the outside before a furlong, cleared before a quarter, cruised home through the stretch under
token pressure to win ridden out. APRIORITY MAGIC last away, fell further back into the turn, saved ground through the bend and into the stretch, rallied up
the rail to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. JUST A WIN void of speed off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, roused, rallied through
traffic to finish up willingly and earn the show while to late for the runner up. CALL ME DARLIN chased the winner for three furlong from the outside, had
little left in tiring through the stretch. COSMIC BELLE in the second group off the inside, four wide entering the stretch, came up empty for the run to the
wire. ROSEISALWAYSRITE forwardly placed, weakened gradually through the stretch. GOOD GIRL SHORTY was finished after three furlongs.
POSEIDON'S QUEEN fell back after the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LAURI'S WISH broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, dueled in the two path into the turn, shook off that rival to be clear into the lane, slight drift,
maintained daylight while being kept to task. LEROY JENKINS outrun for a half in trailing, eased out and was four wide and between horses into the stretch,
proved determined after a long drive for the place, no match for the winner. FLAT OUT AMERICAN last to leave, moved up to race closest to the dueling
leaders, three path into the stretch, dropped to the inside past the furlong marker, finished up evenly to earn part of the show. WOODS N WATER off the
pace for five furlongs inside, moved out a bit into the lane, lugged in nearing midstretch, floated in by FLAT OUT AMERICAN with a sixteenth remaining and
finished on equal terms with that one while along the rail at the wire. INDEFENSIBLE bobbled slightly at the start, lacked speed, was floated out to be five
wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL moved up steadily the opening furlong to duel inside the winner, gave way late
in the turn, continued to falter through the stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
RIGHTANDJUST broke alertly, with the pace three wide into the first turn, dueled while continuing off the inside up the backstretch and into the far turn,
began to edge away late in the turn, clear past the furlong marker, enough left to narrowly hold off the runner up. STRONG EAGLE broke with the two early
leaders, fell in behind that pair into the first turn, continued to track those two while saving ground the middle half mile, steered out three wide turning for
home, slowly but steadily made progress on the winner late to narrowly miss. BEHEMAH STAR last away, lacked speed toward but not on the rail, improved
while continuing in the two path second turn, continued to make progress on the top two through the lane, clearly best of the others. VODKA GIMLET broke
toward the front, tracked the first flight in the two path, was three wide exiting the final turn, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly. PIPES AND DRUMS
in the main body into the first turn, closer from between foes before a half, had little left for the stretch run. SHIPPINGPORT broke on top, dueled inside the
winner, held a narrow advantage far turn, first to give way of that pair turning for home while continuing inside. CITY PARK raced in mid pack and three
wide, failed to muster a rally. NATE'S ATTACK broke back, trailed most of the way and was never involved. FREEDOM FACTOR four wide when well off
the pace into the first turn, remained back to be always outrun.

Footnotes
KNIGHTS SWORD away in good order, cleared to the inside, shrugged off a couple of foes entering the stretch, clear again, held sway late. BECCA'S
BOUQUET moved the inside to race closest to the winner up the backstretch, moved closer with a quarter remaining, fell back off that one when
straightened for home, trying to come back on that rival late. TENSAS VIRGINIA within striking position up the backstretch, shuffled back in some traffic into
the turn, moved out, came four wide for the drive, finished up best of the others. KLEINMEISTER broke back, trailed early, saved ground through the turn,
improved slightly while not a serious threat. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH broke well, forwardly placed early outside, three wide turn, tired in the drive.
ARKANSAS BLING finished early while outside.
