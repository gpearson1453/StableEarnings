Footnotes
MACHOS VISION was away in good order and got the lead and the rail shortly after the start had the inside trip on the turn and steadily drew clear down the
lane for the win. PRINCESS SHAKIRA was in contention from the outset while racing outside the winner could never get by that rival while clearly second
best. OVER EXPOSED was four wide the entire race and drifted out some down the lane and made a mild bid to nail down the show while never a threat to
the top two. T. P. RIGHT LANE raced three wide the entire race while just off the pace dropped back some in the lane and was not a factor late. EPSOM
IMP raced along the inside while just off the pace but had nothing to offer in the stretch. OKIE PRINCESS was away best and was quickly passed had a
perfect rail trip but steadily faded. GIVE EM FITZ was in the back of the pack from the outset and never was a serious factor in the race.

Footnotes
MOONFIELD was quickest from the blocks and opened a long lead up the backstretch took a breather into the turn and had plenty left to maintian the
margin down the stretch under mild urging. POCO SUENOS chased in the leader in the two path into the turn but could never cut into the margin while
clearly second best. BEHOLD THAT WORD was well off the pace along the inside remained on the rail to the head of the lane then angled out for the drive
and finished well for third. DABBLIN CHANNEL was closest to the leader for the first quarter along the inside and then faded going into the turn. SNICKEL
TE raced mid pack in the two path up the backstretch and into the turn while midpack and never mounted a rally in the stretch. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS
was away a step slow to trail in the early stages moved up three wide up the backstretch and then tired into the turn. SOJOURNER TRUTH was always well
back and never a serious contender.

lead in the final sixteenth to earn the win. UNPLUCKED GEM raced up close to the pace in the two path in the turn finished well but could not match strides
with the winner through the stretch. PICTORIAL was away very slow spotting the field five lengths made a three wide bid up the backstretch and made the
lead and the rail into the turn had a good lead through the stretch but tired in the final sixteenth. MISS IZZY BEE showed good early speed on the inside
faded while drifting out through the stretch. WHO B DAT raced along the inside in the back of the pack early stayed along the rail and made a mild bid on
the turn while never a serious threat. HURRICANE FLORENCE raced in the two path for much of the race and never mounted a rally. TAP THE HEART
