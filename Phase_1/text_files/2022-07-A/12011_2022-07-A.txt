Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER allowed the two leaders to go early off the inside, advanced with a push button move three wide to challenge turning for home,
dueled upper stretch outside the runner up, edged clear of that one the final furlong under steady handling. WAR SONG broke well, dueled up front in the
two path, narrowly showed the way out of the turn as the winner was moving to challenged, gave ground grudgingly to that rival to the wire. I'LL RAISE YOU
away in good order, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, dueled through the bend then began to give way when the real running
began entering the stretch. MAKATI PHIL fell back to trail soon after the start, fell further and further behind, jogged in after losing contact with the field
through the stretch.

Footnotes
KIND WAYS sprinted clear into the first turn, set a relaxed pace under a loose hold in the run up the backstretch, called on for some run when confronted
entering the stretch, found more late to hold the runner up at bay late while drifting out slightly. SPELLBINDING last away, lacked speed while off the inside,
came in the four path when moving closer turning for home, tried the winner from the outside soon after, long drive to the wire, denied. MI LIA chased the
winner while along the inside, crept a bit closer turning for home while continuing along the rail, had little for the top two in the run to the wire. CRIMSON
FELINE in the second flight while racing outside, lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
QUANA DUDE in the main body early outside, ranged up three wide to mount a challenge turning for home, put a head in front entering the stretch, drew
well clear through the lane under steady handling. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER last away to race well back early, swung out four wide when beginning to
advance late in the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be up in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. MARVELOUS RED broke alertly,
showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, offered but brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch to prove no match for that one, nipped in
the waning strides for the second spot. ARGYBARGY BUCK in the second flight while along the inside, covered up while continuing along the rail turn,
steered out three wide when straightened for home, lacked serious late punch, not enough for the runner up position. NOCOMET in the second flight early
toward the inside, shuffled back a bit with five furlongs to run, moved out, three wide into the lane, came up empty for the run to the wire. FULL POWER
within striking distance for a half, had little left for the stretch run. ONE PROUD BOY broke back, was finished early and was well beaten.

Footnotes
G'WILDCAT brushed slight bother when the runner up broke out, came in soon after to bother that same rival slightly, settled closest to the leader off the
inside, took over from that one turning for home, steadily increased advantage to the wire under a firm hand ride. FOOLISH DREAMS broke out, was
straightened and bothered ever so slightly by the winner soon after, moved outside, came three wide when roused for the drive, could do little with that one
late, clearly second best. ORDER UP back off the pace while racing outside, came in the two path for the drive, moved out slightly then showed a mild
amount of late interest to pick off a single tiring rivals. YOUNG TUSCAN broke sharp, set the pace inside, faltered when headed by the winner entering the
stretch, continued to tire to the wire. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LAKE RUNNER off slowly, lagged well back early inside, continued to save some ground when beginning to advance turn, steered out widest for the drive,
challenged widest of all a furlong out, drove clear. LA JAZZ with the pace from the start, vied between horses through the turn, continued to contest the
issue past the furlong marker, came back for the place while not a threat to the winner. CONSERVATVE VALUES pressed the issue from the outside, vied
three wide through the turn, held a narrow advantage, with a furlong to run, weakened, saved the show. MISS MIRACLE GIRL with the pace along the
inside, continued with the lead pack into the stretch, gradually weakened, not enough for the show. CUSTOM MADE chased the lead pack while off the
inside for a half, four wide into the lane, failed to mount a meaningful response in the stretch. CORBIN'S WILD ACES broke back, was never a factor to be
well beaten. ABIGAIL G finished early, fell far back, eased under wire, walked off. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION. RACE WAS RUN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY DUE TO TOTE MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LADY CHURCHILL away well, closest to leader, moved up to duel two path, shook off the other speed into the stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage
to the wire under a brisk hand ride. STARSHIP NOLA in the second flight while racing off the inside, continued to pursue the two leaders into the lane while
three wide, no match for the winner, just up in the final stride to gain the place. MYLIES STAR away best of all, showed the way through the first turn,
dueled the middle half mile closest to the rail and inside the winner, could not match that one through the stretch, nipped late for the second spot. WORLD
OF HURT lacked speed, staged a mild middle move then failed to sustain that advance stretch. MISS BARETA off a step slow, settled in mid pack and
failed to rally. THE CALLING STONE broke awkwardly to spot the field a couple of lengths and failed to menace. BARRANCA forwardly placed, finished
before a half, trailed home far back. RACE WAS RUN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY DUE TO TOTE MALFUNCTION.

GET THEM JUSTIN in mid pack while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, closer when four wide again in the second bend, challenged in upper
stretch, spirited duel to the wire, floated out, brushed with the runner up, proved game late to gain the nod. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE forwardly placed from the
start, closer bid 2nd turn, showed the way into the stretch, hooked up with the winner soon after, floated out that rival then brushed that same foe,
outfinished in the late going, clearly second best. ALIGNED INTEREST in the main body inside, in the two path second turn and between horses, dropped
to the inside with less that a furlong remaining, up late for the show. DREWHUSTLE behind the pace and off the inside, crept a bit closer three wide turning
into the stretch, lacked a further response and was outkicked for the show late. FORESTDUNGONE broke on top set a clear pace for five furlongs,
weakened when headed by the winner midway on the second bend. STANDING MAN back off the pace, went evenly with a three wide trip in failing to
menace. EVERLOVINGHAND broke back, void of speed, was five wide into the lane, lacked a meaningful closing response. PINCH ASSAULT off slow,
remained back and was never involved. VENN broke back, fanned six wide into the lane, failed to muster a closing kick as well. MAGAWILDTIME forwardly
placed early, began a steady retreat before a half. RACE WAS RUN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY DUE TO TOTE MALFUNCTION.

PEPPER POINT with the leaders from the start inside, dueled through the turn while remaining closest to the rail, disposed of the remaining speed entering
the stretch and remained clear to the wire under steady pressure. GRACE'S VISION lacked speed off the inside, came four wide out of the turn when being
put to task, rallied to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. D'LADY FIRED UP with leaders up the backstretch while between rivals, fell
back off that pair through the turn, went evenly through the lane, finished up best of the rest. GOODBYE ROSIE last away, raced back in lacking speed,
improved position without posing a serious threat. FLYING I broke sharp, dueled turn in the two path outside the winner, gave way in the stretch.
BISTINEAU BELLE in mid pack for three furlongs, had little left late. COURT IN SESSION broke well, fell back immediately to trail, never a factor. RACE
