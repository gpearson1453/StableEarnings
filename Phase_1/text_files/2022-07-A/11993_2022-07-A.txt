Footnotes
GOLDEN EFFECT raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path approaching the quarter pole, took command quickly and drew off to the wire. BEASTIE GIRL saved ground around the first turn, raced off
the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, shifted to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground in late stretch.
PENSIVELY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. WI
FI raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch
while finishing evenly. SAIGON bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch
on the outside, continued around the far turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening. CAST NO STONES bumped
with the horse to her outside at the break, trailed the field in the four path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the
two path and was empty from there. QUEEN OF CLASS was sent to an early lead while racing in the two path through the opening quarter of a mile,
opened up on the field coming up the backstretch and around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch and tired to the wire. ISOLA raced in the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
REYNA DE VERANO raced from off the pace in the two path, made progress while under a loose reign down the backstretch, bid two wide rounding the far
turn, and was much the best. BARREL OF BLISS set the pace from inside, yielded to the winner in upper stretch, but held on for place. BYEGONE DAYS
trailed along the inside, was short room heading into the stretch, and rallied up the inside to show. RUNNING ON ENTRY was unhhuried from inside, was
hustled two wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. BIONDA SUPRISE raced well back and two wide, was driven along while three wide into the stretch,
but flattened. FASHION ICON rated from three wide, was cued from the seven path at the top of the lane, but was tired. SAYOH chased between rivals, was
ridden five wide at the top of the stretch, but was empty. V K STAR prompted the pace in the three path, was ridden while continuing to race in the three
path at the top of the lane, but was no threat. EPHEMERAL stalked inside but backed out around the far turn. BRASS BAND pressed two wide but faded
rounding the far turn.
