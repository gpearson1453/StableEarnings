rallied. ELUSIVE RYDER pressed from two path, made a bid while continuing to race two wide rounding the far turn, opened up at top of the stretch, but
was caught late. NANA'S SHOES rated from the inside, made progress while tipping into the five path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly to show.
VIKING QUEEN set the pace, was coaxed from the two path rounding the far turn, and was outrun between foes in the stretch. HETTY G. tracked from the
three path but was empty in the stretch. SING ALONG SUZY stalked inside but backed out rounding the far turn.

NO CENTS stalked while four wide, took the lead rounding the far turn, shifted in to the two path at the top of the lane, but was tired late. GREELEY AND
BEN set the pace from inside, was roused while saving ground around the turn, tipped into the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on. FULL
AUTHORITY tracked in the two path, was ridden three wide at the top of the stretch, but flattened. HOPEFUL TREASURE pressed from the two path but

SPARKLE BLUE tracked two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, drifted in upper stretch to bump with TASWEYA passing the sixteenth pole, and held
gamely. TASWEYA set a loose lead, was roused saving ground around the far turn, gradually shifted out in upper stretch, bumped with SPARKLE BLUE
passing the sixteenth pole, and yielded grudgingly in the final strides. LAY THE GROUNDWORK raced in mid pack from the inside, was hustled along while
drifting into the center of the course at the top of the stretch, and ran on. SHAD NATION rated from the inside, saved ground while driven along around the
far turn, and stayed on. GIZALA (IRE) trailed while two wide, was cued from four wide at the top of the lane, but was no threat. CENTER STAGE stalked
from inside, was ridden between in upper stretch, was squeezed out of it and steadied passing the eighth pole, but faded. SAUCY LADY T was unhurried
and two wide, was floated out to the seven path and checked slightly at the top of the lane, but was no factor. THERE WAS A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE
RIDERS OF Saucy Lady T AND Gizala (IRE) AGAINST THE RIDER OF Lay the GroundworK FOR DRIFTING OUT AND CARRYING THEM OUT

held gamely. SHOTGUN HOTTIE raced from well back and in the three path, was driven three wide around the far turn, made a bid from the four path in
upper stretch, but hung to place. MORNING MATCHA was squeezed at the start to trail, floated into the six path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly to
show. REPUBLIQUE stalked from inside, was hustled two wide around the far turn, but flattened. SANDSTONE rated inside, raced wide into the stretch and
never threatened. UNADULTERATED led from two wide, opened up down the backstretch, but backed out coming into the stretch. CHARDONNAY
prompted the pace from inside early, but dropped out into the far turn. THERE WAS AN OBJECTION LODGED IN THIS RACE WHERE THE RIDER OF
