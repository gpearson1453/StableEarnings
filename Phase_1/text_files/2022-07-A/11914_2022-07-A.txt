was coaxed from the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on for show. ZEN PI chased from the two path, tipped four into the path at the top of the
stretch, and finished evenly. LITTLEBITAMEDAL tracked between rivals, was ridden from the four path rounding the turn, floated into the six path in upper

Footnotes
CHICKIENESS stalked from the three path, was coaxed racing from the four path coming into the stretch, and drew clear. ALL ABOUT ME set the pace
from inside, tipped into the two path at the top of the lane, and held place. STEPHANIE MY LOVE tracked from inside, was roused inside around the turn,
tipped into the three path in upper stretch, and ran on. BAYLIS STREET chased while two wide, was ridden in the two path rounding the turn, but flattened.
FANCEE GRACE C bobbled at the start, trailed from the three path and was no threat. PHARIBE tracked five wide but faded coming into the stretch.
ISTRIA was well back and never a factor. TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK rated three wide, drifted in and clipped heels to lose the rider into the turn. AN
INQUIRY WAS HELD REGARDING TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK LOSING THE RIDER INTO THE TURN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO
FOUL SO NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE stalked from the three path, ranged up three wide approching the far turn, took over mid way around the far turn, and opened up to win
impressively. BATTLE BLING trailed early, made progress from the three path down the backside, tipped into the five path in upper stretch, and held place.
TONAL VISION tracked inside, was ridden from the inside rounding the far turn, and ran on for show. BEES AND HONEY pressed while two wide, floated
into the four path coming into the stretch, but was tired. ONYX raced well back from inside, drifted into the seven path coming into the stretch, but was
empty. LET'S CRUISE set the pace from the two path but faded rounding the far turn. MICROCAP stumbled at the start, rated in the two path but was done
early.
