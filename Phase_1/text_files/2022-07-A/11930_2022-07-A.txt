VEGAS GUY vied for the lead from the three path then took the lead at the quarter pole and held sway. AFRICAN WARRIOR chased the leaders from the
three path around the turn and closed willingly. MARKETBOOK raced in the middle of the pack and made a late gain. CLERIC raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside made a late rail bid to improve position. ON TILT tracked the leaders from the inside and faded. DIXIELAND MUSIC hopped at the start
and broke to the outside and was never a threat. TOOL BOX was restless in the gate then sprinted to the lead around the turn and gave way in the final
eighth. CANDY SHOPPER showed little.
