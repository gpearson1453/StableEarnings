DOMINEERING broke out and bumped KHOSEA at the start, was pulling hard inside through the opening quarter, angled out three wide late on the first
turn, advanced between foes down the backstretch, tipped four wide entering the far turn, advanced outside, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a
drive. KHOSEA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide, shifted widest in upper stretch and ran on for the place. EMMA AND I set
the pace along the rail, could not keep pace around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and kept on to regain the show. SERENADE A KITTEN settled
off the early pace while racing two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane.
ISADORABLE AIDA pressed the pace two wide, dueled between down the backstretch and around the far turn then tired in the drive.

MAILBOX MONEY set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. BANKER'S HOURS chased the winner two wide, was no match for that foe but
stayed on for the place. FULL OF MISCHIEF raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS steadied early,
chased the pace four wide, bumped with SMALL REASON near the sixteenth pole and faded. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED bumped with SMALL REASON at
the start, raced four wide and never threatened. SMALL REASON was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide turning for home,
continued on the left lead and was bumped near the sixteenth pole. JOYFUL SURPRISE pressed the winner three wide and tired in the lane. SI COMO NO
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BACH played no factor while racing five wide. AWESOME PUDDING had speed between foes, steadied
early, steadied nearing the turn, chased inside around the turn, steadied again midway around the bend and retreated.

Footnotes
VENEZUELANDREAMERS was in range three wide, found clear sailing in upper stretch, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. THE
BEAST dueled two wide between foes, could not hold off the winner leaving the eighth pole but stayed on well to hold the place. PIPITO stalked the pace
two wide, was in tight quarters between foes through much of the stretch and gained the show late. SENOR GEE pressed the pace three wide, took the lead
leaving the quarter pole, battled to midstretch and weakened. EL ROSILLO failed to menace while racing two wide. ROCK SOLID WORDS chased the pace
four wide and lacked a closing bid. DANLEY played no factor while racing five wide. GO CRISTIAN saved ground well back, angled three wide near the
quarter pole and lacked a rally. SHEA D CAPTURE made little impact while racing two wide. UNIQUE TIME was fractious in the gate, was rank down the
backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and retreated. COLORS set the early pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole. WILDCAT
ECHO was outrun inside.
