INSIDE RISK was bumped leaving the gate and raced well back from early contention, started a bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn in the six and
seven paths then closed widest to get up the final stride. NEWS FLASH chased the early pace outside, raced close three wide on the turn, drifted leaving
the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead later yards but was nipped under the wire. LANTAU was hustled to the lead inside approaching the three eighths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was caught in later yards and flattened toward the wire. GOLDEN G chased through the backstretch, ran
near the rail on the turn, angled six wide toward the head of the lane and finished well. MISCHIEVOUS JESSE broke outward and made contact with MR
TINGLES then pressured the pace to the head of the lane, though, flattened later yards. The latter was bumped leaving the gate, engaged in close early
chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened inside the eighth pole. IMPETUOUS broke outward and made contact with Inside Risk then
engaged in close early chase, ran at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane.

CRUZ IN THE CASTLE stalked the early pace off the rail then threatened into the backstretch, dueled clear toward the quarter pole, was met into the lane
but dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over Tough One, then I B NASTY in later yards, while the latter, settled back in the two and three paths
the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased to the four path leaving the turn and dug in to take second later
yards. TOUGH ONE angled to the inside and rated the early pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled close from that point, dropped back at the
quarter pole, eased out and recovered even terms into the lane but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground on the first
turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased outward later yards but flattened nearing the wire. COLOROFACLOUD
exchanged contact with Whose That Lady leaving the gate then stalked in the three path leaving the first turn, picked up the chase past the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, was carried outward into the lane and flattened stride. HIDDEN PERSUASION rounded the first turn in the
three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. WHOSE THAT LADY exchanged contact with Colorofacloud leaving the gate then
saved ground racing well back. CASTLE OF CAYLEE rated close inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the
backstretch.

MY SACRED PLACE came through the first turn in the three path then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn in the five path, dug in widest leaving the turn and got up the final yards. JUNGLE WARRIOR stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
ran in the three path of the far turn, dueled through late stretch for second but was outfinished for the win. BETTER BOOGIE angled to the inside and rated
the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn but was caught flattening stride later yards. DYNAMIC
DAY saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and raced evenly in the lane. BRIAN'S
AVENUE rounded the opening turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, chased nearing the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back midway
on the far turn and weakened in the lane. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME saved ground.

Footnotes
MAE SAI PRINCESS became a bit anxious in the gate then stalked on the first turn, took the lead at the half mile pole and drew clear toward the five
sixteenths, came under pressure into the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. FLOATING BY saved early ground well off the pace, picked up
the chase leaving the half mile pole, steadily progressed through the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in from the top of the
lane to take second the final stride. SECRET CASTLE saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn off the rail, was steadily handled leaving the turn then nipped from second under the wire. DUSTWHIRL WONDER settled off the pace about the
three path, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn, left the turn widest and finished well. TAKE ME HOME raced off
the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened into the lane.
NANCYSAIDSO took the lead at the rail into the first turn, was met into the backstretch and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back
toward the five sixteenths and faded readily at the rail on the far turn. FRENCH NOUGET was not a factor.
