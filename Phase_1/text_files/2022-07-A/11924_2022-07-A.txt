Footnotes
WIDGET FACTORY closed to the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, cleared rivals approaching the quarter pole, widened at the
rail toward the top of the lane and was hand ridden to the finish. MY CANDY BIZ chased through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the turn then dueled the
final furlong for second. SCOTTY SILVER chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path then dug in to take third later yards while gaining on the
runner-up. SOMERSET BAY engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened the final sixteenth. VIDMER'S COURAGE
gave distant early chase inside, entered the turn near the rail but angled widest through the turn and passed rivals in the lane. I'D LIKE TO KNOW gave
chase, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little more. WILLIE THE WHALE was not a factor. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS pressured the pace
through the backstretch but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened off the rail on the turn.

SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and had the lead past the pole, ran clear at the five
sixteenths, widened on the far turn and was kept alert through the stretch. VOLTAMOUR was jostled early then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and got up for second under the wire. INTERNET OF THINGS raced off the pace from the seven eighths pole,
started a bid toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn off the rail, flattened in the lane and was nipped from second under the wire. AUTS
REVOLUTION raced with the pace off the rail, took the lead leaving the five eighths pole, was pressured past the seven sixteenths, gave up the lead at the
three eighths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. ALPHA QUEUE raced with the pace inside but dropped back on the second turn and faded through
the backstretch. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME raced off the pace about the four path and showed little response.

dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. COASTAL CHAOS settled off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch and

yards. ANAHEIM rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane.
