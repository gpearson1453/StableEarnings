factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was hustled early and roused from the
inside on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. SNELL FLICKA set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but failed to hold.
MARTINI SUE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick. STORMY SUZIE was well back and showed little in a dull effort.
ROSIEJEWEL DANCER stalked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.
