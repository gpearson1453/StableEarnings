CHOCOLATE PHILLING tracked the pace, angled out to bid between rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. OLD
FORTY FIVE well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, then was no match for the winner and
closed for the place. HUNTIN' THE RUT set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show.
OLE G MAN stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then drifted in and
weakened. TIZ SNOW allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled widest for clear racing
room and missed gaining a share. RICHARD HOOTY ran evenly.

Footnotes
ROUGH NIGHT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the second turn, then lasted under steady pressure. ZERO GRAVITY tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late.
INCLUSIVE four wide through the first turn, moved to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out the final
furlong. RONALD R (IRE) unsettled in the gate, was unprepared at the start, saved ground through the turns, racing boxed through the second turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled widest for clear racing room and evened out. AULT well placed, moved to position into the second turn,
looped three wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and had no rally. CLAW rated outside, held position on the two path through the second
turn, then faded into the stretch.

SUNSET well placed, held position three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and evened out. COURTED tracked the pace, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. PRINCESS TINE (FR) well placed, lost some ground
on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER set the pace on the inside, stayed on when
challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. GUCCI GAL never far back, gained position four wide through the turn, bid on that path and faded
in the stretch. SHIPMANS MAGIC dwelt at the start and was never involved. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
