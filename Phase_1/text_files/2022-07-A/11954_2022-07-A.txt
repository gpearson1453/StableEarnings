Footnotes
STEEL PIER raced off the pace with an inside trip, moved up inside on the turn, waited for room, angled out in upper stretch, closed willingly outside and
drew clear. CHANGING THE KARMA raced off the pace, three wide on the backside, dropped back entering the far turn, then rallied late outside for second.
WINSOR MANOR vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and earned the show spot. CASSATION pulled and
was steadied in the early stages, tracked the pace on the inside, then two wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole and was outkicked. HELLO POP was
reluctant loading, vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in and weakened late. IRISH BOOLUM raced off the pace inside, then between
rivals and lacked a rally. FOREVER CHOCOLATE raced off the rail, off the pace, steadied at the five sixteenths and did not factor.

Footnotes
HE'SPUREGOLD settled comfortably off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, closed willingly, swept by the
pacesetter and pulled away. GOLDEN BROWN raced off the pace inside, moved up four wide midway on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and
got up at the wire for the place spot. THERE ARE NO WORDS set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch,
was no match for the winner and lost second in the final jump. STEFANO raced off the pace, off the rail, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly
inside. LEO MONTE tracked on the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, chased and tired. PASSPORT was reluctant loading, raced off the pace inside
and had no rally. OPTIC WAY stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and faded. OHANA EMPIRE raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and
did not factor. QUIBERON BAY raced two wide off the pace and gave way.
