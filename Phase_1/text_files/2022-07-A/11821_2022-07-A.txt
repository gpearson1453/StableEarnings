Footnotes
QUIET CHARM was off half a step slowly and was hustled to show early speed, set quick fractions while on a clear lead through the turn, extended the lead
in upper stretch and was kept to task in the end. TEXAS LONHRO broke out and squeezed SONORA SERMON at the start, chased the quick early pace,
ran evenly through the turn, gave ground to the winner in upper stretch, was able to close in the final furlong but could not reel in the winner and was second
best. HE BE MOJO RISIN chased the quick pace outside of rivals, went four wide into the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not impact the top
two in the end but was clear for third. CASH LIMIT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a threat. SONORA SERMON stumbled
at the start then was pinballed soon after the break, chased the pace through the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and was not a late factor.

CHANCERY WAY broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions while prompted through the turn, extended the lead to be clear in upper
stretch, pulled away in the final furlong and was hand ridden to the wire. HAPPY IS was asked to show early speed and stalked the quick fractions through
the turn, gave ground to the winner in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and just held for second. CODE RIBBON bobbled at the start and was off
slowly, lacked early speed, improved position on the turn while outside of rivals, was outkicked in upper stretch, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-pole and
just missed for second while holding safely for third. MISS UNION bobbled at the start, chased the pace to the turn, advanced along the rail nearing the
quarter pole, ran evenly to the stretch run and weakened in the final furlong. DERRYGOOLIN chased the early pace, was outrun on the turn and was not a
factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ARISTEIA was in tight leaving the break, settled off of the quick early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, overtook GOLD RUSH GAL
nearing the head of the lane, took a clear lead into upper stretch and was ridden out in the late stages. PARTY SPIRIT (GB) was unhurried early on, saved
ground into the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid leaving the far turn, was no match for the winner in the late stages but kept on to get up for second.
GOLD RUSH GAL was hustled leaving the break and engaged with BLUEBERRY MUFFIN on the first turn and dueled with that rival while setting quick
fractions through the backstretch run, took a narrow lead along the second turn, was overtaken by the winner nearing the top of the lane, weakened in the
drive but stayed on to be an easy third. CHULA GIRL tracked the quick pace, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the
stretch and tired in the final stages. FRONT OF LINE (GB) tracked the quick pace while three wide through the backstretch run, gained ground along the
second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave out in the final furlong. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly and was sent to contest the early pace,
dueled with GOLD RUSH GAL through the backstretch run while carving out quick fractions, stopped heading into the second turn, was eased through the
stretch run and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
HAY JUAN was hustled leaving the break and sped to a clear lead into the turn, set moderate fractions into the stretch run, maintained a clear lead through
the drive and held sway in the final stages. ROISTER broke alertly, tracked the pace through the turn, was not able to close into the winner's margin in the
drive but held for the place. SENOR DEL CAMPO was taken outside of rivals in the early going and lacked early speed to the turn, improved position on the
turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, ran evenly through the drive and was outfinished, while clear of the rest for third. EL TENAMPA chased
the early pace, lost position on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch run. ANNIE'S CHIEF chased the early pace, gained ground while along the rail
on the turn, could not sustain that bid and weakened in the stretch run. SPLIT ACES chased the early pace, lost ground while four wide on the turn, was
outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

OFFSHORE AFFAIR was sent in hand to the front after an alert start, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, quickened when challenged on
the far turn and extended the lead in upper stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth and gamely held on for the win in a blanket finish. BLACK CASPIAN
(IRE) was forwardly placed into the first turn, came four wide into the backstretch run and advanced nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground nearing the
quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final furlong, confronted OFFSHORE AFFAIR inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the
win, while earning the nod for second. HONOS MAN was crowded a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, was content to settle in the early stages, came
four wide into the backstretch run, made a four wide advance on the far turn, mounted a five wide rally into the drive, closed fast outside of rivals in the final
furlong, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for third. TABLE FOR TEN settled three
wide off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, continued that rally on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in
the final furlong. GOVENOR'S PARTY showed early speed and attended to the pace on the first turn, lost position on the backstretch run, was put to a drive
on the second turn and came up empty in the stretch run. AUTISMS WORLD was forwardly placed early on and stalked the pace from a three wide path,
advanced on the backstretch run, maintained position through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. SHOT OF A
LIFETIME settled just off of the pace while running in midpack, lost position along the backstretch run, went three wide into the second turn and did not
mount a late rally. HAPI HAPI bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, came two then four wide entering the drive and could
not find the needed late response.

I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was hustled leaving the break and tracked the solid fractions through the first half-mile, confronted the pacesetter nearing the
quarter pole, took command into the drive, was headed by MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH in deep stretch and came again to repel that effort and edged away in
the end in a game win. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH showed early speed and stalked the pace while four wide on the first turn, gained ground on the backstretch
run, made a three wide move nearing the quarter pole, lost a bit of ground to the winner in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, headed
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY nearing the sixteenth-marker and was repelled by the game winner in the end, while holding safely for the place. AMERICAN
FARMER settled three wide off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
gained on the top two in the final furlong but could not reel them in and held safely for third in the end. TOM'S SURPRISE settled off of the pace while racing
in the second flight, lost position on the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final
furlong. MEMO DADDY (CHI) was off a step slowly but recovered to stalk the pace on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost
ground on the second turn and weakened in the final stages. MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke in a bit at the start and crowded JUNGLE CRY, was sent to the
early lead, set reasonable fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted along the second turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and gave
way in the final furlong. BOTTLE OF SMOKE settled off of the pace and came four then five wide along the first turn, improved position on the backstretch
run, dropped back on the second turn and lacked a late response. JUNGLE CRY was crowded at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, lagged
through the backstretch run and into the second turn, stumbled at the top of the lane, unseated the rider and walked off under his own power. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING #1 JUNGLE CRY AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED
HIS OWN ISSUES IN THE INCIDENT AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ROBIE broke well, settled into a stalking position while racing in the four-path, made a strong bid on the turn in an attempt to catch ROBIE, saw that one slip
away turning for home but persevered and wore his rival down in the last jumps. LEMON ZINGER fastest from the gate, rated kindly to the far turn,
quickened a bit leaving the half mile marker, opened a clear lead in the stretch, drifted a bit in the late stages and just failed to last in a game effort.
HARBOR SKY raced in the second flight in the early stages, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, improved position while four wide on the second
turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but closed well in the final furlong to be clear for third. SALTO DE TIGRE bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly,
was unhurried in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, ran evenly through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch, closed
in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response. BARHOPSKY away last, remained in the rear of the field to the far turn, was asked to pick it up
entering the far turn but couldn't mount a bid and only passed a couple of tiring horses in the stretch while well behind the rest of the field.
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE was keen to go from the gate and forced her rider to take a wide path through the first turn and down the backstretch, made a
mild bid on the far turn but flattened out turning for home. WILL IS CHILL broke out at the start, then was hustled to be part of the early pace, settling into a
tracking position to the outside of LEMON ZINGER, tracked that pacesetter into the far turn then suddenly tired at the three furlong marker and dropped
back through the field.
