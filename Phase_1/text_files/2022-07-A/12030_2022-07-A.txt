Footnotes
THINK BLUE bumped with DIAMOND GUCCI at the break, soon had the lead then the inside entering the first turn, showed the way in hand, was let out
some on the second bend, roused with two furlongs to go and steadily drew away with slight hand urging through the stretch. RONAN was kept close just off
or along the rail, took over second entering the lane then drew off for the place through the stretch. IMAGINE GOLD angled out four wide on the
backstretch, lost ground staying in that path taking the second bend, gained third upper stretch then could only hold her position late. SUPERTRIX vied for
the lead between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide on the second turn and flattened out for the stretch run. DIAMOND GUCCI bumped
with THINK BLUE at the start, advanced between rivals on the backstretch, was three wide through the second bend then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
RAZ COUNTRY a step slow at the break, was boxed in early, got through from outside nearing the turn, was five then six wide taking the bend, all out in the
stretch and got up in time. TRUIST waited for room on the turn, got through two wide upper stretch, lugged to the rail near the eighth pole, took the
advantage approaching the final sixteenth then was outfinished in a game effort. LUKE ATTACK prominent from the beginning, went for the lead three wide
on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, fought for the lead but did not have enough left in the waning yards. DIAMND CON SUERTE fractious in
the gate, was settled outside on the backstretch, angled in to be just off the rail on the bend, swung out to path five for the stretch run, rallied belatedly,
weaved in then back out quickly deep stretch and was closing in for third nearing the wire. ROCKET MAN ATTACK contested the pace between horses,
was two wide on the turn, floated out some for the drive and slowly wore down inside the last furlong. DARREN'S LEGACY raced in the second flight from
outside on the backstretch, was four and five wide taking the bend, had every chance through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. U S HONOUR
NAP was hustled to dispute the early pace from inside, did not keep up on the turn, regained a striking position upper stretch but wore down inside the final
furlong.

Footnotes
DELTA LADY rated in the second flight, commenced her bid two wide on the bend, took over upper stretch and gradually lugged in as she drew away the
final furlong under a mild drive. CREAL SUGAR vied for the lead from outside, moved clear nearing the end of a quarter mile, was challenged from outside
leaving the turn, was no match for DELTA LADY in the lane but proved easily second best. BURNING BUSH well back early, picked up her pace five wide
on the turn and passed outside tired ones in the stretch to gain third in the waning yards. MARQUEE COWBOY reluctant to load, raced in contention from
inside, progressed on the bend but weakened the final furlong. STEPHANIE'S MELODY raced in the second flight from outside on the backstretch but faded
three wide on the turn. KENKEAD chased from off the inside, three and four wide through the turn then had no stretch bid. LADY BABA was prominent
between rivals on the backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go. VICTORIA'S DOLL void of speed, though hustled along, stayed off the inside
throughout and showed little.

KARAYEL gradually progressed from outside, came four wide into the lane, edged ahead upper stretch, lost the advantage deep stretch but came back
nearing the wire. CRAPS SHOOTER contested the pace from off the inside, moved clear and took the rail after a quarter mile, was challenged again leaving
the turn, fought gamely through the stretch but had to settle for second best. MY LITTLE TIPSY forwardly placed between horses, went for the lead two
wide on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, lugged in beside CRAPS SHOOTER inside the last eighth and gradually wore down. TIZRIK broke
inward, moved to the rail after entering the main track, vied for the lead inside CRAPS SHOOTER, did not keep up after two furlongs, came off the rail for
the stretch run, angled out some when MY LITTLE TIPSY came in inside the last furlong and finished evenly. JOHNNY LONGBOAT squeezed back at the
break, saved ground on the bend, swung to the outside for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late.

CHANGE DIRECTION rated from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, rallied to vie for the lead inside the last furlong, lugged in beside INDIAN SIGN
deep stretch and edged ahead near the wire. INDIAN SIGN chased from between rivals, progressed along the rail on the turn, fought for the lead inside the
last eighth, was narrowly outfinished but clearly second best. GREENSPAN contested the pace outside GOLDEN LANCE, moved clear into the bend,
stayed just off the inside, was challenged from both sides inside the last furlong and flattened out deep stretch. YALIKEANYTHING moved to the inside
early on, came off the rail some on the turn, came into the lane behind CHANGE DIRECTION, advanced upper stretch then leveled off. BOLD ATTACK
raced in contention from inside on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs. GOLDEN LANCE displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up
into the bend, came off the rail some, shortened his stride leaving the turn, was eased late and walked off.

TWO MORE TIMES rated between horses early, commenced her bid two wide on the bend, moved to the rail for a clear path nearing the furlong marker,
vied for the lead with a sixteenth left, took a narrow advantage inside the seventy yard marker, floated out some, brushed with G CITY WARRIOR through
the waning yards but held on for the win. G CITY WARRIOR chased the early speed from outside, began to close the gap just off the inside on the turn,
fanned to path three for the stretch run, took the lead, was challenged from inside, with a sixteenth to go, lugged in slightly as TWO MORE TIMES came out
nearing the wire, brushed with the latter to the finish and had to settle for second best. HIDDEN FIGURE in midpack early from outside, was three then four
wide taking the bend, gained third inside the sixteenth marker and made up minor ground in the late going. SIMPLY FAST well back early, had the rail on
the turn, swung out behind G CITY WARRIOR for the stretch run and rallied belatedly. MISS LEARJET in contention early from inside, did not keep up on
the turn and ran evenly through the lane. NEXT TIME YOU WIN chased from inside, gradually angled out through the bend, lost considerable ground
fanning widest for the drive but showed a willingness to run late. COOKIN ROSES reluctant to load, was hustled along to vie for the lead at the beginning,
moved clear after the first furlong, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail for the stretch run and began to wear down. AH LEAH chased from outside,
improved position four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive and also showed some interest deep stretch.

TONYS MORNING LINE was encouraged from outside, came into contention four wide on the turn, floated out further entering the lane, rallied to gain the
advantage with a sixteenth left and gradually edged ahead under steady handling. YOU'RE IN COREY vied for the early lead between horses, edged ahead
nearing the end of two furlongs, gained the rail, was headed on the turn, regained a narrow lead inside the final furlong but did not have enough left the final
sixteenth. SIRCORRI pressed from between rivals, went for the lead two wide on the turn, fought gamely in the stretch but also lacked the extra needed in
the late going. CRANKSHAFT prominent from outside, vied for the lead outside SIRCORRI on the bend and upper stretch but weakened inside the final
furlong. BLAZEN ROAD hustled along between horses early, did not keep up two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and made up minor
ground late. BABA'S BOY chased from between foes, lost considerable ground widest through the turn, drifted out in the lane, was straightened deep
stretch, showed a willingness to run and finished on even terms with BLAZEN ROAD. STORMIN EL PRADO forwardly placed from outside, was three wide
taking the bend, altered out some for a clear path upper stretch and flattened out inside the last eighth. FLASHY RICHIE trailed early, progressed two wide
on the turn, angled out to path five upper stretch, altered out for a clear path inside the last sixteenth and made up minor ground. MOVE ON OVER well
placed from inside on the backstretch, faded on the bend, angled out six wide upper stretch and continued to yield. MARESONOFAGUN showed little in a
ground-saving trip.
