Footnotes
ZELIG set a pressured pace inside of W W KAN DO, remained in control as MESSIAH inched closer turning for home, but shook free of them entering the
lane, and drew off thereafter. W W KAN DO prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart entering the lane while battling
for place inside of MESSIAH, got headed by that foe for that position in midstretch, but fought back to reclaim that position soon after. MESSIAH stalked
outside of the top pair while in the four path, ranged up turning for home, dueled for place outside of W W KAN DO through the lane, but faltered late.
AREYOUTALKINGTOME broke a step slowly, chased from the two path while behind the leaders, shifted outside of the top trio entering the lane, but lacked
a kick while shifting inwardly in midstretch. MASON A. P. raced far back in the three to five path and failed to threaten. PEQUENO GRANDE laid off of the
pace along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, and failed to factor. RED ALERT raced far back in the five to six path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MARKITOFF stalked two wide, bid into the far turn, led turning for home, shook clear in the three path in upper stretch, and held sway thereafter. TIZ LIGHT
THE WAY tracked two to three wide, took aim outside of MARKITOFF around the far turn, but only managed to chase him through the lane. FLY NIGHTLY
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, emerged to a stalking position approaching the far turn, chased from the two path turning for home,
attempted to produce a bid inside of a leading MARKITOFF in midstretch, but flattened out. PLAYOFF BOUND settled off of the pace along the inside,
swung four wide turning for home, and rallied to narrow the gap on the leaders through the final furlong. PEERLESS COURT cleared early on, met the
eventual winner's bid into the far turn, got headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME laid off of
the pace in the two path, but failed to menace. MOLIERE bumped the gate at the start, and made no impact from far back while the saddle slipped. THE
BOSS FACTOR settled off of the pace, but faded while saving ground around the far turn. MAJORS VINDICATION tracked three wide from the four path,
chased approaching the far turn, but faded around it. ROAR OF THE LION was outrun. JUST GUN IT tracked along the inside, but was done early, and
eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
GRACE'S SECRET took a bump from an inner foe while bobbling a bit at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, tucked to the rail while picking up
stride turning for home, loomed large approaching the lane while just behind the leader, bumped an outer SWEET TRUFFLES while tipping out for clear
sailing, and swept past the leader leaving the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. STUPENDOUS bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside,
shifted off of the rail turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rallying foe entering the lane, kept on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, and
prevailed. SWEET TRUFFLES pressed two wide, but was bumped and outkicked by an inner foe entering the lane, sustained stride to bid for place along
with an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. SUM MORE BIZZNESS set the pace, held firm entering the lane, but proved no match for an
outer bidder at the furlong grounds, and faltered. YELLOW CREEK ROAD broke outwardly, raced at the rear in the four path, and was outrun. TOTAL
DISCRETION tracked three wide, chased around the far turn, but faded.

Footnotes
C C CRUISE CONTROL tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair nearing the lane while floating outer foes wider, rallied with a good kick to
sweep past the leaders at the furlong grounds, and shifted in while kicking clear leaving that junction. WHAT AN HONOR hesitated at the start and spotted
the leaders multiple lengths, settled at the rear in the two to three path around the first turn, commenced a rally approaching the far turn, tracked while
inching closer outside of the main group turning for home, but got floated to the six path nearing the lane, and stayed on well through the final furlong to
reach place. AMERICAN APPLE stalked two wide, prompted the pace setter into the far turn, gained an advantage approaching the lane, but was outkicked
at the furlong grounds, yielded on her left lead, and lost place in the closing stages. FLASHY GEM tracked three wide, but was outkicked by an inner and an
outer rival turning for home, and gave way. RUM RUNNER READY set the pace, got headed turning for home, and faded. LADY SQUARED laid in midpack
three to two wide, but lacked a rally. CATHERINE BLAZE settled far back along the inside, and never got involved. MISS ADDIE LYNN took a bump from an
inner foe at the start, raced far back two to three wide, and never factored. CORVINA stumbled at the start while bumping an outer foe, tracked from
midpack along the inside, but faded around the far turn, was eased in the late stages, then was vanned off. THIRTY CARATS broke a step slowly, then was
pulled up around the first turn, yet walked off.

AIR COMBAT broke outwardly, pressed the pace setter from the outside, gained an advantage turning for home, and drew off in upper stretch.
SCRATCHOFF laid forwardly placed two wide and between horses, then chased a clearing AIR COMBAT through upper stretch, and gained place leaving
the furlong grounds. PINE VALLEY set the pace inside of a prompting AIR COMBAT, but gave way to that foe entering the lane, tired, and just saved show
late. VALE broke a step slowly, trailed the field around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of foes to miss show late. NORGAY
laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out approaching the final furlong, and kept on mildly between horses. LEVITY tucked two wide while off of the
pace into the turn, and failed to menace. LUCKY DEVIL broke a bit slowly, took the turn in the three to four path, came into the lane five wide, but made little
impact. MR. MARIAH tracked four wide, but yielded between horses while shying mildly from an inner foe at the furlong grounds. SHAKEDOWN STREET
chased three wide and between horses, but faded around the turn. KIAWAH BREEZE stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
AMERICAN HERO settled off of the main group in the three path, got outkicked by an inner WATCH THE MUSIC while being floated six wide nearing the
lane, then sustained stride despite hanging on his left lead to take aim on that leading foe in the final furlong, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and
edged away. WATCH THE MUSIC rated far back along the inside, rallied noticably along the rail around the far turn, tipped out to the five path entering the
lane, sustained his charge to gain an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, led as an outer AMERICAN HERO pursued, met that foe's bid at the
sixteenth pole, and was outkicked. CAMP DADDY bumped an outer foe at the start and sparked a chain reaction, stalked along the inside, split foes two
wide in upper stretch after an outer WATCH THE MUSIC got a jump, attempted a bid inside of that foe leaving the furlong grounds, but leveled off. FORT
DEFIANCE laid forwardly placed three wide between horses while in the four path around the first turn, pressed down the backstretch, bid entering the lane,
but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, and tired. WINTERWOOD took a bump from a inner foe into an outer rival at the start, sat
reserved two wide, attempted a four wide gain around the far turn, but failed to match rallying strides with inner foes turning for home, then shifted further
out in midstretch, and surpassed tired foes. MY BUDDY B got nudged by an inner foe into an outer one at the start, set the pace while feeling outer
pressure, resisted bids entering the lane, but weakened at the furlong grounds. GROUP EIGHTEEN pressed the pace two wide and between horses, vied
around the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch. FROOME (IRE) took a bump from an inner foe while in a bit of tight quarters at the start, then raced at the
rear three wide, and was outrun. CREATIVE MIRACLE stalked five to four wide around the first turn, but weakened into the far turn before wilting between

Footnotes
PALM COTTAGE set the pace inside of a pressing LITTLE BLAZE while a path off of the rail, shrugged off that foe passing the quarter pole, drew off under
a hammerlock through the lane, and cruised home. LITTLE BLAZE pressed PALM COTTAGE from the outside while in the three path around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, and remained well clear of show. WINGS OF AN ANGEL bobbled and brushed an outer foe at the start,
tracked from the four path while three wide and between horses around the turn, vied for show in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead and failing to
keep pace with the top pair, and secured show. MOLLIE KATE was put to a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the two
path, but failed to factor. BABY BLUE EYES stalked along the inside, vied for show in upper stretch, but faltered in the final furlong. JUMAKAN BOURBON
brushed an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, and made little impact. DULCIMER DAME tracked in the five path, but
faded turning for home.

Footnotes
HAWK OF WAR settled off of the pace two to three wide, tracked while awaiting racing room behind a wall of rivals turning for home, tipped four wide in
upper stretch while inside of RISK MANAGER, rallied to bid along with that foe at the sixteenth pole, dueled between horses through the late stages, and
prevailed. RISK MANAGER trailed early on, gained five to six wide and outside of foes turning for home, sustained his charge in the final furlong while
hanging on his left lead, bid at the sixteenth pole, battled through the closing stages, but missed. VINTAGE PRINT tracked from midpack along the inside,
split foes three wide turning for home to bid for the lead nearing the lane, led in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds, but met a pair of bids at the
sixteenth pole, and was bested. HOZIER stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase the top trio from the two path through the final furlong.
ABSAM saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. PEEKACHO tracked from midpack three to four wide, ranged up to striking distance turning for home,
but yielded when put to tight quarters between horses in upper stretch. QUARI MASTER set the pace in the two path early on, but was swarmed by a host
of challengers nearing the lane, and yielded in upper stretch. SOUNION tracked two wide, but faded four wide and between horses turning for home.
KOUFAX bobbled at the start while still breaking with the top flight, prompted the pace from the five path around the first turn, tucked two wide while
pressing down the backstretch, vied among foes nearing the lane, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. HAIG POINT never got involved.
