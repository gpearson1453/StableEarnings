WESTA WAVERLY broke readily, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing
upper stretch and edged clear in late stages under firm right handed pressure. BIG BOY MCCOY was settled last while shifting inwards racing to the turn,
gained some position between foes racing through the stretch, then angled to the rail in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors in time. DEPUTY
LAW was urged inside the eventual winner from the outset disputing the lead into the turn, dueled for command to upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
MYNAMEIS PRINCE settled into stride along the rail, saved ground on the bend, then altered course five wide in the stretch to gain some position while
lacking the needed final kick. JOHNNY UP was urged three deep racing just off the leaders pursuing those rivals into the turn, then to upper stretch, gave
way between foes late. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE tracked the leaders from just out of striking position racing four wide through the backstretch to the turn and
steadily faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLAME J D was prompted to maintain striking distance racing five deep through the backstretch to the turn, shifted inwards on the bend to press the issue
three wide into upper stretch and responded to strong left handed pressure to narrowly prevail in a long drive. CAUCUS RULES was urged to the lead
nearest the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. WESTONS
WILDCAT vied with the pacesetter between foes prompting that rival into the turn, gained terms with the leader to duel for command between foes into
upper stretch but was outfinished by the top pair. BAYOU GEM, in touch with the leaders between foes racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
MISTER WAYSIDE stumbled at the start, recovered to be a brief factor four wide between foes attending the pace to the turn but came up empty nearing
upper stretch. HUNGRY HENRY, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, dropped out last and failed to menace thereafter.

CAN HE STORM, caught in tight quarters at the start, was held up just after the break, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn,
steadied slightly racing along the rail midway through the bend, came through inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch to challenge for command and
narrowly prevailed under firm right handed encouragement. RUSTY CAGE was urged inside foes disputing the lead from the outset into the bend, edged
clear in upper stretch while tipping off the rail but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. FREUDIAN FATE was urged along three wide pursuing the leaders
into the turn, then continued in that path through the stretch while finishing evenly late. EPIC DRAMA angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival from
the outset into the turn, lost terms with that foe entering upper stretch and gave way. ENOUGH NONSENSE was rated off the first flight between foes racing
into the turn and faded into upper stretch.

SEEKING SPLENDOR, slow into stride, settled well off the field in the opening half, gathered momentum racing through the far turn, swung four wide
entering upper stretch, then rallied to the front in time under firm right handed pressure to narrowly prevail. PORTSMOUTH angled to the inside racing to the
first turn tracking off the first flight, continued along the inside to the second bend, steadied momentarily racing past the three furlong marker, tipped off the
rail awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, split foes entering the lane then bid for command inside foes in upper stretch, struck the front between calls
late but couldn't contain the winner. SIMPSON BAY was rated stalking just off the first flight in the opening half, continued with a steady bid three wide
between foes on the far turn but was outkicked by the top pair. RUNAWAY HARRY, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch tracking
off the first flight, steadily moved to terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. FREEDOM FLASH sped to the lead along the
inside, disputed the pace inside foes to the far turn and gave way. HURTS SO BAD was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening half, dueled for
command between foes into the far turn and gave out abruptly nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
BRIAR THICKET was settled last in the opening stages while angling inwards racing into the turn, tipped off the inside midway through the bend, split foes
nearing upper stretch, then bid inside foes for command entering the stretch and narrowly prevailed under right handed pressure while contesting the issue
to the wire. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN attended a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to gain the advantage, shifted to
the three path carrying out several rivals entering upper stretch, then shifted inwards grudgingly resisting the winner's bid to the end. IMPULSUS was rated
off the second flight while shifting out on the backstretch, raced four wide through the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with
interest to narrowly prevail for a share. ME SAY SO, a bit outpaced racing to the turn, angled to the six path entering the stretch gaining some late
momentum but was outkicked for a share. FROST WARRIOR was rated off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, advanced three wide on the
turn to lodge a brief bid, was carried out by HOUSE OF TARGARYEN racing into upper stretch and quickly came up empty. BOOZIN AT BOZOS tracked
the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. ARNOLD'S PATSY tracked off the first flight inside rivals to
the turn and gave way into upper stretch. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY, off a bit awkwardly, flashed brief pace along the inside but emptied out early.

Footnotes
START SINGING was urged clear while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, was headed racing
through upper stretch but produced a solid second effort under firm right handed pressure to regain the advantage in time on the wire. LADY CLARE
tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance to challenge for command racing into upper stretch,
edged forward racing past the furlong marker but failed to sustain her momentum. MAIDEN ROCK tracked the pace inside rivals in second flight to the far
turn, shifted out to the four path racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. HUNTER'S MAGIC settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, then continued with a steady three wide advance to gain some position between foes racing into the lane. ICYWILBURNYEH
settled inside foes in the last flight in the opening half, came around a tiring foe on the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to
advance into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. THAT WOULD BE NICE tracked the leader outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, was
caught four wide after a half and soon faded. SURELY A LEGEND angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied
out early. SHEZONEZESTREET tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and faded after a half.

TWO BY TWO was rated last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gaining position inside foes, tipped out to the
three path in upper stretch advancing on the leader, took over from that foe leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. A ROSE FOR
RAVEN was urged clear along the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted
by the winner. STITZY, forwardly placed in the three path while being urged to prompt the pacesetter into the backstretch, faded into the far turn, but
produced a solid second effort in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. ROAMING UNION, urged between foes prompting the pace into the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter into the far turn, was fanned to the three path nearing upper stretch and gave way. GIANT PAYDAY
tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and retreated early.
