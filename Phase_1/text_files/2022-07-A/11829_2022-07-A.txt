Footnotes
RANTING moved in early, checked after brushing with a foe when the leader crossed in front into the turn, raced under a tight hold especially with the
left-rein early on the bend, shifted to the two path while in dead-aim of the leading trio at the five-sixteenths, had leveled out some at this juncture, was
asked at the quarter-pole then espied an open seam between foes into upper stretch, bumped with rivals on both sides while making a bid as both of her
combatants made the hole tighter, bullied through with good courage to take the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under a strong hand-ride to
the wire. SNOWY EVENING moved in while showing good speed, dropped from the three to two path early on the turn, vied between foes around the bend,
spun back three wide into the stretch, came in a bit while the winner was making a bid around the three-sixteenths then bumped with that foe multiple times,
led into the final furlong then lost the advantage to the winner and was outfinished but clear for the place. KINGSLEY CREEK broke a bit awkwardly then
was hustled, moved in while showing speed, dropped from the two path the rail while in front into the turn, came out some while losing the advantage in
upper stretch then bumped with the winner, battled inside the top two into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. DREAM ON CARA was
hustled from the gate then drifted in early while dropping back, saved ground around the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, moved out outside the
furlong marker and lacked the needed response. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS came in early then was carried nearing the first turn, brushed with RANTING
then checked leaving the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. BENEVOLENTLY was last to
commence, raced on the outside while hard ridden, moved up leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the four then three path around the turn, floated six
wide into the stretch then drifted further out and capitulated.

Footnotes
INSPIRATION POINT was last to commence, settled towards the rear, raced in hand behind foes outside the five-eighths, moved out late on the
backstretch, had the rider fall back in the saddle with a half-mile to run, was roused five wide around the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch, rallied
on the outside, closed well to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under steady urging. FAZARO pressed the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive in the stretch and secured the place while unable to go with the winner.
SUPPRESSOR went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, inched clear while a bit off the inside around the turn, was set down into upper
stretch then came under a drive, lost the lead inside the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. EMPIRE RIDGE was urged along on the
outside, chased four wide through the turn and tired. IRIE SPICE was urged early then settled at the rear, saved ground around the turn and failed to
respond. SHARPOON was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while saving ground on the turn, was put to the crop outside the five-sixteenths
and retreated.

GREAT WORKOUT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide five-sixteenths from home
before swinging five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. COUSTEAU coaxed from
the gate, prompted the pace just off the inside taking over narrow command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was
caught a furlong out, kept on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. SPECTATORLESS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the
inside under pressure from a trio and then a pair, came under coaxin gat the three-eighths, got headed for command with five-sixteenths to go and cut the
corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the late going. FOREVER WICKED coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking three wide with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and
offered no response. O'TROUBLE prompted the pace four then three wide briefly between foes and then outside a pair through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths and went four wide for home, then tired in the stretch. MAJESTIC TIGER coaxed from the start, showed brief speed outside a
trio six then five paths off the rail, got shaken off and tucked four wide through the turn, went four to five wide for home and folded.

TRINITY TITOLI showed speed on the inside of a foe, was eased back off the pace then moved out at the three-quarter pole, tracked outside from that
point, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch, vied three then two wide around the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths then shook clear outside
the quarter-pole, responded well when roused in upper stretch, widened while kept to the task into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the
best. GAGLIANO came outward at the start while last away, raced on the outside while urged at the rear, went three wide around the turn, moved out
approaching the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. GAME THEORY brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along between horses,
dropped back late on the backstretch, moved out into the turn, went four then five wide under urging around the bend, floated seven wide into upper stretch
and lost the place while clear for the show. SIMPLE SUGAR broke out at the start, was urged along on the inside of foes, went two then three wide around
the turn and came up empty. HANDLE THE TRUTH bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled outside under some urging, went three then four wide
around the turn and capitulated. KEEN DANCER bumped lightly with a foe at the start while brushing with another rival then was squeezed back between
horses, raced near the rear on the inside, saved ground around the turn and was no factor. LOVE THAT FACE was hustled to the front, went clear with six
furlongs to run, was challenged leaving the backstretch, vied inside of the winner while dropping from the two path to the rail around the turn, lost the lead
under urging at the five-sixteenths and faltered.

RANGER FOX veered in at the start carrying in ALADO five paths before clearing that rival to show the way in hand along the inside safely in front,
remained patiently handled through the turn and was let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
and held well to prevail. RING OF FIRE four then three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick.

Footnotes
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS went to the front then strode clear, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand-ride to the wire. FAUCI settled comfortably near the
back, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted to the three path while moving closer at the quarter-pole, steadied while blocked behind horses from
the three-sixteenths to the eighth-pole, altered in for room at this juncture, rallied in the final furlong and finished fast but was too late while up for the place.
MAXWELL ESQUIRE settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the
final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed the place while able to get the show. COMEDY TOWN was well
placed just off the pace, drafted inside around the turn, was asked nearing the three-sixteenths, moved out outside the furlong marker and lacked the
needed kick. CASANOVA KITTEN tossed his head at the start and hit the outside of the gate while away very awkwardly, spotted the front many lengths,
went three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch then tipped further out and improved position. BALLYDOOLEY (GB) was rated off the pace
while tugging on the bit under tight restraint, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his
best into upper stretch, chased between foes into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. BATTLE STATION tracked the pace on the outside then
in the three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. TIGER BLOOD was rated lightly on the
outside, went four wide around the turn, lugged out late on that bend, floated nine wide into upper stretch and faltered.

DEMANDSRESPECT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside, tipped three wide at the three-eighths and came under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths bidding strongly through the latter portion of the turn to take command just outside the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, went
clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. PRECURSORY stumbled at the start, chased three wide until tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on well
clear of the rest to be along second best. HOP PICKER coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. DOLCE SERA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a
ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DON'T OVERLOOK ME coaxed from the start, showed the way in
hand just off the inside under some pressure from QUOTABELLE to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and was overhauled just
outside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. QUOTABELLE stumbled at the start and broke on top despite it, prompted the pace
from the outside four paths off the rail down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn and under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, went
four wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
ANNAPOLIS was rated just off the pace under a snug old, drafted in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to
the lead into the final furlong, kicked clear under a pop of a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole then drifted in and proved much the best under a
hand-ride late. DOUBLE CLUTCH broke a step slow, was reserved at the rear of the field, went two then three wide around the turn, was roused five wide
into the stretch then tipped further out and finished willingly for the place. READY TO PURRFORM bumped with COINAGE early then was taken back, was
reserved off the pace, moved closer while three then four wide around the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into
the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then missed the place while able to get the show. CHANCEUX contested the pace on the inside of a rival while
in hand, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into
the final furlong and weakened. BOSTON TEA PARTY contested the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the two path around the turn, was given his
cue outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. COINAGE bumped with READY TO PERFORM early, was rated on the
outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made an outside bid at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong
and also weakened. SMOKIN' T was reserved off the pace, pulled on the bit with a half-mile to run, drafted inside around the turn, was roused at the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond.
