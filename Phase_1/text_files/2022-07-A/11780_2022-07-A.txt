Footnotes
ZAICI set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals around the turn, shook free to a narrowly clear margin approaching the three sixteenths pole, gamely held
sway through midstretch, then inched further away entering the final sixteenth. CIGARETTE BOAT took a bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked four
wide while in pursuit outside of the leading trio, shied from an inner HILL OF TARA leaving the five furlong pole, tucked down to the three path approaching
the turn, stalked intently while well in hand from the three path and among foes around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, grinded away through
midstretch, bid for place entering the final sixteenth as the leader kicked away, and flopped back to his left lead while securing that position. MO'S
TREASURE bobbled into an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace three wide, chased his innermost counterpart through upper stretch, but failed to
keep pace with that one while getting outkicked for place at the sixteenth pole. RARIFIED FLAIR rated far back along the inside, encountered traffic behind
a tiring HALLOW POINT entering the lane, shifted to the three path soon after, and stayed on between horses. BOXSTER vied for the lead two wide and
between horses, but yielded entering the lane, and gave way before changing leads at the furlong grounds. IRONSIDES stalked along the inside, but only
managed to chase before tiring. MR BINGO laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to menace. SABURO'S GRACE hopped at the start while last away,
raced at the rear three to four wide, came into the lane in the five path, and failed to factor. SYNTACTIC broke slowly, trailed two wide and between horses
around the turn, and failed to factor. HILL OF TARA was bumped by an outer rival at the start, rushed forward inside of rivals, caused CIGARETTE BOAT to
shy when shifted outside of the leading trio leaving the five furlong pole, stalked four wide around the bend, but weakened five wide entering the lane.
HALLOW POINT broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, was taken in hand in tight quarters between horses early on, laid off of the pace along the
inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
HOLLIS hopped at the start while still breaking on top, set the pace in the two path, tucked into the turn, drew clear of pressing foes entering the lane,
maintained a clear margin through midstretch, reached for the wire in the late stages as NECKER ISLAND menaced, and held. NECKER ISLAND stalked
along the inside, got keen inside of foes before steadying when put to tight quarters at the half mile pole, tracked two wide and between horses turning for
home, rallied through upper stretch to gain place from outer foes leaving the furlong grounds, then sustained his charge to take aim on the clear leader in
the late stages, surged to bid approaching the wire, but ran out of ground. LONG RANGE TODDY pressed three to two wide into the turn, but failed to keep
pace with the leader entering the lane, then was outkicked by an inner rival for place in midstretch, and fended off an outer foe for show. LONG WEEKEND
bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, moved forward to stalk outside of the leading pair into the turn, but failed to keep pace while being
floated to the five path entering the lane, vied for place in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position at the furlong grounds, and
yielded. MANNY WAH trailed in the three to four path around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but made little impact. ROBO MAN took
substantial bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, and failed to factor. JALEN JOURNEY
bumped an outer rival at the start, laid close up two wide while between horses just behind the pace setter early on, tucked to the rail at the half mile pole,
stalked from the pocket around the turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
DAMON'S MOUND broke slowly, surpassed foes to achieve a four wide tracking position while perched outside of rivals, glided up to the leading trio while
well in hand at the three furlong pole, gained an advantage under his own power leaving the five sixteenths pole, cleared and tucked to the two path
entering the lane, then powerfully pulled away under little to none encouragement from the rider. EASY BIG BOY dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes
into the turn, but offered little resistance to a bidding outer rival approaching the quarter pole, safely managed place through midstretch, met CONFIDENCE
GAME's challenge for that position entering the final sixteenth, and held. CONFIDENCE GAME broke a step slowly at the start, laid off of the pace in the
three path, took the turn in the five to four path while tracking the top flight, and stayed on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but hung. BLOCKED chased
along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn, then tipped four wide while between horses in midstretch, and stayed on. HE'S A GOOD DANCER
stalked two wide and between horses, chased from the two path around the turn, and lacked a bid. MAYFIELD STRONG broke slowly, raced far back in the
two path, swung to the six path entering the lane, and improved on his left lead. NAK NAK BOLT dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, but
proved no match for an outer foe turning for home, and faded in upper stretch. OVERLY D'ORO was outsprinted after breaking well, and never got involved.
FROSTED DEPARTURE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, and failed to factor. MACHO VILLA prompted the pace three wide, but was outkicked
turning for home, and weakened between horses in upper stretch. CAPACITY trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
GUNNING tracked along the inside, tipped three wide into the turn, loomed a danger behind the top flight turning for home, tipped five wide entering the
lane, ranged up in upper stretch, assumed command at the furlong grounds, and drew off while ridden out. PLEASE BE KIND set the pace in the two path,
showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the turn, shook free of them at the three sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to GUNNING's bid
approaching the furlong grounds, and was second best. MY LILY MAE trailed along the inside, split foes two wide while picking up stride turning for home,
chased in the three path while midpack in upper stretch, dove to the rail at the furlong grounds, and sustained a rail charge to gain show. ROMANCE
NOVEL pressed three wide, then two wide while in the three path and between horses around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch while hanging on his left
lead, yet fended off an outer foe for fourth. SAVO ISLAND stalked four wide, pressed the leading pair from the four path around the turn, but chased his
inner most counterpart while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and tired. TUBMAN raced off of the pace four wide and between horses
around the turn, and moved up in the final furlong. BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the two, then three, path around
the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. DREAMALOT tracked two wide, cut the corner entering the lane after an inner foe
faltered, but lacked a rail kick to threaten inside of the leaders, and tired. LIL TOWN SIS got hung out five wide while far back around the turn, fanned seven
wide entering the lane, and made little impact. EXPLICATE broke outwardly while off a step slow, tracked in midpack four wide and outside of foes, but
faded while getting floated six wide entering the lane. AMERICAN PYRAMID raced off of the pace three wide and between horses, but faded into the turn,
and was done early. AMARYLLIS KISS laid close up along the inside early on, stalked from the pocket into the turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
SWING SHIFT broke out towards open space, vied four wide and outside of foes early on, then three wide into the turn, gained an advantage turning for
home, inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway from a pursuing LET MY PEOPLE GO through the final furlong. LET MY PEOPLE GO tracked two wide
and between horses, loomed a danger from the three to four path while stalking between horses from behind the top flight around the bend, emerged
among foes to take aim on a clearing SWING SHIFT passing the three furlong pole, but failed to progress on that foe's margin through the final furlong, and
chased him home to prove second best. PRAYFORPEACE vied two wide and between horses through the early stages, rated back to stalk from the two
path entering the turn, tipped five wide at the three sixteenths pole after SWING SHIFT built a clear margin, and stayed on to claim show. TEXAS RED HOT
broke a step slowly and was last away, took the turn in the three path before swinging eight wide in upper stretch, and moved up late. UNIFIED REPORT
tracked along the inside, laid off into the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, then six wide in upper stretch before tipping back in inside the final furlong,
and failed to threaten. HIPPODROME vied for the lead inside of a trio of rivals, but gave way entering the lane, and tired. SPANKSTER backed out after
briefly taking part in the early scramble for the lead, chased three wide into the turn, shifted out and inched closer under urging to press from the five path at
the five sixteenths pole, vied for place entering the lane while chasing a clearing SWING SHIFT and weakened at the furlong grounds. MENDENHALL vied
three wide and between horses, then two wide into the turn, but yielded entering the lane, and weakened. PATIENT CAPITAL took the turn in the four to five
path while off of the pace, swung seven wide entering the lane, and made little impact. ATTA BOY ANTHONY trailed in the four path, and was outrun.

WICKED HALO prompted the pace three wide, assumed command nearing the lane, and drew off under hand urging. HEARTYCONSTITUTION set the
pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, but proved no match for her widest counterpart entering the lane, and held place from an outer foe through the final
furlong. ZAWISH remained in the center of the track leaving the chute, tracked outside of the leading trio around the turn, bid for place in upper stretch after
the leader kicked away, but flashed her tail six times while resenting the rider's use of the crop, and missed reaching that position. VERYLITTLECENTS vied
for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SHEDARESTHEDEVIL stalked outside of the clear pace setter without applying pressure down the backstretch, inched closer to take aim around the far
turn, came under a drive in the three path at the five sixteenths pole while chasing, but sustained stride to through upper stretch to produce a bid
approaching the furlong grounds, forged an advantage shortly after, and edged clear through the final sixteenth. SUPER QUICK broke a bit flat footed
before tugging to the fore, established a loose advantage entering the first turn, dictated terms via an uncontested margin, showed the way in hand turning
for home as SHEDARESTHEDEVIL gave chase, was set down entering the lane as that foe inched closer, held sway gamely through upper stretch, but was
confronted and headed passing the quarter pole, and proved second best. PAULINE'S PEARL settled off of the pace in the four path, was urged along to
gain ground around the far turn, bid for show in the five path entering the lane, and secure that position in the final furlong while not threatening the top pair.
SHE'S ALL WOLFE laid off of the pace along the inside, improved in upper stretch in hopes of vying for show inside of PAULINE'S PEARL, but was safely
kept at bay. AVA'S GRACE tracked three wide, chased without progressing around the far turn, and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
ALOHA WEST took a bump to his hind quarters leaving the chute, inched closer along the inside to a stalking position, pursued from the pocket while in
hand around the turn, tipped to the three path to take aim on a clearing KNEEDEEPINSNOW entering the lane, chased through upper stretch inside of
MILES AHEAD, produced a bid along with that foe at the sixteenth pole, led shortly after, and kept his outer counterpart at bay. MILES AHEAD stalked three
wide while in the four path around the turn, came into the lane between horses, chased the clear leader while outside of ALOHA WEST in upper stretch,
inched closer and bid along with that one a sixteenth from home, but was denied. KNEEDEEPINSNOW set the pace in the two path, inched away from
chasing foes entering the lane, changed leads leaving the three sixteenths pole, held sway from a pair of chasing foes entering the final furlong, but offered
little resistance to their bids at the sixteenth pole, and caved. BANGO brushed with rivals on either side early on, tracked two wide and between horses into
the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, but lacked a rail rally. HEART RHYTHM lagged behind the field in the four to six path around the turn, and
improved past a pair of tiring foes in the late stages. BOB'S EDGE bobbled before being bothered by an outer rival at the start, tracked the main group from
the four path while outside of foes, came into the lane in the five path while chasing, but lacked a punch before tiring in midstretch.
STARTDFROMDABOTTOM broke very rankly and bothered an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace setter from the outside, chased that foe from
between horses around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD pressed CADDO RIVER two wide through a modest tempo, inched closer and vied around the far turn as an outer MANDALOUN forced the
pace, gained an advantage nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held strong from a chasing AMERICANREVOLUTION through the final
furlong. AMERICANREVOLUTION backed off the early scramble for the lead into the first turn to track from the three path, followed the leading trio down
the backstretch, tipped four wide and outside of them while under strong urging approaching the five sixteenths pole, sustained a rally outside of foes to take
aim on a clear OLYMPIAD in midstretch as that foe's main pursuer, but failed to progress through the final furlong, and proved second best. PROXY trailed
comfortably behind the hot pace while in the two path, picked up stride turning for home, moved out of last in upper stretch before shifting out to the seven
path approaching midstretch, and offered a good belated kick in the final furlong to reach show in the closing sixteenth. MANDALOUN stalked three wide,
pressed in earnest around the far turn while under coaxing, but failed to bid before getting outkicked for minor rewards by an outer foe entering the lane, and
faded. TITLE READY saved ground off of the pace, but failed to offer a rail kick through the lane, altered course outside of a tiring CADDO RIVER at the
sixteenth pole, and failed to factor. CADDO RIVER set the pace, showed the way from a pair of pressers into the far turn, but was headed by the eventual
winner entering the lane, quickly proved no match, and gave way in upper stretch. LAST SAMURAI rushed to be prominent five wide and outside of foes
passing the wire for the first time, failed to keep pace with inner foes and was relegated to a four wide tracking position around the far turn, got floated to the
five path approaching the far turn, then faded around that bend.

Footnotes
AMUSING ANTICS set the pace in the two path, was confronted by ALTERED SHOT at the three furlong pole, but repelled that foe in upper stretch, and
drew clear. ALTERED SHOT stalked outside of the pace setter, bid in the three path at the three furlong pole, vied turning for home before drifting to the
four path entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, chased her counterpart home thereafter, and proved second best. RECODED stalked
three wide, tucked to the two path behind the leaders into the turn, then chased them from the rail through the lane, failed to bid before flattening out in the
final furlong, and held show. REGAL RETORT tracked along the inside, tipped off of the rail in upper stretch, chased while inching closer to RECODED in
the closing stages, but missed reeling in that foe for show. BE LIKE WATER settled off of the pace along the inside while in the two path, awaited racing
room behind LEGAL RETORT entering the lane, shifted inside of that foe in upper stretch, but lacked a rail rally. MILLEFEUILLE tracked from midpack five
wide and outside of foes, took the turn in the four path, but failed to progress on the leaders in upper stretch before fading. LINDALEVESOLTA (ARG) raced
at the rear in the three path into the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and improved. MALLOY took the turn in the four to five path while well off of the
pace, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. STERLING MISS laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped four wide entering the
lane, but had no rally while hanging on her left lead. SHE'S A DIME stumbled at the start, altered course multiple paths outwardly leaving the chute, tracked
four wide, then from the three path and between horses around the turn, but weakened. HONORIFIQUE raced in midpack two wide and among foes, but
faltered between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO tracked two wide, stalked behind the leaders while between horses around the far turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of
TIZ RYE TIME in the final furlong, ranged up entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. TIZ RYE TIME stalked three wide, bid entering the
lane, gained an advantage in midstretch, but was steered outwardly to meet ALEJANDRO's challenge entering the final sixteenth, and was outkicked late. C
FALLS prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, then from between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe approaching
the furlong grounds, dueled with an inner BOURBON THUNDER for show thereafter, and prevailed. BOURBON THUNDER set the pace inside of a vying
rival, but was outkicked by an outer bidder approaching midstretch, dueled for show late, but missed. SOUTHERN PASSAGE settled off of the pace two
wide, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE laid off of the pace three wide, tracked around the far turn, but finished up
evenly without threatening. GREATHEART stalked in the two path, but faded turning for home. ROGUE ELEMENT broke a step slowly, trailed around both
turns, and passed tired foes late. CURBSTONE saved ground in midpack, shifted three wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. MR. TIP was outrun.
