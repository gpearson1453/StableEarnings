Footnotes
GORMLEY'S GABRIELA saved ground around the turn in a striking position, eased off the rail in upper stretch, gained the lead in the three path near the
sixteenth pole then drove clear. GENIEINABRIDLE hugged the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path in mid stretch and rallied inside the winner.
FREE ADMISSION rushed to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail entering the turn, remained along the rail and tired in the drive. CREATIVE
CADENCE rushed up three deep mid way on the turn, gained a short lead approaching the stretch and tired late. GALACTIC TIDE circled the turn three
wide, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was not a factor. NEVER FREE stumbled leaving the starting gate, was well placed
three wide turning for home and faltered. MYSISTERNANCY hopped at the break then trailed.

WICKED MAD , three deep heading to the turn, dropped in to advance mid turn, got through along the rail and responded to firm asking when challenging
past the eighth pole, spurted clear under right handed encouragement with a sixteenth remaining then dug in late to prevail. PASSWORD PROTECTED ,
urged early and saving ground leaving the far turn, moved up then swung out four wide into the stretch, was guided well out in the course past mid stretch,
advanced between runners leaving the sixteenth pole and finished well to gain. CHAUFFEUR rated outside PASSWORD PROTECTED mid turn, moved out
wider with run into the lane, swung out extremely wide past the eighth pole, rallied outside rivals but was out kicked for the place. BILLINGSGATE tracked
the leaders two wide and in hand, awaited room nearing the lane, had ample room and edged up some past mid stretch but flattened out late. FLASH IS
BACK stalked outside a rival, ranged up four wide into the lane, briefly threatened in mid stretch then failed to sustain. BOLD TREK was hustled clear early,
set the pace towards the inside, took pressure then dueled in the two path into the lane, stayed on well to lead past the furlong grounds then weakened very
late. THATS MY DUDE , two to three wide outside the leader, disputed the pace into and around the turn, drew on even terms near the quarter pole, failed
to kick on past mid stretch and faded. BET ON BITZ steadied at the break, raced between foes while off the pace into the turn, steadied in close quarters
leaving the far turn then failed to make an impact. SWEET ASTA broke a step slow, saved ground while inside a pair of foes heading to the turn, was
shuffled back soon after, angled out and faded.

AFTERMATH , in tight at the break, recovered and settled well back while off the rail, angled out for room leaving the three eighths and gathered steam,
circled five with a bold run into the lane, surged outside embattled rivals to take over nearing the eighth pole then drew clear under a drive. I'M NOT SLOW
cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by a pair of foes while two wide into the lane, fought on past the furlong grounds and stayed on
gamely to regain the place. ERAWAN rated in range while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, moved up then bid between runners near the
quarter pole, sparred past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. DOLICE VITA broke a step slow, angled out nearing the three quarter pole and
pulled his way forward, edged up outside foes leaving the far turn, bid four wide heading into the lane, fought on past mid stretch then hung late. TYLER
TIME , five wide into the first turn, continued wide progress to stalk past the three quarter pole, drifted in a bit and bumped with a foe past the five eighths,
remained difficult to handle as he was laying in some mid way on the final turn, pursued into the stretch, stayed in range to mid stretch then faded.
SCHOOLYARD BULLY was steadied when in a bit close entering the backstretch, swung wide for the drive and failed to threaten. ROCKIN RON , four
wide, faltered. SCORCHED BY FIRE , between foes chasing early on, was bumped near the five eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
BOMBOLONI , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and pulled his way forward heading to the five eighths, checked repeatedly when keen to
go behind foes from the five eighths to the three eighths, dropped in and got a chance to regroup mid turn, eased out into the lane, split rivals with three
sixteenths remaining and had the leader in his sights, leveled off under right handed asking, closed in determinedly to forge to command in the final yards
then continued with vigor through the gallop out. BLISS THIS was urged to the front, dropped and set the pace, took pressure around the turn, opened up
after being set down in upper stretch, kept on gamely but failed to contain the winner's charge. DR RAGS nearly lost his rider when breaking outward and
bumping soundly with the winner, regrouped and moved up behind rivals leaving the five eighths, checked soon after, swung eight wide for the drive and
closed willingly. MR. MOSLEY chased off the rail, shifted out seven wide in upper stretch, made a mild run past the eighth then failed to seriously sustain.
AWESOME DYNAMO had speed then was rated off the leader, tracked inside, gave hard chase in upper stretch, failed to kick on leaving the furlong
grounds then faded. THUNDERHOUSE came in at the break and bumped with the winner then failed to menace. BEN RUMSON rated between foes early,
steadied near the turn, recovered to pursued between runners mid turn then gave way. OBOY was sent up early and entertained the pace outside BLISS
THIS, stayed on to force the issue to the quarter pole then gave way. ON SPOT chased three deep, was fanned five wide into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
LISHEEN , patiently rated inside horses for five furlongs, eased out mid way on the far turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch, took command outside
foes approaching the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling. MY THOUGHTS , two wide chasing the pace to the stretch, had aim on the lead in
upper stretch and weakened late. NICOLAR lacked speed, behind horses far turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and had a mild rally. POUNDING
MUSIC chased the pace down the backstretch, was well placed three deep around the far turn then weakened. MOSALAH moved to the inner rail after
sprinting clear entering the first turn, remained along the rail and gave way the final furlong. LA CASA D'ORO was no factor. HELLUVA LADY bore in at the
break then was outrun. VODKATINI , three wide both turns, was outrun. SWEET SENSATION raced along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
CYNERGY'S STAR prompted the pace two to three wide outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure entering the lane, seized command past the
three sixteenths, responded when asked for more and spurted away past mid stretch, eagerly widened from there and won under a mild drive. GOLDENIZE
, brushed at the break, rated three deep early on, angled out around the turn, circled five wide and was put to pressure into the lane, moved up[ outside
rivals and churned on willingly to be clear of the rest. THE WOLFMAN broke awkwardly, recovered and stalked the pace from the inside, was under a hearty
ride pursuing two wide into the lane and kept on with interest. ROYAL SPY edged up between runners early on, chased three wide into the lane and was
giving effort at the wire. RETURN THE RING , three to four wide and under asking past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. ACE
NINE NINE drifted in at the break and brushed with a rival, saved ground while off the pace mid turn, eased out past the sixteenth pole and had a mild
response. BOSS MAN J J was hustled to the front and cleared heading to the half mile pole, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure past the five
sixteenths, failed to stay on with the winner near mid stretch and weakened. ROYAL THUNDER saved ground and was rated off the pace, shuffled back
leaving the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was eased late.

PREMIERE CHOICE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and lasted under brisk urging. TAUBER , rank inside horses entering the turn,
hugged the inner rail on the turn and in upper stretch, eased out inside the eighth pole and closed outside the winner. MONSTER MASON saved ground
around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. BY THE SEY SHORE lacked speed, worked between horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. CRABS N BEER , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in upper stretch. PRINCE PERE , four
deep on the turn, gave way. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn and failed to be a factor.
SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , outrun, swung to the five path in mid stretch.

Footnotes
FLIGHT OF BOURBON shadowed the leader under rating, moved to near even terms mid turn, poked a head approaching the stretch, spurted clear after
being set down in upper stretch, moved away past the furlong grounds, was kept alert with some left handed asking, switched over to his correct lead and
held firm while steadily hand ridden the final fifty yards. TALL ORDER stalked behind a contested pace, eased out three wide into the lane, gave hard chase
past the furlong marker and continued on willingly to gain the place. R B'S THE BOSS broke a step slow, quickly recovered and moved up to stalk outside a
rival, shifted out some then was fanned five wide giving chase into the lane, gained some past the sixteenth marker but flattened out late. PRIDE OF
PAYTON settled off the pace, moved up four wide into the lane, swung out a few paths wider past the three sixteenths and churned on. LANDON JACK
broke sharp and cleared early, was joined by the winner after a furlong, took pressure while towards the rail, ceded the lead entering the lane, stayed on to
mid stretch then weakened. EXPECT LUCKY bore out at the break, straightened and raced far back into the turn, saved some ground into the lane but
never got on track.
