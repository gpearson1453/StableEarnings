Footnotes
POWER BACK set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened up in upper stretch and was kept under urging in the drive. GREAT IDEA raced in the two
path between horses leaving the far turn, was taken to the inner rail near the eighth pole and rallied. SAINT MARCO , well placed three deep on the far turn,
lacked the necessary rally. LIGHTNING ROD , rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out on the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch
and flattened out. UNORTHODOX , no factor, passed tired foes late. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , two wide chasing the pace to the stretch, faltered. ICY
MINISTER , outside horses throughout, was no factor. VIOLENT ROCK , along the inner rail stalking the pace, faltered.

Footnotes
COLOROFACLOUD tugged her rider forward from between rivals leaving the chute and prompted the pace, was patiently handled as the leader cleared off
the after a half mile, stalked about three wide past the three eighths, came under pressure and began a run four wide soon into the lane, reeled in the leader
while under right handed asking heading to the sixteenth pole, briefly cleared in deep stretch then lasted over SHE'S A TRIPP. SHE'S A TRIPP , with the
pace outside rivals leaving the chute and heading to the three quarter pole, rated back and stalked three deep, dropped further back departing the far turn,
swung out five wide for the drive, found more through the final furlong and closed steadily to just fall short. KOBE'S GIRL bid inside foes leaving the chute,
poked a head in front with five eighths remaining then cleared into the turn, widened past the three eighths and came three wide into the lane, stayed on
under a drive past mid stretch, drifted in a bit while under right handed asking inside the sixteenth pole and faded. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE edged up to the
inside of trio early on then drafted back, saved ground off the pace mid turn, moved up some while towards the rail leaving mid stretch then lost momentum
when steadying off the heels of KOBE'S GIRL soon past the sixteenth marker. CAGED PIXIE , off very slowly, was sent up between foes past the three
quarter pole, chased off the inside but failed to drum up a solid finish. SATISFIED , off the pace while saving ground, swung wide for the drive but lacked a
rally. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, KOBE'S GIRL was disqualified from third and placed fourth for causing interference to
ALITTLESLICEOF PIE.

Footnotes
TOE CURLIN' KISS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn, angled out for the drive, was five deep in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside
horses and was up at the wire. PRAIRIE sprinted clear soon after the break, moved to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace near the rail and
gave way grudgingly. SAMUI SUNSET hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, was taken off the rain inside the eighth pole and rallied between the top pair.
PETIT FILS (FR) , two wide chasing the pace, weakened in the drive. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , three wide the first turn, remained well off the rail the far turn,
swung to the six path in upper stretch and had a mild gain. HALITE , three deep both turns, weakened. AMENDED raced along the inner rail most of the trip
and was no factor. ATREYU raced in the two path between horses down the backstretch and on the far turn then gave way in mid stretch.

Footnotes
RAPID RESPONSE , in close attendance three wide and under rating into the turn, moved alongside the leader mid turn, poked a head in front entering the
stretch, dueled under a drive past the furlong grounds, wandered outward when clearing a sixteenth out, was corrected with right handed asking and held
firm. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU had speed to the inside of rivals, eased back out of a tight spot heading to the turn, came off the inside with three eighths
remaining, circled four wide into the lane and finished with good energy to be along for the place. SUBJECT TO CHANGE had speed three deep early on,
dropped in to the two path to set the pace, battled inside the winner from the quarter pole past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BAPTIZE THE BOY
broke a step slow, was ridden off the pace three wide and failed to respond. SEANOW had speed between foes, was under asking trying to keep pace
towards the inside leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on and faded.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD WALK assumed the early lead without urging, set the pace slightly off the rail, opened up in mid stretch and held sway under steady
handling. LUMINIST , rank in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail throughout and rallied late. DANCING SOPHIA
, three deep chasing the pace around the far turn, finished willingly outside horses. MELIPONINI BEE , fractious during the post parade, raced inside
horses, chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. CIRCLE HOME lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace. BESSIE
BLUE , no factor, swung to the four path in upper stretch. COFFEE BEAN , rated back off the early lead, raced outside the winner down the backstretch,
chased the one to the stretch and faltered.

BOONDOGGLE , bumped at the break, recovered quickly and rated kindly outside a rival, edged up three wide mid turn, went after the leader a sixteenth
later, secured command in upper stretch, spurted away after being put to a drive past the three sixteenths and eagerly widened while kept to task. DIVINE
PROPORTION drifted in at the break and bumped with the winner, dropped off the early pace, raced three wide into the lane, eased out and finished up
willingly to gain the place. HIGH PRINT stalked towards the inside, eased out and moved up to be the closest pursuer past the furlong grounds, flattened out
late and just saved the show. FIVE STAR PHIL , squeezed back at the break, raced well back past the five sixteenths, saved ground into the lane and
rallied. RED MESA chased off the inside, circled four wide with a bit of an advance into the lane, failed to sustain past the three sixteenths and weakened.
STEVETHEVANDRIVER opened up early and set the pace two wide, was joined nearing the quarter pole, fought on to upper stretch then gave way.
ENANO ASTRAY saved ground, was pulled up and taken wide leaving the far turn and walked off.

stretch, bid for the lead in upper stretch, dueled inside the winner and just missed in a sharp effort. DIXIE DRAWL saved ground on the turn, moved to the
three path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. LORD WINSALOT disputed the pace outside OUTLIER and tired in upper stretch. OUTLIER hugged the

Footnotes
NATHAN DETROIT saved ground early while in range and under some rating, eased out and edged up between runners into the far turn, was kept in by
BROKER'S REWARD when trying to advance three wide in upper stretch, altered in towards the rail soon after, bid inside the leaders past the furlong
grounds, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch and prevailed following a steady drive. SIGILOSO rated in range while outside a rival, moved up into the
far turn, was put to a hard ride leaving the three eighths, bid three wide outside the leader with a quarter to go, exchanged a brush with KING'S HONOUR
dueling in upper stretch, gained a slim lead a furlong out, lost command in deep stretch, made one last lunge but just missed in a gritty effort. KING'S
HONOR (IRE) cleared early, was nursed along two wide on the front end, braced for a challenge nearing the lane, brushed with SIGILOSO soon into the
stretch, fought on after being headed in mid stretch, stayed on to late then gave way grudgingly. BROKER'S REWARD rated off the inside while trailing,
circled four wide making some headway into the stretch, continued progress outside rivals past the sixteenth pole then failed to seriously sustain. CLOSER
LOOK was hustled up soon after the break and stalked the pace, saved ground while under pressure leaving the far turn, chased inside rivals and faded.

Footnotes
TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK , four deep stalking the pace around the turn, secured command near the three sixteenths pole then drew off under steady
handling. MADE MY WISH , three wide on the turn, chased the pace, was well placed in upper stretch, failed to menace the winner late and gamely held the
place. MUSIC QUEEN bore out leaving the starting gate, raced five deep turning for home, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole and rallied mildly.
ASHARA , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. HEART
OF SECRETS , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and passed tired horses. PERFECT MOVE saved ground on the
turn and weakened. AT THE GATE lacked speed and was caught in traffic near the three sixteenths pole. BIZZY BIZZY was shuffled back leaving the
backstretch. SPEAK YOUR MIND came in leaving the starting, chased the pace in the two path around the turn and faltered.
