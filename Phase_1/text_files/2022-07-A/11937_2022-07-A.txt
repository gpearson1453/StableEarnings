Footnotes
GAV'S DREAM GIRL tracked the leader throughout, assumed command at the quarter pole and was gradually drawing away in the late stages. DOO DAH
took command early, was collared at the quarter pole by the winner and held on well through the stretch to be unchallenged for second place. BOSSKAYE
made a mild bid while three wide on the turn advancing around runners and finished outside down the lane with some late energy to capture third. FOREST
VIXEN stalked between rivals, contended at the quarter pole just behind the front runners and levelled out through the stretch. RETAIL THERAPIST saved
ground throughout, stalked inside on the turn, began to weaken midway on the far turn and had little to offer down the lane. SMART IRENE trailed inside
after the break, was ridden through the backstretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
GREEN GABLES attended the pace from outside, edged clear about the three-eighths going two wide on the turn, was kept to the task in the stretch and
held sway. CREEMORE exchanged a light bump after the break, stalked the leaders three then four wide on the turn, came out a few paths at the top of the
stretch, kept on late to gain the place over KNOW HOW (GB), who was urged forward at the break and set the pace inside the winner, switched outside that
rival about the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch but lost second. HEKLA'S AURA settled off the pace, went two wide on the turn, came out at the furlong
marker for room and ran on evenly. INFINITE PASSION raced well back early, swung three wide into the stretch then came out further, failed to threaten.
LEGAL STEPS exchanged a light bump after the start, went four to five wide on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
MY BABY JANE chased inside, faded.

Footnotes
BASALT STREET was close to the pace early tracking, took over at the three eighths pole to quickly open up through the turn and won going away down
the stretch. KERICS BEAUTY stalked outside of foes early, advanced through the turn picking up positions but could not threaten the winner who was long
gone. KHOZZY VALINTINE was near the back in the beginning, angled out three wide on the turn between runners and closed belatedly to garner third.
SIMPLE SOUVENIR stalked while inside down the backstretch, steadied at the three eighths pole, was shuffled through the turn to trail and finished with
some late interest on the rail to get a minor share. SNEAKY REBEL stalked mid pack between runners, roused on the turn splitting rivals and flattened out
down the lane. MAJESTIC HORIZON was off a little slow on the break, steadied briefly entering the turn, rallied mildly while angling out four wide mid turn
and ran evenly while widest through the stretch. A. A. SWEET CHILLI showed speed early, was collared at the three eighths pole, weakened on the rail
through the turn backing through the field and was not persevered with in the stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 SIMPLE SOUVENIR AGAINST #3

Footnotes
DEJAS TOO settled three wide early, moved in a bit on the far turn then cut inside rivals turning for home while gaining, bid up the inside, took the lead and
edged clear from the lone challenger. PRINCESS HALIME was caught outside four to five wide early, advanced still outside and four to five deep on the far
turn, made a bid in upper stretch, lugged in a bit in the stretch and couldn't kick on with the winner. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA settled at the rear racing two
to three wide, was still unhurried into the far turn, came out in upper stretch, kicked on well to get up for show honors. RIDE THE WIND was
forwardly-positioned heading to the first turn but ceded the lead, switched outside that rival early up the backstretch, bid three wide turning for home, lacked
the needed late kick. A MAIZE ZING DOTIE moved clear outside two wide on the first turn, set the pace, had no extra. SUPER LEGGERA exchanged a
bump at the break, settled toward the back two to three wide, swung seven deep into the stretch and ran on evenly. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND stalked from
outside two to three wide, chased from between runners turning for home, faltered and faded. GORMLEY GIRL exchanged a bump at the start, tucked in
behind the leading pair in the second flight, saved ground but dropped back and faded. MOMMA CARRIE raced near the inside throughout and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
HELLUVA HOLIDAY tracked just behind the dueling pacesetters inside on the turn, angled out in early stretch for a clear path and was full of run late
drawing away easily the final eighth. I'M A BOURBON GIRL chased the early speed, challenged for the lead at the five sixteenths pole battling until the
eighth pole where she put away that one on her inside only have little response for the fast closing winner on the outside. SOUPER SUNDAY broke inwards
at the start, took command to lead into the turn, was headed at the five sixteenths pole and battled with that rival through to the wire giving away in the late
stages to lose third. BEDAZZLE ME broke sharp and was allowed to settle at the back, was roused mid turn and began picking off runners while weaving
through traffic finding her best stride late on the fence. CANADIANSWEETHEART stalked three wide early, made a mild run outside of runners into the
stretch and stalled through the lane. FAST'N SEXY was bumped at the start and trailed early, roused throughout the turn and passed tiring rivals through
the lane. MORE GELATO was mid pack throughout while racing three wide and never reached contention. CELTIC REVIVAL saved ground while ridden on
the turn and offered little for the stretch drive. JUNGLE TIGRESS retreated inside on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ASTROLOGICAL got away well then allowed to settled, shifted in gradually up the backstretch, advanced inside foes early on the turn, came out three wide
late on that bend commencing a bid, struck the lead just past the three-sixteenths, was clear coming to the furlong marker and kept to the task late.
TWISTER ALERT settled off the pace, advanced some outside rivals late on the turn coming four wide into the stretch, kept on to get the place. SILVER
BULLET LADY stalked the pace, went three wide on the turn, was within striking range turning for home but evened out late. EXIT STAGE RIGHT attended
the pace two wide, took over just past the three-eighths, was collared in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. FOXY DIVA broke a step slowly,
settled off the inside going four to five wide turning for home and improved position. NEW PLAY reared and tossed her head several times at the start
spotting the field several lengths, swung six wide turning for home and was not a threat. INDIAN MUSIC was encouraged forward some to force the pace
inside, overtaken early on the turn, gave way in the stretch. SUSPICIOUS chased briefly about three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC D'ORO rated kindly on the rail behind the leader tracking through the first half, angled outside for a clear run entering the stretch while two wide
taking command at the three sixteenth pole and had enough in the late stages to win comfortably. GAL IN A RUSH was brushed by a rival at the break,
trailed into the turn, started her run mid turn while angling outside of runners eight wide and finished strongly gaining steadily through the stretch.
BREATHING FIRE was brushed at the start, stalked on the rail in mid pack early, waited behind runners on the turn and found a seam in the three path mid
stretch rallying between runners. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY was near the back outside runners early, commenced her run mid turn and weaved through
traffic in the stretch showing good late energy for a minor share. MARIE MACKAY took command early getting to the inside, was headed at the quarter pole
and gave way on the rail in the final furlong. LOYALTY was four wide throughout stalking, loomed into contention at the top of the stretch only to weaken the
final eighth. LEMIEUX was shuffled back to trail early, was steadied briefly entering the turn and could not offer a finishing kick while inside through the
stretch. ADVERSITY chased the speed while between rivals, started to fade through the turn and was empty for the drive. FROM ABOVE was between
runners chasing the pace early, weakened midway through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
VERDEJO settled outside off the pace, advanced three to four wide on the turn, asked for run at the top of the stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and
drew clear. OL' BLONDIE settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, came out a bit turning into the stretch, was running strong late and got up
for place at the wire. HALFINTHEWRAPPER broke awkwardly and a length slowly, was mildly coaxed forward and moved clear to dictate the pace near but
just off the inside, was collared by the sixteenth pole and lost the place late. TAKOTA raced between foes in the second group two to three wide into the
turn, lacked the needed late kick. MRS. DEL raced near the inside off the pace, altered outside a foe near the furlong marker and ran on evenly. ISHIYAYA
chased inside, came out a bit turning for home, weakened. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD broke a bit awkwardly, trailed racing near the inside and was never a
threat.

Footnotes
ERASMO'S GIRL trailed early and commenced a sustained run circling runners five wide through the turn, assumed command on the outside at the
sixteenth pole and was drawing away late. ELEANOR POWELL ran well through the lane in the four path splitting foes and overcoming some traffic issues
at the eighth pole when she lost her path and had to re rally just getting up late for place. UNDER THE EYE tracked the early speed and took command at
the mid turn point, opened up at the quarter pole but weakened the last sixteenth just missing second money. TWISTED PATH tracked just behind the
frontrunners outside early, made a bid at the top of the stretch between foes and faded the final eighth while drifting inwards settling for a minor share.
AWILDAS TREASURE waited just behind the pace on the turn, was between runners in contention at the top of the stretch and ran evenly in the late
stages. BOSSALINA was near the back in the beginning and passed tiring runners through the stretch. PIPESTONE stalked three wide on the turn, was
asked entering the stretch and had little to offer while between runners through the lane. SILENT GUROO was away alertly for the lead, headed at the five
sixteenth pole quickly surrendering the lead and stopped on the rail through the stretch.

Footnotes
PHIL IN ECHO settled off the pace two to three wide, was given some flagging by the crop late up the backstretch, began to pick it up two then three wide
on the far turn, swung five deep turning for home, drove past late under steady urging. NADIABIZNIZ was forwardly-positioned heading to the first turn then
eased back and tucked in behind the pacesetter content to track two to three wide, was within striking distance turning for home, put to steady urging, bid
between nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. FRAC TALES was keen and a bit rank early having difficulty cornering into the first turn while pulling
clear, set the pace racing just off the rail, was challenged in late stretch and yielded grudgingly. SKINNY DIPPIN settled off the pace three to four wide,
maintained roughly that path throughout and ground on in the stretch to improve position. SUSPICIOUS MINDS was mildly coaxed forward at the break,
tracked near the inside but just off the rail, raced two to three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. JOLIE DAVINA exchanged a light bump at the break,
tucked in early saving ground nearing the inside, advanced up the rail heading to the far turn, continued to save ground and got through along the rail in the
stretch but evened out. SILENT CREEK exchanged a light bump at the start, was unhurried early moving nearer the rail, swung six wide turning for home
and ran on with mild late interest. HIPPIE CHICK raced mid-pack inside saving ground, moved out leaving the far turn, was empty for the stretch run.
T'PRING moved in two to three wide for the first turn, dropped back on the far turn and faded. MY LAST DREAM chased three to four wide, came up empty.
