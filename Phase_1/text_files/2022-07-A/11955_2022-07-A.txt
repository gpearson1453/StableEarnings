Footnotes
AFRICAN HERITAGE well rated tracked loose leaders reeling in rivals on the far turn wresting the lead near mid track in upper stretch taking over from
there to win going away. RIP THORN hustled up early pressured from the outset dueling abreast foe through the far turn proving no match for outside
pressure in upper stretch angling out to the four path holding on for place. NEPAL UP raced evenly off the pace lagging to the far turn losing ground to
upper stretch gaining late in the six path. WILE E PEYOTE away alertly pressured the pace through the backside dueling inside of rival on the far turn,
extended in the two path upper stretch wearing down late. PICKFORD moved evenly off the pace saving ground to upper stretch needing more late. HIGH
ROLLING DUDE played no factor. MR. UNIVERSE was always outrun.
