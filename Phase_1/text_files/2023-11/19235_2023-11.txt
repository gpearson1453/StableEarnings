Footnotes
ABBY'S LUCKY GIRL raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four
path to began a bid nearing the quarter pole, bumping with AMERICAN ODALISQUE around that time, and pulled clear in the final furlong. MARLEY'S
GHOST raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around
the second bend and chased the winner home to the wire. AMERICAN ODALISQUE raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle
of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path coming around the second turn, came out a lane wide entering the stretch, bumping with
ABBY'S LUCKY GIRL in the process, was blocked by that rival in upper stretch and outkicked from there. OPINIONATED raced in the two path around the
first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and weakened in the lane. SUPER MONEY saved ground
around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend and tired in the lane. POWER AND GLORY bumped
repeatedly with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, came
around the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. VOODOO PRIESTESS raced off the pace in the four path through the opening half mile, came
around the far turn in the three path and showed no kick. TIME GOES FAST trailed well behind the field while racing in the three path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and made up some ground in the lane but was not a factor. DIVINE SPIRIT bumped hard with
the horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far bend and faded in the stretch.
