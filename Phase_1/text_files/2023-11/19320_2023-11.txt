Footnotes
OH GLORIOUS DAY chased the pace three wide, engaged the leader at the top of the stretch, dropped back a bit before the furlong marker, dung in late
under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. QUICK RENDEZVOUS was bumped at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured
pace into the stretch, edged clear before the furlong maker and just missed hanging on. MY DANIELA trailed down the backstretch and found her best stride
late in the four path. WINGS OF HEAVEN had good early speed along the inside then faded. MAC'S CAILIN failed to menace. THIRTY SOMETHING
pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half. MERRIEMELOUIE broke inward bumping QUICK RENDEZVOUS at the start, had speed into
the turn then weakened.

LADY JASPER pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch, was put to right handed urging before the furlong marker, surged two wide under a
strong hand ride through the final stages and was along in time. BETTER HALF made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then
couldn't handle the winner. CHICA CHULA allowed to settle, offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn then leveled off and finished well clear for third.
MIZZEN THE POINT a bit slow from the start, was no factor. ONE RICH KITTEN pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK failed to menace. COWGIRLS HUMOR was no factor. MOBIL DREAM STAR wide early, was no threat. SOMETHING LUCKY

Footnotes
CAGUA was bounced around between horses at the start, trailed down the backstretch, split horses two wide while closing rapidly nearing the quarter pole,
shifted five wide at the top of the stretch, rallied to make the lead late and drew clear. J P'S GLADYS never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the
stretch and finished second best. SABELLE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead briefly near the furlong marker then was outfinished.
LA LIMA sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail into the stretch and was outfinished. CITY SIGNS was bumped at the start
and failed to menace. GRAND PRIZE drifted inward at the start, vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then faded. FLYING BUSINESS was bumped
between horses at the start then no factor. ADULTING drifted inward at the start and had brief speed. HIGH HEAVEN also bumped between horses at the
start, was outrun. SWEET BELEN veered in at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to his inside, had good early speed four wide and was through
after a half.

Footnotes
BUCKEYE SKY had speed from the start four wide, gained a narrow lead nearing the turn, set the balance of the pace under brisk pressure and wore down
rivals in a game effort. PAINT THE TOWN never far back, loomed boldly five wide on the turn and gamely gained second in a stretch long drive. TEAM
LEYENDECKER pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch then along the inside through the stretch and was outfinished. THE PINK Z led briefly
three wide just after the break, prompted the pace the balance of the trip and was outfinished. KNOCK WOOD sped to a narrow lead along the inside soon
after the start, dropped back a bit on the turn, shifted six wide entering the stretch then came on again late. HITE failed to menace. OUR BUCKWHEAT miss
stepped at the start and was no threat.

Footnotes
THE MIRACLE KIUT never far back, split horses two wide past the three sixteenths pole, dropped to the rail while making the lead and proved best under
left handed urging while fully extended. BODIL unhurried early, swung wide, rallied six wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. YOU NAME IT
stalked the early pace, loomed boldly five wide into the stretch then was outfinished. SPICE ICE trailed into the turn, swung wide and had a mild late rally
eight wide. SEEYOUINMOTOWN allowed to settle, improved position seven wide into the stretch then leveled off. GO GIRL dueled fore the early lead three
wide then inside a rival through the turn and faded in the stretch. WHYNAUGHTY battled for the lead four then two wide and was through after a half.
SWEET OUTLOOK pressed the early pace five wide, gained a narrow advantage into the turn, battled to the top of the stretch then came up empty.
WEEKENDING had speed into the turn then gave way.
