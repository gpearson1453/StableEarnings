Footnotes
RAGUEL set the pace inside of a pressing rival, dueled with that one around the far turn, sparred gamely while clinging to an advantage through upper
stretch then shook free leaving the furlong grounds. TIRELESS pressed two wide, bid and dueled around the far turn, sparred neck-and-neck through upper
stretch, but was turned away leaving the furlong grounds, yielded and safely held place. BOURBON'S FAULT was a bit restless in the starting gate awaiting
the off, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, came under urging in the two path around the far turn, then stayed on along with an outer rival
in the final furlong and gained show in the late stages. PHREDDIE MAC laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced while tipping to the three path turning
for home and ran on willingly. MANDATORY MEETING broke inwardly before being hustled forward to achieve an inside tracking position early on, entered
the far turn as the embattled leading pair's main pursuer, chased outside of them around that bend, but failed to keep pace while drifting inwardly in upper
stretch and tired. TUSCANY'S EAGLE broke a step slow while last away, trailed along the inside, shifted out to the five path down the backstretch, then took
the far turn in the three path and improved inside of rival entering the lane. SHERIFF JOE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace three wide, pursued in the
five path around the far turn and faded. PUBLIUS stalked three wide, chased while failing to keep pace approaching the far turn and weakened in the four
path around that bend.

Footnotes
LEGALIZE set the pace along the inside, kicked away from an outer chaser in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth as the
aforementioned for sustained pursuit, yet held sway safely. EL MAGNIFICO pressed outside of the leader, required pressure to sustain pressure around the
turn, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, yet kept on well through the final furlong to remain clear of show. LINEBACKER tracked two wide, tipped outside
of the top pair turning for home and chased them home willingly. SAN SIRO tracked along the inside, chased around the turn and was best of the rest. TOP
OF THE STREET raced off of the pace, took the turn in the three path and moved up. ANTHEM KING pursued from the two path and failed to menace.
GOLD SEARCH tugged between horses early on culminating in steadying back leaving the chute, raced well back in the four path and improved mildly.
KISSTHEMOON was last away, railed early on, advanced between rivals passing the nine sixteenths pole, laid off of the pace in the two path aiming
between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but drifted in and tired. SMACKOVER LIME lacked speed along the inside and made little impact.
ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT raced forwardly in the four path but gave way around the turn. FULL ARMOR saved ground in midpack and weakened. DAILY
GRIND was fractious in the starting gate, lacked speed in the three path, resented kickback behind rivals and faltered between horses at the nine sixteenths
pole raced at the rear into the turn, then was done early and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LAGYNOS tracked in the four path under a snug hold around the first turn, pressed three wide around the far turn, vied in the four path entering the lane,
drove clear approaching midstretch and held sway thereafter. FOOTPRINT tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn before
committing to a rail charge in upper stretch, slipped through to offer a bid inside of the clear leader in midstretch but was kept at bay through the final
furlong. GORILLA TREK settled off of the pace in the two path, tracked behind the main group in the three to four path around the far turn, fanned six wide
into the lane, rallied in upper stretch to be within range of the leader coming to the furlong grounds, but leaned inwardly and flopped back to his left lead at
the that juncture then evened out through the late stages. STEELER MISCHIEF set the pace in the two path, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far
turn, but shifted just off the inside entering the lane before being headed in upper stretch, and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. TIFAREEH
raced off of the pace in the three path, but pulled under strong restraint behind foes around and exiting the first turn, pursued around the far turn, tipped to
the five path and between horses entering the lane and lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead. MISSION READY brushed the inner half of the starting
gate while coming out a step slow, trailed around both turns and got outrun. ASPENITE stalked outside of the pace setter, vied with that one and an outer
bidder around the far turn, but faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DENIM AND PEARLS tracked two wide and between horses, inched closer tipping from the three to four path to take aim outside of the leading pair turning
for home, ranged up to bid in upper stretch and drove clear. ICE COLD pursued from midpack in the four path, surpassed an outer rival turning for home
before tipping to the five path entering the lane, then rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole. WEE BIT O MISCHIEF was void of early speed, trailed in the
three path around the turn, then rallied two wide and between horses through the lane and surged between foes to gain show at the wire. TARIFA was
restless in the starting gate, then leaned inwardly at the start, raced in the bit tracking behind the leaders down the backstretch, came under moderate
coaxing in the two path around the turn, then chased between horses in the final furlong, bid for show in the final sixteenth but was outfinished by an inner
rival. ASTERNIA set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, gave way and lost show to an outer pair at the wire.
AUTUMN CHILL broke a step slow before being put to a bit of crowded quarters between a pair of foes at the start, advanced along the inside entering the
backstretch, but raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, then lacked a rally in the three path. LOOKSTER pressed two wide but faded between
horses in upper stretch. MO SENSE threw her head at the start, then saved ground well back to no avail. FLOORED laid off of the pace in the three path
and between horses, fanned to the six path entering the lane and tired on her left lead. ZADORSKY made little impact from the four to five path. BALLADRY
stalked the top pair from the four path but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
PERFECT SHOT pressed outside of the leader, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. SHILOH'S MISTRESS was
forced to bump an inner rival and steadied as an outer foe crossed across her path in the opening sixteenth, then brushed an inner rival into the first turn
while settling off of the pace two wide, picked up stride inside of foes and a path off the rail into the far turn, swung out to the five path entering the lane and
sustained a rally to gain place late. LITTLE JAMIE set the pace in the two path around the first turn, showed the way along the inside as an outer rival
applied pressure around the far turn, got headed by that bidder in upper stretch, gave way through the final furlong and lost place late. FLIGHT TO PARIS
tracked in the two to three path around the first turn, pursued from within striking range entering the lane, but only managed to chase in upper stretch and
yielded between horses in the final furlong. MISHKA pursued from midpack in the three to four path early on, but lacked a response to urging around the far
turn and failed to menace. CHURNING BERNI lacked speed in the three to five path around the first turn, trailed in the four path around the far turn then
improved position. JUST A COED laid close up along the inside, stalked from the pocket exiting the first turn, but chased under urging around the far turn
then weakened. OH MY MIA transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe while getting pinched back between horses in the opening stages, then
saved ground well back but to no avail. FUN LOVING raced towards the rear in the four to six path around the first turn, then took the far turn in the five path
before tiring. LEGAL DECEIVER was bumped by outer rivals early on, then took lighter contact into the first turn, pursued from midpack along the inside but
faded in the three path and between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
BAND OF GOLD tracked four wide, sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the clear leader while hanging on her left lead through the lane, slowly closed
in inside the final sixteenth and narrowly reeled her in at the wire. PIN UP BETTY vied for the lead in the three path, built a clear margin tucking to the two
path at the three furlong pole, showed the way in hand drifting back to the three path entering the lane, was set down in upper stretch, held sway from an
outer pursuer into the final furlong, but tired in the final sixteenth as that one offered a bid and got nailed at the wire. SPEAK UP stumbled a stride after the
start, raced at the rear in the six path, quickly gained ground in the five path and outside of foes around the turn, but leveled off and edged show in the final
furlong. CONTOUR stalked two wide, tipped three wide into the turn, chased between foes turning for home then gradually yielded. LUMINOUS RULER
vied along the inside, but chased her outer clearing counterpart to the three furlong pole and faded turning for home. WASHASHORE pursued from midpack
along the two path, edged between horses around the turn but failed to menace. ROUND THE TOWN lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. MY
SEXY BLONDE broke slowly, raced off of the pace in the three path and made little impact. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA trailed in the five to four path into the
turn and was outrun. WILLOWY stalked along the inside, came under a drive into the turn, but was shuffled back behind a faltering foe turning for home and
weakened.

WHO DEY raised his head leaving the gates before taking contact from an outer rival at the start, shifted outwardly in the chute, pulled under a firm hold in
the six path entering the backstretch, brushed and steadied slightly between rivals at the five furlong pole, pursued in the four path among foes around the
turn, tipped out to take aim five wide entering the lane bid approaching midstretch and drove clear. BERGEN was brushed by an outer rival and bumped an
inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to gain
place late. INFORMED PATRIOT pressed the leader from the four path around the turn, vied four deep into the turn, led briefly in upper stretch but was
outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and lost place late. KNICKS STORM tracked three to two wide and between horses into the turn, bid
inside of the leader along with an inner rival entering the lane, vied between horses in upper stretch but yielded nearing the final sixteenth. MYSTIK DAN
chased two wide and between horses into the turn, tucked down after an inner foe faltered, ranged up to offer a rail bid entering the lane, vied in upper
stretch but tired entering the final furlong. MARKET STREET set the pace in the three path into the turn, encountered bids from rivals on both sides entering
the lane and faded between horses in upper stretch. MI OSCURO SECRETO broke a step slow and leaned inwardly at the start, then was floated outwardly
while trailing down the backstretch, lagged behind, then improved in the four path around the turn, got floated to the nine path entering the lane and moved
up. VITEMENT pursued from the inside, tapped on the brakes behind a rival at the half mile pole, tipped to the two path into the turn then failed to menace.
BARKSDALE broke slowly while leaning outwardly, laid off of the pace in the seven to six path into the turn, but drifted to the eight path entering the lane
and weakened. THE PROCESS stalked in the five path but faltered between horses turning for home. CANDYMAKER vied along the inside, but yielded at
the half mile pole, faltered around the turn and was eased through the lane.

TRACK PHANTOM vied two wide, showed the way inside of a bidder while a bit off the rail around the far turn, kicked away from that one entering the lane,
widened under a drive and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. LAT LONG raced forwardly two wide and between horses early on, tracked then shifted
outside of foes and to the five path leaving the three furlong pole, then rallied in the six path in upper stretch to edge place inside the final furlong. D DAY
SKY bumped with an inner rival soon after the start and was firmly taken in hand, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the seven path in upper
stretch, delayed changing leads until the furlong grounds then ran on. DOMINGO lacked speed two wide, fanned to the seven to eight path in upper stretch
and stayed on. STOP THE PRESS tracked along the inside, chased two wide and between horses around the far turn and kept on mildly. DROPTOP
CADDY lacked speed three to two wide, then four wide around the far turn, swung to the eight path entering the lane and moved up. SURF CITY stalked
three wide, bid outside of the leader and from the three path at the three furlong pole, but was turned away entering the lane and tired between horses. TOP

inside and failed to factor between horses. MR. FAVERSHAM was jostled between rivals and pinched at the start, trailed and got outrun. LOU'S LEGACY
broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, steadied between horses into the first turn, pulled inside, checked behind rivals at the nine sixteenths pole

Footnotes
JUST STEEL leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, chased four wide, pressed under urging at the three furlong pole, bid in the five path entering the
lane, vied through midstretch while forging an advantage and inched away. AGOO tracked along the inside and sustained a rail grind to gain place at the
sixteenth pole. NORMANDY HERO tracked three wide and between horses, entered the lane blocked behind the leading group, altered course to the six
path to be outside of them entering the final furlong, but only offered a mild kick to edge show. MOLLY'S TOWN vied two wide and between horses, sparred
with a pair of outer rivals while entering the lane in the three path, got headed nearing the furlong grounds and yielded between horses. BOOTH took light
contact from an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn between horses, floated to the four path entering the lane then
yielded passing the furlong grounds. GABARRA raced forwardly between horses early on, but yielded after a quarter mile, trailed around the turn, swung out
to the six path in upper stretch an surpassed tired rivals. BOWSTREET rushed after breaking flat-footedly, sparred with a pair of outer rivals into the turn,
but weakened inside of a trio of rivals at the five sixteenths pole. DIVIETO snagged the outer part of the starting gate upon leaving it, then was slow to
recover, raced off of the pace in the four to three path, faded and was found to have bled.

Footnotes
INTRICATE tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while pursuing from the pocket with run around the far turn, smoothly split the leaders two wide,
gained an advantage in upper stretch, surged clear at the furlong grounds and was ridden out under moderate urging. THORPEDO ANNA hopped slightly
and broke slow, recovered to track in the four to five path and outside of foes around the first turn, stalked three wide while inching closer around the far
turn, bid in the four path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, edged place in the final furlong and lasted from an outer
bidder late. CENTRAL AVENUE transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, was roused shifting to
the four path around the far turn, chased in upper stretch, tipped further out at the furlong grounds and stayed on late to miss reaching place. DOZEN
DIAMONDS shifted outside of the clear leader to stalk that one from the four path into the backstretch, chased two wide and between horses under coaxing
around the far turn, bid drifting to the three path while among foes entering the lane, but allowed a seam for the eventual winner in the process, got
outkicked by that one in upper stretch, lost place at the sixteenth pole and was bested for show. GIN GIN bumped an inner rival causing a chain-reaction at
the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased in the two path around the far turn and failed to menace. PURLOIN broke a step
slow and took contact from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, shifted out to the four path entering the lane and made little impact.
HERE'S THE SPIDER received a bump from an outer rival at the start, bumped an inner foe and steadied back in the process, trailed in the three path,
floated to the five path entering the lane and was outrun. WEST SUNSET tugged clear in the three path around the first turn, settled into stride before saving
ground showing the way from chasing rivals around the far turn, but faltered inside of a trio of bidders in upper stretch and caved through the final furlong.

Footnotes
HONOR MARIE trailed early on, inched closer in the three path into the far turn, swung six wide and outside of rivals while sustaining his charge entering
the lane, bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong and drove clear. REAL MEN VIOLIN tracked along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn,
encountered traffic turning for home, tipped in for clear rail sailing entering the lane, slipped through to offer a challenge in upper stretch, but was outkicked
by an outer bidder in the process, then kept on to hold place. STRETCH RIDE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, sustained position entering
the lane, but was outkicked by bidders on either side in upper stretch, then chased onto remain clear of the rest. RISK IT stalked the leading trio from the
two to three path, but steadied inching closer to them approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, remained rank while wrestling with the rider and steadying
repeatedly behind rivals until settling at the half mile pole, tracked in the three path around the far turn, tipped to the five path while getting outkicked by an
outer rival entering the lane and chased to secure a minor placing. AWESOME ROAD settled off of the pace in the two path, smoothly shifted out to the four
path entering the backstretch, crept closer approaching the far turn before offering a four wide bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied with inner rivals
turning for home, but faded between horses in upper stretch. DANCING GROOM laid off of the pace in the four to five path around the first turn and made
little impact. ONE RED CENT vied for the lead three wide, then between horses around the far turn but weakened in upper stretch. NOMOS vied for the
lead inside of a pair of rivals, then inside of a trio of foes around the far turn but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and caved through the lane.
