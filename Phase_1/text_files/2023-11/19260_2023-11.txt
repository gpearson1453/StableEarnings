Footnotes
LOCO took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
cleared ALDARIGHTTRICKS leaving the eighth pole and held on well with steady urging. The latter stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths
pole and raced close two deep on the far turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and had to settle for second. TEMPESTIVO broke in the air then
settled off the pace, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little more. RUM CUP
rounded the first turn about the five path then settled close from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in
the three path on the far turn and showed little. LUNAR MISSION saved ground and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole; to no avail. LUNAR

chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well to take third the final yards. MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated a short
lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and cleared AUBURN MILL approaching the quarter, was met midway on the far turn,

Footnotes
GHOSTLY SQUALL pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled for the lead while lugging in later yards and drew
clear nearing the wire. FANCY HER UP dueled for the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the rail on the turn and dug in
leaving the turn, but was pinched back in later yards and flattened stride from that point. RIVER REWARDS RVF gave chase, rounded the turn about the
three path and ran evenly down the lane. PURE NONSENSE saved ground. MY SISTER CLURRIE chased through the backstretch and entered the turn
near the rail, angled to the five path toward the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA'S HOUSE chased, rounded the turn about the five path, left the
turn outside and showed little in the lane. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claims of foul against the rider of Ghostly Squall for interference in later
yards, lodged by the owner and rider of Fancy Her Up, the Stewards disqualified Ghostly Squall to second place.

OVERLY CRITICAL rated close off the rail, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and took the nod in the four path approaching the head of the lane,
dueled clear nearing mid-stretch and held on well. NEPOTISM saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on
the far turn, eased out past the eighth pole and dug in to take second the final stride. MIND YOUR OWN raced with the pace inside then stalked from the
nine sixteenths pole, challenged at even terms at the three eighths pole, remained a close factor nearest the rail on the far turn, flattened stride inside the
eighth pole and was nipped from second under the wire. MARTINKELLY raced with the early pace two deep and took the nod at the nine sixteenths pole,
was met at the three eighths and contested the edge in the three path on the far turn, but gave up the lead toward the head of the lane and flattened inside
the eighth pole. GOLDEN SPOKE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail into the far turn,
angled to the five path through the turn and offered little in the lane.

Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE settled back inside on the opening turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and closed the gap in the three path on the far
turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up the final yards. FOX RED rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was caught in the final yards. MOON OVER MONTANA saved ground racing well back the
opening turn, bid leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and got up for third later yards. MAGNETRON veered out leaving the gate then
raced in the three path the first turn, eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and
passed rivals. CLASSY AMERICAN stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and
flattened in the lane. ONE MORE FACTOR ducked in leaving the gate then rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and weakened in the lane. MAKE WAY was shuffled back at the break, raced in the three path the opening turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was pinched at the start and raced well back.
