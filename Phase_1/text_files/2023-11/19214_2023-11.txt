Footnotes
TAP ANCHOR laid off of the pace three wide, pursued from the four path turning or home, rallied along with an inner rival while aiming inside of the clear
and drifting leader, offered a bid passing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. WHO'S SNOW TROUBLE vied three deep early on, cleared while tucking to the
two path with three furlongs to go, maintained a wide margin in upper stretch, but began to tire while drifting outwardly at the furlong grounds and was
caught by an inner bidder in the final sixteenth. MR BIG STUFF pressed two wide and between the leading pair early on, eased back to stalk into the turn
before taking an awkward step approaching the three furlong pole, recovered to chase in the three path turning for home, offered a rail rally through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole and leveled off. PLEASANT DESTINY prompted along the inside, chased a
clearing outer counterpart around the turn and gave way. PERSUADE broke a step slow at the start, failed to respond to riders urging and lagged behind the
rest into the turn, then surpassed a tiring rival and never got involved. NON FUNGIBLE tracked along the inside but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BABY GUNDIN stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid turning for home, assumed command entering the lane and drew off under a drive.
LA TOURISTA stalked along the inside under a snug hold around the the first turn, pursued behind the leader around the far turn, tipped to the four path
entering the lane, sustained a chase to vie for place between horses in the final furlong and prevailed. HOPE OVER FEAR set the pace in the two path, but
was headed by an outer rival entering the lane, gave way thereafter, then lost place to an outer rival late and saved show. KEEN CONTENDER trailed in the
two path, was urged along in the four path around the far turn, ran on mildly in the six path and missed show.

Footnotes
EXTRA HALO set a clear pace in hand around the turn, widened the margin in upper stretch and was driven home to seal the deal. LEAD FOOT pursued
from midpack in the four path, ranged up to gain place entering the lane and held that position from an outer bidder late. BARNABY lacked speed in the
three path, shifted out to the five path around the turn, then ran on outside of rivals to attempt a bid for place in the late stages, but was fended off. GREAT
RICHIE M moved forward to gain an inside tracking position passing the five furlong pole, pursued from the two path around the turn, but lacked a bid.
CAPITAL CAUSE leaned in and bumped an inner rival at the start, raced towards the rear in the two path and moved up late. STUNNEM pursued from
midpack in the three path and gave way. ALL THE RAGE was bumped by an outer rival leaving the gates and made little impact along the inside. VINO
CALDO was ridden along to pursue from midpack along the inside leaving the chute, but failed to sustain that position inside of foes with five furlongs to go
and retreated. MUNYHUNGRY stalked in the three path, lost place to an outer rival entering the lane and weakened between horses.

LAUGHINALLTHEWAY was put to a bit of crowded quarters between foes leaving the chute, lacked early speed despite heavy urging from the rider,
pursued from the five path around the turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid passing the furlong grounds, led entering
the final sixteenth and edged clear. SOLEVO tracked the embattled leading trio from the three to two path around the turn, tipped outside of them to take
aim from the six path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong grounds, drifted out slightly while meeting a pair of outer challenges
at the furlong grounds and was bested by the widest one in the final sixteenth. MY UNCLE FRANK broke a step slow and took light contact from an outer
rival at the start, raced off the pace two wide, was roused in the three path into the turn, swung seven wide entering the lane, rallied along with an outer foe
to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked soon after and leveled off. SILVER BULL broke a step slow and brushed an inner rival at the start, raced at
the rear in the two to three path, entered the lane in the five path, tipped in to maneuver around traffic nearing midstretch and improved mildly. PACIFIC
STATES vied three wide, led nearing the lane but was headed by an outer bidder leaving midstretch and faded between horses. DELTA DELTA dueled for
the lead two wide and between horses but weakened in upper stretch. NIGHT CHANT laid off of the pace in the four to six path and made little impact. BAD
BOY FOR LIFE chased along the inside, but faded at the half mile pole and was done early. CHITWOOD dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals and
weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TALKIN' CASH set a clear pace in the two to three path around the turn, then widened under a drive. DOUBLE CLUTCH chased along the inside and edged
place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds. HUNTERTOWN brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, then stayed
on well inside of foes through the late stages to gain show. ZARTOWNIS brushed with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, raced off of the pace in the two
to three path, inched forward to be between horses nearing the lane, altered course outwardly leaving the three sixteenths pole, then ran on mildly but was
outfinished by an inner foe for show. TRUST DADDY broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked the clear leader from the three to four path,
chased while failing to keep pace in upper stretch and tired between horses. IMMORTALIZATION was bumped by an inner rival at the start, was coaxed
along while pursuing in the four path and outside of rivals, fanned to the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid. BAIE LONGUE leaned inwardly at the
start and was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
CAT'S CAVE stalked in the three to four path around the first turn, moved forward to press three to two wide into the far turn, bid turning for home, led
entering the lane, maintained an advantage from her inner stubborn counterpart through midstretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. ANNA'S WISH
set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's bid around the far turn, got headed entering the lane, fought on doggedly through midstretch but
yielded late. HUSH IT HONEY broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, loomed a danger from the pocket around the far turn, shifted off the inside
entering the lane, but only managed to chase the top pair evenly thereafter. ABOVE THE SUN raced at the rear along the inside, was urged along in the two
path around the far turn and improved inside of rivals in upper stretch. ROCK STAR DOCTOR lacked speed in the three to four path, spun for home in the
five path and failed to factor. PUCKERED laid off of the pace in the four path, lacked a response to urging around the far turn and tired on her left lead.
BOLD BABY pressed outside of the leader, but yielded between foes into the far turn and weakened around that bend.

Footnotes
TRIAL was fractious in the starting gate, lacked speed, commenced an advance in the four path into the turn, tucked to the two path nearing the lane,
sustained progress while taking aim outside of the leading pair in midstretch and drove past them at the sixteenth pole. BEDAZZLE 'EM set the pace along
the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering the lane, repelled that rival passing the furlong grounds but was bested by a wider bidder entering the
final sixteenth. CHARM OF THE SONG broke outwardly lacked speed in the two to three path around the turn, entered the lane in the five path before
altering to the seven path in upper stretch, then offered a late rally outside of foes to gain show late. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF pursued from midpack in the
two to three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane and ran on in pursuit while one paced. HOW SOON IS NOW stalked along the inside, bid outside
of the leader and from the four path entering the lane, but was turned away in midstretch and weakened late. SUMMERINTAHOE broke slowly and steadied
back behind crowded quarters at the start, lacked speed in the four to five path, then shifted inwardly while improving in midstretch. TIZ SWEET EMOTION
was urged along off of the pace in the three path and tired. LADY DRILLER broke a step slow, saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. WONDER OF
YOU pressed two wide, chased the leader around the turn, but faded once floated to the five path entering the lane. CALADIUM broke slowly, lagged behind
around the turn and was outrun.

STRONG QUALITY set the pace, built a clear margin with a half mile to go, showed the way well in hand around the far turn, responded once set down in
upper stretch, widened while being shown a right handed crop through midstretch and was put to wraps nearing the final sixteenth. JOHNY'S FIREBALL
steadied out of tight rail quarters early on, trailed the field in the two path, gained in the four path around the far turn to gain place nearing the five sixteenths
pole, but failed to threaten the clear leader and was second best. THE REDS stalked three wide, but was outmoved for place by an outer foe turning for
home, gave way thereafter yet held show. UNDERDRESSED tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. NATIVE THUNDER stalked
two wide and between horses, chased the clearing leader approaching the far turn, but weakened into that bend and was done early.

Footnotes
HOT AND SULTRY set a clear pace in the three to two path into the turn, widened her margin around the turn, opened up in the four path in upper stretch,
then drifted out through the final furlong while much the best. NOSTALGIC was slow into stride, trailed in the four path into the turn, swung to the seven path
entering the lane, rallied to bid for place inside a drifting OEUVRE in late stages and narrowly prevailed via a tight photo. OEUVRE pursued from midpack in
the two path, gained place from outer rivals entering the lane, but failed to threaten the clear leader in upper stretch, lugged out severely through the final
furlong and was nailed by an inner bidder for place. FALCONET tracked three wide, pursued in the five path around the turn, floated to the six path entering
the lane, ran on along with an outer rallying rival through midstretch, attempted a bid for place along with that one in the final sixteenth but needed more.
SHE CAN'T SING saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes to vie for show nearing midstretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. BE LIKE
WATER stalked in the four to three path into the turn, chased in the four path turning for home, but was floated to the five path entering the lane and gave
way between horses. BRAGANZA pursued from midpack in the three path and between a pair of foes into the turn, but failed to menace. HIDDEN
CONNECTION stalked along the inside, shifted out and chased from the three path around the turn, entered the lane in the four path and weakened
between horses soon after.

Footnotes
DIVINE GAL shied hard from an inner rival at the start, lacked early speed, yet picked up stride in the five to six path around the turn, rallied outside of foes
to bid at the sixteenth pole, cleared soon after and held late. SONHADOR broke slowly, raced towards the rear in the three to four path, fanned seven to
eight wide in upper stretch, rallied with a long sustained run outside of foes in the final furlong, and gained place late while belatedly closing in on the leader.
TAP THE CHAMPAGNE leaned in at the start, chased from the five to four path, tipped back to the five path entering the lane, ran on along with an outer
rival, gained place in pursuit of that one in the final sixteenth but was outkicked late. PRETTY SONG broke a beat slow, laid close up in the two path into the
turn, aimed to split foes around the bend but was blocked while lacking racing room nearing the lane, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch and ran on
evenly. RAINY NIGHT stalked in the four path, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch, but hung on her left lead and weakened between horses in the
final sixteenth. MISS ENCHANTED prompted along the inside, but faded around the turn, then kept on mildly between horses. ADELEKE broke out and
bumped a rival at the start, pressed in the three path and between horses, attempted a bid entering the lane but yielded in upper stretch. THE J FACTOR
broke slowly, trailed in the five path, entered the lane in the eight path and failed to factor. COPPERDROP raced off of the pace into the turn and made little
impact. CABERNEIGH balked behind the starting gate, set the pace, but was headed by outer bidders entering the lane and weakened between horses in
midstretch while hanging on her left lead. VINO MIZEL was bumped and forced outwardly by an inner foe at the start, chased from the four to three path into
the turn and faded.
