Footnotes
BETTERING vied three wide, dueled with an inner rival while in the three path around the turn, led approaching the lane, drifted out while inching clear
nearing the final furlong, then straightened course and held sway. MI OSCURO SECRETO broke a bit outwardly, trailed early on, moved forward in the four
path around the turn, then stayed on willingly to gain place in the final sixteenth. FAMILY FACTOR set the pace inside of a pair of prompting foes, dueled
with only a single rival while remaining a bit off of the rail around the turn, but was headed by that one turning for home and tired while hanging on his left
lead through the final furlong. POINT AT YOU prompted the pace two wide and between the leading pair, but failed to keep pace with them with a half mile
remaining and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
GOSHEN showed the way via a clear and uncontested margin while taking the turn in the two path, inched further away in upper stretch, flopped back to her
left lead leaving the sixteenth pole and held sway safely. SHE DAZZLE broke slowly but avoided crowded quarters between foes in the process, laid off of
the pace two wide, picked up stride between horses turning for home, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, then ran on while hanging on her left
lead to gain place at the furlong grounds. QUARTERFLASH trailed around the turn, swung out to the seven to eight path in upper stretch and rallied to gain
show late. FAIRY CAKES (GB) broke a bit outwardly, stalked the clear leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that one whlie drifting
outwardly on her left lead in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. EVERYOTHERWON saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. WILL
VIRGINIA DARE chased in the four path and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
TROPIC STORM lightly brushed with an outer for at the start, pressed outside of the leader early on, stalked that one from the three path around the turn,
took aim in upper stretch before bidding at the furlong grounds, then drove clear entering the final sixteenth. KENTUCKY BOURBON broke a step slow and
brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, raced at the rear two wide, fanned out to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place late. GHENT set
the pace along the inside, built a clear margin into the turn, showed the way well in hand while taking the bend in the two path, maintained a clear advantage
through upper stretch, but met an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, proved no match with a sixteenth to go, gave way and lost place late. HAROLD'S
CLOUD laid off of the pace in the four path tipped to the five path entering the lane and ran on mildly. SHOTSHELL tracked in the four path, chased entering
the lane then yielded between horses. ENJOYMENT brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, tucked in entering the
lane, but chased in upper stretch then yielded. GOLDEN REIGN raced forwardly along the inside, but faded turning for home.

DANCING NANCY set the pace in the two path, encountered a pair of outer challenges turning for home, yet inched clear in upper stretch and held late.
BLENHEIM BABY stalked in the four path and between horses, bid outside of the leader and from the three path along with an outer rival turning for home,
but subtly failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, sustained a chase and kept on to offer a rebid along with an outer foe in the final sixteenth,
but needed more and saved place. FASTA LAVISTA BABY broke half a beat slow before taking contact from an outer rival soon after the start, raced at the
rear in the two to three path, launched an advance passing the three furlong pole, chased between horses entering the lane, tipped out to take aim on the
top pair from the four path in midstretch, then sustained a grinding charge to miss reaching place. JUST AN OPINION bumped an inner rival soon after the
start, stalked along the inside, gave way around the turn to trail the field turning for home, shifted out to the four path and between horses in upper stretch,
tipped six wide in midstretch and improved mildly. GOLD DEL MAR transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe soon after the start, raced
forwardly along the inside leaving the chute, but failed to sustain position and steadied back while under strong restraint from the eleven sixteenths pole to
the nine sixteenths marker, raced at the rear in the two path into the turn, steadied subtly behind foes entering the lane, shifted out before before floated to
the seven path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. THE BIG BANSHEE shifted outwardly a stride after the start, tracked in the five path, gained ground
outside of foes into the turn, laid in striking range outside of the top pair and from the four path turning for home, but failed to sustain a bid and weakened
through the final furlong. CITY SHACK stalked two wide and between horses, tucked inwardly while failing to sustain position turning for home and
weakened on her left lead.

Footnotes
FREE LOOK tracked along the inside under snug restraint, surged up a vacated rail to bid for the lead inside of a trio of rivals at the three furlong pole, led
while tipping to the two path with five sixteenths to go, inched clear entering the lane before embracing an inner challenge in upper stretch, sparred through
the final furlong and held gamely. BEST PERFORMER tracked two wide and between horses into the turn, followed his inner counterparts bid while tucking
to the rail passing the three furlong pole, took aim inside of that new leader entering the lane, slipped through to offer a rail bid in upper stretch, dueled
through the final furlong but was denied. TITUBA vied in the three path, but was outmoved by an inner bidder while between horses into the turn, chased
that clearing leader from the four to three path into the lane, failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch and fended off an outer foe for show
thereafter. CONDONE stalked in the four path, was outmoved by an inner bidder into the turn, chased outside of rivals entering the lane, then yielded
through the lane while being fended off for show. HERINGTON ROCKET set the pace inside of pressers and in the two path, but left the rail vacated
allowing for the eventual winner to slip through and gain advantage at the three furlong pole, then faltered between foes soon after. THE CLUB trailed in the
two path and was outrun.

ALLEGE exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer vying rivals around the
far turn, shook free of them while shifting ground outwardly in upper stretch, drove clear in midstretch, then inched further away while drifting out in the final
furlong. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn, tipped to the six path inside the final three sixteenths and ran on to
edge place a sixteenth from home. MAILMAN MONEY raced off of the pace two wide, got a bit keen entering the first turn among foes, then came under
urging in pursuit of the leading trio around the far turn, got floated to the seven path leaving the three sixteenths pole and moved up. KEYSTONE FIELD
tracked three wide, bid into the far turn, vied turning for home, but was turned away by the pace setter in upper stretch and tired between horses through the
final furlong. SEARCH ENGINE exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start before taking a brush from an outer rival soon after, stalked two wide and
between horses, bid along with his outer counterpart into the far turn, vied between horses turning for home, but faded in upper stretch. NAUTILUS (BRZ)
brushed an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace three wide and failed to factor. ICARUS took contact from rivals on both sides while put to a bit
of crowded quarters at the start, raced at the rear along the inside and never got involved.

BOLT ABOVE bumped with an inner rival at the start and dropped back in the aftermath, pursued from off of the pace in the three path, smoothly split foes
while advancing between horses in upper stretch, bid outside of the leader at the furlong grounds, dueled with that one through the late stages and
prevailed. VALE broke a bit outwardly, vied for the lead outside of a rival and in the three path into the turn, forged an advantage leaving the three furlong
pole, inched clear while well in hand entering the lane, but encountered outer challenges at the furlong grounds, dueled with a bidding BOLT ABOVE
through the late stages and was grudgingly bested. LORD GRANTHAM was urged along to sustain forward position in the three to four path and between
horses around the turn, sustained stride to attempt a bid along with an inner rival in midstretch, but only managed to chase the top pair through the final
furlong. HARDY CHOICE tracked in the four to five path, ranged up to the leaders turning for home, but leveled off. MIDWAY MIRACLE trailed in the two
path, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up. LOVE SPELL bumped with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, stalked along the inside, but faded behind
a faltering foe turning for home. GOT THE BOB set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole and weakened turning
for home.

Footnotes
WIZARD OF WESTWOOD tracked two wide, bid outside of the tiring leader and in the three path at the three furlong pole, assumed command shortly after,
then drew off under a drive in upper stretch. QUADRA ISLAND laid off of the pace two wide, tipped to the three path entering the lane, ran on to claim place
from a wide drifting rival in midstretch and was second best. REALLY GOOD broke a step slow and backed out of would-be tight quarters between horses at
the start, saved ground off of the pace, shifted just off the inside entering the lane and moved up. FEARLESS SOLDIER tracked along the inside, shifted out
down the backstretch, came under heavy urging in the four path to inch closer follow the eventual winner's bid around the far turn, but lugged outwardly
while stalling out in upper stretch and faded. KIGALI pulled clear into the first turn, but was overhauled by an outer bidder approaching the five sixteenths
pole and weakened. RARIFIED FLAIR trailed, lagged behind down the backstretch and was outrun.

wide, but yielded once floated to the six path entering the lane, yet kept on through the final furlong but was denied show. GENO'S MYTH laid off of the
pace three wide, spun for home in the five path and moved up between horses. TIMING DIFFERENCE broke poorly, lacked speed in the three to five path,
picked up stride fanning eight wide into the lane and moved up. SPIN THE BOULEVARD vied for the lead along the inside, but yielded to an outer pair at
the five sixteenths pole and gave way. GIVE ME LIBERTY was jostled between horses at the start, lacked speed in the two path, improved inside o rivals in
