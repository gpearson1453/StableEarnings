COUNTRY GUY prompted outside of the pace setter, vied with that one while taking the turn in the three path, led nearing the lane then drew clear entering
the final furlong. JACK THE WHISTLE laid close up behind the leaders early on, stalked from the pocket around the bend, then chased well in pursuit of the
clearing leader through the final furlong and reached place in the late stages. RED ROCK SOLUTION leaned inwardly and was off slow, settled off of the
pace, picked up stride in the four path around the turn then sustained a rally to reach show at the wire. QUAIL set the pace inside of a prompting rival, vied
with that one around the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, yielded through the final furlong and got caught at the wire for show. MO'Z STAR
CROSS laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the five path for clear sailing between horses nearing midstretch and moved up. CANAL ST.
CUPID broke slowly, trailed in the three to four path around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace while hanging on his left
lead. YOCKEY DOODLEDANDY pursued from midpack outside of foes early on, tucked down to the three path at the three furlong pole, but hung on his left
lead through the lane and faded between horses. NATIVE REQUITE bobbled inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, chased from midpack in the five to
four path, tucked down to the two path entering the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole, then took an awkward stride at the three sixteenths pole while
weakening. BET ON BOBBY bumped with an outer rival at the start and lost his rider soon after. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE
START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
STORM HAVEN took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide and between horses, but took firm contact from an outer rival, transferred it to an
inner foe and was jostled between horses approaching the half mile pole, recovered to stalk from the two path into the turn, took aim along the inside in
upper stretch, but steadied when blocked behind the leader approaching the furlong pole, altered out and surged between rivals nearing the final sixteenth
and drove clear. MRS. SPEAKER broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start before taking contact from an inner rival soon after, tracked the top pair
from the three path around the turn, took aim four wide in upper stretch, then ran on well to gain place in the final sixteenth and prove second best. IZE
SMILING sparred for the lead outside of a pair of rivals early on, but leaned in and bumped a foe approaching the half mile pole, sustained vying position
two wide around the turn, got floated to the three path in upper stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in
the final furlong and kept on to reclaim show. GOLD PLUS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals early on, took contact from them approaching the half
mile pole, led from an outer presser into the turn, vied with that one turning for home, shook free in the two path in upper stretch, but hung on her left lead
and weakened in the final furlong. GRAY PEARL broke outwardly and bumped an outer rival a few strides after the start, lacked speed in the four path,
fanned out to the six, then eight, path in upper stretch and moved up while hanging on her left lead. FREEFORM chased off of the pace along the inside,
took the turn in the two to three path, shifted out to the five path nearing midstretch and failed to menace. BOLD EXAGGERATION broke through the gate
pre-race, then raced off of the pace in the four path, got floated to the seven path approaching midstretch and faded. MIDNIGHT WALTZ broke a step slow
and showed little. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT AT THE HALF MILE POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH.

HAROLD'S CLOUD pressed the leader from the three path, bid and vied in the three to four path around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane,
drew off under moderate urging through midstretch and was put to wraps late. ACTION SEEKER showed the way in the two path, vied with an outer bidder
while remaining off of the fence around the far turn, got headed while entering the lane in the three path, proved no match for that one in upper stretch, then
fended off an inner bidder for place in the final furlong and secured that position. ABSOLUTE COURAGE tracked two wide and between horses, chased the
top pair around the far turn, cut the corner and took aim inside of the leaders entering the lane, produced a bid for place in midstretch but flattened out a
sixteenth from home. PATH TO SUCCESS settled off of the pace in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane and moved up. IZEONDEC
staked along the inside, chased into the far turn, yielded turning for home and faded thereafter. HUMOR ME PLEASE took back from between horses
passing the wire for the first time after failing to be hustled to the fore, then made little impact from the two path. TARAASHOQ trailed, lagged behind around
the far turn and was outrun. DEFINE tracked four wide, but chased around the far turn and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
SCOOP took contact from an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, smoothly offered a rail bid in upper
stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds and held sway. CLEARLY COPPER broke out and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two path, pursued between horses around the far turn, moved forward to take aim in the four path in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the clear
leader through the final furlong. JOCELYN bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, showed the way shifting to the three path in upper
stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder soon after and gave way while hanging on her left lead. LOVE LIGHT tracked along the inside, moved up to be
behind the leaders entering the lane, shifted out in hopes of taking aim between horses in midstretch, but steadied when put to tight quarters approaching
the sixteenth pole, recovered and missed reaching snow at the wire. DOOBLAY laid off of the pace in the three path, attempted to inch closer in the five
path around the far turn but lacked a bid. SAUCY SIX lacked speed along the inside, shifted out around the far turn before swinging to the seven path in
upper stretch, then failed to menace. STARCRY transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, pressed the leader from the three path,
but drifted to the five path in upper stretch and faded. DYLAN'S DREAM stalked in the three to four path, encountered mild traffic while hanging on his left
lead in upper stretch, then lugged inwardly approaching midstretch and tired. SWEET MARIN took contact from an inner rival before lugging inwardly behind
that foe at the start, then made little impact two wide. ISOBELA broke a step slow, trailed, lagged and was outrun around the far turn then eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
F T W SLAM lacked speed three wide, gained five wide and outside of foes around the turn, sustained a rally to drive past the leaders and the sixteenth
pole, edged clear and held sway. INFINITESIMAL settled well back two wide, encountered traffic in upper stretch, split foes in the four path launching a rally
in midstretch, then surged to gain place late and ran out of ground to catch the leaders. PATIO'S PORCH broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace
along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, repelled that foe at the sixteenth pole but was bested by a wider bidder in the process,
then lost place late. REVERENT broke outwardly, stalked three wide, ranged up entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, vied through midstretch but was
repelled at the sixteenth pole and gave way. PEANUT N IKE chased forwardly two wide and between horses, then kept on evenly. CHAD'S FLASH staled
along the inside then only managed to offer a rail chase and lacked a bid. PROBLEM CHILD pursued from the two path, shifted out entering the lane and
failed to menace. PERFECT STRIKE broke inwardly while off slow, then made little impact along the inside. BROOK IS GOLDEN pursued from the four
path then weakened between horses nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LOU THE BODY stalked the top pair from the two to three path, took aim on them from the five path in upper stretch, then rallied to drive past them at the
sixteenth pole and kicked clear. VERY SATISFACTORY was firmly bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, jostled among rivals and steadied
out of crowded quarters, laid off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride in upper stretch, rallied in the five path and between horses entering the final
sixteenth, reached place in the late stages and slowly closed in on the leader. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND broke through the gate pre-race, laid off of the pace
in the three to two path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, ran on to bid for minor placings in the final furlong, but was outkicked for place by an
inner rival at the sixteenth pole. PERFORMANCE PLUS took stern contact from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, then
failed to factor before improving position late. ALVIN pursued from midpack while tucking to the inside around the first turn, then offered a rail chase through
the lane to attempt a bid for minor placings in the final furlong, but flattened out. THEZELENSKYYFACTOR leaned out and bumped with an outer rival at the
start, set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off the inside, built a clear margin approaching the far turn, but was quickly surpassed by an outer
bidder at the furlong grounds and weakened. THIS TIME BLUE veered inwardly at the start and squarely bumped an inner rival, pressed the leader while
pulling in the four path around the first turn, remained rank under restraint entering the backstretch, then chased the clear pace setter from the three path
around the far turn and weakened between horses in the final furlong. SATURDAY STARTER was jostled between horses and pinched back at the start,
then showed little.

Footnotes
RISING EMPIRE set the pace outside of a pressing foe, cleared that one into the far turn, dug in as his aforementioned rival re-bid to his outside in upper
stretch, held sway before repelling that rival at the sixteenth pole and shook clear. BEATBOX prompted along the inside, stalked the leader into the far turn
before taking aim outside of that one turning for home, bid in upper stretch, but was kept at bay through midstretch, then failed to keep pace into the final
sixteenth and held place. KENTUCKY GHOST tracked along the inside into the first turn, moved out to the three path down the backstretch, chased while
lacking progress in upper stretch, shifted to the four path at the furlong grounds, then stayed on late to narrowly gain show at the wire. BRITAIN'S KITTEN
saved ground off of the pace, ran on to vie for show with outer rivals leaving the furlong grounds, forged that position entering the final sixteenth but got
caught at the wire. WHISPER NOT (GB) stalked two to three wide, took aim from within striking range entering the lane, but only managed to chase through
midstretch and yielded between horses with a sixteenth to go. ALEX JOON trailed along the inside and made little impact. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB)
laid off of the pace two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
BANISHING vied for the lead inside of a dueling rival, sustained position as a pair of outer rivals joined the fray turning for home, gamely maintained a
margin from a bidding MASTER GAME through midstretch, repelled that one entering the final sixteenth and shook free. MASTER GAME tracked in the
three path, ranged up outside of the leading trio to offer a four wide bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner game BANISHING in upper
stretch, but failed to gain even terms before being turned away at the sixteenth pole. QUATERNION raced at the rear towards the inside, picked up stride
along the rail with five furlongs to go, sustained progress into the far turn, but paused once blocked behind the leaders turning for home, gained show while
chasing the top pair in upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong grounds and was best of the rest. RICKY BOBBY laid off of the pace in the three to five path
around the first turn, pursued in the four to five path around the far turn, then chased while hanging on his left lead, edged fourth entering the final sixteenth
and lasted from an outer rival. BUBBA CAN DANCE pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, retreated
between rivals before racing towards the rear around the far turn, yet swung out to the seven path in midstretch and moved up. MOREAU was fractious in
the starting gate, stalked the top pair from the two to three path, bid three wide along with an outer rival turning for home, but got outkicked and yielded in
upper stretch. KAHALA lacked speed along the inside and made little imapct. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY vied two wide, then between horses around the far
turn but weakened entering the lane. UP N GONE broke outwardly, trailed two wide, then in the four path around the far turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
OUR FREDDIE MAC set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a path off of the rail, shook clear of that one entering the lane in the three path and held
sway. BIBLEMAN pressed the leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace while floating to the five path entering the lane and remained clear of
show. CRUSADER EXPRESS took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack tow wide and between horses, gained show from among
rivals at the three furlong pole, then lasted for that position late. J B GRAY pursued from midpack in the four path, came under a drive into the turn, tipped
out slightly in midstretch, ran on outside of foes to offer a late bid for show, but missed. ZONG TOUGH laid off of the pace in the four path and stayed on
between horses. GALLANT STAR broke slowly, trailed in the three path, picked up stride while shifting out in upper stretch and showed late interest.
CARLOS PUNCH stalked in the four path, then chased in the five path in upper stretch before tiring between horses in the final sixteenth. ADIEU LE CHAT
chased forwardly along the inside, but hung on his left lead and gave way. CAEUS IN PASADENA bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack
along the inside ang faded. SIR OVERANALYZE transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside,
shifted out and failed to menace. STEALING APRIORITY lagged behind along with another rival while taking the turn in the six path and showed little.
