Footnotes
RUNNING LUCKY showed the way in hand just off the inside, shook away through the latter portion of the turn and spun three then two wide into upper
stretch, drew off under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. MAD BANKER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. BRACA broke a beat
slow and was steadied at the start in behind SWEPT, who broke outwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. THE DELAWARE BOYZ chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch, tired. CHARLIE TOUGH got bumped at the start by SWEPT, who broke outwards, chased two then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, tired and drifted in a sixteenth out coming together with SWEPT and forcing STAR
SEQUENCE to steady between foes, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. SWEPT broke out at the start bumping CHARLIE
TOUGH and forcing BRACA to steady in behind, came under coaxing and chased along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired and
came out a sixteenth from home, bumping with CHARLIE TOUGH while forcing STAR SEQUENCE to steady between foes in concert with CHARLIE
TOUGH who came outwards. STAR SEQUENCE five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got steadied between foes near the sixteenth marker and trailed.

Footnotes
GUT FEELING was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile pole then moved out, chased in the four path on the turn, pursued
the
leader
under
a
drive
into
the
final
furlong,
gained
to
take
the
advantage
at
the
sixteenth-pole
and
prevailed
under
strong
urging.
INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER was hustled from the gate then taken in hand before moving out, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three
path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was
headed, fought with the winner to the finish and missed. STRONG LIGHT was void of speed, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper
stretch and finished with late energy to garner the show. IRON WORKS was away alertly from the inside post, showed speed on the inside of a rival then
pressed the pace, dropped back under urging at the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, pursued the leader in the stretch and lacked the
needed kick. DEVIL'S CAY showed good speed on the outside, set the pace under pressure to his inside, moved clear late on the backstretch, vied inside
while challenged on the turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths and tired. ROCK THE WEEKEND angled in leaving the chute, settled off the pace, was
roused while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ACHILLES HEEL dropped
back under urging early then angled in, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
ESCALATION CLAUSE five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside
the eighth pole and edged away under a drive to prevail. LUCENCY vied from the three path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide
into upper stretch, came out bumping with BURTON WAY at the three-sixteenths pole when that foe also came inwards, dug in and was collared just inside
the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. AUTHORIZE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide before going four wide through the
turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish clear of the rest for the show honors. BURTON WAY
chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a bid five to six wide into upper stretch, came in as LUCENCY came
outwards and bumped with that foe at the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. MODERN ERA hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. RINGSIDE coaxed from the start, vied five then four wide coming under coaxing midway on the turn, faded and swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish walking across the wire at the end well behind, then walked off under his own power. BILLY PRICE
vied from the four path down the backstretch through to near the midway point on the turn, retreated and was guided outside and allowed to float nine to ten
paths into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
F F ROCKET settled on the outside, angled in inside the five-eighths pole, went three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained in the
final furlong and went past the tired leader in the final sixteenth to prevail. STRIKING SPEED was forwardly placed on the outside, gained in the three path
to make a bid on the turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch, led while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was
caught. PRINCE JAMES chased the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader in the drive and
willingly earned the show. RALLY SQUIRREL dropped back on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick. WINNING DRIVE dropped back quickly at the start, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper
stretch and gained late but failed to impact. GANDY DANCING angled in inside the five-eighths pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn and failed to
threaten. HANDSOME CAT tossed his head at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into
the stretch and was no factor. NEVER EARLY pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths between horses,
remained between foes into upper stretch and capitulated. LOHENGRIN TWO went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
CUGINO got bumped between foes at the start and conceded three lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, raced four then three wide
through the first turn before settling three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, went three then two wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied and was directed inwards once clear of TRIPLE ESPRESSO a furlong out to look
the leader in the eye, dug in head to head taking narrow command a sixteenth from home when placing his main danger in tight along the rail, brushed with
that foe as that rival came out slightly near the finish and gamely held on by a nostril to prevail. ENLIGHTEN established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat to the
outside and had that rival come in to look him in the eye, was put in tight a sixteenth out along the rail when headed on the bob for command, dug in coming
out very slightly and traded brushes to the finish fighting on gamely but was ultimately nosed at the end in a good effort. TRIPLE ESPRESSO broke in at the
start and was bumped due to pressure from UNIQUE INSIGHT breaking outwards, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. HAMILTON'S WAY
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. THORNBURY
broke in a step at the start and was bumped between foes and pinched out conceding four lengths to the front, chased along the inside from near the rear of
the field, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, had to alter out a path at the three-sixteenths when URGE TO MERGE tipped out in front and
passed tired rivals. BOUNTEOUS broke out a step at the start brushing FOUR TOP, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. UNIQUE INSIGHT veered out at the start
bumping CUGINO out into URGE TO MERGE and in turn THORNBURY against pressure from TRIPLE ESPRESSO breaking inwards, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. FOUR TOP got brushed at the start by
BOUNTEOUS, chased three then two wide through the first turn and then three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) got bumped between foes at the squeezed
out at the start conceding six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path at the three-sixteenths forcing THORNBURY to alter out and made no impact. WON TEAM chased
along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of
ENLIGHTEN alleging interference in the stretch from CUGINO. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to be
declared official.

IMPLICATED was well placed while rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch then made a bid inside two foes at
the three-sixteenths, fought with those two rivals into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. SACRED WISH settled while three to four wide,
was roused on the far turn and finished with good energy to get the place. STARTUP MENTALITY (IRE) was reserved while three to four wide, came six
wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the place while up for the show. SILVER SKILLET went three wide on the first turn, stalked
the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, made a bid outside of two opponents at the
three-sixteenths, fought with those rivals under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. RHIANNON went four wide on the first turn, settled just off
the pace on the outside without cover, was roused three wide on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ON THE
SHORTLIST brushed the outside of the gate at the start, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was asked on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. PLENTITUDE established forward position from the gate, resisted the tactics of the rider and became rank when taken under tight restraint down
the opening straight away, spun out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the two path, was rated off the pace, came under encouragement in the
two path on the far turn and failed to rally. PRECIOUS AVARY went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead before the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth
and weakened then was reported to have bled and was vanned off after the race. STEPHANIE'S CHARM angled in early, saved ground on both turns and
failed to threaten.

KINGDOM established the front shortly after the start pulling on the bit to the front, showed the way in hand just off the inside, slipped away through the
latter portion of the turn and went three wide into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. SOUTH STREET
coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. UNCLE WATER FLOW six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the
turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. BREAK
THE ICE chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. HAPPY BOB chased six wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAMA BANNED ME chased seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. INSPECTOR
chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. SCOTTO chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and made no impact. UTAMARO five to six wide early
on, chased seven wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded and folded and
cornered two to three wide at the head of the stretch and was eased home to the finish, then walked off under his own power.

MASTER PIECE (CHI) tracked the front from mid pack two to three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
closed well to issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, dug in and fended off a late surging foe to score on the
wire by a neck. SOLDIER RISING (GB) two to three wide in pursuit settled at the tail of the field, tucked briefly inside through the final turn, got given a notch
to work with before being let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying, then surged late inside the final seventy yards but
missed at the end. VERSTAPPEN traded a bump at the start with TIDE OF THE SEA, settled two to three wide leading the main flight as a pair of rivals
widened away in front knocking heads, took closer order into the far and final turn and got first jump on the weakening front to take command spinning two
to three wide into upper stretch, got set down straightened away, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught seventy yards from
the finish, ran on to preserve the show honors on the wire. CROSS BORDER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside among the main
flight, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. NINEELEVENTURBO two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch offering up a bid, then got outfinished in the late stages while running on to the
end. LIMITED LIABILITY just off the inside tracking the gap duel from afar near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in but was outkicked to the finish. DAUNT chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, made some headway but was outkicked. SO HIGH (GB) dueled inside of TIDE OF THE SEA
widening away from the rest of the field as a pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and shook off his main pace foe, took the inside route displaced
from command, weakened in the final furlong. MARWAD (GB) chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. TIDE OF THE SEA traded a bump with VERSTAPPEN at the start, dueled two to three wide, got shaken off at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. LOST ARK chased along the inside, tipped to the two path into the far and final turn and faded

Footnotes
DREAMPOINT brushed the outside of the gate at the start, settled on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied to make a bid coming to the furlong marker, took the lead inside that marker and prevailed under good handling. ICY FLAVOR showed speed then
pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took a short lead into upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while able
to get the place. RUSSI settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide near the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and
finished with good energy for the show. HE'S GOT IT settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch then moved further
out and improved position. VETERANS BEACH settled just off the pace on the outside without cover, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid into the
stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. KREESA was well placed while rated on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved out
in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, paused then altered in behind a foe around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly. BLAME IT ON DADDY
settled towards the back, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. IMAGE
OF QUALITY broke a half-step slow, was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch
and failed to rally. THE COBBLER broke a step slow, rushed up under urging then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the
two path, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and weakened. THANK YOU JON showed good speed then set the pace under pressure to his outside,
vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way then was in tight near the wire.
