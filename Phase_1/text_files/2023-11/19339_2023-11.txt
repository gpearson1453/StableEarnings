Footnotes
CONNOISSEUR surged clear and moved to the inside to rate the early pace, dug in to the challenge of SO RED THE ROSE leaving the three eighths pole,
contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold that one off. The latter stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three
eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn and dueled gamely to the wire. CHANNEL SCENT stumbled to her nose leaving the gate then settled off
the rail, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the stretch and finished evenly. WOODSONG'S
CASTLE settled inside on the opening turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, but flattened later yards. WAGER
WORTHY stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn then flattened the
final sixteenth. HOLLY'S PERSUASION rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.
SARAH BELLUM saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. HOLMDEL PARK rounded the first turn in the four path, entered the
backstretch outside and proved no factor.

LIL BOUGIE ducked out leaving the gate then dueled for the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady
handling and just lasted. OUR GREAT NOTION chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and just missed
under steady handling. OPPO TACO was shuffled back at the break then hustled to contention, raced close in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in
the lane. JUJU ON DA BEAT broke a step slow then picked up the chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and improved her position in the lane. LIVANA
engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn five wide then flattened in the lane. OFFICER CALLY chased outside, rounded the turn
about the five path and passed rivals outside. STORMI VANNA veered in at the break, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the
three path. WINDSOR'S MEMORY had a brief early lead then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in
the lane.

CONTINGENCY contested mostly even terms through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn, cleared DONATE LIFE past the sixteenth pole and was
asked only when necessary. The latter pressured the pace at mostly even terms, contested the rail through the turn but dropped back past the sixteenth
pole and had to settle for second. QUEEN OF HEARTS pressured the pace inside but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn
and ran evenly in the lane. DEBT RELIEF chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. FOE WHAT ITS WORTH chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT gave chase and rounded the turn about the four
path. LAILAH NITE veered out leaving the gate and never factored.

Footnotes
GREATANDGOOD settled off the rail early, took the lead two deep into the second turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, then dug in determinedly and inched ahead of BAD LINEAGE, who saved ground well off the early
pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, but reluctantly ceded in the duel through the stretch. JONAS
HILL ROAD gave up several lengths when he dwelled at the break and settled well off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but showed little more. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. MOON FALL settled off the early pace about the four path and showed little response
through the backstretch. GETTIN SPICY set the early pace inside, was met at the rail into the second turn then faded through the backstretch.
SOMESAYNEIGH steadied approaching the thirteen sixteenths pole, showed little effort and was eased in the stretch.

FIBER STRONG set a pressured pace at mostly even terms, contested the advantage two deep on the turn and dug in determinedly to edge out
MONCRIEF through the final sixteenth. The latter pressured the pace at mostly even terms, contested at a slim disadvantage at the rail on the turn then
reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. JUBAY chased toward mid track through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn outside and
got up for third in an even finish. HOPPING HENRY gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then flattened stride later yards. SETTLEMENT DATE
gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. TRIPLE BAD chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn
off the rail and showed little in the lane. RUN TO DAYLIGHT became a bit anxious in the gate, chased outside then rounded the turn in the four and five
paths. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY gave chase and rounded the turn about the seven path. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY checked at the rail past the five sixteenths
pole, angled to the four path and showed little.

leaving the turn, took the nod past the eighth pole and drew off the final sixteenth. RAGTIME RICHES rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in through the lane and got up for second the final yards.

met passing the eighth pole and flattened stride in the stretch duel for second. SEIZE THE BREEZE settled off the rail the first turn then eased out entering
the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed some rivals outside. PERSONAL FINANCE rated
a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail toward the head of the lane and weakened inside the eighth pole.

entering the stretch and passed some rivals. NORLANDER saved ground close to the pace on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the five path and flattened in the lane. TAPADINE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. ZAP MAN steadied lightly leaving the gate then saved ground and never factored. MR. COWBOY
