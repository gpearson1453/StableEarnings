SECOND TO NO ONE was bumped at the start, sprinted to the front soon thereafter, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and prevailed under a brisk
hand ride in the four path. SWELTER vied for the early lead three wide, dropped back a bit entering the turn, was in tight between rivals at the quarter pole
then came on again late in the five path in a determined effort. DOMI trailed outside and had a mild late rally in the seven path. MINDSHIP Q drifted out
bumping the winner at the start, was a forward factor along the inside down the backstretch, altered course to the five path nearing the top of the stretch,
remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened in the final stages. OUTSLEWTHEM chased the winner four wide into the stretch and weakened
late.

under mild right handed urging late. DISCLOSURE trailed for nearly a half, closed fast outside rivals six wide through deep stretch and finished second best.
SO DIALED IN vied for the lead three wide through the turn, put a head on front briefly at the top of the stretch then was outfinished. AGNELLO'S DREAM
sprinted up the inside to gain a narrow advantage before a quarter, set the pace to the three eighths pole, kept on into the stretch, shifted out to the five path
and was outfinished. BIG TRUCK failed to menace. IRISH UNITY pressed the pace two wide for three furlongs, made the lead, maintained a narrow

Footnotes
NOT YET CHARLIE away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated and prevailed under right handed urging two wide. SAY HEY KID settled, began to rally
in the four path in upper stretch, shifted in to the two path inside the sixteenth pole and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. RUBINSTEIN
never far back, finished determinedly four wide. NOBLE BEHAVIOR pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was outfinished while three wide.
LEXATOGA saved ground and went evenly. HIGH POWERED was no factor. YOUVESAIDITALL was outrun. DEBDURITE drifted inward bumping RSAS
WAY at the start, stalked the pace three wide for six furlong then weakened. ROSAS WAY was bumped at the start and no threat.

Footnotes
JETTIN PEGASUS unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, settled back to circle five wide in the turn laving the rail, loomed in upper stretch and was up
in time under a drive down the lane. THE LAST APPLE sped to the lead shortly from the gates, controlled the pace to the top of the lane, responded when
challenged in upper stretch and kept on well only to be caught late in the stretch. SHEZA POP STAR stalked the pacesetter through the turn, challenged in
upper stretch and failed to get passed. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE raced mid-pack into the turn, dropped back on the bend and came again through the lane
with late interest. CHECK OUT LINE reserved off the pace through the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. CITY SIGNS saved
ground along the fence while well positioned in striking distance turning for home and flattened out in the drive. HIGH CUPPER raced wide throughout and
never posed a threat. PSYCHOANALYST tracked the pace from three wide to late in the turn and gave way in the lane.

ALSANAH reserved early, circled her field five wide through the stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN chased the
pace for six furlongs, rallied two wide to make the lead in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages.
WILDCAT DREAM was a sharp threat from the start and finished with good courage along the rail. BLACK FOREST sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. ROWDY DAISY offered a mild bid three wide into the second turn then came up empty.
PENUMBRAS MAKER was no factor. ELIKA trailed from the start, lost contact with her field on the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and was vanned off.
