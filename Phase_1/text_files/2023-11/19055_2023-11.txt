Footnotes
POTUS assumed command after the 1st hurdle, increased the lead after the 9th hurdle, entered the stretch with FRONTLINE CITIZEN challenging for the
lead, then won handily after FRONTLINE CITIZEN lost his rider. WITHOUTDESTINATION (GB) settled midfield after the 2nd hurdle, made a bid 2nd hurdle
from home, but was unable to gain ground on the leader. SEISMIC WAVE ran in the middle of the pack the entire race and never challenged the leaders.
OSCAR WINNER remained toward the rear the entire race and was never a threat. VINCENT VAN GOGO rated early, attempted to gain on the outside
after the first circuit but gave way to finish last. FRONTLINE CITIZEN (IRE) kept pace with the leader, entered the stretch alongside of POTUS to challenge
for the lead, then lost his rider. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE FALL OF THE RIDER OF FRONTLINE CITIZEN AT THE TIME
HE WAS SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH POTUS AND IN CONTENTION OF WINNING. THE JOCKEY OF FRONTLINE CITIZEN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINT THE JOCKEY OF POTUS FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AS THE CAUSE OF THE FALL. FOLLOWING THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, THE
CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
