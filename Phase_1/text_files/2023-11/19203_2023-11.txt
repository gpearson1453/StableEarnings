Footnotes
FRISSON set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path around the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and was driven clear.
COPANELLO BAY raced wellback in the three path, floated out to the six path and was coaxed early around the turn, fanned out to the nine path entering
the stretch, and rallied for place. GARY'S FLYING LION bumped at the start with an outer foe, stalked in the five path, was cued passing the quarter, and
finished evenly from the six path down the lane for show. GABAGOOL prompted the pace in the four path, was driven between foes around the turn, but
faded in the stretch. CORPORATE AFFAIR raced off the pace inside, was ridden in the two path into the turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, but made no impact. KOHAKU rated in the five path, was urged from the six path into the lane, but did not factor. STRAIGHT TIME trailed in the five
path, was driven in the seven path around the turn, but never threatened. REAL ROCKET BOY bumped at the start with an inner foe, chased in the six path,
was roused from the three path into the turn, but gaveway in upper stretch. CALLIHOO tracked in the two path but weakened entering the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST FIXER set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew clear under a drive. COURAGEOUS COPPER prompted the
winner in the three path and was clearly second best in the lane. FILIGREE chased the pace four wide, was no match for the top two but won the show duel.
LOST A LEGEND raced in range inside and was one-paced through the lane. SMOKIN CLOUD had early speed inside and dropped back two wide around
the turn. THE GREAT CESAR failed to menace while racing three wide. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY was off a bit slowly and outrun inside. RUNANDHIDE WIND
played no factor while racing four wide. GONE NUTS chased the pace three wide between foes, steadied near the three-eighths pole and had no further
bids. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH saved ground off the pace, checked while appearing to try to get out near the quarter pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BOB bumped with an outer foe after the start, travelled in range around the six path, was under right handed encouragement in the four path
around the turn, floated back out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on to draw past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. STORM BRAVE raced
prominently in the six path, took command after the five-eighths, shifted into the two path and opened up around the turn, stayed on from said position going
into the stretch, but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. GRAND MACALLAN led in the five path early, took back and raced up close in
the four path, lost ground rounding the turn, but was along for show. CHIEF CHEETAH raced off the pace in the six path and made no impact. ASTRAL
WEEKS stalked in the five path, was ridden between foes into the turn, but was tired in the seven path entering the stretch. EYES OF CHAMPION bumped
with an inner foe after the start, chased from out in the eight path into the turn, was driven in the six path around the turn, and did not factor while back in the
eight path down the lane. EMBER was rank at the start, trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and did not threaten.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE was unhurried in the two path but never menaced. MONEY MAP rated in the three path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
HEALS THE SOUL dueled inside, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) stalked the pace three and four wide,
angled in nearing the eighth pole and held second. EXECUTIVE SEARCH tracked the pace two and three wide, bid between foes turning for home, was
herded in in midstretch, angled out and switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and held third. BARONE CESCO saved ground in range and
lacked the needed rally. NEVER SATISFIED failed to menace while racing two wide. TIZ A PRINCE checked shortly after the start, raced off the pace three
wide, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. BEACH WARRIOR dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch and tired. URANIUM played no
factor while racing four wide. ABE HONESTLY had his head turned at the start then stumbled, raced four and five wide and made little impact. GRAND
VALLEY was outrun inside. LUNAR ROCKET was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SOY UNA DAMA (CHI) set the pace in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
kicked away under a drive. CALL ME SPICY bumped at the start with an inner foe, chased in the four path, waited confidently around the turn, was cued
while fanning out to the eight path turning into the lane, drifted in passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. MUSICAL DESIGN tracked in the three path,
was driven from the two path into the stretch, and dug in for show. ON THE PAYROLL stalked in the seven path, loomed a threat in the six path around the
turn, swung from the seven path into the stretch, was herded in passing the eighth pole, and evened out. LI LI BEAR prompted the pace in the six path, was
ridden between foes in the five path around the turn, but flattened between foes in the stretch. MAMA MARIA had a slow start, trailed in the two path early
and did not factor from the six path down the lane. ORNELA (CHI) bumped at the start with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden
from the rail around the turn, but did not threaten. MISTICA TRAVIESA (CHI) pressed in the five path, was roused between foes in the four path midturn, but
yielded from the three path in the stretch. PER RULING FROM HIWU, SOY UNA DAMA (CHI) WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BEACH PARTY BINGO came out and bumped LADY THOR into BURNAWAY at the start, set the pace in the two path, dueled in the two path through the
final six furlongs and lasted. BURNAWAY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide between foes, swung out nearing the eighth pole,
surged late and just missed. DIGITAL TRADE raced in range three wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch,
battled to the wire and was unable to get by. PALACE FLIRT pressed the pace three wide between and was one-paced through the lane. SKIP TO THE
BEAT (IRE) stalked the pace four wide and finished evenly. LADY THOR was bumped between foes at the start, chased the pace inside, steadied near the
quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. LUCKY IN LOVE was fractious behind the gate and again in the gate, stumbled at the start, saved ground off the
early pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. OKAY FINE was outrun inside. GOOD VALUE chased the pace five wide and faltered
nearing the quarter pole.
