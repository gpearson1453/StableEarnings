ISLAND settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn and failed to respond. BOLD AMBITION was carried out early, moved in near the
nine-sixteenths then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend and came up empty. FLUFF THE PILLOW broke a
step slow then was hustled, raced on the outside while ridden along, angled in near the five-eighths pole, went two to three wide on the turn and was no
factor. THE HERO CODE broke in and brushed with a foe, was urged along at the rear, moved in with six furlongs to run, saved ground on the turn and
failed to threaten.

ITS COLD IN DEHERE chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn advancing on the front through the latter
portion of the bend, tipped out and swung three wide into upper stretch bumping when briefly in tight between foes, took over command at the
three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive kept to task. TRADE SECRET broke out at the start brushing VALLARAND, chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the place honors.
MARIAH'S FORTUNE vied inside a duo and then a quartet coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch,
weakened while along for the show honors. GRINGOTTS five wide just off the pace dispute down the backstretch, advanced with ALPINE QUEEN to her
outside just inside the nine-sixteenths to vie for the front through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. VALLARAND got brushed at the start by TRADE SECRET, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ALPINE QUEEN six paths off the inside just off the early pace dispute,
advanced five wide from the nine-sixteenths to vie through the turn the outermost of a quintet, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch getting bumped by the eventual winner coming on through a tight seam to her inside, then tired to the finish. MORE MANGO coaxed from
the gate, led early on before vying three wide first with a pair and then a quartet to the midway point on the turn, got shaken off while coaxed along at that
station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and tired through to the finish. CROWDING OUT got brushed at the start by VALLARAND due to
pressure from TRADE SECRET, vied from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got bumped when spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch by ITS COLD IN DEHERE when that rival went on by to the outside, tired and then was taken under a protective hold just outside the eighth pole, got
guided outside and was eased up before being pulled up just outside the finish line, then walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
RACHEL'S ROCK broke out and was last to commence, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, rallied
inside of the leader to make a bid into the final furlong, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady handling. ROYAL
POPPY tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong but
weakened and settled for the show. STONEWALL STAR bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled, prompted the pace on the inside, vied along the rail
for most of the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was
overtaken and tired. MALIBU MOONSHINE dropped back at the start then settled at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. CENTRE COURT CHAMP was hustled to the front, showed the way under some pressure from both sides, came under encouragement in the two
path on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and gave way. SHESALITTLE EDGY prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, dropped back in
the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well to the lead outside the
sixteentjh-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FULL MOON MADNESS settled on the outside, dropped from the three path to the two path
early on the turn, angled four wide under urging near the five-sixteenths, rallied outside at the quarter-pole, came inward a few paths in upper stretch then
bumped with MARIACHI while taking the lead, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the finish and just missed. WHO
HOO THATS ME was last to commence, raced at the rear under urging, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out
and finished willingly for the show. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, hugged the rail into
upper stretch, was bumped near the three-sixteenths and steadied briefly, chased behind foes into the final furlong, moved to the two path outside the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. MARIACHI chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was bumped while making a bid in upper
stretch then steadied, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. CAPONE went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around
the turn in the two path, dropped closer to the rail coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, FULL MOON MADNESS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH

Footnotes
RUN FOR YOUR HONEY chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, took over command
straightened away, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. HOLDER CLOSE six to seven paths off the inside early on, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. LONE STAR WILDCAT seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the eventual winner while keeping on to the
finish. MOTHER MARY bobbled at the break, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DAME CATHERINE vied just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired. BORNFORGREATNESS vied five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. LOVE THYSELF vied six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. LET'S CONNECT chased five to six paths off the inside early on before briefly tucking three wide at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five to six wide at the three-eighths, continued six wide into upper stretch and tired. SHE'S A LAKER stumbled at the
start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired. ARCHIVIST chased three wide down the
backstretch, then floated out to be seven to eight paths off the inside at the three-eighths, began to angle in with five-sixteenths to go to swing three wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. ALOTTA JAYS bobbled at the break, recovered to vie four then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, faded and swung four wide into upper stretch and folded in the drive.
