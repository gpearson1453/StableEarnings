Footnotes
SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) set the pace inside, was roused into the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and was driven clear. RHYMES
LIKE DIMES prompted the pace in the three path, was driven into the turn, got floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for place.
KUHL STAR raced up close in the two path, was roused into the turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, but evened out for show. ANOTHER DUKE was
rank and hopped at the start, trailed from the five path into the turn, swung out to the seven path under right handed urging turning into the lane, and made
no impact. SIR KAHN bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path into the turn, was coaxed from inside midway around the turn,
but did not threaten. WAR CROSS stalked in the four path but was empty in the eight path at the top of the stretch. ROYAL KITTEN bumped with an inner
foe at the start, chased in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
DANCING N DIXIE prompted the pace four wide around the first turn, led early on the backstretch, rated back into a pressing position, pressed in the three
path around the far turn, could not quite match with the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, kept on outside, took over near the sixteenths pole, switched
back to the left lead soon after, lugged in and held sway. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to the
sixteenth pole, fought on inside of the winner from there and was herded in a bit late. DE REGRESO trailed in the two path, advanced four wide around the
far turn, had aim outside of the top two through the lane but was only able to gain marginally. ALCOHOL raced in range two and three wide and lacked the
needed rally. KISS prompted the pace in the three path around the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. SINGING
SANDRA raced up close inside and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
HAUL stalked in the five path, took aim from the six path at the top of the lane, ran on under right handed encouragement, and drew past the inner
pacesetter in the closing stages. OKIRO bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, angled out to the seven path under a
drive at the top of the stretch, and rallied for place. KING SKULL set the pace in the two path, was cued early into the turn, stayed on and floated out to the
four path in upper stretch, but yielded around the final sixteenth to show. SHEA D WORLD bumped at the start with an outer foe, prompted the pace in the
four path, bid under coaxing approaching the quarter, but faded from the five path in the final furlong. RAGING FURY was in tight at the start, tracked inside,
was roused in the two path midway around the turn, but flattened in the final furlong. FULL NELSON trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path
turning into the stretch, and did not threaten. NINJA STAR chased in the two path but weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
OLGA laid up close in the three path, bid early into the turn, bumped with the inner pacesetter while in the two path at the top of the lane, dueled with that
foe into the final furlong, and inched away late. GIRVIN GIRL set the pace inside, was challenged by the outer eventual winner early around the turn,
bumped with that foe while along the rail at the top of the stretch, and dug in, but yielded late to place. DIVINE CONNECTION stalked in the two path, was
coaxed midway around the turn, but finished evenly in the four path down the lane for show. AWESOME ANNMARIE tracked in the three path, was roused
in the four path early around the turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch. GREAT ANALOGY trailed along the inside into the turn and did not
factor. KAEKO chased in the four path but never threatened. ZOSTEROP rated in the five path but never menaced.

TIZ THE COAST set a clear pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. BIG COMMERCE stalked the winner two and three wide, rallied between foes
but could not get by that foe. BEE WELL saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied. CACCIATORE rated off the pace between
foes, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between foes in the final furlong but was outkicked. FOR THE CHIEF broke outwardly, raced off the pace
four and five wide and had a mild rally. JUST FOR LUCK saved ground in range and was one-paced through the lane. MWARI was outrun inside. MR
BRIZEL stumbled at the start and never threatened while racing two wide.

Footnotes
TIME PASSAGE set the pace in the three path, tipped into the two path under rousing going into the far turn, floated out to the four path at the top of the
stretch, and dug in to hold of an outer foe. COCO bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was cued from the three path into the far
turn, took aim from the six path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. TO THYSELF B TRUE chased in the four path, was driven in the three path
around the far turn, and kept on for show. BATUCADA rated in the two path, was ridden along the inside into the far turn, but evened out from the two path
in the stretch. WRITTENINTHESTARS trailed in the six path and never threatened. FLAKES was fractious in the gate and bumped with an outer foe, stalked
inside but was done after a half.
