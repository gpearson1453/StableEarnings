the win. FOR THE PARISH (IRE) chased the leader through the first lap, challenged on the outside nearing the second mile pole and battled gamely the
length of the stretch to narrowly miss. GO POKE THE BEAR led the way through the opening mile, opened up on his competition the second time around,
and was caught in upper stretch but finished well, keeping on the wire. PRESENCE OF MIND (IRE) chased the leader through the first lap, fell coming over
