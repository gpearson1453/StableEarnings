Footnotes
MIDNIGHT'S GIRL stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then was coaxed going into the final turn and took the lead at the quarter pole,
pulled away and drew off in the stretch. WA WA WEE WA prompted the pace from the two path down the backstretch then made a move to engage the
leader at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner and was clearly second best. CAYMAN QUEEN was unhurried to the final turn then made a rail
bid and tipped out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW rushed up from between horses to take a clear lead going into the
first turn, held that position to the quarter pole where she was overtaken and tired. SODDY DAISY raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then
made a three or four wide bid on the backstretch but lacked the late response. SCRAPBOOK saved ground and didn't make a serious bid. PIPPA'S
PROSPECT raced near the back from off the rail but was not a threat. TRUE RED SLEW was off the pace from between horses to the three furlong marker
and was done, eased, walked off.

Footnotes
FLOATING BEAUTY was well rated down the backstretch then made at three wide bid at the three furlong marker, drove past the leader and pulled away
under a hand ride. BIKINI BOTTOM was reluctant to load, the sprinted away to a pressured lead from the inside to the quarter pole but was overtaken and
chased the winner home. SAINT ISABEL saved ground while racing near the back down the backstretch then passed tiring rivals in the stretch. UNLUCKY
IN LOVE pressed the pace from between horses to the three furlong marker then dropped back and finished evenly. GOOD BY FAITH pressed the pace
from three wide to the three furlong marker then retreated. STAND BY TIME trailed the field and was outrun.

SWEET LAURA was unhurried around the first turn, moved out to three wide at the three furlong marker then went between horses at the quarter pole and
maneuvered around horses on the turn, ran down the leader in deep stretch to draw clear late. SAENZ went to the front to and unchallenged lead to set all
the pace but was run down in deep stretch to be caught late. ALL GOOD TIMES tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a bid from three wide
on the final turn to be a clear third. BAR TAP was forwardly placed off the pace down the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but
faltered. TEASIN' TESLA rushed up to vie for the lead into the first turn then stalked the leader to the three furlong marker and stopped. IN THE RED was
allowed to settle off the pace on the inside to the half mile marker then dropped back.

off the rail to the turn then made a rail bid on the final turn, angled out to four wide in the stretch but finished evenly. MR ELVIN was allowed to settled down
the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn but flattened out in the stretch. HEATHER'S REQUEST was unhurried down the backstretch
then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late run and improved position. PINK HIGGINS chased the leaders from three wide but failed to menace.

midway through the final turn and drew off. INAWIC stalked the pace inside down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn to show a
late run to be second best. FOUR PRINCESSES raced in the middle of the pack through the final turn then made a three wide bid in the stretch to show late

HAIL STATE vied for the early lead then dueled to mid turn then came again in the stretch to prevail. GRAND PRADO dueled for the lead from the two path
then edged away in mid turn, was headed in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SLITHER was off the pace through the turn then split horses entering the
stretch and angled out to three wide for a late run to be up for the show. DIABLO CAT dueled for the lead from four wide to the turn then fell back slightly but
continued to match strides with SCRUTINIZER into deep stretch while fighting gamely. SCRUTINIZER dueled for the lead from three wide to the turn then
fell back slightly but continued to match strides with DIABLO CAT into deep stretch while fighting gamely. I'LL RAISE YOU showed no early speed, made a
mild bid from the inside going into the turn but flattened out. WONDER RUN had no speed and was not a factor. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced near the
back between horses but was not a threat.
