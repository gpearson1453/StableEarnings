well off rail in the stretch run for place spot. JAYLA inside run to the half, stayed on in the stretch for show. WICKED KITTEN unhurried early with an inside
run in the stretch run. AMATTEROFPRINCIPLE never a real menace. MULSANNE (IRE) bit tardy from the gate while off rail in the stretch run. WILMA
saved ground to no avail. WILL VIRGINIA DARE off rail run on the backstretch. ARAYA inside run backstretch, gave in after three quarters. JOEZINE
outside run first turn while never a threat. LA COPA never a menace.
