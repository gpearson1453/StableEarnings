Footnotes
DELPHIA was under a snug hold content to sit behind the pacesetter down the back straight, started to reel in the frontrunner midway on the far turn, quickly
moved on the fence to seize control in upper stretch and opened up at will to the wire to be much the best at the finish. HURRICANE GIZMO settled on the
inside in the third flight stalking the leaders, edged closer along the backstretch, began to pick up rivals at the quarter pole and gamely closed in down the
stretch to capture the runners up share at the finish line. JULIE'S MIST travelled up front on the rail in the beginning, dictated a soft pace unchallenged
down the backside, continued up top through the final bend, drifted out a touch at the quarter pole, offered no resistance to the winner inside turning for
home and gave way late just nabbed at the wire for second money. DREAMS AND SCHEMES tracked the pacesetter on the outside down the back
straight, came under a ride but was losing ground to the top two rivals around the far turn and was one paced through the stretch holding for a minor role in
the end. MORAL TURPITUDE leapt up at the start, trailing by many in the early going, continued to see the field down the backside and showed some run
passing a weary rival in the stretch drive. FOREST VIXEN stalked on the outside in the third flight down the backstretch, was scrubbed on for more run
three eighths out, offered little response and had nothing to give in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
MR CROWLEY seized the lead entering the backstretch, set comfortable fractions at the half, continued up front with only mild pressure around the final
bend, had something left in reserve in upper stretch holding off rivals, drifted out under right handed encouragement at the sixteenth pole but still held safe
at the finish line. C C'S KINGDOM was nestled behind the frontrunning winner down the backside, shifted just outside getting off the rail with five sixteenths
from the wire, edged closer to the leader outside at the top of the stretch, determinedly chased through the lane, shifted inwards to the rail at the sixteenth
pole to avoid the winner who was getting out late and bested the rest in the end. DERZKII tracked three deep outside foes at the half, was hard ridden at the
quarter pole vying outside for the lead, angled out in the four path to still be in the thick of things straightening out for home, could not threaten the top two in
deep stretch but easily held for third money at the wire. HELL BENT was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, was urged
right handed at the quarter pole, swung outside in the four path gaining momentum at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly to settle on the fringes in
the end. NEWPORT AGENT co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, improved on the fence throughout the far turn, made a mild rally inside on the rail
in upper stretch but stalled at the seventy yard pole losing a position late. GREEN FLEET stalked outside near the rear in the early stages, was roused for
more at the three furlong pole, offered little run around the far turn and could not make any impact in the running down the lane. UMNEYAAT settled on the
rail in midfield down the back straight, put in a mild run on the fence midway on the final turn, could not continue on in the stretch run and weakened
between foes in the final furlong. SEGUIMI had the early lead taking this field into the first turn, was relegated to chase the frontrunner down the backstretch
with rivals on each side, could not find more trying to keep up with others at the seven sixteenths marker and backed through the final around the final turn.

Footnotes
PRINCESSOFTHENORTH was content three deep watching the leader outside down the backstretch, continued to measure the front runner outside rivals
through the bend, loomed three wide turning for home and had a little more in the tank than others to edge away at the wire for the score. LIVIN ON LUV
rated kindly in hand tracking on the rail down the back straight, waited patiently to pounce throughout the turn, shifted just outside two wide getting involved
up front driving to the wire, battled gamely with horses on either side down the stretch and finished up second best with a solid effort on this day. OLYMPIC
FENCER was hustled for the lead at the break, set the pace uncontested around the bend, tenaciously was clinging onto the lead inside at the sixteenth
pole and faded just a bit in deep stretch to settle for third money in a photo at the line. SOCIETY'S KAT settled all alone in midfield down the backside, was
scrubbed on three wide keeping up with rivals at the quarter pole, was in range of the frontrunners in the four path turning for home, crept closer down the
stretch but needed more late to pose a threat crossing the line. KNOW HOW (GB) co-trailed on the inside in this tightly bunched pack down the backstretch,
kept pace running on the rail through the turn, angled out in the four path behind the leaders at the top of the lane, stubbornly chased the front trio through
the stretch and was gaining late to be involved in a five horse blanket finish at the wire. RETAIL THERAPIST co-trailed on the outside stalking down the
back straight, made a mild move three wide outside rivals at the five sixteenths marker, swung outside in the five path for the stretch drive but made little
impression running to the finish line.

Footnotes
LAST DAWN settled off the pace outside a rival then shifted nearer the rail, bided time into the far turn, shifted five wide leaving that bend beginning to
advance quickly, struck the lead in upper stretch, forged clear late. BRINGER OF RAIN switched out off the inside settling off the early leader, advanced
outside four wide on the far turn, took a narrow and brief lead from about the quarter pole till upper stretch, was no match for the winner. HEMLO GOLD
stalked from outside two to three deep, was ridden along at the three-eighths, made a mild bid between runners at the five-sixteenths, had no extra.
UPTOWN LIGHTS was a bit keen in the early going, saved ground tracking from inside and ran on. ANSELMO unhurriedly brought up the rear, fanned six
wide into upper stretch, passed a tired rival. HE'S FULLY LOADED sped well clear early to set the pace from just off the rail, was challenged on the far turn,
switched out leaving that bend, tired.

Footnotes
SPUTNIK hopped at the start, was patiently allowed to settle trailing the field down the back straight, galloped along seeing the field on the far turn, started
to reach for more ground weaving between rivals in the two path at the quarter pole, swung outside six wide gaining momentum at the top of the lane,
exploded by runners in mid-stretch under a hand ride to win impressively going away crossing the finish line. VUCCHELLA took this field under a narrow
advantage into the first turn, dictated the pace while shadowed outside through the backstretch, held a slim lead on the rail straightening out for the drive,
was no match for the winner in mid-stretch but stubbornly carried on the to the wire to prevail over all other foes at the finish line. BEAUTIFUL SKY pressed
the pace outside in the first turn, continued to hound the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, battled outside up front on the final bend, fought
determinedly between runners down the lane and faded in deep stretch saving third money at the wire. HOT DANCE bobbled on the break, stalked near the
rear on the rail down the backside, advanced mildly on the rail at the half, inched closer on the fence through the far turn and ran on willingly to the wire just
missing the show share in a photo in the end. VAZHI settled in mid-pack between horses down the backside, offered a mild run three wide around foes at
the three furlong marker, was in range in the four path turning for home and was one paced to the wire to be involved for the minor share in the end.
PRINCESS JADE was in a good spot watching the contesting duo inside down the back straight, was roused to go after the front pair in midturn, could not
gain on the leaders in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. MELODY'S KISS stalked, having one bet down the backstretch, made little headway
between rivals on the far turn and could not be a presence in the stretch drive. GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS had good position tracking on the outside in the
second flight along the backside, was urged for more at the three eighths pole, could not keep up with the leaders and backed away through the field on the
far turn.

Footnotes
MAGICAL TRICK settled off the pace, advanced five to six wide, outside runners on the turn, led by the sixteenth pole and drove clear. FEDOROVA tracked
from inside, shifted three wide at the top of the stretch, was within range between runners in mid-stretch but outkicked. NORMA NO broke inwardly, settled
inside at the back, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch, was gaining but too late. KITTY'SSPEEDYSTARR was lightly bumped at the start, moved
quickly clear and set the pace racing just off the rail, had no extra in late stretch. NIKITA'S GEM bobbled slightly then was in tight at the start, raced off the
inside at the back, shifted to the rail at the quarter pole, was gaining late. ECHO SEVEN raced off the pace in the two to three path, gained some but too
late. PRAIRIE SKY brushed the inside rival lightly at the start, moved forward between runners to press the leader three deep into the turn, came to the top
of the stretch four wide, weakened. ROSIEPOSIE made a swift early move outside runners four to five wide on the turn reaching striking distance six deep
at the top of the stretch but faltered. LODGE HILL was a bit reluctant to load, raced up close four wide, floated seven wide into upper stretch, failed to rally.
SILENT PASSION was caught outside runners five to six wide on the turn, fanned eleven deep, made no bid. AMI'S GIRL broke a bit awkwardly, raced at
the back three to four wide through the turn shifting nine wide into upper stretch, was never a threat.

Footnotes
LANTANA LADY was unhurried to trail on the fence down the backside, waited to move in mid-pack on the rail with five sixteenths left to run, rallied up the
inside at the top of the lane, shifted outside in the three path at the furlong marker full of run, quickly took control and was geared down when crossing the
finish line. MISS VYVYANNE was hustled to take command down the backside, opened up on the field by mid-turn, continued up front holding off the
chasing rival in upper stretch and was caught by the surging winner in deep stretch. JILL tracked the front two on the rail down the backstretch, took up the
chase closing the gap on the frontrunner at the quarter pole, was determinedly inching closer through the stretch, could not threaten for the win late and
settled for a clear third crossing the line. FOREST B travelled in midfield on the rail at the half, was on hold behind runners midway through the turn, rallied,
finding a seam two wide at the quarter pole and ran on gamely to the finish to settle on the fringes in the end. COLLECT DATTT could see the field at the
half mile marker, saved ground picking up horses on the fence through the turn and finished up with intent to the wire. HARD TO CAPTURE stalked near
the rear outside horses down the back straight, showed little interest running around the bend, was blocked behind runners in the five path at the top of the
stretch and showed some late energy when clear in deep stretch. INDIAN MUSIC chased the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, was roused but
could not maintain forward position at the five sixteenths marker and yielded with runners on each side in upper stretch. WEEHAWKEN travelled in midfield
three deep on the outside down the backside, made a brief run four wide at the quarter pole, swung out widest in the six path having a chance for a small
share turning for home and faltered in mid-stretch. FOXY LADY lost action briefly between foes at the nine sixteenths pole, was shuffled back, offered little
run through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch running. VEERY tracked the front two outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden three wide
midway on the turn but could not keep up to the leaders, gave way in upper stretch and cantered home through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BABBO bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward outside and cleared into the first turn shifting in on that bend, set the pace up the backstretch in the
clear and near the rail, asked for more at the top of the stretch, had enough in reserve to hold sway under steady handling. PIPER'S FACTOR broke out just
a bit, was well-positioned in behind the eventual winner stalking that one from off the rail, made no headway in the stretch but held the place. NO MORE
OPTIONS tracked from inside saving ground throughout, kept on late but needed mor. NAPTOWN appeared quite washy heading into the gate, bumped
lightly at the start, stalked from between runners into the first turn, continued racing up close two to three wide into the far turn, ridden along by the
three-eighths, came out four deep for the drive and ran on. ZIPPY GIZMO settled outside at the back three to four deep, advanced outside foes four to five
wide on the far turn but evened out in the drive. KING ROSSO bumped a rival and was in tight at the start, rated inside at the back, saved ground, improved
position. VITALITY was forwardly-placed outside three to four deep stalking the leaders, weakened. HATMAKER GIZMO settled in the back half racing off
the rail in the two to three path, went evenly and made no bid. PONTIAC bumped with a rival at the start, raced off the pace three to four wide, moved out
six wide in upper stretch, failed to rally. THOR'S CAUSE was outside a foe two to three deep and toward the back, was forced out seven deep in upper
stretch, failed to threaten.

INUDATION stalked near the rear on the inside, improved smartly on the fence at the half, progressed saving ground through the far turn, burst up the rail in
mid-stretch, took over the lead at the seventy yard marker and held off the re-rallying rival at the finish line. WAR PAINTER stalked near the back outside
foes down the backstretch, started to make a bold move three wide circling horses midway on the final turn, continued her momentum six wide driving to the
wire, took control at the furlong pole, was caught by the winner seventy yards out and resurged at the wire just losing in a photo. MORE MONEY HUNNY
stumbled badly at the start trailing by many in the beginning, was allowed to gather herself down the backstretch, caught up the the field swinging out five
wide at the top of the lane, shifted inwards to the fence closing in sharply at the furlong marker and ran on gamely to be a solid third considering the poor
start. HURRICANE CLAIR stalked on the outside in the third flight, was roused at the three eighths pole, could not match strides with rivals, swung outside
off a weakening runner in the five path in upper stretch and showed late interest to finish up for a minor role. BRAVO KATE settled in the third flight on the
rail, improved nicely running in hand at the half mile marker, waited for her cue inside through the far turn, had no room in mid-stretch, was checked behind
the tiring early front two runners, angled off the pair at the furlong pole and offered a mild rally late. OLIVIA ROSE prompted the pace outside in the first turn,
chased the pacesetter down the backside, bid for the lead two wide at the quarter pole, could not go on with others commencing a late run and faded at the
sixteenth pole. FOURFIFTYFOUR had one rival beat, which was the poor starter, down the back straight, closed in on the field two furlongs from home,
angled outside five wide turning for home, was steadied in upper stretch and could not regroup to be involved at the wire. SOUNDS PRACTICAL had a slim
lead into the first turn, opened up mildly at the half mile marker, was headed outside at the quarter pole, could not find more straightening out for the drive
and was engulfed by runners on either side with a furlong to run. AIROSA had a nice trip all alone watching the contesting pair down the backstretch, took
closer order to the leaders three wide at the quarter pole, was in the mix in the four path at the top of the lane, began to shorten stride in upper stretch and
stopped in the final furlong. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #7 FOURFIFTYFOUR AGAINSY #1 HURRICANE CLAIR IN UPPER STRETCH RESULTED IN #1

Footnotes
MY ASSISTANT engaged on the rail down the backside for the lead, continued on the rail fighting up front around the bend, put away the early speed foe at
the top of the stretch, was kept to the task to the wire and had something left in reserve to hold off all challengers in deep stretch for the win. AUTUMN'S SO
FLASHY stalked in mid-pack at the start of the race, advanced between foes down the backside to track the dueling frontrunners through the turn, waiting
patiently to move, rallied on the fence turning for home and determinedly chased the winner in vain besting the rest comfortably at the wire for second
money. POLA STAR had one foe beaten down the back straight, started to commence a run four wide picking up horses outside at the quarter pole, swung
out in the six path extending her stride and closed in down the stretch to just get up for third in a tight photo at the wire. IT'S ME MARIO had a good spot
outside watching the contesting down the backstretch, through the turn, was in the hunt angling out to the four path straightening out for the drive and
willingly ran to the wire just missing holding onto the when crossing the finish line. SING DIXIE had a slow start to begin, quickly recover to be sent up the
fence to track the front duo at the half, was steadied in tight quarters inside at the seven sixteenths marker, angled outside five wide at the top of the stretch
and was one paced to the wire. TONKA WAKAN stalked near the back on the inside at the half, saved ground making little headway through the turn and
ran on down the lane inside passing tiring rivals in the process. SEATTLE POINT stalked three deep on the outside near the rear down the backside, could
not get involved running around the bend, angled out four wide at the top of the lane and showed some late interest putting in a mild run in the final furlong.
ASTAPOVO engaged for the lead outside down the back straight, dueled outside throughout the turn up front, had no more to offer in the three path turning
for home, retreated inside the furlong pole, pulled up quickly and was vanned off. WONT FORGET YOU travelled in mid-pack with runners on each side
down the backstretch, made a brief run on the fence at the three eighths pole gaining some positioning, could not make any more impact when roused
around the turn and had little finish to give in the stretch run. QUEEN SAHARA was coaxed along trying to maintain a tracking spot between runners at the
half, offered a mild run three wide outside foes in midturn and tired with a furlong left to run. BUSTA GROOVE could not get interested trailing down the
backside, made no progress through the turn and never reached contention running to the finish line.
