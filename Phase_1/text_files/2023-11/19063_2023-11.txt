Footnotes
LATE NITE LIZZIE tracked four to three wide into the turn, loomed boldly up to the top pair around the turn to assume command nearing the lane,
maintained a clear margin through midstretch and held sway from a pursuing foe late. BUMP IN THE NIGHT stalked just behind the leaders and from the
two path, chased around the turn, shifted three wide and between horses entering the lane, rallied to close in on the clear leader in the final sixteenth but
needed more. CRY IF I WANT TO vied three wide and between horses leaving the chute, but failed to sustain forward position and dropped back with five
furlongs to go, chased in the three path around the turn, floated four wide entering the lane yet ran on willingly. AUTISM COMPASSION prompted four wide,
tucked two wide at the half mile pole, but was swiftly outmoved by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. GOLDEN LAKE set a
pressured pace along the inside, offered no resistance to an outer rival's challenge at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. REDHEADEDSTRANGER
failed to factor from the five path. BELLA SKYE trailed in the two path and was outrun.

Footnotes
MULLION took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, vied in the three path, led well in hand in the two path around the turn, then
cruised away easily through the lane. SPIELMAN trailed in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, rallied while taking contact from an inner
foe at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a charge while shifting inwardly passing the furlong grounds, bid for place approaching the final sixteenth, dueled
with an inner foe for that position through the late stages and prevailed. NYQUICK vied inside of his stablemate leaving the chute, stalked that foe into the
turn, chased turning for home, kept on to edge place coming to midstretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge for that position at the sixteenth pole, flopped
leads before gamely dueling through the late stages, but was narrowly bested. BEARINGS bumped an inner rival at the start, chased in the three to two
path and between horses into the turn, then improved inside of rivals for a minor share at the furlong grounds. ARTWELL tracked five wide, chased outside
of the leaders and from the four path around the turn, but was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole and gave way.
WICKED AGAIN bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, pressed in the four path, required urging to sustain mild pressure on the leader while between
horses around the turn, failed to keep pace entering the lane, leaned out and bumped a rival at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. CHIRON bumped
with an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly along the inside but faded entering the turn.

Footnotes
PIGALLE set the pace two wide, drew off at the three sixteenths pole and widened under moderate urging. LITTLE DIXIE broke a step slow, tracked two
wide and between horses, floated to the three path entering the lane, ran on before flopping back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, sparked momentum
and gained place late. CENTER STAGE prompted inside of the pace setter, but proved no match for that one at the three sixteenths pole, tired through the
final furlong and was caught at the wire for place while narrowly saving show. GOLDCREST tracked along the inside under a snug hold, tipped to the two
path entering the lane, ran on mildly to attempt a bid for place along with an outer rival in the late stages, but was outkicked and missed show. JACKIE'S
LOVE raced at the rear in the two path and failed to factor. FORTUNE BOUND lacked sped in the three to five path and made little impact. CHICA DE ORO
broke outwardly, stalked three wide but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
LET'S GO MARK tracked along the inside, took aim outside of his leading stablemate turning for home, bid entering the lane, forged a narrow advantage
while sparring in midstretch, then clung to that margin while hanging on his left lead thereafter. DUNPHY set the pace along the inside, met his stablemate's
challenge entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch, fought on after being headed in midstretch but just missed. STORMQUIST pressed two wide, but
was outmoved by an inner rival while floated three wide at the five sixteenths pole, chased the embattled leading pair through the lane and managed to
narrow their advantage late. HEY JOE JOE tracked four wide, chased turning for home and lacked a bid. SMOOTHDINI trailed in the three path, moved to
the five path entering upper stretch and failed to factor. NUEVO AMANECER stalked three wide but faded between horses into the turn and was done early.
J T'S IMAGINATION ducked inwardly leaving the chute and lost his rider, then walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT
LEAVING THE CHUTE, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
HALINA'S FORTE vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the turn, then kicked away in the two path in upper stretch and was ridden out thereafter.
SILVER ROSE broke half a beat slow, prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, drifted to the five path entering the lane, yet sustained a chase
of the clearing leader to duel with an inner foe for place through the final furlong and prevailed. FREEBURN laid close up along the inside, stalked around
the turn, chased the clearing leader well to duel for place with an outer rival through the final furlong, but just missed. ROUND THE TOWN broke in the air,
laid off of the pace in the two to three path into the turn, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, lugged inwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper
stretch, straightened passing the three sixteenths pole and ran on mildly. MISCHIEVOUSNESS stalked two wide, pursued in the three to four path around
the turn and gave way. AZTEC EMPRESS leaned inwardly at the start, vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.
ROUTE SIXTY SIX broke a step slow before steadying out of pinched quarters at the start, raced at the rear in the three path and made little impact. BEE
BRANCH lacked speed in the four path, tucked to the two path into the turn and failed to factor. ABUNDANT LIFE chased three wide, pursued under heavy
urging in the four to five path around the turn, but got floated to the seven path entering the lane and weakened. GRACE AND GLORY dropped back early
on, trailed around the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
OCEAN ATLANTIQUE tracked two wide, pursued outside of the leading pair around the far turn, failed to progress on those embattled rivals through upper
stretch, yet closed in inside the final furlong to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead. CHURCHTOWN pressed two wide, vied around the far turn,
wrestled a narrow advantage entering the lane, battled with his inner persistent counterpart through midstretch, led into the final sixteenth as an outer foe
challenged and was bested late. WINFROMWITHIN set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, got slightly headed by that
one entering the lane, fought on gamely while sparring through midstretch, but yielded inside the final sixteenth and lasted for show. SEIZE THE NIGHT
stalked along the inside, chased behind the leaders while just off of the fence through the lane, kept on late but missed reaching a tiring foe for show.
GRAY'S FABLE lacked speed in the two path, split rivals in upper stretch and ran on. TIZ THE BOMB raced off of the pace three wide and failed to factor.
HOZIER pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, then gave way. SKYRO saved ground off of the pace but faded. BIG DREAMING was last
away and trailed throughout.

show from an inner bidder late. RIDER'S SPECIAL took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide and between horses early on, backed off to
chase his counterparts at the half mile pole, was urged along in pursuit among foes around the turn, yet sustained stride in the final sixteenth to attempt an
inside show bid late, but was kept at bay. GREYS THE BOY steadied slightly as an outer rival shifted across his path leaving the chute, tracked in the four
path, inched closer along with an outer rival turning for home but failed to sustain a bid. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS leaned out and bumped a rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and failed to menace. CALL ME MIDNIGHT broke a step slow and failed to

an outer rival in the final furlong but was bested. KING CURLIN laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three to five path around the far turn, chased
mildly and held fourth from an inner bidder. READ ON pursued from midpack along the inside, split foes two wide in midstretch but missed reaching fourth.
