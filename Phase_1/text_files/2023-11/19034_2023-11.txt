Footnotes
ESPRESSO stalked in the four path the first turn, moved to even terms toward the half mile pole and dueled from that point, took the lead two deep
approaching the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was kept sharp in the stretch. GREATANDGOOD rated close inside on the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, cleared second past the eighth pole and finished evenly.
ALDARIGHTTRICKS saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path
leaving the turn and came along for third mid-stretch. MY BALBOA rated a short early lead inside, was met at even terms nearing the half mile pole and
dueled from that point, ceded the advantage approaching the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened. JUST MURPHY saved
ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. JUST CALL ME
AL raced well off the pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT stalked the early pace from
the two and three paths but faded past the seven sixteenths pole. PREPPYFIED showed little response. JUBA'S MOCHA rounded the first turn about the
five path and never factored.

the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and held on well. ASUE ducked out leaving the gate then chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and
dug in to take second later yards. KILBRITTAIN'S RED engaged in close chase through the backstretch, took the lead two deep midway on the turn, was
steadily handled leaving the turn but gave up the lead while flattening stride mid-stretch. ONLY KIDDING gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and ran
evenly in the lane. CAROLINA SUN chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CALERA LOVE set a
pressured pace from the half mile pole, but was met at the rail midway on the turn and weakened in the stretch.
