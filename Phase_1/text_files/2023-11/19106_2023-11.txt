Footnotes
GREAT IDEA , sluggish leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, raced in the two path in upper stretch, swung outside near the eighth pole,
led late and drove clear. ELUSIVE EDGE stalked the pace to mid turn, eased outside approaching the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave
way grudgingly. RANGER FOX set the pace near the inner rail around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gradually weakened. BOSS MAN J J ,
three wide chasing the pace, weakened in the drive. KENNER advanced along the inner rail in upper stretch then weakened. VOLKERT , checked leaving
the backstretch, was four wide turning for home and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
COCKTAIL DREAMING rated close up while saving ground, awaited room mid turn, slipped through along the rail into the lane and took over, eagerly
opened up in mid stretch then was throttled down through the final seventy yards. GINGER GIRL bore out a the break, corrected and prompted the pace
three wide outside the leader, lightly steadied off the heels of ALLIALLIOXENFREE when lodging a three deep bid into the lane, straightened away to
pursue the winner, switched over to her correct lead inside the furlong grounds and kept on with good energy while second best. ELLIE VICTORINA , inside
while in the clear leaving the far turn, worked outward to be four wide in upper stretch and churned on. LINAHASPECSHOES drifted out at the break,
regrouped and raced off the pace and to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, angled four wide under pressure heading towards the stretch and lacked a
solid rally. ALLIALLIOXENFREE vied outside the winner before clearing heading to the half, set the pace two wide past the five sixteenths, drifted out a bit
when taken on from both sides entering the lane, corrected to stay on to about mid stretch then weakened. MERGER OF EQUALS , a bit rank at the break,
saved ground under a ride mid turn and failed to menace. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , three wide leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA WIND sped to the early lead, set the pace off the rail around the turn, drifted out near the sixteenth pole, dug in and prevailed. IN HER CUPS ,
three wide around the turn, chased the winner, bid for the lead outside that one in mid stretch, drifted out and hung. GET LOADED , steadied leaving the
backstretch, swung to the four path in upper stretch, rallied mildly and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. VOLATILITY , briefly steadied in close quarters
along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained inside horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. QUALITY WEEKEND rushed up after
breaking slowly, angled five wide turning for home and was not a factor. FLITTER , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, gave way. DENIM N
LACE , wide on the turn, was outrun. FINALJUMP chased the pace around the turn then faltered. Following an objection by the rider of IN HER CUPS
against MAGNOLIA WIND for alleged interference in the stretch drive, MAGNOLIA WIND was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT , three wide between foes nearing the backstretch, tracked three deep heading to the half, separated herself from others and
became the closest pursuer leaving the three eighths, moved to engage R B'S BIG MOMENT nearing the quarter pole, asserted herself and took control
into the stretch, moved away under a solid drive past mid stretch, was kept alert to the sixteenth marker then coasted home the final seventy yards. R B'S
BIG MOMENT broke outward and was off a step slow, corrected and advanced four wide outside rivals around the first turn to reach contention, moved
clear of foes past the three quarter pole, dropped in and set the pace, was joined by the winner with a quarter to go, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then
faded through the final sixteenth though well clear of the rest. TURBO MILLIE , four deep nearing the half mile marker, pursued three wide past the five
sixteenths and came up empty. DAZZLING DEMELZA rated off the pace and behind rivals leaving the five eighths, angled out under pressure around the
final turn, came four wide for the drive and faded. SIPPIN' TIME , inside rivals vying around the first turn, rated back a bit leaving the three quarter pole, was
under a ride pursuing past the five sixteenths and gave way. ANY FOOLS GOLD , urged between runners chasing the pace, tired through the final quarter
mile. ROBBERY , fractious behind the gate and reluctant to load, vied between runners around the first turn, prompted two wide through the backstretch and
into into the far turn, failed to kick on under a ride nearing the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
CROSSLAND chased the pace two wide for seven furlongs, secured command in upper stretch and edged away. WRECKING BALL set the pace along the
inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and dug in late to hold the place. MISTER ABARRIO stalked the pace near the inner rail, moved to the three path in
upper stretch and lacked the needed late effort. WICKED SECRET , unhurried, saved ground the far turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, angled
out in mid stretch and flattened out. OPPOSITES ATTRACT , well positioned three deep on the far turn, flattened out. GENERAL'S DUTY , three wide the
first turn, circled the far turn four wide and was no factor. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the far turn and
failed to rally.

FOLE'S NOTION rated four deep and in range nearing the half mile marker, dropped in a path and took closer order under coaxing past the five sixteenths,
closed in under right handed asks and took aim of the leader past the furlong grounds, took over with a sixteenth to go and drew clear under
enocuragement. DISPUTED CLAIM , bumped at the break, quickly recovered and moved up to take command leaving the chute, edged clear and set a
rated pace just off the inside, came under a ride soon into the lane, remained clear under pressure past mid stretch, could not contain the winner soon after,
gave way grudgingly and saved the place. GREAT HEAVENS drifted out at the break bumping DISPUTED CLAIM, straightened and rated towards the
inside, eased out and moved up between rivals mid turn, angled four wide for the drive, churned on and nabbed the place. FRIGHTLAND tracked three wide
early on, dropped in around the turn, was in a bit tight when trying to advance along the rail leaving the three sixteenths, came back out and continued with
effort between runners. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE was sent up three wide between rivals near the half mile pole, chased four wide into the lane but lacked a
solid finish. RHUMJAR , coaxed inside early, chased while saving ground, eased out some in upper stretch and faded. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR
prompted the pace under rating between rivals, eased back leaving the far turn, dropped further back past the five sixteenths and came up empty.
MIDNIGHT RENEGADE , bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to respond. HELDISH , bumped at the break, raced off the
pace, swung about five wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
RUN RAEGAN RUN , off a step slow after having her head turned slightly as the gates sprung, regrouped and rated outside a rival early on, secured the rail
leaving the far turn and gained inside runners past the three eighths, eased off the rail into the lane and closed in under solid right handed asks, overtook
the leader nearing the sixteenth marker and widened while kept alert. CORA'S CHOICE , away alertly, displayed strong speed along the rail while handling
some outside pressure, moved clear into the lane, kept on past mid stretch, could not withstand the winner's charge heading to the sixteenth pole but stayed
on well to remain clear of the rest. JESS'S GYPSY GIRL , away a bit awkwardly, raced well off the early pace, saved some ground while about two wide into
the lane, came out for a clear run in mid stretch, straightened and finished up with good energy. FASHIONATTA , four wide stalking the early pace, raced
three wide mid turn, shifted in for the drive but went evenly in the final furlong. BALI HAI saved ground, angled out near mid stretch but lacked a bid.
ALWAYS FORWARD failed to menace. LIL SPINNER , three wide stalking the early pace, was coaxed along leaving the far turn, failed to kick on leaving
the five sixteenths and weakened. MEETMEATTHEBEACH forced the issue outside CORA'S CHOICE, failed to go on under urging leaving the three
sixteenths and weakened.
