ONE RICH KITTEN away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the far turn, gave up the advantage to the runner up near the five sixteenths
pole, fought back gamely along the rail under right handed urging and got back up in time. DOLCE MARIE pressured the winner two wide into the far turn,
made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then finished second best. MY TWO JAKES never far back, finished with good courage three wide.
MANDOLIN BREEZE was restless in the gate, allowed to settle, then rallied outside rivals four wide through the stretch in a determined effort. GHOSTLY
REVIVAL also restless in the gate, was no factor. HALO EFFECT stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. WELLOILEDCAT saved ground
and was no factor.

of the winner. LAZARUS PROJECT unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap later six wide. RULING FRONT chased the winner two wide and was
outfinished. BIG FALCON ROCKET stalked the pace three wide and went evenly. REINSURE close up from the start, offered a mild bid four wide nearing

Footnotes
JOSH'N set the early pace along the inside, was headed on the turn, fought back gamely under left handed urging along the rail through the stretch and
proved best under confident handling. KEEPING SCORE never far back, rallied steadily through the stretch five wide and got up for second. THE PINK Z
stalked the pace near the inside into the stretch, altered course three wide inside the three sixteenths pole then finished determinedly between rivals.
IT'SGOODTOBESEEN pressed the pace two wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead, matched strides inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished.
WILDCAT BILL had speed from the start, inched closer four wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. SURROUNDER failed to menace.
MARVIN'S EXPRESS was no factor. STUNT MAN was no threat. ACCURATE was outrun.

Footnotes
OHIO PLAYER sprinted to the lead inside rivals while well off the rail in the four path, set all the pace, drew well clear on the turn and won as much the best
while being kept to task under strong handling. THAT'S THE WAY was bumped at the start, trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed determinedly and
got up for second in the 6path. BABA LOOEY was bumped by MUCHO PRIMO, forced out into THAT'S THE WAY causing a chain reaction of bumping to
his outside and rallied belatedly for a minor share in the four path. PLATE IT UP was bumped at he start, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the six path.
CHOCOLATE RABBIT chased the winner four then three wide into the stretch and gave way. JACK BE FAST also bumped at the start, chased the winner
three then two wide and was through after a half. MUCHO PRIMO bore out at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside, was a forward
factor into the turn then stopped. THE RIDERS OF THAT'S THE WAY AND PLATE IT UP LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed four wide under right handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the final strides.
FIRST SONG never far back, rallied four wide to make the lead in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. SIMPLY VALID
bumped at the start, battled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch and faded late. HEY EUGENE unhurried early, passed tiring rivals through the
stretch five wide while out in the eight path. PATIO PARTY bumped at the start, pressed4the pace four then three wide into the stretch and weakened late.
ROCK ON KITTEN was no factor. GIV'EM THE BIZ dueled for the lead along the inside to the seven sixteenths pole then gave way. LUCKY STREAK
contested the lead two wide then along the inside through the turn and was used up.
