Footnotes
MISTER SHARPIE was off to an alert start, cleared soon after the first call while in the two or three path, came into the lane from the four path, had his
largest advantage with an eighth to travel then was kept to the task to hold. YOLO SANTIAGO saved ground through the turn and into the lane and was
gaining to the end. FIRST CROWNED pressed the winner early then chased that one while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the
five path and weakened while losing the place spot in the final eighth. WHITE PIGEON was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and turned in
an even effort. SCHENECTADY STAR never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn and never factored. SHERLOCKED saved ground
through the turn and lost ground. ONE SOCK BILLY never made an impact while racing in the two path through the turn.

winner but couldn't match strides. MISS GOODBAR was brushed at the start, raced in the four path and gained the show spot. SPIRITCATCHER stalked
the pace but lacked a late bid. ENDLESS brushed a rival at the start, then saved ground.

on the top ones and lacked a closing response. KITTENS ADAIR pressed the pace three wide early, chased the leaders through the turn and into the lane

Footnotes
KILLER HOTROD chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the pacesetter, shifted in sharply
just inside the eighth pole, continued with good momentum near the inside and edged up rail. BOLSHIE set the pace on a clear lead from the outset,
continued clear into the far turn while in the two path, swung into the lane from the three path then could not hold the winner safe while finishing second
best. AMAZING JUSTICE saved ground through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the two path and moved up while not a threat to the top
ones. EPIC THE LEGEND was along the inside down the backstretch, angled four wide approaching mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path and
moved up while not a menace. SECRETO DE AMORE raced in the four path through the turn when near the back, straightened in the lane from the three or
four path and passed a couple. FOR MAMA was jostled between rivals soon after the start, tracked the pace while saving ground, continued near the inside
through the turn and into the lane and tired. SHA KON O HEY in the two or three path through the far turn when in mid-pack and tired. PABLO'S SUN never
a factor while in the two path throughout. GOLDEN RAPPER raced well back while in the two or three path and was subsequently vanned off. DOLINSKI
raced four wide through the first turn and into the backstretch when moving to chase the pace, began losing ground in the far turn and retreated through the
lane.

GIRVIN CITY LIMITS vied for the lead two wide through the turn, began inching away straightening in the lane, shook clear with an eighth to go then
widened to the wire. SHIPCAPTAINNCREW vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, was no match for the winner through the final eighth then
stayed on to be clear for the place spot. RODEO ZONE was off flat footed and took a bit to get going, raced in the five path through the turn, came into the
lane from the seven path and moved up for the show spot. OUT WORK'M raced in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane
from the two path and stayed on to miss the show spot. TIZAWHITEFACECAT chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from
the two path, shuffled a bit straightening into the lane then lacked the closing response. BARCA BILLY raced in the four path through the turn and into the
lane and moved up while not a threat. AMATEUR DAY never a factor while near the rail into the lane. BLACK WHITE N GOLD saved ground into the lane
then faded. BUCKET LIST chased the pace from the three path through the turn and was empty through the lane. NEUTRON raced near the back while in
the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired. IZZAT outrun while near the rail. PRINCE SHUKO trailed throughout while
