Footnotes
KEEP MOVIN' ON rated nicely off of the early pace, tracked into the first turn and saved ground into the backstretch run, was guided two then three wide
heading to the half-mile pole, stalked the leading pair into the far turn and raced within aim three wide approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead into the
stretch and took a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, dueled with BABY WAYLON into the final sixteenth, battled with the game runner-up into deep
stretch and determinedly won the nod at the finish to prevail. BABY WAYLON away from the gate in good order and was sent to establish the early pace,
was engaged by TAMARANDO STAR heading to the first turn and contested the pace with that rival into the backstretch run, disputed decent fractions with
TAMARANDO STAR to the half-mile pole, dueled into the far turn and lost a bit of ground at the quarter pole, came again into upper stretch and vied for the
lead at the furlong marker, confronted KEEP MOVIN' ON inside of the furlong pole and dueled with that foe to the sixteenth-marker, battled gamely inside of
KEEP MOVIN' ON into deep stretch and held a slim lead into the final strides, was bested at the finish and was well clear of the rest for second.
TAMARANDO STAR broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, engaged with BABY WAYLON and contested the pace into the first turn, disputed
decent fractions into the backstretch run, dueled with BABY WAYLON into the far turn and took a narrow lead while between horses heading to the quarter
pole, battled between runners into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for third. GROGU allowed to settle, maintained an
outside path into the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid along the far turn, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and flattened out. WE CAN
tracked the early pace, raced two wide into the first turn then was guided to the three path into the backstretch run, tracked the decent fractions while not far
back heading to the half-mile pole, slipped to the inside into the far turn, was outrun to the quarter pole and did not factor in the stretch. BUTCH O'HARE
forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early pace two then three wide along the first turn, was well positioned while tracking the pace two wide to the
half-mile marker, began to drop back nearing the far turn, was pulled up at the quarter marker and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CALIGRAPHY was outrun in the early stages, built up some momentum through the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and produced a nice rally to get
up in time. HARBOR DEAREST came away from the gate running and dueled for the lead with RUNAWAY SALLY through the turn, got the better of that
rival passing the five-sixteenths pole, took on a new challenge from SAHARA SUE to the outside, held a short lead at the top of the stretch, got another
challenge from HILLSDALE NATION on the inside, was passed briefly by that one near the sixteenths pole but fought back for second. HILLSDALE
NATION broke well then was put in a tight hold by the rider, then angled to the inside when clear, stalked the front trio through the turn then tipped out to the
two path, quickened stride and gained the show. SAHARA SUE stalked the dueling pacesetters three wide on the turn, got to the flank of HARBOR
DEAREST at the top of the stretch, tried hard but could not get by that stubborn foe and was outfinished late for a minor award. RUNAWAY SALLY broke
sharply and went head to head with HARBOR DEAREST through the first quarter, came under heavy pressure passing the five-sixteenths marker, remained
a factor to mid-stretch then faded in the last furlong.

Footnotes
DICK BEST broke alertly and set the pace into the first turn, was confronted by CALI CONQUEST and set a contested pace into the backstretch run,
conceded the lead heading to the half-mile pole and tracked from the inside into the far turn, was taken off of the rail approaching the quarter pole, swung
five wide into the stretch, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth,
drew clear into deep stretch and held sway in the end. SEA OF LIBERTY rated off of the early pace, was floated five wide into the first turn, recovered and
tracked the leaders four wide into the backstretch run, pulled on the rider heading to the half-mile marker, made a middle move and rushed to contention
three wide approaching the far turn, vied for the lead three wide nearing the quarter marker and battled into upper stretch, was overtaken by DICK BEST at
the furlong marker, was outfinished by the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for second. CHIEF JACKSON settled in the second flight to
begin and tracked three wide into the first turn, was well positioned into the backstretch run and tracked two wide and between rivals to the half-mile pole,
raced three wide into the far turn, gained ground heading to the quarter marker then came in tight and was blocked nearing the top of the stretch, remained
in tight at the three-sixteenths marker, found room at mid-stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth, stayed on in deep stretch and won the nod for third
on the wire. KO SAMUI (IRE) tracked the early pace four wide, drifted out a bit into the first turn and floated out SEA OF LIBERTY, tracked the decent pace
three wide through the backstretch run, raced four wide into the far turn and loomed at the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled to
the furlong marker, could not match strides with DICK BEST into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and just missed for third on the wire.
IMPLICITLY tracked the early pace from the inside, came under a tight hold approaching the half-mile marker and navigated traffic to race two wide into the
far turn, was boxed in at the quarter pole, continued to be in tight into upper stretch, was able to shake free at the furlong marker but could not muster a late
rally. LOVE OF THE SPORT tracked the early pace two wide and between runners into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and raced close up
to the decent pace while three wide heading to the half-mile marker, took a narrow lead at that station and vied for the lead two wide into the far turn, lost
position into the stretch, dropped back approaching the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. CALI CONQUEST asked for early speed and was
prominent into the first turn, engaged with DICK BEST and contested the pace with that rival into the backstretch run, took a narrow lead between runners
and vied for the lead heading to the half-mile pole, lost position into the far turn, chased from the inside into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

BOLD DAUGHTER away a step slowly from the gate,was kept near the back of the field and saved ground under some restraint through the early stages,
tipped out three wide into the stretch, had a little trouble keeping a straight course but kept on under steady handling and got up in time. LA VIKINA was
allowed to settle and tracked the front pair traveling well in hand for the first half-mile, was still going easily into the turn, waited until passing the quarter pole
to make a move, responded when set down, ran on well, took a short lead inside the sixteenth and was caught yards from the finish. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN
was content to cede the lead to PROOF OF JAZZ through the early stages, then decided to press the pace approaching the five furlong marker and pushed
that rival to quicken a bit, backed off again and moved back to a stalking position to the far turn, was asked to quicken near the five-sixteenths marker, and
took over the lead by the quarter pole, drifted inward down the stretch putting PROOF OF JAZZ in tight quarters, rider lost the crop inside the sixteenth pole
and was overtaken in the final yards. PROOF OF JAZZ assumed command away from the start, was able to set comfortable fractions with only a modest bit
of pressure on BLUEBERRY MUFFIN, offered no resistance when that foe challenged approaching the stretch, tried to re-rally along the rail but got put in
tight quarters and gave way. CHARLOTTE HARBOR fractious in the gate, was unhurried early and lagged near the back of the field to the far turn, set up
for a three to four wide run through the turn, then came into the stretch still wide and was only able to pass one in the end. PANDEMIC GIRL tracked the
early pace outside of rivals, raced four wide down the backstretch, came under a drive passing the three-furlong pole, struggled to keep up from that point
and gave way.

LAMMAS (GB) forwardly placed in the early going and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace into the backstretch run and was well placed
heading to the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, mounted an inside bid at the quarter marker and took command into the stretch,
kicked clear approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task while clear to the sixteenth-pole, dug in in deep stretch and held safely in the end over the
oncoming runner-up. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY prominent leaving the start and stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, raced close up to the
decent pace through the backstretch run, pressed MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH into the far turn and vied for the lead three deep at the quarter marker,
maintained that three wide path into the lane and chased to mid-stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured LAMMAS in deep stretch but could not
get by the determined winner and was second best. ROYAL 'N RANDO allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace
through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and mounted an inside rally into the stretch, needed more in the final furlong but held
well for third in the late stages. FREEPORT JOE forwardly placed leaving the start, was a bit keen into the first turn and tracked the leading pair two wide
into the backstretch run, was well placed approaching the half-mile marker and was guided three wide into the far turn, mounted a three wide bid at the
quarter pole and raced four wide into the stretch, lost ground into the drive and lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth, flattened out and just
missed for third on the wire. PASSARANDO unhurried in the early stages and raced outside of his stablemate into the first turn, settled through the
backstretch run and chased into the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, shifted to the two path approaching the
sixteenth-marker, could not muster a final response and finished evenly. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH sent leaving the break and assumed command in the early
stages, dictated terms into the first turn and carved out decent fractions while showing the way to the half-mile pole, came under pressure into the far turn,
drifted to the two path at the quarter pole, lost the lead to LAMMAS into upper stretch, dropped back heading to the furlong marker and tired in the final
stages.

SWALL broke well and was forwardly place from the outset, raced three wide through the turn, was on the outside of a trio contesting the lead at the quarter
pole, pulled ahead with a furlong to run and won clear. BREVE lacked early speed and raced at the rear of a compact field, was put into a drive from the
five-sixteenths pole, had to alter course to the outside mid-stretch, finished well and surged late to gain second. STRANGE ADDICTION broke well but was
unable to keep up with the leading trio early, made some forward progress going into the turn, became boxed in through the turn, tried to go through a
narrow opening near the eighth pole, steadied when the hole closed, re-rallied when clear, drifted out a bit into deep stretch, missed for second and was up
in time to secure third at the finish. BERRY VALLEY broke well and settled just off the flank of LADY GREGORY and shadowed that foe to the turn, moved
up in tandem with SWALL to challenge for the lead approaching the quarter pole, battled to mid-stretch then weakened and was just edged for third. MISS
BELLIMBUSTO bumped at the start, was last away and allowed to settle into stride, started making some forward progress passing the five furlong marker,
got stuck behind horses through the turn, tried to go through a hole at the top of the stretch at the same time STRANGE ADDICTION went for the same
hole, made some contact, neither got through, then shifted to the outside, attempted to rally, but had to check off the heels of STRANGE ADDITION once
again yards from the wire. LADY GREGORY broke well and was hustled to the front, pressed by BERRY VALLEY in the early stages, came under pressure
at the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch, gave way at the eighth pole and faded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SPEED GRAZY was knocked off stride by CHICKENFINGERFRIDAY just after the break causing loss of a length or two at the start, then settled at the rear
of the field, remained in that position to the far turn, circled the field to get into contention, came into the stretch five wide with huge momentum but on the
wrong lead, sustained the run through the stretch, drifted in late and got a nose in front at the wire. UNION WAVE broke well but eased off the pace to avoid
getting hung five wide on the first turn, settled comfortably mid-pack to the half mile pole, moved forward through the far turn but became boxed in, slipped
through a successive pair of narrow openings in the stretch, surged up the rail when clear, was put in tight by ARTEMUS GORDON near the sixteenth pole,
pushed back and knocked that rival off-stride near the wire causing the rider to stop riding for a couple of strides, got back down and just missed at the wire.
ARTEMUS GORDON broke well and got a share of the lead into the first turn, pulled the rider to the front on the backstretch, led the field through
reasonable fractions to the far turn, took a short lead at the head of the stretch, got challenged by UNION WAVE to the inside and SPEED GRAZY to the
outside inside the furlong grounds, got put in tight at the sixteenth pole, then was bumped off stride by UNION WAVE in the closing yards and lost all
chance. EL JOY settled behind early while holding the rail, remained unhurried down the backstretch, awaited room through the turn then got put in tight
quarters at the three-sixteenths pole, re-rallied through a narrow opening mid-stretch, ran on and improved position. WODETON (FR) got forward position
early and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, bid for the lead while racing between horses passing the three furlong pole, was unable to match
strides passing the three-sixteenths marker, drifted in some late and weakened in deep stretch. ARREST was sent hard from the break and was able to
secure the rail and share of the early lead, then was content to sit just off ARTEMUS GORDON when that one took over the pacesetting duties, tracked
inside to the far turn, struggled to keep up from the five-sixteenths pole and finished one-paced. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY broke in and bumped with
SPEED GRAZY after the break, then was outrun into the turn, settled well behind the field to the far turn, tried to rally three wide through the turn ran into
some traffic at the head of the stretch swung out a path for room and flattened out. BUTTONWOOD TREE got away well but was forced four wide through
the clubhouse turn, stayed out in the clear while racing up close in the early going, made a three wide forward move through the far turn to challenge for for
the lead near the five-sixteenths pole then stopped at the head of the stretch and was ridden out to the finish behind the field. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE DEEP STRETCH RUN. IN A MAJORITY DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SPEED GRAZY DRIFTED
IN, CAUSING ARTEMUS GORDON TO STEADY AND TAKE UP IN DEEP STRETCH, AND THIS ACTION COST ARTEMUS GORDON THE
OPPORUNTIY OF A BETTER PLACING. SPEED GRAZY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD.
