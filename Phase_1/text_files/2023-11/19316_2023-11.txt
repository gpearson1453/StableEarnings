Footnotes
GIZMO'S MISSION away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under mild right handed urging to win as much the best. MR. CELLULAR
chased the winner two wide and finished well clear for second in the four path. MR LAOBAN was bumped at the start, moved up three wide on the far turn
then leveled off. NATURE OFTHE BEAST chased the winner along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch to the four path and finished evenly. BELL
CURVE was bounced around between horses at the start, tailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals along the rail. ALTAIR broke inward causing a chain
reaction of bumping to his inside then was through after half. SECRETARY OF WAR also bumped at the start, was no threat.

Footnotes
DOUGS MORNING PICK trailed early, shifted outside on the turn, the rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch, circled his field under a strong hand ride in
the six path and got up in the in final stride. OAKEN battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, made the lead, set the balance of the pace under strong
pressured and held firm under left handed urging. PRIVATE DRIVE vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead two
wide, matched stride to the wire and just missed in a game effort. OL' NED hopped at the start, moved up four wide in the turn then failed to sustain that bid.
PLATE IT UP failed to menace. SURROUNDER had good early speed then faded. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN dueled for the lead along the inside to the top of
the stretch then was used up.

SWEEPINJUSTICE saved ground into the turn, shifted out wide wide nearing the top of the stretch, circled her field to make the lead near the sixteenth pole
and edged clear under brisk handling. VAVITE settled along the rail, stalked the top trio past the quarter pole, slipped through to make the lead at the top of
the stretch then was no match for the winner in the final stages. CREATIVE CADENCE drifted to the five path while making the lead soon after the start, set
a pressured pace off the rail past the five sixteenth pole, gave up a narrow lead, kept on until deep stretch then weakened. DULCE VICTORIA pressed the
pace three then four wide until mid stretch and faded late. POLITICAL ASTRAY pressed the pace two wide for three furlongs, led between calls, had speed
into the stretch then came up empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

under mild right handed urging and prevailed under a hand ride. CIRO THE BOSS never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path and finished well clear
for second. STORMED OUT made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and faded late. EL
SORDO passed tiring rivals two wide. MAILS HERE moved up three wide on the turn then leveled off. ROUGE TU RICHES was no factor. MOR CRAFTY

Footnotes
ORFANO never far back, closed willingly four wide to make the lead in upper stretch and drew off under right urging. I STRONG allowed to settle, loomed
boldly five then four wide into the stretch and finished second best. WILDCAT PRIDE pressed the early pace two wide, led on the turn then was outfinished.
CONSTITUTION COAL had good early speed along the inside, lacked room at the seven sixteenths pole then finished with good courage two wide.
HOTROD BOBBY close up two then three wide, finished determinedly. SHOWTIME BOY set a pressured pace along the inside through the turn then was
outfinished. MAN'S CHOICE was no threat. HARSH TRUTH showed little. YIPPEE KI YAY offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then came up empty.
WHISKEY HELPS was always outrun.
