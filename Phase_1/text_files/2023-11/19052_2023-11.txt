Footnotes
FLEETS BAY prompted the pace two wide early, bid for the lead mid way down the backstretch, battled outside CRIPPLE CREEK in upper stretch, asserted
himself late and drew clear. WORLD FACTOR stalked the pace inside horses to the stretch, swung wide for the drive and rallied mildly. BLIND EYE , four
wide the far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR , rank in traffic the first turn, raced in the two path between
horses the far turn and into the stretch and rallied mildly. TIO TONY , steadied behind horses soon after the break, was wide the far turn, floated to the five
path in upper stretch and failed to rally. HIGH STAKES raced near the inner rail most of the trip and lacked a rally. CRIPPLE CREEK showed speed along
the inner rail, battled to mid stretch and gave way in the drive. GO TAKE CHARGE , wide, was outrun. PHOTO COPY , along the inner rail for much of the
trip, was not a factor. FOE , between horses the far turn, was outrun. MARYLAND MOON bumped with DYNA BLAST the first turn, advanced three deep
the far turn and faltered. DYNA BLAST , four wide entering the first turn, bumped with MARYLAND MOON on the bend, faltered in upper stretch and was
eased.

Footnotes
PRESSING CONCERN vied three deep early, moved clear into the turn then dropped in and set a rated pace, responded to solid asks past the three
sixteenths, wandered outward a bit but dug in tenaciously to thwart outside challenges in the final seventy yards. ISLAND D'LITE vied inside a pair of rivals
early on, eased back off the winner nearing the turn, came out and advanced two wide past the five sixteenths, shifted a bit wider and closed in leaving the
furlong grounds, challenged between rivals was kept at bay. FROG TOWN saved ground early, edged up and angled three wide brushing with a foe nearing
the turn, took closer order heading to the lane, moved out a bit wider to continue progression, loomed inside the furlong grounds but could only gain slightly
in the final yards. SPONSORED broke a step slow, was urged along off the rail, raced between rivals pursuing past the three eighths, came four wide for the
drive and offered a mild late response. SMOOTH RICO disputed the early pace between runners, eased back off the winner near the half, gave hard chase
mid turn and came up empty. SWEET ASTA , off the pace, raced two wide into the stretch and failed to respond. RASCALLY REBEL stalked outside a rival,
lightly brushed with FRIG TOWN when that one angled out near the half, lost his action and checked soon after, dropped back, lost ground five wide into the
lane and faded. SHACKINTHEBOX dropped back early and was eased through the drive.

BETWEEN THE COVERS stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path on the far turn, gained the lead near the eighth pole, drove
clear and switched to his left lead late. GETTIN'DOWNONIT lacked speed, raced in the three path leaving the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and
rallied. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA , inside horses entering the far turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, advanced between horses and
flattened out. DARK AND FITZY sped the early lead and was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail and weakened the final
furlong. KING SWANSBORO , unhurried along the inner rail down the backstretch, steadied lacking room leaving the far turn and failed to rally. LARGER
THAN LIFE swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. REEL WELL , sent into contention soon after the break, chased the pace, was three wide
into the far turn and gave way. JACKSON ROAD , rank soon after the break, circled the far turn four wide, faltered and was ease.

Footnotes
POGGIBONSI , bumped at the break, recovered and was nudged up to the inside of rivals to take command, set the pace towards the rail, handled outside
pressure around the turn, was guided two wide entering the lane, came in under right handed asking and bumped BENEATH THE STARS in mid stretch,
corrected, kept on under tenaciously under left handed encouragement, jumped a shadow a stride or two from the wire and prevailed. BENEATH THE
STARS edged up between rivals early on and stalked, awaited room behind foes nearing the lane, dropped in towards the rail soon into the stretch, moved
up to the inside of POGGIBONSI to threaten past the three sixteenths, was bumped and put in tight by that rival a furlong out, regrouped and kept on
gamely inside rivals while just missing. CANOODLE , lost ground four wide outside rivals while pursuing the pace, took closer order approaching the stretch,
shifted out a bit wider soon into the lane, advanced while drifting in leaving mid stretch, threatened late then hung. MAMA G'S WISH saved ground within
range, steadied and eased back off of a rival near the quarter pole, altered outside for the drive and came back on in gritty fashion. VIOLENT VIXEN stalked
the leaders three wide, moved up and bid three deep around the turn, pressed the pace into the lane, failed to kick leaving mid stretch and faded.
BOURBON WILDCAT broke inward and bumped POGGIBONSI, raced off the pace and off the inside, was under a strong ride mid turn, shifted out but
lacked a solid run. MATTITUDE prompted the pace outside the leader, moved alongside around the turn, battled between runners into the lane then tired
leaving mid stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of BENEATH THE STARS, POGGIBONSI was disqualified from first and placed
second for causing interference in the stretch.

stalked three the two wide, moved to engage the winner mid turn, forced the issue to the head of the lane, could not match strides soon after, gave way
grudgingly through the final furlong and just saved the place. INDIAN LAKE , nudged along off the inside, angled five wide for the drive, closed steadily and
just missed second. JEOPARDY JAMES chased behind rivals, steadied briefly around the turn, regrouped to pursue and continued with interest to the
inside of runners. BIG ROWDY DAN saved ground off the pace, angled out around a rival into the lane, moved up behind a pair of runners nearing the
sixteenth pole, steadied briefly, angled in and kept on with interest. SHACKLED LOVE chased the pace four then three wide, drifted in past mid stretch and
faded. TREASURE TRADITION , towards the inside with pursuit, gave way in upper stretch. SUPREMACY , sluggish early, was ridden along leaving the far
turn, raced wide in the drive and lacked a response.

Footnotes
DAILY PLANET , up close in the two path leaving the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, rallied outside
PLEASE MARRY ME, led late and narrowly prevailed. AMPLIO ESQUEMA , bumped and forced in by PLEASE MARRRY ME leaving the starting gate, was
rated between horses to the stretch, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied. PLEASE MARRY ME bore in leaving the starting gate then sprinted clear, set
the pace along the inner rail, was hooked near the sixteenth pole and weakened. MOSALAH saved ground in a forward position, eased off the rail on the far
turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. CARMEL SUNRISE prompted the pace outside PLEASE MARRY ME, weakened in upper
stretch and was steadied in close quarters near the eighth pole. HOT CHOICE raced inside horses most of the trip and failed to rally in an even effort.
PROPER STORM , squeezed back start, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. WATER WITCH hopped at the break, was rank behind horses
entering the first turn and failed to be a factor. MISQUILLO was outrun. MOVING IN STEREO lost ground on the turns, faltered in the drive and was eased
late.

Footnotes
SADDLE UP JESSIE settled outside a rival while not too far back, cruised up three deep near the five sixteenths, took over soon into the lane, spurted clear
leaving the three sixteenths, responded when set down in mid stretch and was kept to solid asking through the final sixteenth. I CAN RUN took command
early and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled some outside pressure through the backstretch run, dug in when collared past the five sixteenths,
shifted out a bit after the winner cleared then kept on with good energy to the wire. PEYTON ELIZABETH shadowed the leader through the backstretch and
into the far turn, came under a ride near the five sixteenths, angled out with pursuit entering the lane, lacked a punch in mid stretch and gave way. HAINT
BLUE , brushed soon after the break, lagged off the pace, was put to a ride two wide near the half mile marker but failed to get involved. DRY WELL ,
bumped and in tight soon after the break, rated off foes then dropped in, was under a ride around the final turn and faded. TIC TIC TIC BOOM bobbled at
the break, was bumped a few strides later, saved ground off the pace, dropped back leaving the three eighths then swung wide for the drive.

Footnotes
TEQUILERA , bumped by GUN BOAT leaving the starting gate, saved ground stalking the pace, found room along the inner rail through stretch and was up
in time. SURYA lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and closed. GUN BOAT bumped the winner
when bearing out at the break, set the pace, was well off the rail in the stretch and weakened. THISNAMEISOKAY chased the pace outside GUN BOAT,
took a short lead in mid stretch and weakened. GALILEI stalked the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and weakened.
IN A SPIN saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the lane and failed to rally. BALI KUTA , never a factor, worked between horses in the
stretch. RUDA broke in the air, raced wide the far turn and was no factor. CHELICHNA , always near the inner rail, was no factor. FLANIGAN'S COVE ,
three wide the first turn, raced between horses the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was always outrun. GYPSY REWARD chased the pace outside
horses, circled the far turn three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
JACKSON'S DIXIE was nudged clear early then dropped in to secure the rail to set the pace, was joined by MYSISTERNANCY past the five sixteenths,
kicked back clear after being put to a strong ride, kept on under pressure inside the sixteenth pole, was joined again by that one in the final yards and got
the bob. MYSISTERNANCY tucked up inside just off the leaders, angled three wide while put to pressure three furlongs out, rolled up to threaten
approaching the quarter pole, stayed on with pursuit as the winner went clear past the three sixteenths, found more to make a final surge in deep stretch,
drew alongside near the wire and lost the bob. COAL MINE saved ground, edged up mid way on the final turn, stayed inside chasing in upper stretch but
went even late. ONE LAS OLAS broke a step slow, was taken wide early and raced outside runners, advanced four wide under a ride past the five
sixteenths, loomed into the lane then flattened out through the final furlong. EARLEY ROSE , between rivals stalking past the five eighths, gave way. IRISH
LACE , four wide early, prompted outside the winner through the backstretch, was under pressure past the three eighths, failed to quicken into the lane and
dropped back. VOODOO MAMA JUJU , three wide, faltered leaving the far turn.
