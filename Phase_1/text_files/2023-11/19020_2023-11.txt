Footnotes
HOME SCHOOL , patiently handled near the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out on the far turn, floated six deep at the head of the stretch, rallied
outside foes, led mid stretch and drew clear under steady urging. VAX A NATION , rated inside horses to the stretch, worked between rivals in upper
stretch, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and closed strongly. MOST WANTED MAN lacked speed, swung to the four path in upper stretch, bid for the
lead in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. URBAN MYTH , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, swung to the three path leaving
the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. GLIDING AFLEET raced inside horses much of the trip and failed to rally in an even
effort. COVERT KAT chased the pace, gained a two wide lead on the far turn and gave way the final furlong. SEVILLE ROW weakened. LANGLEE
AVENUE was no factor. HANFORD , wide both turns, lacked a rally. KING OF CHAOS , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way. BEE
MAJOR set the pace along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
VIENNESE WALTZ , hard urged from the gate, edged up while saving ground into the turn, slipped through along the rail to join the embattled leaders mid
turn, took over nearing the lane, kicked clear under a hearty drive in upper stretch then steadily widened while kept to task. BIG EARN vied to the inside of
DETERMINED BLUE early on, checked leaving the five eighths then altered out, rebid three wide outside that one leaving the far turn, dueled from mid turn
to the five sixteenths, remained on her left lead pursuing past mid stretch, switched over to her correct lead late and stayed on gamely to hold down the
place. BATTLING TIME , off slow after breaking inward, regrouped and was taken wide, moved up outside runners heading to the turn, chased four wide
between foes nearing mid stretch then went evenly late. SALTY GIRL sat perched outside the leaders into the turn, shifted five wide approaching the
stretch, gave hard chase outside runners leaving mid stretch but lacked a serious finish. DETERMINED BLUE vied two wide outside BIG EARN early on,
briefly cleared then was joined again leaving the half, sparred under asking while between runners past the three eighths, lacked a response nearing the
lane and gave way. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT broke outward, raced between rivals while off the pace into the turn, lacked a kick past the three eighths and
dropped back.

WALKS LIKE A LADY stalked the pace while three wide around the turn, gained command near the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling. WILD
DELIGHT raced in mid pack to the stretch, moved to the five path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND , three wide chasing the pace
around the turn, weakened in the drive. RED WIND lacked speed, swung to the five path turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones.
LADY IN HEELS opened up leaving the turn and gave way the final furlong. SNEAKY CHEEKY , three wide on the turn, was not a factor. THEODORA
GRACE , always near the inner rail, was no factor. CANADIAN GINGER , well placed in the three path on the turn, gave way in the drive. TRANSLATE
raced along the inner rail while outrun. EVANGELINE ALLONS was outrun.

WHAT SAY YOU , a bit rank at the break, recovered and was nudged clear into the first turn, dictated the pace towards the inside, entered the lane two
wide responded when put to firm asking past the three sixteenths, wandered outward near the sixteenth pole, switched over to his correct lead and widened.
UP AGAINST IT , firmly in hand between runners and up close past the seven eighths, was rated back off foes through the backstretch run, advanced inside
a rival past the three eighths, stayed inside for the drive, churned on and nabbed the place in the final yards. ACE NINE NINE rated close while saving
ground early, eased out leaving the far turn, was under heavy pressure pursuing three wide into the lane, gave way grudgingly and lost the place late. HOT
N SPICY LOVE saved ground off the pace, eased out past mid stretch and had belated action. CAPTAIN CARDO , bumped at the break, raced off the pace
and off the inside, came three wide between rivals into the lane but lacked a serious kick. SOUPER CATCH , three wide early stalking the pace, was
pushed along between rivals into the far turn, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and tired. BAHAMA CHANNEL angled out into the backstretch,
chased three to four wide and tired. COUNTY COURT , bumped at the start, dropped off the pace while off the rail, had no response around the final turn
and faltered.

MURRAY , nudged up outside rivals early to gain a stalking spot, tracked the duelers into the turn, quickly moved up and bid four deep mid turn, battled
outside SEVEN'S ELEVEN into the lane, got the better of that one in mid stretch then eagerly pulled away under a drive. MONDAY MORNING QB broke a
bit slow, was taken to rate while saving ground, worked outward to be five wide and to the inside of a couple of rivals soon into the lane, straightened away
and kept on willingly to nab the place. SEVEN'S ELEVEN rated close up while saving ground into the turn, eased out and bid three wide between rivals
leaving the three eighths, held a slim lead battling to the inside of the winner into the lane, fought on past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly through the final
sixteenth and was edged for second in the final jumps. TOP BOSS , sent from the gate, got engaged in a duel to the inside of BLESSED ARION soon after,
sparred past the five sixteenths then weakened nearing mid stretch. WENDELL FONG , three deep early, was fanned seven wide into the lane and came up
empty. MOJOVATION , off the pace, saved ground into the lane but lacked a solid kick. BLESSED ARION dueled two wide outside TOP BOSS, raced
between runners as the top pair moved in near the five sixteenths, drifted out entering the lane and faded. FULL AUTHORITY bobbled at the break, edged
up between runners and chased, was fanned out to about the six path while between rivals into the lane, failed to kick on near the three sixteenths and tired.

CHICKAHOMINY lacked speed, was in the five path in upper stretch, worked between horses in mid stretch, closed outside the w leader and was up at the
wire. RECINTO ROMPERE bumped ANGEL ART when bearing out at the break, sprinted clear on the turn, was well off the rail in the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. ALLA BREVE stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied outside foes. WISE AND
ELEGANT saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and flattened out. PATTY CAKES , swung to the six path in upper stretch, offered
a mild rally. PAGEANT PRINCESS , near the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. ANGEL
ART , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, finished willingly between horses. LILLY SIMONE , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, gave
way. CLASSIC PERFORMER showed speed near the inner rail down the backstretch, eased back and was taken outside entering the turn, chased the
pace and weakened. VOLNAY bore in bumping ANGEL ART at the break and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
BINNIE broke a bit slow then was forced in, recovered and was taken to rate while saving ground, drafted back leaving the far turn, angled out approaching
the quarter then straightened away to be five wide in upper stretch, responded to strong hand encouragement and leveled off past the three sixteenths,
sustained under a firm hand ride to take command inside the sixteenth pole and drew out. HATEFUL was sent from the gate to gain a slim early advantage,
sparred between rivals into and around the turn, spurted away under a drive in upper stretch, could not contain the winner with about seventy yards to go
but kept on gamely to the wire. BUNNY HOP , jostled soon after the break, pulled her way forward while four wide and appearing difficult to settle, ranged
up four to loom into the lane, chased on her left lead past mid stretch and came up empty in deep stretch. LADY CHARLOTTE , away last when hopping at
the break, soundly bumped with BUNNY HOP, moved up outside a rival leaving the far turn and gave hard pursuit of the embattled leaders, angled four
wide into the lane, altered in towards the rail for the final furlong and kept on with effort. ENEMYNUMBERNINE , urged inside while chasing, steadied briefly
near the quarter pole, came out to work between runners, angled further out in the final eighth and churned on. NEXT GIRL , with the pace three deep,
dueled mid turn, gave willing chase as the leader cleared past the three sixteenths, stayed on to late then faded. MEG , soundly bumped and pinched back
soon after the break, was pushed along off the inside mid turn, angled four wide into the lane, shifted further out in mid stretch and offered a belated
response. BLUE TRILLION , bumped after the break, edged up soon after and chased to the inside of a rival, stayed on to upper stretch then faded.
KATIE'S BRAT broke inward bothering the winner, straightened and was hustled up towards the rail to engage HATEFUL, dueled to mid turn, could not
keep pace under asking in upper stretch and weakened.
