pace two and three wide and and was outkicked in the lane. FLUID raced up close inside and weakened in the lane. MAYBE MAGIC was outrun inside.
PERILOUS prompted the winner three wide and tired in the drive. A PALACE FOR MOM played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
GRAND DANIEL vied for the lead in the five path, took a short lead under coaxing in the four path midway around the turn, kicked away while on his left
lead from the five path in upper stretch, and was wrapped up late. ANTILLEAN raced off the pace in the four path, was under right handed encouragement
in the three path rounding turn, and ran on from the two path down the lane for place. VANISHING INTEREST broke slow and was herded out at the start,
chased in the four path, was ridden between foes around the turn, and stayed on from the four path in the stretch for show. GINGERSNAP JACK broke out
at the start, trailed from the two path into the turn, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the stretch, but flattened. DOC
BALLARD pressed inside of foes in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, and faded.
CORPORATE AFFAIR rated in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. NICO'S HAVING FUN prompted the
pace in the six path but yielded turning into the lane. HONOR GOLD dueled for the lead in the four path but backed up between foes around the turn.

LURE HIM IN tracked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter near the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead in upper stretch and drew
clear under a drive. BLACK BELT prompted the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, led to upper stretch but was no match for the
winner in the final furlong. BOCA BOY set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker and held on the show. TARTUFO failed to
menace while racing two wide. SELF TAUGHT played no factor while racing three wide. LOGICO chased the pace four wide and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ALA TURKA chased in the two path, was ridden along the rail around the turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and rallied past an inner
trio in the final furlong. FLIP MY ID set the pace in the two path, was roused at the top of the lane, dug in gamely inside of rivals, but was caught in the final
strides to place. BARBARA pressed in the four path, bid between foes around the turn, and kept on while on her left lead for show. LEXINATOR prompted
the pace in the five path, bid midway around the turn, fought on between foes in the five path down the stretch, but was outlasted to just miss minor
placings. WINNING AT EASE stalked in the six path, tipped into the three path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, but failed
to bid. TROTTING GEAR trailed throughout around the three path.

Footnotes
DR. RAY D. stalked the pace four wide, took over leaving the eighth pole and drew off while ridden out. ISAYSO set the pace along the rail, drifted out into
the three path turning for home, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold the place. CASUALLY saved ground in range, bid
in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but churned on for the show. LAST GLORY saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and
never threatened. WILDCAT FIRE pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane. MOBAY PRINCESS was reluctant to load, raced three wide and made
little impact. REGAL MISS was outrun while racing four wide. SHARP AZ CAN BE played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
REAL MACHO stalked in the six path, bid going into the stretch, and ran on to be up in the closing stages. ONE SHARP COOKIE set the pace in the five
path, was driven in the four path around the turn, stayed on going into the stretch, but drifted out in the final furlong, and was caught late to place.
RAPTURE BAY tracked in the two path, was roused just after the three-eighths, cut the corner turning into the stretch, but evened out for show. BREAK
OUT broke in at the start, chased in the three path, floated out to the five path around the turn, and made no impact. GUYS TRIP got bumped at the start by
an inner foe, pressed the pace in the two path but backed up along the inside around the turn. HE'S A COMMISIONER broke out an bumped an outer foe,
raced wellback in the three path, was ridden along the rail going into the stretch, but failed to bid. XY FACE broke slowly, trailed in the four path early and
never threatened. WHITE SERIES raced off the pace in the seven path and never menaced.

outwards in the final furlong, and inched past the inner pacesetter in the final strides. ROLLING ON set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn,

outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, fanned out to the nine path under a drive turning into the lane, and kept on for show. GAME BOY BENNY

Footnotes
ONE SMOKIN' RITA raced in range four wide between foes, closed outside and was up late. TESHIMA set the pace in the three path, was collared in upper
stretch, battled back outside of that foe to regain the lead near the sixteenth pole but could not withstand the winner alte. MISS UNCONCERNED was
bumped at the start, made progress inside around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out and weakened late. IMAGE OF CURLIN raced well
back three wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. BREAKING BULLET broke awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide and had a
mild stretch gain. ROMASHKA prompted the pace four wide and faded in the stretch. ALWAYS CONNECTED failed to menace while racing two and three
wide. KINDNESS IS FREE was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact. MYSTICAL LADY broke outwardly, had early speed five wide and
retreated nearing the lane.
