Footnotes
ENCLOSURE broke a beat slow and was put to a bit of crowded quarters at the start, trailed in the two path, then in the five path around the far turn, rallied
to take aim on the top pair entering the final furlong and drove past at the sixteenth pole. VANISHED dictated terms in the two path while well in hand,
resisted an inner bidder well through midstretch, but was bested by an outer challenger with a sixteenth to go. SHIRL'S DELIGHT stalked along the inside,
took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, attempted a bid at the furlong grounds but needed more. MEDAGLIA FOREVER tracked in the four path,
chased under urging around the far turn then faded between horses in upper stretch. RAGGITY SAND pressed the leader from the three path, chased
among foes around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DON'T WAIT UP moved forward after a bit of a flat-footed beginning to set the pace along the inside, inched clear in hand around the turn, then held sway
well through the lane. SOLIDIFY trailed along the inside, then offered a steady rail grind through the lane, bid for place along the inside in the final sixteenth,
dueled late and prevailed. IMPLEMENTATION was off slowly, stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but only
managed to chase that one through midstretch, sparred with an inner bidder for place through the late stages but got outfinished. NIFTY tracked two wide,
chased under urging in the three path around the turn then lacked a bid. PRISONER pressed three to two wide, chased around the turn then faded between
horses in midstretch. GROUP EIGHTEEN laid off of the pace in the four path, but came under coaxing into the turn and was outrun thereafter.

THE PRINCESS SAYS bumped an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of a rival while in the two path, then inched away approaching
midstretch. RUBY FOO broke outwardly, stalked outside of the embattled leading pair, pursued them from further back two wide around the turn, shifted
inwardly in upper stretch while picking up stride, ran on along the rail to offer an inside place bid in the final sixteenth and prevailed. ROYAL BLOOD tracked
along the inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place in the final sixteenth but missed. BELPERRON took simultaneous
contact from rivals on both sides at the start, dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner while kept in the three path by that one around the turn, but
failed to keep pace in upper stretch and yielded place to a rival on either side in the final sixteenth. CODE FOR SUCCESS bumped an inner rival at the start
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
POUNCE prompted two wide, bid entering the lane in the four path sparking a duel with the leader, vied into midstretch, took contact from his inner
counterpart at the furlong pole, kept on and took contact once again from that one at the sixteenth pole, yet sustained the duel through the late stages and
prevailed. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering the lane, held while drifting out and bumping that
one at the furlong grounds, but drifted into her one more time at the sixteenth pole, sparred through the late stages but missed. MISS JEOPARDY pursued
from midpack in the six path, moved down to the three path tracking into the turn, tipped back to the five path entering the lane and ran on willingly. PAM
PAM broke a step slow, then shied between horses and bumped an outer rival leaving the chute, laid off of the pace along the inside, spun for home in the
two path and moved up. SYBARITE bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, then chased in the three path and between horses while
gradually yielding. SPLASH MASTER lacked speed along the inside and failed to menace. SHEZTHEFACTOR stalked along the inside and faded.
EVOCATION bumped with an outer rival while put to crowded quarters at the start, trailed early on and failed to factor. MISCHIEF JAC was reluctant to load,
chased in the five path and faded into the turn. MAHJONG GIRL raced forwardly in the four path early on, but faded before faltering between horses into the
turn. THE TRAINER OF PRINCESS IS OLIVIA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF POUNCE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, BUT THE
STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE OBJECTION.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL KING pressed two wide, chased the clear leader under urging from the three path around the turn, ranged closer to bid entering the lane, drove
clear in the four path in upper stretch then lasted safely. COX CANYON trailed, gained in the five path around the turn, sustained a rally in the six path,
closed in on the clear leader after flopping back to his left lead in the final furlong but ran out of ground. LIAM THE BRAVE stalked along the inside, was
roused in pursuit in the two path around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and ran on evenly. YONO laid off of the pace in the three path and
failed to menace. CARMICHAEL set the pace, built a clear margin nearing the turn, but was headed by an outer bidder entering upper stretch and
weakened. SCHMOOZIN tracked in the four path, but came under coaxing into the turn and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CARBONE set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the rail around the turn, then drew off under a drive. GOLDBRICK pressed the eventual
winner from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and safely maintained place. MOONLIGHT ROAD took a brush to his hind
quarters from an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out into the turn, tipped four to five wide turning for home and
ran on willingly. MIYAGI bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, pursued from the two path turning for home, chased in upper stretch and
yielded. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE leaned inwardly at the start, laid off of the pace while hung in the five path around the turn, floated six to seven wide in
upper stretch and failed to menace. DECATUR STREET broke slowly, raced at the rear in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five to six path and
between horses entering the lane but lacked a rally. SHAKIN LOOSE was jostled between rivals and pinched back at the start, raced at the rear in the two
path and made little impact. DANNER was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, chased along the inside and faded turning for home. HIGH
HEADED bumped the gate while off slow, lagged behind early on and was outrun. YO BANANA BOY stumbled at the start, chased in the four path and
faltered between horses in the lane.

CASH ONLY stalked along the inside before tipping outside of the pace setter entering the backstretch, inched closer around the far turn to forge an
advantage at the five sixteenths pole and drew off. CATHY'S BOY broke a step slow and trailed early on, gained in the four path and outside of rivals into
the far turn, then sustained his long rally to gain place at the sixteenth pole. RUNNIN MUNNIN tracked in the three path, ran on in the final furlong to bid for
place along with an outer foe at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. JACKED set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder at the five
sixteenths pole and gave way. MANFREDI tracked in the two path and lacked a bid. COASTAL BRINK broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside,
took the far turn in the three to five path and lacked a rally. KARLWITHANARL laid off of the pace in the two path and faded. MIDNIGHT MAESTRO
pursued from off of the pace three wide, but was done early, eased through the lane and walked off.
