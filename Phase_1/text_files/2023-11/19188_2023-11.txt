raced with the pace inside, drifted on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. DOC ELM gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn
and showed little in the lane. THUNDERINREADYRICK refused. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race before declaring it official.

S S MIRAGE took the lead at the half mile pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail
on the turn, lugged in under right hand urging mid-stretch and held on driving. RAISE A RUCKUS lunged leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced at
a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then dueled through the stretch for second. ARYA CHARMING gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the
four path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the
turn, was shut off at the heels of S S Mirage mid-stretch and flattened stride. GETTIN SPICY gave chase, raced near the rail into the turn, angled out
approaching the head of the lane and showed little more. METALLIC CAT chased, raced in the four path on the turn, was carried out toward the head of the
lane and showed little in the stretch. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of S S Mirage for interference mid-stretch,
lodged by the rider of Callisto's Brigade.

BETCHA BY GOLLY took the lead while angling in and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and just lasted. DIVINE FASHION rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase passing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three
path on the far turn, eased outward toward the head of the lane, dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole and just missed in a strong finish. I HAVE
COURAGE settled off the pace toward the inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished evenly to take
third later yards. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY stalked off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and flattened nearing mid-stretch. UNCAPTURED RUBY rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far
turn in the four path, left the turn outside and flattened in the lane. BONITA LASSIE saved ground. SECRET CASTLE rounded the opening turn in the four
path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride in the three path on the far turn.
