Footnotes
RICCIO steadied nearing the first turn, saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began
a bid in upper stretch, worked between rivals in mid stretch, shifted out, gained ground late to get up for the win. HAPPY CAT saved ground around the first
turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved
position in the lane, leading in the final furlong before getting caught late. VAX A NATION hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, settled at
the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the two path and gained ground late. GHOSTLYPRINCE
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground into the lane, attempted to
work through inside rivals nearing mid stretch, checked sharply when in tight, altered out for the final seventy yards and came back on. SWAN LAKE raced
in the three path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the second turn, and dug in in the
lane, weakening in the final strides. SAKETUMI raced in the two path around the first bend, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
saving ground around the far bend and dueled in the lane, giving way near the wire. HAY CHIEF saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of
the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the three and four path for the run around the far turn and never threatened. JOHN
HALL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the second turn still in the three path and was empty in the stretch.
BEYOND THE PALE raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace between horses, saved ground around the far bend
and made no bid. HACHURE saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
was never a factor.

RUBYS FLASH brushed with the horse to her inside at the start, recovered to led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving
ground around the turn and drew off in the lane, in command throughout. MY ENDEAVOR raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid from the two
path coming around the bend, swung wide into the lane and gained ground late, but was no match for the winner. SIMON'S CHOICE raced at the back of
the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to improve position in the
stretch. GABRIEL SEVEN bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, stalked the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
kept on in the stretch while proving to be no match for the top finishers. SEEKER chased the leader on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and
was no match in the lane but kept on to the finish. IMAGINE THE GLORY bumped with the horse to his outside and stumbled leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. GINO THINKABOUTIT bumped with the
horse to his inside at the start, stumbling mildly in the process, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the five
path for the run around the turn and was outkicked. NOT THISTIMERANDY tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the two path and faded in the lane. TORTOLA raced off the pace between horses through the opening stages, navigated the bend from the three path and
made no bid. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and

Footnotes
MISTER AGENT led the way throughout, saved ground around the bend and held clear to the wire. THREE CAPTAINS veered in and bumped with the
horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered the chase the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the two
path and gained ground. SQUARE SLICE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and kept on to the finish. BUCKIN' DREAMER stalked the leader on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from
the three path and finished evenly. WHISKEYINTHEJARO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, continued around the
bend in the two path and raced evenly in the lane. WONDER WONDERLAND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter,
came around the turn in the three path and showed no kick. SIN PERMISO trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend
and was empty in the stretch. BETTER WATCH IT raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and
made no bid.
