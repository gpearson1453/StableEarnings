Footnotes
WHEN IN ROME tracked the leaders to the turn, waited patiently behind three horse wall of leaders at the quarter pole, angled five wide turning for home
and wore down his rivals in a determined well handled drive. WILDERZAR reserved early on, made a steady advance three wide in the turn to loom in upper
stretch, overtook the leader inside the eighth pole and was out-finished by the closing winner. QUESTION MARK prompted the pace through the turn, took
command in upper stretch and finished evenly. ROYAL AIR FORCE stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, made an early bid to take the lead
at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. ANGEL'S SOUPERSTAR showed brief speed to be the early pacesetter and gave way in the turn. KATZ
ULTIMO was outrun.

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY set a well rated pace to the far turn, widened at will through the turn and pulled away easily in the lane as much best.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK stalked the pace to the final turn, made a bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, failed to threaten the winner but kept on
willingly to hold the place. POLYESTER BRIDE slow early to be at the rear of the field, commenced a rally midway on the far turn and kept grinding down
the lane. ANIPPE prompted the pace for the first half and weakened. BACKSPLASH contended in good position down the backside and faded when lacking
a response when called upon. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL was never a factor.

Footnotes
QUANTUM THEORY reserved off the early pace racing three wide in the second flight, made a steady advance ranging up four wide in the turn, continued
under a steady drive on the outside to pull clear in deep stretch. UNCAPTURED LYON tracked the pace down the backside, rallied midway on the bend in a
drive and fought on through the lane to be up for second. CONSIDER ME prompted the early pace to the turn, assumed command on the bend, held the
lead to midway down the lane and weakened inside the final eighth drifting out late. ON HIS TOES broke a step slow to give the field several lengths,
continued to trail to the quarter pole and showed good late energy gaining through the stretch. SILVER MATT settled off the pace down the backstretch,
rallied to contend in upper stretch and flattened out late. SEEING RED never seriously menaced. ARMOR PIERCING well placed early, dropped back on
the bend and was never a threat. SECOND TO NO ONE stalked the pace to the turn, ranged up to be prominent at the quarter pole and gave way in the
lane. ESTILO CLASICO showed brief speed from the fence and stopped turning for home.

Footnotes
WHISKEY ROAN prompted the early pace through the first turn, settled off the pace down the backside, rallied into the far turn, idled through the turn losing
position, angled six wide to the clear in upper stretch and kept coming down the lane to prevail late in a well managed ride. KING SOCIAL reserved off the
early pace, rallied in the turn in a long drive to take command midway down the lane and was caught in the final fifty yards. MASTER set the pace while
racing wide in the six path down the backside on a clear lead, battled to midway down the lane and weakened late in the drive. RUBINSTEIN well placed
tracking the leaders through the final bend from the fence and failed to close in the stretch. LUCKY SMILE taken in hand to be at the rear of the field into the
backstretch, chased from wide throughout and lacked a sufficient closing kick. FISHING FOR FUN raced prominently to the far turn, threatened on the bend
and faded coming home. DUEL FUEL failed to menace.

Footnotes
BAD BOY BOOGIE sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage entering the turn, was kept to task in the lane while unthreatened.
CONSTITUTION COAL stalked the winner throughout, kept on willingly through the lane unable to challenge for the top prize while being second best in a
good try. BIG TIME FLIRT chased the leaders, failed to gain on that pair but finished willingly as best of the rest. WHISKEY HELPS slow early to trail and
made a steady advance down the lane to hit the board. GOOD MUSIC went evenly failing to mount a closing bid. NOSEY POWER raced mid-pack and
failed to menace. CHILTEPIN prominently placed in the early going and steadily gave ground. BUCKEYE CHARLIE passed tiring rivals in the stretch.
CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS contended for the first half mile and gave way. YOU'RE OUT was never a factor.

Footnotes
DAWN slow early to be the distant trailer in a strung out field, rallied into the far turn circling five wide and closed well through the lane to be up in time.
HONORABLE WOMAN set a pressured pace down the backside, shook clear of the presser into the far turn opening a clear advantage into upper stretch
and was caught late in a good effort. SICILIAN STYLE TWO dueled with the pacesetter for five-eighths of a mile, could not go with that one and kept on
evenly to hold the show. HIGH FASHION LADY tracked the leaders down the backside, made a mild rally in the turn but failed to gain ground. LADY
GIULIANA chased the pacesetters to the far turn and faded. LITTLE EMPIRE was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOSSY LADY reserved off the pace saving ground for the first half mile, rallied four wide in the far turn through traffic, was taken in hand turning for home to
dive to the rail behind the leaders, closed well up the fence in a determined drive to be up late in a well handled ride. AUNT BEE tracked the pace down the
backside, split rivals in the turn to engage the leaders turning for home, took command in upper stretch and was run down late in the lane while clearly
second best. NEAR PERFECT raced five wide down the backstretch while steadily gaining on the pacesetters, loomed up from five wide at the quarter pole
to threaten in upper stretch and kept on through the lane to hold the show. KETTLE KISS worked her way to the inside to save ground down the backside,
worked through traffic at the head of the lane and closed well belatedly. LUCKY PENNY ROSE slow early to be the distant trailer, picked up ground down
the backside to be with the field, angled well wide circling the field coming home and closed willingly. EXPRESS FASHION saved ground along the fence
while well placed in striking distance to the quarter pole and failed to gain ground in the lane. DIVA POWER pressed the pace to the three-eighths pole,
assumed command on the turn and weakened coming home. SARAH JANE set the pace to the far turn under pressure and gave way at the head of the
lane. LOFTY COWTOWN stalked the pace to the far turn, challenged from three wide at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. STAR RULES failed to
menace. GOODNESS SAKES prominently placed in the early going, dropped out of contention down the backside and passed tiring rivals down the lane.
CHILLVILLE was never a threat. DRIVEN FOR SUCCESS was outrun.

respond when called upon. GRAY TORMENTOR unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and never posed a threat. NOAH MY BABY contended early
