WHO'S THAT BABY was allowed to settle having one beat down the backstretch, took closer order between rivals three eighths from the line, rallied three
wide at the quarter pole, loomed the threat in upper stretch, pounced to the lead inside the furlong marker and comfortably came home for the win. I'M
TENACIOUS bumped the outside foe at the start, was unhurried trailing down the backside, continued to see the field on the turn, began to lengthen stride
catching up to the pack at the quarter pole, swung out in the five path with momentum at the top of the lane and closed belatedly on the wrong lead to the
wire getting up for second late. DIXIERIBSY chased with runners on either side in the two path around the turn, battled for the lead two wide a quarter from
the prize, briefly poked his head in front on the fence turning for home, could not keep up to the winner with a furlong to go and faded in deep stretch losing
the place share. I'M AWESOME prompted the pace three wide outside on the turn, bid for the lead three wide at the quarter pole, was no match for the top
pair running between foes in upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker. CASBY nestled behind the pacesetter in the beginning, was hard ridden trying to
keep pace on the rail with others making a move around the bend and levelled off in upper stretch. FEATHERWEIGHT bumped with inside foe at the break,
stalked outside near the rear down the backstretch, made a brief run three wide three furlongs from home through to the three sixteenths marker biding up
front in the four path, could nor find more in the lane and wilted with a sixteenth left to run. GOLDEN SPRING tracked between in the second flight in the
early going, was roused three furlongs from the wire, offered little response and backed away through the field in midturn. GOINGTOARUBA broke
outwards on the start, took command down the backside, continued up front on the rail through the turn, was engulfed by runners outside with a quarter to
go, faltered on the fence in upper stretch and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
ONANDONANDON broke out at the start, travelled in mid-pack down the backside, took closer order to track four wide into the turn, angled inwards off a
rival getting out at the quarter pole to be in the mix in upper stretch, strongly closed between foes at the furlong pole and was edging away for the win
crossing the line. TAMANA had a good position tracking the contesting duo on the turn, loomed four wide appearing to get out some turning for home and
ran on gamely to the wire but was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch. FEDALINE pressed the issue outside at the half, shadowed the frontrunner
around the turn, pounced to the front two furlongs from home, was clinging onto the lead at the eighth pole and faded against the top two while not switching
leads to the wire and finished a clear third in the end. TENPENNY NAIL settled in midfield in the three path between horses down the backside, was mildly
checked at the nine sixteenths marker being shuffled back a touch, began to pick up runners three wide at the quarter pole and finished up willingly down
the lane to close in for a minor share in the end. SWEET NOLA trailed the field running inside down the backstretch, made a mild run on the rail midway on
the turn, angled in the two path between foes straightening out for the drive and could not get involved in the stretch run. TAYLORMOON stumbled on the
break, recovered to dictate the pace at the half, maintained a slim advantage while pressed outside through the turn, was collared outside with a quarter left
to run, battled inside until the furlong marker and yielded on the fence in the final seventy yards. MANITOULIN ISLAND stalked on the outside near the rear
down the back straight, had no run around the bend losing ground to others, could see the field at the top of the stretch and did not find more in the drive to
the finish line to be a factor. PICK A PENNY tracked on the rail down the backside, was nudged on the fence three furlongs from the wire, could not match
strides with rivals on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CEREBRO was smartly throttled back off the contesting duo up front at the half, rallied between horses keeping position going with the outside runner
making a move around the turn, posed the main threat with horses on each side turning for home and wore down the early pacesetter through the lane for
the victory. SMART COVERAGE took command from the onset, put away the early speed foe pressuring the pace in midturn, battled up front, still holding
onto the lead in upper stretch, could not ward off the winner late but comfortably bested the rest at the finish. ANARCHY was void of speed trailing in the
early going, made a bold move circling around foes four wide three eighths from the prize. loomed in the three path outside rivals at the top of the lane but
stalled at the furlong pole to settle for a clear third in the end. ROLLING HILLS was checked when on heels behind a fellow runner on the fence at the seven
sixteenths marker, could not regroup through the turn seeing the field and showed some late interest to pass a tired one down the stretch. BLUES POWER
pressed the issue inside down the backstretch, could not go on with quickening rivals three furlongs from the wire, was shuffled back and retreated on the
fence in mid -stretch.

Footnotes
FOREST STAR broke on top but settled off the pace between runners heading into the turn four to five wide, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, surged
late. WALTER ME LAD stalked the early leaders, dropped back between runners leaving the backstretch, encouraged along three to four wide on the turn,
moved between runners while tipping out six wide coming to the top of the stretch, kicked on belatedly. SOUPER SUNSHINE was reluctant to load,
prominent in the early going then pursued the leader two to three wide into the turn, moved out four wide leaving that bend, kept on late. JIMMIES BIG DAY
shifted in and moved up inside in behind the leaders on the turn two to three deep, found room between runners to bid in late stretch but was outkicked.
PUDDINGONTHERITZ moved forward inside to take the lead and set the pace, moved clear into upper stretch, gave way late. SILENT FORTUNE was in
pursuit from outside five to six wide on the turn, ran on evenly. STAR SCHOLAR broke a step slowly, lacked early speed and was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
WITCH HAZEL exchanged a light bump at the start, settled at the rear off the rail, began to advance outside on the far turn, shifted six wide into the stretch,
powered to the lead and drew away. TOERIS exchanged a light bump at the start, settled inside, came off the fence, advanced in behind the leaders and
inside the eventual winner on the far turn, bided time behind foes before angling out six wide in upper stretch, chased the winner home but was only second
best. MO TOWN MAYHEM stalked from outside three to four wide, edged closer on the far turn drawing even while ridden coming to the quarter pole, took a
narrow brief lead, drifted in through the stretch, was no match for the top pair but preserved show honors. ROSEBUD'S HOPE moved forward inside and to
the lead into the first turn, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was challenged on the far turn, had no extra. PEMBERLEY was in tight between runners
two to three wide entering the first turn, dropped back, shifted in and saved ground along the rail through the far turn bringing up the rear, was unable to
threaten. CURLIN CANDY was a bit rank fighting restraint early racing in range of the leader two to three wide on the first turn and up the backstretch, bid
coming to the five-sixteenths drawing even, contended between runners to the top of the stretch then faded.

Footnotes
HATMAKER GIZMO stalked in the third flight on the rail down the backside, was patiently handled waiting behind runners at the half, improved smartly
inside midway on the far turn, shifted outside off the tiring leaders at the quarter pole, looked for running room in the three path in upper stretch, found a
seam bursting through in the two path with a furlong to go and was edging away for the win at the finish. BUCK'S FIZZ had a good spot tracking the
engaging pair on the first turn under a tight rein, took closer order to prompt three wide outside three furlongs from the wire, seized control at the furlong
marker and stubbornly battled to the end just missing out for the win while saving second crossing the line. MUCHO MAGNIFICO stalked with runners on
each side in the third flight down the backside, was roused between horses three furlongs out matching strides with the eventual winner through the last
bend, turning for home was in the hunt four wide but needed more late to threaten the top two in deep stretch. AWESOME ENTRY hopped at the start,
trailed in the early stages of the race, came under a ride closing the gap to the field midway on the far turn, angled out widest in the six path swinging for
home and found his best stride late, closing in to be a fringe player in the end. THEFRONTIERSMAN bumped outside rival on the break, settled on the
fence early on having one beat, stalked near the rear five deep outside foes when the field bunched up at the half, kept pace four wide running around the
final bend and showed some late energy in the four path running to the wire. THOR'S CAUSE bumped inside foe on the break, travelled in mid-pack on the
rail in the first turn, was tucked in behind the top pair at the half, could not go on with others and was shuffled back at the three eighths pole and finished up
evenly through the stretch passing some. FABELMAN stalked in the third flight three deep down the backside, was hard ridden three wide with three
furlongs left to run, made little headway on the final turn, swung out to the five path for the drive but was no menace running down the lane. CAMAROSA
under a snug hold, took this field into the first turn, continued setting the pace while hounded outside down the back straight, maintained a narrow
advantage on the rail through the far turn, battled determinedly until the furlong marker, could not find another gear late and weakened at the sixteenth pole.
NIGHT STRIKER pressed the issue on the outside in the early stages, bobbed heads up front in the two path between runners at the three furlong marker,
was first of the contesting trio to give way at the quarter pole and faltered on the fence with an eighth to run.

Footnotes
ROYAL HUDSON tracked the contesting duo inside down the backstretch in the second flight, crept closer to the embattled leaders at the three furlong
marker, had his sights locked on the leader just outside in the two path straightening out for home, took command at the eighth pole and was resilient
between foes late to prevail by a photo at the finish line. DUBAWI BULL was off slowly on the start, co-trailed on the inside down the back straight,
progressed sharply on the fence at the half, shifted outside reaching for more ground three furlongs from home, closed in strongly on the leaders at the
quarter pole, loomed the threat in the three path turning for home, was poised to go by, rider unfortunately dropped his inside left line dueling for the lead in
deep stretch and could not get by at the wire. WHITING FIELD pressed the issue just outside in the early stages of the race, began to edge away for a clear
lead midway on the far turn, could not sustain the run in upper stretch, faded on the inside at the eighth pole and held for a clear third in the end. OH
PEANUTS travelled all alone in mid-pack in the third flight down the backside, was coaxed for more going after the leaders three furlongs out, offered little
run on the far turn but finished with a little late interest to close in for a minor role right at the wire. COMPUTER HACKER had a narrow advantage inside on
the first turn, dictated the pace while hounded outside down the backstretch, could not find more trying to maintain the lead in midturn, gave no response
when urged and stopped on the fence in upper stretch. CANDID CANDACE stalked near the rear having a few beat entering the backstretch, was shuffled
when stuck behind a rival to trail at the half mile pole, was taken up sharply at the seven sixteenths marker and cantered home crossing the finish. ADESSO
was in a good position on the the outside watching the front pair duel down the backside, took an awkward step at the seven sixteenths marker, fell,
dislodging the rider and was vanned off. CLARENCE B settled near the rear four wide on the first turn, began to improve outside runners in the three path
down the backside, was steadied with runners on each side trying to avoid the fallen runner nearing the seven sixteenths pole, lost the rider and walked off.
TRUE SHOT co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, started to move in closer three wide outside rivals at the half, lost its rider trying to avoid a
fallen rival nearing the seven sixteenths marker and walked off.

Footnotes
HURRICANE GIZMO improved smartly on the fence running down the backside to sit behind the front pair at the half, waited to pounce inside running
throughout the turn, angled just outside for the drive to the wire, was full of run between rivals with a furlong to go and gamely held on by a diminishing
margin for the well timed stretch rally. GUNNAWIN travelled in mid-pack between foes at the half, began to rally when ridden for more at the three eighths
marker, was in range of the leaders five wide at the top of the lane and was gaining steadily with each stride through the stretch but could just not get there
in time for the win. LADY EVA emerged with the lead while hounded outside along the backstretch, continued up front with a slim advantage on the fence in
upper stretch, was asking for the wire holding onto the lead at the eighth pole and faded late while saving third money at the finish line. SNOW LAKE stalked
between runners in the four path down the backstretch, was urged four wide midpoint on the turn, began to pick up runners by the quarter pole, was floated
out seven wide for the drive to the wire and ran on mildly down the lane for a minor share in the end. MUCHO MISSTIQUE was unhurried at the back five
deep down the backside, could see the field making no progress around the bend, switched to the outside off runners for clear run at the furlong marker and
finished with intent closing well at the wire. SWEEPING PASSION travelled in midfield at the half, was asked for more three furlongs from the wire, made
little progress running around the turn and was one paced through the stretch. GAVEL GIRL was in a good spot watching the front pair travelling three wide
on the outside down the back straight, began to take up the chase closing in on the frontrunner at the quarter pole, bid in the five path turning for home,
began to shorten stride between horses with an eighth remaining and faltered in deep stretch. ALMONTE PRINCESS was on hold trailing down the
backside, improved on the fence through the turn, was checked mildly inside with five sixteenths to go, made a mild rally on the rail in upper stretch and tired
on the fence in the final sixteenth. DEFAMATION broke sharply leading this field down the chute, pressed on the outside along the backstretch, was
scrubbed on but could not go on with the leader three furlongs out and backed away through the field at the quarter pole.
