Footnotes
CHAOSMOS vied for the early advantage, dueled on the front end throughout and drove clear late. MIAS MOONBEAM unhurried in the beginning, had an
outside trip, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the lane and got up for second. INDIMAAJ raced within contention, came around both turns on the
outside and was outfinished for second. AFFIRM CHIEF raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. NATE'S REVENGE
lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. G VICTORY dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. TURN ON THE MAGIC void of early
speed and was never close. BODE'S LIGHT pressed the pace and made a steady retreat. CLEVER UNION always raced near the back and showed little.

early speed, forwardly placed throughout and was a clear third. MATZOH BALL raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide, made a mild bid
and finished evenly. HIT THE BULLSEYE broke a step slow, racing in the rear, came around the turn on the outside, showed late interest, but was no factor.

Footnotes
DIXIE FARMER stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid and was going away at the end.
GYPSYROSELEE pressed the pace, raced inside around the turn, angled out down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
WHERE'S AUNT J went to the front, drove clear, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. EL CALIENTE LADY lacked early
speed, gained ground late, but was no real factor. COURTLY DOC raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and put forth
an even effort. VALTESSE raced within striking distance and weakened. SCRAPBOOK raced near the back and was never a threat. SKY HIGH SUSAN
void of early speed, raced outside around the first turn and showed little. BOSTON PAULETTE always raced near the back and was outrun.
TOLATETOOWAIT raced in the middle of the pack, dropped back and was eased to the wire.
