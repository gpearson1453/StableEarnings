Footnotes
GUEST OF HONOR stalked two wide, bid in the three path outside of the leader in upper stretch sparking a duel in the process, got subtly herded out by
that foe inside the three sixteenths pole, shifted inwardly in response passing the furlong grounds floating her counterpart while shown a left handed crop,
wrestled an advantage nearing the final sixteenth, clung to that margin through the late stages and lasted from an outer bidder to the wire. PRINCESS
KALAMOH set the pace along the inside as an outer rival applied pressure, braced for that one's bid while shifting a bit out in upper stretch, sparred and
drifted out subtly inside the final three sixteenths pole, clung to an advantage while being herded back inwardly by her counterpart crossing the furlong
grounds, fought on while headed through the final sixteenth and saved place. CHAMPAGNE SURPRISE tracked in the three path, failed to progress on the
embattled leading pair through upper stretch, yet offered a late kick to bid outside of them approaching the wire but came up short. SPITE LITE tracked
along the inside then chased the leading trio home. DIXIE RAG laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. SACRED CONNECTION bumped
with an outer rival twice at the start and was take in hand in the aftermath, trailed in the two path early on and failed to factor. IMPECCABLE TIMING
pursued from midpack in the four path and gave way around the far turn. MISS CLAUDETTE leaned in and bumped with an inner rival twice at the start, laid
off of the pace in the three path but was done early.

Footnotes
LIPS SAY BLISS broke slowly, laid off of the pace three wide, launched an advance around the turn, took aim in the four path along with an outer rival
entering the lane, drove past the leaders at the three sixteenths pole and kicked clear. AUTO DIAL broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, trailed
into the turn, picked up stride fanning to four five wide turning for home, then rallied in pursuit of the clearing leader in upper stretch, gained place
approaching the furlong grounds and was second best. SPANISH DOUBLOON took contact from an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace
setter, bid with three furlongs to go, led turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer pair in upper stretch and yielded. BATTLE BORN tracked along the
inside, chased around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up. AUGUSTUS BLUE lacked speed along the inside, retreated to trail at the three
furlong pole, swung out to the five path soon after and surpassed tired rivals. HIJACK THE PARTY cleared off early on, but met an outer challenge around
the turn, was headed at the five sixteenths pole and stopped through the final furlong. PALMISANO steadied when an outer rival shifted across his path
leaving the chute, tracked three wide, chased two wide into the turn but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
SHIP IT tracked in the three path, crept closer between horses into the turn, took aim outside of the leading trio turning for home, produced a grinding
charge to slowly close in on the clear leader in the final furlong, drove past that one inside the final sixteenth and cleared. SONADOR raced forwardly in the
two path, stalked along the inside into the turn, then sustained a rail chase through the lane to edge past the tiring early-leader for place nearing the wire.
MUSICMANSANDY set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, drew clear of them shifting off the inside entering the lane, maintained a clear margin
through midstretch, but was bested by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth and faltered between rivals to just save show. BUCKEYE ROSE took contact
from an outer rival just after the start, vied three to two wide and between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader entering the
lane, chased between rivals through midstretch, kept on late and just missed re-reaching show. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE broke slowly, laid off of the pace
in the three to two path, swung six wide in hopes of offering a rally entering the lane, but flattened out without reaching contention. JUST LIKE MAGIC raced
towards the rear, trailed in the three path around the turn, then improved inside of rivals. DOMITIA LUCILLA broke a step slow, lacked speed along the
inside and failed to factor. ARDEN'S ASSAULT broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, vied four to three wide into the turn, but weakened four wide
and between horses entering the lane. NIGHT KISS broke outwardly, stalked five wide, chased four wide into the turn, then weakened getting floated six
wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
JANUARY JUBILEE broke a step slow, then bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, gradually advanced to an inside tracking position down the
backstretch, smoothly tipped outside of the leader entering the lane, bid in upper stretch and drew clear. BABE IN THE WOODS brushed with an inner rival
leaving the gates, tracked the main group from the two path, split foes at the furlong grounds to gain place and held from outer bidders late. CHIQUITA
REINA lacked sped two wide and between horses, fanned out to the five path, then six path, entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid for show in the
final sixteenth, then gained that position at the wire while running out of ground to reach place. WRECK IT RUBY leaned out at the start, raced off of the
pace two wide and between horses, chased while tipping out to the five path in midstretch, ran on to gain show in the final sixteenth but was caught by an
outer rival at the wire. UNMATCHED came out at the start, raced forwardly two wide, attempted to apply pressure while under urging around the turn, but
failed to keep pace entering the lane in the four path and gradually yielded between horses in the final furlong. MOTEL MISCHIEF bumped with an outer
rival at the start before taking simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides soon after, pursued along the inside, then ran on mildly while hanging on his
left lead. LOVEYA LOVEYA MORE brushed with an outer rival before bumping with an inner foe at the start, dictated terms well in hand around the turn, but
was swiftly headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and faltered. ANGEL ON FIRE trailed, swung out in midstretch and surpassed tired rivals late. PRIX
stalked three wide, but floated four wide nearing the lane and weakened between horses. RUN RUN RABBIT broke a step slow and shied from an inner
rival at the start, lacked speed three wide and was outrun. WIND CHASIN broke outwardly, raced off of the pace three to six wide and tired. ANGELIC
VISION transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, then bumped with her inner counterpart again soon after, got rank between and
behind foes after a furlong, then was outrun along the inside.

HOLLYWOOD ENDING pressed two wide, vied around the turn and drove clear in midstretch. SPIELMAN advanced along the inside down the backstretch
to track from the pocket around the turn, took aim in the three path and between horses entering the lane, edged place while chasing the clearing leader in
midstretch and held that position. COLLIER'S TIME laid off of the pace in the five path, tracked in hand outside of foes around the turn, floated six wide
entering the lane, then stayed on willingly outside of rivals while hanging on his left lead in the late stages and reached show at the wire. PEEK stalked two
to three wide into the turn, but drifted to the four path entering the lane, yielded place to an inner rival at the furlong grounds, yet kept on along with an outer
rival late but was nailed for show. PINELAND set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the turn, got headed in upper stretch and gave
way. SURFACE TO AIR laid off of the pace in the six to eight path around the turn and failed to factor. TEXAS PRIDE trailed along the inside and never got
involved. MOUNT CRAIG raced off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the lane and faded. REMARKABLE MO chased in the four
path and between horses but weakened entering the lane in the five path.

PULA was tough to load, moved forward between foes to track three wide into the turn, bid turning for home, vied while fended off through midstretch, but
forged an advantage nearing the final sixteenth and held as an outer pair closed in late. LEMON MUFFIN laid off of the pace in the five path, advanced into
the turn, inched closer turning for home, chased through upper stretch, yet sustained a late rally along with an outer rival but needed more to reel in the
leader late. SWEET GAL OF MINE set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge nearing the lane, dueled and clung to an advantage
through upper stretch, but was headed at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. TANYA SHOWERS pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted five wide
entering the lane, chased while lacking progress through midstretch, but flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole, offered a late kick outside of
rivals, but missed reaching show. ANGEL OF FAITH broke a step slow, stalked along the inside and chased along the rail. FIGGY stalked two wide and
between horses but gave way in upper stretch. AUNT FANNIE dropped back early on, lacked speed in the four path, fanned to the seven path in upper
stretch and moved up. CANAIMA raced forwardly in the four path but faded entering the turn. PALACE DRIVE broke outwardly and failed to menace from
the two path. ROUTE SIXTY SIX broke half a beat slow and failed to factor from the three path. TAPWRIT WARRIOR broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
THE ALYS LOOK tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, took aim three wide in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge outside of the
embattled leading pair to bid entering the final sixteenth and forged an advantage late. CORNINGSTONE prompted the leader from the three path, vied
down the backstretch, sparred in the two path and between horses around the far turn, sustained the battle with her inner counterpart through upper stretch,
dueled between horses into the final sixteenth and got outfinished. PUNCHBOWL set the pace inside of a vying foe, sparred with that one down the
backstretch, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch but was bested in the final sixteenth.
MAGICAL LUTE broke a step slow, trailed in the two to three path, gained between horses in upper stretch and ran on late to miss reaching show. CHOP
CHOP laid off of the pace in the three path, inched closer in the four path and between horses around the far turn, tipped six wide entering the lane, but only
managed to chase while one paced. CHIQUITA MOSCA saved ground off of the pace and chased along the rail. TWO ITEM SAVER raced off of the pace in
the four path and between horses, floated to the five path around the far turn and weakened. SECRET STATEMENT stalked in the four path, pressed the
top pair around the far turn, but drifted to the five path entering the lane and weakened between horses. ALEXA LOU snagged the gate upon leaving it, laid
off of the pace while hung five wide, floated to the six path around the far turn and faded.

HEAVENLY SUNDAY stalked outside of the leader, bid into the far turn, led in hand at the three furlong pole, pulled clear entering the lane and drew off.
BEACH WALKN pursued from midpack along the inside, chased under urging while inching closer around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the
lane and ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole. MAKE THE BOYS WINK settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path in midstretch
and rallied to gain show nearing the wire. CALLIE'S GRIT set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's challenge into the far turn, got headed at
the three furlong pole, yielded to that one entering the lane and weakened between horses in the final sixteenth. NEECIE MARIE lacked speed along the
inside, took the far turn in the three path and closed the gap in the final furlong. SAFEEN tracked in the two to three path around the first turn, pressed the
top pair under urging around the far turn, but floated to the five path entering the lane and weakened. SABALENKA lacked speed two to four wide and tired.

TRADEMARK tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, pursued from the pocket with run around the far turn, took aim on the leaders from the four
path and among rivals entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. FIRST MISSION vied
along the inside, led in upper stretch, shifted out to meet TRADEMARK's challenge at the furlong grounds, gamely battled with that one through the late
stages but missed via a tight photo. IL MIRACOLO laid off of the pace in the two path, took closer order before pursuing in the three path into the far turn,
shifted to the four path and between rivals turning for home before floating to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on while shifting inwardly and
gained show from an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. BLUE DEVIL lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the backstretch, pursued in
the four path around the far turn, shifted ground outside of rivals passing the three sixteenths pole and ran on willingly. GASOLINE laid off of the pace in the
three to four path around the first turn, pursued in the two to three path around the far turn, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
FILM STAR vied two wide but yielded between horses in upper stretch. STRAIGHT ARROW pursued from midpack in the two to three path around the far
turn chased in the four path into the far turn, got floated five wide turning for home then fanned to the seven path entering the lane and tired. GIANT GAME
stalked outside of the leading pair, but faded in the five path and between horses entering the lane. STAGE RAIDER broke erratically and bucked leaving
the gates many lengths behind the rest, lagged behind around both turns then narrowed the gap through the lane.

Footnotes
ANIMAL FRIES stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch, led from an outer bidder into the final furlong and held sway. EYES OF
GOLD advanced among foes leaving the chute to track two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, bid outside of the new
leader in midstretch but was fended off through the final furlong. LIPOCHROME set the pace along the inside but yielded between bidders in upper stretch.
LADAN pressed two wide, but gave way between horses in upper stretch. STAGFLATION pursued from midpack tow wide and between horses, shifted four
wide at the three furlong pole, floated to the six path entering the lane and lacked a bid. STAGE BELL laid off of the pace under a snug hold along the inside
and improved in upper stretcch. BLUE TOPAZ laid off of the pace while hung five wide, fanned seven wide into the lane and faded. SOUL HEIR was outrun
in the three path. IMPERATOR FURIOSA stumbled at the start, tracked three wide, then weakened in the five path and between horses entering the lane.
