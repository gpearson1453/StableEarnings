AND FIFTY set his own uncontested early pace along the inside, raced well clear through the far turn and widened in the stretch run under a steady hand
ride. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT was bumped soundly at the start, settled off the early pace near the inside, swung five wide into the upper stretch but was no
match for the winner. STEAL IT BACK tracked the early leader from the inside, hard ridden through the far turn and weakened a bit through the drive.
NORTHERNREFLECTION void of early speed, advanced five wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the drive and closed in mildly. FORT
BONZ was off slowly, raced mid pack early, three deep near the five sixteenths pole and was even late with no closing run. FREEDOMFI was bumped
soundly at the break, raced off the early going, saved ground through the far turn into the upper stretch and never threatened. MEDITATE stalked the pace
top pair three deep and faded. SENATOR CON raced mid pack in the early stages, saved ground and never was a factor.

LAKE MARIE chased the pace from the inside, settled off the duel nearing the three eighths pole, angled out through the upper stretch and drew off to be
well clear under steady handling. CANADA'S CUSTOMS stalked the pace, race near the inside around the far turn, eased out near the three sixteenths pole
and finished gamely to the wire. COUNTRY LADY moved up quickly from the outside of rival nearing the three eighths pole to duel into the upper lane and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. SIENNA BREEZE broke awkwardly, raced off the pace, was six wide into the upper lane and was even late with no
closing bid. GALAXY THIRTYSIX void of early speed, raced from the far outside in the lane and lacked a bid. DROP DEAD SEXY dueled near the inside
past the three eighths pole and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
ST. ARMANDS KEY showed good early foot to set the early pace and held well to be clear late under a steady hand ride. LE GRIS lunged at the break,
raced off the early pace after the poor start, moved up six wide near the five sixteenths pole and closed gamely while racing from the outside. OCEAN
VICTORY raced off the early going, advanced towards the leaders through the far turn, raced from the inside into the upper lane and finished gamely to the
wire while racing near the rail. ZVEREV rated along early, ridden two deep nearing the three eighths pole, raced five wide between in the drive and finished
willingly to the wire. SIR EXTON stalked the pace along the inside and kept on to the wire racing three to four deep. DOUBLE NEAT was unhurried early,
angled widest through the stretch and moved up to improve position. LUCKY ROMANCE stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and had not enough. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC angled in early, rated along down the backstretch, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and
weakened. INTERLUDE void of early speed, raced five wide between in the stretch run and had no late rally. MILL STREET was bumped at the start, was
with the second flight early, raced from the far outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. EL ALACRAN tracked the early leader two deep and gave way. HIGH
ENOUGH settled off the early pace along the inside and had no response. MAX IS G MONEY rated along the inside and faded. LUKE was bumped at the
start and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SWEET DARLIN unhurried early on, advanced through the far turn, circled the field seven deep and drew off late to be well clear under a steady hand ride.
BROADWAY STAR dropped back early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and rallied for the place position. HIGHLANDER'S EDGE pressed the
early leader from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. JUS PRESS STAR was off slowly, made a rail bid in the stretch and closed in mildly.
ADIAMONDINTHESTORM dropped back to race mid pack early, was four to three wide in the lane and lacked a rally. EVERYLITTLESINGH was allowed to
settle early, raced from the inside around the far turn and had no response. MADAM BLUE sprinted clear early and was empty in the drive. CUSTOM
COMEDY stalked the top pair two deep and stopped.

NEAT rated along under a hold three deep from the outside of foes, challenged for the lead near the seven sixteenths pole and drew off to be clear under a
steady hand ride. CARD TRICK broke in sharply at the start, sent along to set the early pace, challenged through the far turn and was no match for Neat in
the drive. BECAUSE THE NIGHT dropped back off the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. BENVOLIO was bumped,
squeezed start, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and was even with no rally. ELEVATED GAME stalked the pace along the inside and faded.
BOURBON LIFE dropped back early, raced from the inside into the upper stretch, angled out through the stretch run and never threatened.
MASTEROFHISCRAFT tracked two wide and gave way. DUMBSTRUCK was squeezed at the break, raced near the back after the poor start, raced wide
into the upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
BRUNCH PUNCH quick to begin to set the early pace along the inside and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. BEELIEVE HER dropped
back early, swung five wide into the lane and finished well to rally for the place position. CANDY LOVER raced mid pack early, was along the inside around
the far turn, angled out to race off the inside through the upper lane and flattened out. BERLAINE raced two deep early, was in tight, shuffled near the three
eighths pole, had an inside run and not enough in the drive. AZTEC EMPRESS prompt the early pace two deep from the outside of rival and gave way.
CHICA ARMA dropped back early, moved up four to five wide around the far turn, raced from the far outside in the lane and never threatened. FLATHEAD
FINALE was off slowly and lacked a bid. A LIL PSYCHOTIC was jostled at the break, raced off the early going, drifted through the stretch and never
threatened. GREYHOUND STATION was allowed to settle early and failed to respond. HUB CITY stalked the pace and was done early.
