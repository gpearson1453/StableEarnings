Footnotes
SARGENT HULKA chased the early pace into the backstretch, moved to vie for the lead into the turn, was joined by the runner-up in mid-turn, dueled with
that one into the lane, lost the lead near the eighth pole then battled back to inch up late. NINE POINTER settled off the early pace while off the inside, bid
from the three path approaching mid-turn, dueled with the top one from there to deep stretch, could not stay late and settled for second best. BIGLEY HUGE
chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn, lost touch with the top two into the lane then won the duel for the show spot. YOSHIDA'S
IMPACT raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane, dueled with the show rival through the lane and could not prevail. STAR REVIEW raced in
mid-pack into the turn while off the rail, was three wide and between rivals in late turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and never was a threat.
CHARMING VICTORY never a factor while racing in the four to five path through the turns. THREE TWO RUN raced in the three or four path through the
turn when near the back, came into the lane from the six path and never menaced. CROSSROADSCORREDOR vied for the lead along the inside into the
far turn and was suddenly done. HAYWES chased the pace from the three path into the turn and was empty in late turn. DE LA VICTORY raced along the
inside throughout and steadily lost ground. ADAMANTLY CROSS rushed out of the gate down the front stretch, continued a straight route to the outside rail
into the turn and was pulled up entering the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
FIERCE JUSTICE pressed the pace two wide into the turn, was between rivals through late turn and into the lane, was in a bit tight straightening in the lane,
continued between rivals through the final eighth and inched up in a game effort. CONQUERED vied three wide through the far turn, came into the lane still
three wide, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while saving the place spot. KINGOFTHERAINBOW vied for the lead
along the inside of two others through the turn and into the lane, was still a serious threat with a furlong to run and could not keep up late. BOLD BIZNESS
saved ground through the turn, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the four path inside the eighth pole and was gaining. UNBRIDLED VICTOR
was in the three path through the turn and into the lane and offered belated energy to be gaining too late. MACHO ALEGRE raced in the two path through
the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path and weakened in the drive. WISHY WASHY never a factor while along the inside through
the turn. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE raced in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was a menace. ROYAL
ICING was close up early, continued in the four path through the turn and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
GOSPEL MUSIC set the pace under pressure into the turn, cleared in mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path, was engaged outside the furlong
pole then repelled the runner-up and widened late. PEWTER'S PROMISE bid three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, moved to
loom a serious threat with a furlong to go then could not keep up late while finishing clear for the place spot. FLAT OUT DIAMONDS was angled to the rail
soon after the start, hustled up to contend through the turn and into the lane then lacked the needed response through the final eighth. CHANNAH DEL
MAR raced in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and never was a serious threat. OUTLAW WOMAN
was bothered at the start and settled in the rear, raced well back into the turn while in the three or four path, came into the lane from the six path and
showed interest while moving up. WHO NOT WHAT never a factor while along the inside. KAM'S ROCKIN GOLD pressed the winner two wide into the turn,
continued a threat into late turn then was done entering the lane. MORNING REFLECTION raced in the three or four path through the turn when never far
back then was empty into the lane. BANDIT QUEEN raced in the four path throughout and was done entering the turn.
