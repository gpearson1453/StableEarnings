Footnotes
TWIXTER had a narrow lead under a snug hold going down the backside, began to edge away from the early rival who pressed the issue outside early on at
the quarter pole, opened up turning for home and comfortably extended the advantage running through the lane for an impressive win. NGABE had a good
position nestled on the rail watching the engaging pair down the backstretch, rallied inside at the quarter pole and gamely chased through the lane but was
just second best this day behind a runaway winner. SPANISH SERENADE was pushed out five wide on the first turn trailing outside, improved outside
runners three wide down the back straight, began to pick up rivals three wide at three furlong marker, was in range in the four path at the top of the stretch
and finished up mildly to be a clear third at the wire. MANETKA tracked the front duo with runners on either side in the first turn, was shuffled back down the
backside to be in the third flight stalking, offered a mild run between horses two wide three furlongs from the line and willingly finished up for a minor share
in the end. SUNYANI shadowed the pace outside in the early stages, was hard ridden but was no match for the winner who was opening up at the quarter
pole, could not find more in the stretch and faded at the furlong marker. HARD ROCK WARRIOR broke a step slow to begin, was bounced around when in
tight two wide between runners into the first turn, travelled on the rail in the third flight down the backside, was asked for more run through the far turn on the
fence, offered little response and could not get into contention driving to the finish line. EVA'S RECORD tracked the front pair three wide outside of rivals on
the first turn, settled nicely in the second flight on the outside down the back straight, was roused for more three eighths from the wire, could not keep up
with others around the far bend and showed little in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SUMMER SNOW took command from the start, extended the advantage throughout the turn and cruised to the wire never challenged at any point in the
race. VALLEY GIRL settled on the rail in midfield down the backside, was checked in tight quarters inside three eighths from the finish, recovered quickly
passing foes on the inside two furlongs to go and closed in the stretch to be a clear runner up at the end. WAKE UP MAGGIE stalked near the rear on the
fence, made little headway saving ground around the bend, found her best stride late rallying on the fence and surged at the finish to get up in the last jump
for the show prize. SPANISH BEAUTY settled behind the frontrunning winner down the back straight, chased but to no avail through the turn and was
getting leg weary down the stretch and tired in the final sixteenth to just miss holding onto third money at the wire. SO BREANNA travelled two wide
between horses in mid-pack, took closer order making a mild run three wide at the three eighths pole and was one paced down the lane posing no threat to
the leaders. BABY MO had a slow start on the break was uninterested trailing by many down the backside, closed in catching up to the field when swinging
outside in the five path for the rive and passed tired runners down the lane. EYE GOT IT GOOD stalked near the rear on the outside, made little impact
running around the turn and could not get involved in the drive to the finish line. PASSION TO PLEASE settled in mid-pack three wide outside foes down the
backside, offered a brief run going around foes three wide three furlongs out until the quarter pole, could not sustain the rally and yielded in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
BABBO took control clearing from the outside to set the pace on the rail unchallenged down the backside, continued cruising on the front end throughout the
turn, was finally set down in mid-stretch, found another gear and spurted away from the field for the dominant victory. BRAVO KATE travelled on the rail in
midpack down the backstretch, crept closer around the turn lengthening stride on the fence and battled inside determinedly to the finish to win the runners
up share in the end. PARTY was content to track the frontrunner outside at the half mile marker, was nudged for more chasing the winner with five
sixteenths left to run, could not match strides with the leader on the turn and dueled down the entire lane for second money but could not close the deal at
the wire. PONTIAC was unhurried to trail down the backside, angled just off the fence to rally two wide between foes midpoint around the bend, angled out
in the three path with momentum driving to the finish line and got up for a minor role in the end. LEGS LIKE FLATTER stalked near the rear having one beat
in this compact field down the backstretch, was asked for more run two wide outside foes midway on the turn, offered little rally and retreated four wide in
mid-stretch and cantered across the finish line.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE BOOTS set the fractions up front having a narrow lead down the backside, maintained a slim advantage while hounded on the inside
throughout the turn, edged clear on the fence at the top of the stretch and something left in reserve to win comfortably crossing the finish line. SWIRLING
DANCER pressed the pace on the inside down the backside, continued to force the issue relentless on the rail through the turn, gave way to the winner
upfront at the top of the stretch and stubbornly resurged in deep stretch to win the nod for place at the line. SOCIAL DRINKER was unhurried trailing the
pack at the half mile marker, rallied circling the field four wide making a sharp move around the turn, loomed in the four path straightening out for the drive
and stalled late to be outfinished for place in a photo at the wire. RIFLING travelled in midfield at the half with horses on either side, was nudged to keep
position three furlongs from the line, ridden for more keeping pace with others at the quarter pole and finished with intent to the the smaller battle down the
lane for the minors. ALBERTA BE MINE stalked near the rear on the inside down the backstretch, offered a brief run three wide in midturn to be in the mix
for a share of the prize in the four path turning for home and willingly ran to the wire just missing out on the fringes. UNIFIED FRONT stalked outside three
deep in the early going, made an early move at the half to be in a good position tracking the engaged twosome around the bend, shifted inwards to the rail
for the drive but came up empty tiring at the furlong marker. NADIABIZNIZ was hustled after the break for forward position, could not maintain her place in
midfield inside rivals at the half, was on hold on the rail behind a tiring runner nowhere to go with three eighths left to run and could no make a presence in
the drive to the finish line. SPIRIT BELLE was in a good spot all alone tracking the contesting front duo at the half, came under a drive on the rail but could
not keep pace with others on the turn and backed away through the field on the fence with five sixteenths remaining.

six deep near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. SIX FOR A NINE settled off the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn and had no response.
RUSH TO GLORY pressed the early leader from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
VEERY travelled on the outside in the middle of the pack down the back straight, was asked for more with five sixteenths from the wire, quickly pounced in
the four path driving to the wire, opened up on rivals in mid-stretch and was kept to the task late to hold safe at the finish line. VERDEJO was allowed to
settle trailing the pack down the backstretch, continued to see the field around the bend, started to reach for ground at the top of the lane, finally found a
seam in the three path at the eighth pole and was full of run late to make it close at the finish. IMA BEAST settled on the rail in midfield in the early stages,
was coaxed between foes midturn getting closer to the leaders, shifted outside five wide to be in the mix turning for home and showed good late energy to
get up and capture third money just before the wire. SOUPER FLASHY contested up front in the beginning, was then smartly reined back off the pace
scenario at the half, re-engaged three wide at the quarter pole, had a brief lead in the three path in upper stretch and weakened on the fence the final
sixteenth, settling for a small share in the end. JILL had a slim lead on the fence in the early going, was throttled down to let the front two contest on the
turn, waited patiently behind the pair on the turn inside, was steadied losing its seam in the three path in upper stretch and could not get interested
afterwards. SOUPER PECAN stalked near the back having one beat down the backside, kept pace with runners going around foes four wide around the
turn and was in range six wide for the drive to the wire but stalled at the furlong marker. INDIAN MUSIC dueled on the fence through the bend, was headed
outside at the quarter pole by many rivals and wilted on the fence in mid-stretch. CARA CARA battled for the lead outside through the turn, had no more to
give at the quarter pole, was engulfed by runners on either side and emptied out in upper stretch.

TWO GHOSTS settled off the early pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued its inside bid through the far turn, angled five wide through the
upper lane and surged up late under steady handling. PIPER'S FACTOR was a bit reluctant to load, set a pressured early pace along the inside, dug in and
kept on gamely to the wire. JAYHAWK stalked the early pace, raced near the inside throughout and finished willingly to the wire to narrowly miss the place
position. TUNECHI raced off the early pace, moved up four to five wide around the far turn, led briefly and was outkicked to the wire. MIDNIGHT MASCOT
prompt the early pace between rivals and weakened through the drive. KING ROSSO rated along early, was three deep between rivals near the five
sixteenths pole, angled out and had no late response. PIPIT was off slowly, raced five wide around the far turn, raced four deep near the five sixteenths pole
and weakened. BREAK THE SPELL raced from the outside down the backstretch, lost ground and was eased up on through the far turn, Break the Spell
galloped past the finish line and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
WITWATERSRAND tracked on the fence in the first of two turns, rated kindly tucked in on the rail down the backside, patiently waited to pounce on the
fence running around the final bend, shifted just outside in the two path turning for home, quickly burst between horses at the furlong marker when roused
and drew off crossing the finish line. TRIPOLINA settled in mid-pack through the first turn, found a good rhythm three wide on the outside of horses down
the backstretch, started to rally three wide going around foes midway on the final turn, loomed in the four path straightening out for home and could not go
on with the winner in deep stretch but bested the rest comfortably in the end. MYSTIC LAKE assumed command taking this field into the first turn, was
unopposed setting a reasonable pace down the backside, had only mild pressure up front through the far turn, was clinging onto the lead inside rivals at the
furlong marker, could not find another gear late and faded against the top two and held for a clear third at the finish line. SIMPLY IN FRONT co-trailed on
the inside in the early stages, had one foe beaten stalking down the backstretch, was hard ridden but could not make any progress on the leaders with three
furlongs to run, swung outside in the five path at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest to close in for a minor role in the end. UPHILL DANCE
tracked two wide on the outside on the first turn, sat just outside, content to watch the pacesetter down the back straight, was urged three furlongs out
forcing the pace in the two path, could not go with others quickening at the top of the lane and gave way in the final furlong. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS
co-trailed on the outside into the first turn, could see the field running down the back straight, could not keep up to rivals losing ground throughout the far
turn and had little to show in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CEFALO travelled alone in midfield after the start, improved smartly on the fence in hand at the half, was on hold waiting patiently behind the leaders on the
turn, pounced in the two path straightening out for home and outdueled two rivals through the lane for the hard fought victory. BLAZING SKY tracked
outside four deep along the back straight, rallied three wide taking closer order at the three furlong marker, loomed five wide turning for home, battled the
entire stretch for the lead and just missed at the finish in a determined effort. FLORAL took control up front down the back straight, continued setting the
pace through the turn, was collared on both sides in the four path turning for home, gamely fought through the stretch until the sixteenth pole and gave way
to the top two late and settled for a clear third at the wire. PINO IN A PURSE tracked the pace three wide between horses down the backside, was shuffled
back losing positioning at the half, tried to commence a run between foes at the quarter pole and shifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch with a chance for
a share and mildly ran to the wire for a minor role in the end. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke a step slow at the start, trailing down the backside, continued to
see the field running throughout the turn, caught up to rivals four wide at the quarter pole on the outside, swung out to the six path in range at the top of the
lane and evened out by mid-stretch. MOSLER'S IMAGE was away poorly to begin, having one slower starter beaten down the backside, offered a brief and
mild run on the fence around the bend, was urged left handed at the quarter pole inside, had no response and showed little in the drive to the wire. SPEEDY
LYNN stumbled on the break, regrouped to prompt the leader outside down the backstretch, chased the frontrunner on the turn, could not accelerate with
rivals on either side at the quarter pole and retreated in upper stretch.
