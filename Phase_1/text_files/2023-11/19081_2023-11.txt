Footnotes
BILL'S HONOR set the pace from between rivals, took the rail into the bend, was roused nearing the end of a half mile, drew off in the lane under urging and
was clearly best. TRUIST prominent from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn then battled to keep second in the stretch. ON THE MONEY RED
bumped from the rear at the break, pressed in tight quarters between rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, fanned four wide into the lane
and was closing in for second late. RUN THE TABLE pressed in tight quarters along the rail, was steadied as he brushed repeatedly with ON THE MONEY
RED from the half mile marker to the seven-sixteenths pole, was checked at that point, altered out, came five wide into the stretch and rallied belatedly.
DIAMND CON SUERTE reluctant to load, hesitated slightly then broke somewhat awkwardly, stayed off the rail then closed well from path three deep
stretch. XPRESSIR boxed in while in close quarters on the backstretch, gained a clear path into the turn, went for the lead just outside BILL'S HONOR but
could not sustain his bid in the lane. J J'S SOLUTION failed to be a factor.

LOVEYOULIKECRAZY rated between rivals, was roused two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, edged ahead inside the last furlong and
narrowly held on. LUTION was taken outside early on, angled in on the turn, all out along the rail in the lane and just missed in a game effort. TENSE
displayed early speed just off or along the rail, was challenged from outside in the stretch, floated out briefly with a furlong to go, was straightened and
slowly yielded in the late going. WICKED SKY prominent from outside on the backstretch, began to fade three wide on the bend. COWGIRL FRANKIE dwelt
at the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BETTY'S SECRET shared the lead from outside, was two wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch, challenged from outside nearing the final sixteenth,
dug in and kept TOUR DE' PORT at bay. TOUR DE' PORT forwardly placed between rivals, was boxed in on the turn, gained a clear path three wide with
two furlongs to go, rallied to engage BETTY'S SECRET approaching the sixteenth marker, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. I DID THE
MATH a step slow at the break, moved to the inside early on, angled out through the bend, rallied five wide in the lane and was gradually lugging in through
the waning yards as she pulled away for third. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY displayed early speed from inside but flattened out for the drive. THE LAST THRILL
was also a step slow at the start and soon moved to the inside, angled out on the turn, moved out widest at the top of the stretch and passed tired ones.
SKIP TO BALI raced in contention from outside, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out some leaving the turn then gave way in the lane. HOT N
FRESH chased from outside, followed SKIP TO BALI'S path through the turn and had no late bid. MADELYN ATTACK was hustled between rivals in the
early going and faded along the rail through the bend. HER SPEAKER'S ON prominent just off the inside on the backstretch, began to yield on the bend.

Footnotes
W W SCOUT'S HONOR broke on top, sprinted away while in hand, was roused along the rail leaving the bend, under some urging in the lane and proved
clearly best under a well handled ride. WALKER'S WIN raced closest to W W SCOUT'S HONOR from just outside, was no match for the leader when set
down for the drive but easily best of the others. BABA'S BOY broke inward, bumping TONYS MORNING LINE then DIAMOND MAXIMUS, chased the top
par from outside and had no stretch rally. TONYS MORNING LINE was reluctant to load, a step slow at the break, bumped from the front, chased running
widest and had little to offer for the drive. DIAMOND MAXIMUS showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
RICHIESONAROLL was sent to share the lead off the rail but inside rivals, floated out to path three entering the lane then steadily drew away under urging.
FAST CROSS TRAFFIC pressed from between rivals, went for the lead outside RICHIESONAROLL on the turn, was no match for that one in the stretch but
stayed unchallenged for the place. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS chased from off the rail, lost ground four to six wide through the bend, rallied in the lane and
got up for third. EMPTY HOLSTER broke inward, brushing BRIANS WAY, chased from outside, lost considerable ground widest through the turn and
showed a willingness to run late. AFTER MY BROTHER raced in contention from inside, vied for third along the rail on the bend, his rider did not have a
riding crop leaving the turn, angled out some for the stretch run and weakened the final furlong. BRIANS WAY bumped from the rear at the start, moved
toward the inside on the backstretch, did not keep up while boxed in on the turn, was checked nearing the quarter pole, moved to the inside at the top of the
lane, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. HIGHLY PERFECT saved ground and failed to menace. MAN ON ATTACK unruly in the gate, was
prominent from outside on the backstretch but began to yield three wide on the bend. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN displayed early speed between rivals then began
to fade two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
RUMBRANDT was kept close, angled to the outside on the bend, came five wide into the lane, lugged in beside DEVIL upper stretch, edged ahead slightly
as she jostled with the latter the rest of the way and held on. DEVIL vied for the lead between horses, came into the stretch from path three, exchanged
bumps with RUMBRANDT the last furlong and had to settle for second best. BEEHIVE contested the pace between rivals, gained the rail on the bend then
slowly wore down deep stretch. BAR MONEY well back early, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, lost ground fanning widest for the stretch run,
surged the final furlong but was too late. GREEN GRACE disputed the pace between horses, was shuffled back while two wide on the bend, moved to the
rail into the lane, was blocked nearing the sixteenth marker, altered out and finished evenly. CLOEY ATTACK vied for the lead from outside, came four wide
into the lane, began to yield, altered out when RUMBRANDT took her path upper stretch and continued to slowly fade. TOO MUCH TUESDAY displayed
early speed from inside, was steadied back from tight quarters nearing the bend, altered out and steadily gave way. The rider of DEVIL lodged an objection
alleging interference from RUMBRANDT the last eighth. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

GO MADI GO was a step slow at the break, two wide on the bend, rallied in the lane, altered inside RACETOTHEFINISH with a sixteenth left and got up in
time. RACETOTHEFINISH shared the early lead from outside, moved clear on the turn and took the rail before finishing a half mile, lengthened command
upper stretch, floated out slightly with a furlong to go then gradually wore down. AROSE FOR LYLA soon trailed from outside, lost considerable ground five
then six wide through the bend, surged the last eighth, lugged in under right-handed pressure deep stretch and was too late. LILY'S WOOFY vied for the
lead from just off the inside, angled outside RACETOTHEFINISH on the turn, floated out to path three entering the lane and only made up minor ground in
the waning yards. CANTOO pressed the early speed from between horses, retreated into the bend, angled out, was five wide into the stretch, also rallied
the final furlong, was caught in a narrow path after entering the last sixteenth and steadied the final seventy yards. COMMISSIONER GULCH in contention
from inside on the backstretch, did not stay close on the turn then also made up minor ground deep stretch. MADELYN BELLE hesitated at the start,
gradually angled out as she moved to contention on the backstretch, was three then four wide through the bend then quickly gave way.

Footnotes
JACK SPRAT was steadied repeatedly while boxed in behind the early speed on the backstretch, moved to the rail into the bend, checked briefly when his
path narrowed leaving the turn, squeezed through along the rail upper stretch then drew off inside the last eighth. COOGAN in contention early toward the
outside, lost ground five then six wide through the turn, was no match for JACK SPRAT deep stretch but caught STROPE for second seventy yards out.
STROPE vied for the lead outside JOE THE TAILOR, was three wide taking the bend, also no match for JACK SPRAT inside the final furlong and began to
wear down in the waning yards. RED MOSCATO angled outside STROPE on the backstretch, went for the lead outside that one on the turn, drifted out
slightly entering the lane, ran evenly the last eighth but was clearly best of the rest. STANCE chased from just off the rail, angled out through the bend,
came seven wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. RHODIUMS PRIDE was sent to press the early speed from inside, did not keep
up into the turn, gradually angled out, was in path four entering the lane and continued to yield. TIGGER ATTACK flipped in the gate before the start, was
taken out, okayed by the veterinarian after examination then showed little racing widest once the race began. JOE THE TAILOR displayed early speed just
off the inside but gave way for the drive. MOCOWBELL showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
BE MY BESTIE broke inward, bumping STACY ATTACK, was corrected, advanced from inside, was steadied while boxed in behind the leaders on the
bend, got through two wide upper stretch, moved clear and held sway under urging. MOON PIES IMAGE without early speed, picked up her pace from path
three on the turn, moved out six wide upper stretch for a clear path, rallied inside CAHOKIA POSSE and got the nod for second at the wire. CAHOKIA
POSSE also without early speed, commenced her bid from outside on the bend, fanned out six wide entering the lane, angled out some as MOON PIES
IMAGE came out upper stretch, rallied with that one in the late going and narrowly missed second. JULYNNE raced in contention from outside, angled in
between horses with four furlongs to go, was three to five wide taking the turn and slowly wore down through the waning yards. CANDY LOOKER in the
second flight early, went for the lead three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and began to wear down. STACY ATTACK was bumped
from the rear at the break, disputed the pace outside BIG SALLY, moved ahead two wide on the turn, floated out slightly at the top of the lane and faded the
last furlong. BIG SALLY a step slow at the start, moved up quickly from inside to vie for the lead but began to fade before finishing a half mile. SHINE
DOWN reared up at the break and was always outrun. DELTA LADY was reluctant to load, fractious in the gate, was rearing up as the gate opened and her
rider dismounted. There was a stewards' inquiry into DELTA LADY'S start. After their review, it was determined that DELTA LADY was not prepared to race
when the gate opened and she was declared a non-starter for pari-mutuel purposes only. A consolation Daily Double was paid and all wagers, except the
Pick 3 were refunded.
