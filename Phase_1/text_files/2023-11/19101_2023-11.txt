Footnotes
LE COOP took an awkward stride soon after the start eventually causing him to lag well behind the rest, picked up stride in the four path around the far turn
to catch the rest of the field entering the lane, then sustained a rally outside of rivals to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear thereafter. GILDED
CRAKEN eased back to avoid crowded quarters between a pair of foes early on, then got mildly floated out by an inner foe into the first turn, settled off of
the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, moved forward to bid three deep around the far turn, vied
before gaining an advantage in upper stretch, but offered little resistance to a well-traveling outer bidder at the furlong grounds and held place. MO MOVES
pulled clear to showed the way in the two path around the first turn, shifted in at the five furlong pole, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders turning for
home, yet kept on to maintain a minor placing. PEARSE stalked outside of the leader and from the three to two path, bid along with an outer foe around the
far turn, vied between horses turning for home but yielded nearing the furlong grounds. CASHMEUP reared in the starting gate while awaiting the off, drifted
out a touch into the first turn, before creeping closer to an inside tracking position approaching the backstretch, but chased the leading trio while a bit off of
the rail around the far turn and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
YOLANDA WHO set the pace along the inside, sparred with an outer rival around the turn, dueled while headed in upper stretch as an outer bidder joined
the fray, yet fought on gamely through the final furlong and reclaimed an advantage in the closing stages. SHIP IT tracked the leaders from the two path
around the turn, tipped outside of the top pair to take aim from the four path entering the lane, sustained a bid in upper stretch, vied into the final furlong,
forged a narrow advantage entering the final sixteenth but was outfinished by an inner counterpart. SONADOR prompted outside of the pace setter early on,
dueled with that one around the turn, vied between horses as an outer rival offered a bid in upper stretch, sparred into the final furlong but yielded with fifty
yards to go. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE hopped slightly while slow away from the gates, trailed along the inside, improved in the two path nearing the lane
and ran on willingly. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B broke outwardly at the start, stalked three wide, chased the embattled leading pair around the turn, but was
floated to the five path by an inner foe entering the lane and gave way. BEACH KITTEN bobbled slightly at the start before shifting ground outwardly along
with outer rivals early on, laid off of the pace in the four to three path approaching the turn but faded with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
KATTATH set the pace in the two path, showed the way from an outer presser around the far turn, shook free entering the lane, maintained a clear margin
through midstretch before meeting an outer challenge entering the final sixteenth, yet held firm. CODE RUNNER laid off of the pace along the inside, took
closer order before tracking behind the leader around the far turn, tipped out to take aim two wide nearing the furlong grounds, closed in to bid at the
sixteenth pole but was denied. BOITANO prompted inside of the pace setter before shifting to stalk outside of that one approaching the backstretch, pressed
into the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, gave way yet held show from challengers on either side in the final furlong. SHORTLIST raced at
the rear two wide, ran on to attempt an inside bid for show in the final furlong but was kept at bay. COUSIN LARRY tracked two to three wide, but shifted
four wide entering the lane and faded. HUGE BIGLY pursued from midpack in the three path, but retreated to the rear entering the far turn, fanned to the
five path entering upper stretch and made little impact.

Footnotes
OFFICER QUIGLEY stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, chased the clearing leader through upper stretch, kept on as that
one tired nearing the final sixteenth to offer a bid leaving that station, forged an advantage with thirty yards to go and held from an inner bidding counterpart
thereafter. GUCCI BOY took contact to his hind quarters from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path, rallied between rivals to be
behind the leader in the final furlong, tipped in at the sixteenth pole before sustaining an inside bid in the final sixteenth, but missed. LUNDBERG shouldered
an outer rival while sparring for the lead with that one early on, showed the way in the two path as his outer counterpart sustained pressure, yet shook clear
while tipping to the three path entering the lane, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but tired while drifting out entering the final sixteenth and
faltered between bidders late. SMOKE WAGON broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, recoiled into an outer foe soon after, laid off of the pace in
the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, stayed on willingly through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and
flattened out. CITY OF LOVE took light contact from an inner rival soon after the start, chased along the inside, took aim for a rail bid in upper stretch, but
lacked any kick and weakened through the final furlong. STUDY COMMITTEE tracked in the five path, but was floated to the six path entering the lane and
faded. PASSING JUDGMENT transferred firm contact from an outer rival to an inner foe while jostling between horses at the start, trailed along the inside
and made little impact. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN brushed with an inner rival while sparring for the lead early on, but came under urging to sustain prompting
position in the three path turning for home and weakened between horses entering the lane.

PRIVATE CREED prompted three wide, vied into the turn, gained an advantage while well in hand with five sixteenths to go, drew clear in the four path
entering the lane and held sway. BAL A KAZOO prompted two wide and between horses, but yielded to those foes passing the five sixteenths pole, spun to
the four path entering the lane and regained stride in upper stretch, then stayed on to edge place in the final sixteenth. SON OF A BIRCH laid off of the pace
three to two wide and between horses into the turn, then ran on well along with an outer foe in the final sixteenth and reached show at the wire. CHISELER
set the pace inside of pair of prompting pursuers, got headed by his widest counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match entering the lane, yet
kept on and maintained place into the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead, but yielded to an outer pair late. GASLIGHT DANCER tracked four to
three wide, spun to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a bid and yielded. MOUNSIEUR COCO pursued two wide and between horses, but backed
out of a bit of crowded quarters entering the turn, trailed in the two to three path around the bend and made little impact. MONEY RUN chased along the

HEART HEADED set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer pair around the turn, kicked away in the two path in upper stretch and held sway safely.
GENERAL ISSUE (FR) pursued from midpack in the two path, brushed an inner rival and split foes three wide while launching a rally in upper stretch, and
ran on well. KING ANTHONY chased in the four to five path and stayed on willingly. MIKEALICIOUS laid close up along the inside, chased while taking
minor contact from an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, shifted inwardly from a brush with that one again in upper stretch and kept on. BEAR RIVER
prompted the leader from the three path, vied between rivals around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch and tired
between horses in the final furlong. EL MATADOR was reluctant to load, then broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the six path
entering upper stretch and moved up. CHARGE THE CASTLE stalked outside of foes, prompted the top pair from the four path around the turn, but yielded
entering the lane and weakened between horses while hanging on his left lead. WICKED MELODY broke slowly and bumped an inner rival at the start,
trailed two wide into the turn and made little impact. FORMAL AFFAIR raced forwardly two wide and between horses, lightly grazed an inner rival turning for
home, but was brushed and put to tight quarters between foes at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. MIDNIGHT STORMY broke a step slow, lacked
speed and faded in hand in the five path around the turn. BROADWAY RED took a bump from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and
was done early.

Footnotes
PURE PANIC stalked the embattled dueling pair from the three path around the turn, inched closer to be within striking range in the four path entering the
lane, shifted inwardly and brushed a foe while offering a bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with an inner rival while being herded out entering the final
sixteenth, yet prevailed. W W HOTSHOT dueled for the lead along the inside, led in upper stretch before meeting an outer challenge at the furlong grounds,
flopped back to his left lead leaving that station, drifted outwardly while battling gamely entering the final sixteenth and was bested late. SOLIDIFY broke
slowly, chased from midpack along the inside, altered course multiple times in upper stretch, brushed with an outer rival while gaining show at the furlong
grounds and saved that position from an outer rival at the wire. BLUE KENTUCKY laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane and
rallied between horses to miss reaching show. LYKAN trailed in the two path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and stayed on willingly. TILTED
TOWERS tracked in the four path, floated to the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid between horses. TEE BURNS dueled for the lead two wide,
entered the lane in the three path, then weakened while taking contact from rivals on both sides at the furlong grounds. LUCKY BOSS lacked speed in the
five path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and weakened.

PARCHMENT PARTY trailed along the inside, saved ground improving position around the far turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane, tipped four
wide for clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, launched a rally soon after, brushed with an inner CATCHING FREEDOM while keeping that one hemmed
in behind the leaders leaving the furlong grounds, sustained his own bid soon after and drove clear late. FIRST WORLD WAR tracked in the two path under
snug restraint around the first turn, steadied among foes entering the backstretch, stalked outside of the top pair around the far turn, spun for home in the
four path while within striking range, bid three wide at the furlong grounds, vied as an outer foe menaced soon after and was outkicked late. LAGYNOS
stalked close up along the inside, bid inside of the leader while brushing with that one in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage coming to midstretch, vied
with outer rivals through the final furlong but was outkicked late and missed show. CATCHING FREEDOM bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of
the pace while tucking from the four to two path around the first turn, tracked in hand between horses turning for home, searched for racing room while
shifting outwardly in upper stretch, but failed to tip outside of the leading trio when called upon to do so nearing the furlong grounds, was brushed by an
outer bidder while being kept hemmed in behind the leaders by that one passing that station, steadied once stymied off rival's heels entering the final
sixteenth and kept on late. FOOTPRINT lacked speed in the three to two path, was brushed to the four path by an inner foe entering the lane, encountered
traffic troubles in upper stretch, altered course outwardly in midstretch and stayed on. KHANATE took contact from an outer rival at the start, set the pace in
the two path, vied with an outer head-strong rival down the backstretch, embraced an inner challenge while brushing with that bidder in upper stretch, vied
between horses into the final furlong, but yielded once put in tight at the sixteenth pole. WOODCOURT track in the three to four path, floated to the five path
entering the lane and gave way. MARKET STREET made little impact from the four path. BARKSDALE was bumped between horses at the start, pulled

SPARTAN QUEEN tracked three wide, bid two wide around the far turn, led entering the lane and drew off. LADY CLAYPOOLE (IRE) was a bit keen among
foes early on, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, fanned six wide entering the lane and rallied to gain place late. KING'S SECRET (GB)
stalked along the inside, then in the two to three path around the far turn, gained place from among foes nearing midstretch, fended off an outer rival for that
position through the final furlong, but was caught by a wider bidder in the closing stages. NOBLE BERNADETTE pursued from midpack three wide, chased
among foes around the far turn, vied for place with an inner rival through midstretch but was outkicked late and missed show. CALL ME TONI settled off of
the pace three wide, gained four to five wide around the far turn but flattened out. BRIC A BRAC set the pace, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn
but weakened entering the lane. QUEEN RHAENYRA broke a step slow before being put to a bit of crowded quarters early on, trailed, took the far turn in
the four path and moved up. SILENT REVENGE lacked speed along the inside then failed to respond to urging in the three path around the far turn.
LASERJET pursued along the inside but was done early. MILAN MISCHIEF stalked two wide, but steadied between horses entering the far turn and faltered
around that bend. ENGLISH TREASURE pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the far turn, chased through
