Footnotes
MENA stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, moved forward to press from the two path approaching the far turn, sustained pressure despite
coming under urging turning for home, bid entering the lane and drove clear in upper stretch. TIZZY INDY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top
pair at the three furlong pole but saw his rider lose his left rein in the process causing the necessity of a right handed crop to keep from bearing wider
approaching the five sixteenths pole, then chased evenly through the lane and edged place from a tiring rival in the final sixteenth. LET'S GO MARK set the
pace along the inside, showed the way well in hand as an outer rival applied pressure turning for home, but was headed while coming under urging entering
the lane, got bested while faltering on his left lead in upper stretch, changed leads inside the final three sixteenths, but continued to give way thereafter.
SMOOTHDINI hopped slightly and broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch but lacked a rally. I'M YOUR MAN raced off
of the pace in the two path, but pulled under a firm hold around the first turn, moved out to the four path entering the backstretch in hopes of settling,
retreated to trail shortly after, then shifted to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. AMERICUS tracked outside of the top pair and from the four
path, but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
RED RIVER MAGIC set the pace, built a clear margin while tucking to the two path into the turn, then drew off under a drive. DEFAULT broke a step slow,
advanced along the inside leaving the chute, tracked while saving ground around the turn, gained inside of rivals entering the lane to reach place in upper
stretch, then failed to threaten the leader. TAKE SHAPE broke a step slow, tracked four wide, inched closer in the five path around the turn to vie for place
turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch. CRIMALDI prompted along the inside, stalked the clearing leader into the turn, tipped
to the three path to be outside of that one at the three furlong pole, but faded between horses entering the lane. VIOLET FLAME lacked speed in the three
path and moved up between horses. BAG LADY was reluctant to load, raced off of the pace in the four path, then lacked a bid in the seven path.
WARWOMAN chased forwardly three wide, pursued under urging in the four path and between horses around the turn but faded turning for home. TIDAL
TACTICS trailed around the turn and passed tired rivals. UPSWELL saved ground off of the pace and tired. CAUSE I'M WILD tracked two wide and
between rivals but faded around the turn.

PACHANGA LOCA leaned inwardly, snagged the gate and bumped an inner rival at the start, set a clear pace down the backstretch, repelled an outer
rival's mild challenge entering the lane, delayed a lead change until leaving the furlong grounds and held sway. THERESASILVERLININ stalked the clear
leader from the two path, took aim while inching closer entering the lane, but only offered a mild bid before failing to keep pace in upper stretch, then safely
lasted for place. LOST BIKINI tracked along the inside, faded into the turn, yet kept on in the final furlong while maintaining show. SHELL SHOCK bobbled
and took contact from an outer rival at the start leaving her many lengths behind the rest, lagged behind in the three path, then cut the gap in the five path
through the lane.

QUENCIO set the pace along the inside, showed the way in hand as an outer rival attempted to apply pressure around the far turn, then drew off while
being show a right handed crop through the lane. TITLE CONTENDER broke a step slow at the start, then bumped an outer rival while tugging into the first
turn, tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to take aim outside of the clear leader around the far turn, but only offered a mild bid while drifting to the
four path entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch, drifted out while tiring in the final sixteenth yet lasted for show. TRACK LIGHT transferred contact from
an inner rival to an outer foe while being pinched between horses into the first turn, raced at the rear two wide in the aftermath, pursued from the five to six
path around the far turn, then stayed on outside of rivals to vie for minor placings and prevailed for show. MASTER OF THE NITE broke a step slow and
took contact from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, advanced while shifting out to the five path and between horses straightening for
home, then stayed on among foes to vie for minor placings but missed show at the wire. PATCH O'BRIEN took contact from an inner rival and bumped an
outer foe while steadying into the first turn, laid off of the pace in the two path, then along the inside down the backstretch, offered a rail chase in hopes of

FROM WEST had his hind quarters knocked from underneath him by an inner rival into the first turn, raced off of the pace three to two wide and yielded.

Footnotes
STORY HOUR vied along the inside of FILLY CRYSTAL, exchanged brushes while sparring through upper stretch, edged away from her outer counterpart
nearing the final sixteenth and lasted from an outer on-charging bidder late. ST. BENEDICTS PREP steadied when an inner rival shifted across her path
leaving the chute, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the turn, bumped an inner foe to avoid a faltering rival at the five sixteenths
pole, fanned out six wide into upper stretch, then offered a good kick to rally outside of rivals in the final furlong, but missed reeling in the leader at the wire.
GHOSTLY NIGHT raced forwardly along the inside, stalked the top pair from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, but only
managed to chase, bid for place along with an outer rival entering the final sixteenth but got outkicked. FILLY CRYSTAL set the pace outside of a vying rival
around the turn, exchanged brushes with that one while dueling through upper stretch, but hung on her left lead and gave way through the final sixteenth.
LUNA MOTH raced at the rear in the three path then offered a belated rally between horses. LITTLE SISTER SUE trailed early on, advanced along the rail
into the turn, but was bumped by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch and flattened out. PILLBOX tracked four wide
and gave way. SISTER KISSES took an awkward stride to shift outwardly soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the four path and faded while fanning to
the eight path entering the lane. BALL GOWN chased forwardly in the three path and between horses, but faltered out of a bit of crowded quarters at the
five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MUSICAL MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane, assumed command in hand straightening for
home, drew off under moderate hand urging through midstretch and was put to wraps with a sixteenth to go. ROSIE'S ALIBI set the pace inside of a
prompting foe while a path off the inside, dueled with that one around the far turn, but got swiftly outkicked by a wider bidder entering the lane, yielded
thereafter, encountered an outer bidder for place in the late stages but lasted. LITTLE DIXIE exchanged firm contact with an outer rival at the start, laid off of
the pace along the inside, paused while searching for racing room off the rail around the far turn, cut the corner, chased along the inside in upper stretch,
took aim on place from the outside in the final furlong, flopped leads while inching closer at the sixteenth pole in hopes of bidding for place, but hung late.
WINGS LIKE EAGLES got briefly keen between rivals at the start, tracked in the three to four path around and gave way in upper stretch. SULTRY LASS
prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, dueled around the far turn, but was quickly outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane and
weakened between horses. CANT KEEP ME DOWN was antsy awaiting the start, then bumped firmly with an inner rival when the gates sprung, trailed in
the two to three path and failed to factor. YARBOROUGH laid off of the pace along the inside but was done early.

Footnotes
REDDINGTON set the pace along the inside and drove clear in upper stretch. BUCKTOWN broke a step slow, pursued rom midpack along the inside, then
sustained a grinding charge up the rail to bid for place at the sixteenth pole and edged that position late. DAVID'S TUITION stalked along the inside, chased
the clearing leader in upper stretch, forged place from an outer rival while in the two path in the final furlong, but was bested by an inner rival leaving the
sixteenth pole. DUAL MONARCHY tracked three wide, inched closer to be within striking range turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the clearing
leader in upper stretch, chased through midstretch, but lost place to an inner rival in the final furlong and yielded through the final sixteenth. JEWELSTOWN
broke awkwardly and steadied at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to four path, shifted out to the five to seven path in upper stretch and stayed on
late. PLATINUM GHOST stalked two wide, but failed to sustain pressure while under pressure between horses around the turn, yielded entering the lane,
but shifted out in the final furlong and kept on between horses. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR was slow into stride, lagged behind and improved late.
CARNIVORE pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and faded. INSIGNIS failed to factor from the two
to three path. AMERICAN ICON broke a step slow and was taken in hand at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, ranged up outside of rivals turning
for home but emptied out in upper stretch.

BEST ACTOR showed the way while tucking to the inside approaching the turn, led from a pair of outer bidders entering the lane, shook free of them in
upper stretch and held sway. INJUNCTION stalked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, bid along with an outer rival entering the
lane, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch, then chased that one home well to prove second best. PRO OXIDANT trailed along the inside, shifted
out in midstretch and edged show from a tiring rival. O BESOS tracked in the three path and between horses, ranged up outside of foes to offer a three wide
bid entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch and weakened entering the final furlong. PIONEER OF MEDINA tracked in the four path but
gave way around the turn.

Footnotes
ANGKOR pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, vied entering the lane, led in upper stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds
and held sway. BOURBON HEIST laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, rallied to gain place in the final furlong, then
slowly closed in on the clear leader but needed more. DUCALE tracked inside, shifted to the three path into the turn, then to the four path entering the lane,
but only managed to chase evenly while getting outkicked in the final furlong, then edged show late. AWESOME AARON brushed with an inner rival at the
start, stalked along the inside, chased up the rail through the lane, vied for show late but got outfinished. INVULNERABLE set the pace in the two path, but
was headed by an outer presser in upper stretch and faded between horses. W W CANDY lacked speed in the four to five path, fanned to the seven path
entering the lane and failed to threaten while hanging on his left lead. EMBRACE broke slowly while bobbling slightly at the start, trailed along the inside and
improved willingly. MR BOB brushed with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, spun to the four path entering the lane and failed to factor
between horses. STRAVA broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path and weakened. BLUE LIGHT broke outwardly, pursued from midpack in the
four to five path and weakened.

Footnotes
STAR FORTRESS (IRE) trailed along the inside, bided time in hand behind rivals around the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, unleashed a
powerful kick in upper stretch, drove past the leader at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead and opened up at will through the final furlong.
SAFFRON MOON stalked three to two wide around the first turn, floated three wide once again down the backstretch, ranged up to offer a bid outside of the
leader and from the three path entering the lane, led briefly in upper stretch, but was swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder nearing the furlong grounds, then
yielded late yet saved place. LOVELY PRINCESS was off a half beat slow and last away, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted four wide
entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, yet stayed on in the final furlong, bid for place nearing the wire but missed. JUNCTURE
(GB) tracked along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a bid between horses. WALKATHON set the pace two wide before clearing an inner
rival around the first turn, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch and weakened.
JOYFUL APPLAUSE prompted along the inside, backed off to stalk around the first turn, shifted outside of the pace setter down the backstretch, but
weakened between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
XIGERA bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, pressed into the far turn, bid turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch and
drove clear. MUSIC STREET stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied between horses turning for home, but proved no match for her
outer counterpart in upper stretch, dueled for place with an inner foe through the final furlong and lasted from an outer bidder for that position late. JAG
WARRIOR set a clear pace early on, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, proved no match for her widest challenger in
upper stretch, sparred for place through the final furlong, but missed. MISTY VEIL pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased under
urging around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, sustained a chase and stayed on in the final furlong to offer a bid for place in the closing
stages but ran out of ground to reach that position. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE tracked along the inside, gave way turning for home, yet shifted out in midstretch
while sustaining stride and chased mildly between horses late. SKRATCH KAT shifted inwardly at the start, trailed along the inside, then in the three path
around the far turn before swinging to the seven path entering upper stretch, and failed to menace. BELLAMORE bumped with an inner rival at the start,
pursued from midpack four wide, chased within striking range around the far turn, but fanned to the six path entering the lane and faded.
DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE raced off of the pace in the three to two path, then gradually shifted ground outside of rivals in midstretch but failed to factor.

Footnotes
LEGADEMA set the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of bidder around the turn, drove clear of them in upper stretch and held sway. OUTSPOKEN
leaned outwardly at the start, chased two wide and between horses, split foes in the five path in upper stretch, rallied to duel for place with an inner rival
through the final furlong and prevailed. UNO LE tracked along the inside, rallied up the rail to duel for place with an outer rival through the late stages, but
got outfinished. TAPPIN INTO GENIUS bumped with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, then improved up the rail through the lane.
MISCHIEVOUS MIND broke slowly, tracked in the four path, floated to the six path entering upper stretch and yielded. LADY MOSCATO prompted three
wide, vied around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her innermost counterpart in upper stretch and faded between horses through the final furlong while
hanging on her left lead. MO ATTITUDE broke slowly, trailed along the inside, improved in upper stretch, then shifted out in the final furlong and offered a
belated kick. PARADE DOWN BROAD leaned outwardly at the start and bumped an outer foe, then failed to factor from the two path. TALE OF LA BEE
prompted two wide and between horses, vied around the turn but weakened in upper stretch. MIRANDA laid off of the pace in the three to five path and
made little impact. LADLE lacked speed in the three path and never got involved.
