Footnotes
CHRISTINA'S CANDY broke alertly, conceded the early lead to COPPER BO TEN and pressed that rival through decent early fractions, kept pressure on
the pacesetter while two wide at the quarter pole, was asked for run into the stretch, dueled with COPPER BO TEN to the sixteenth-marker, repelled that foe
in deep stretch, kept to task and held in a drive at the finish to prove best. WIRLY GIRLY chased the decent early pace and raced two wide into the turn,
shifted to the three path into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and finished well to get up for
second. COPPER BO TEN sent to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out decent fractions while pressed to the quarter
marker, met the bid of CHRISTINA'S CANDY to the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and was outfinished for
second, while holding safely for third. GRAZED N' CONFUSED raced close up to the decent early pace, was well positioned along the turn while saving
ground, chased into the stretch and did not offer a late response. LADY OF THE RIVER chased the decent early pace from the outside, raced three then
four wide to the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and did not threaten. DIVINE PASSAGE lacked early speed, chased three wide to the quarter
marker and did not factor.

Footnotes
AYRTON SENNA away in good order, conceded the early lead and pressed the pace two wide and between rivals, disputed the pace into the turn and took
a narrow lead approaching the quarter marker, was asked for run into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish for a clear win. STAY LIT rated off of the early pace and settled along the inside to begin, was guided to the two
path into the turn and improved position approaching the quarter marker, navigated traffic into upper stretch, split rivals and dove to the rail at the furlong
marker, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure second. BRANNIGAN tracked
the decent early pace, was guided four wide into the turn and gained ground heading to the quarter pole, maintained a four wide path into the stretch and
chased AYRTON SENNA to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and just missed for second. RIVER'S BEHEST raced close up
to the decent early pace, came three wide into the turn and pressed to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.
HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE tracked the decent pace from the outside, chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung to the four path into the stretch and
did not threaten. ZHIVAGO sent in the early going, contested the decent pace and led into the turn, disputed the pace from the inside approaching the
quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and faded.

CRESCENDO MOLTO broke alertly, was asked for early speed and assumed command, set decent fractions into the backstretch run while well handled,
kicked clear heading to the quarter marker, drifted to the three path into upper stretch and held foes at bay to the furlong marker, dug in into the final
sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted for the win at the finish. ADAPTED MEMORY forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early
pace then drifted out to the four path along the first turn, recovered and tracked the pace three wide into the backstretch, slipped to the inside and tracked
the decent pace to the half-mile marker, was well placed heading to the far turn, lost ground to CRESCENDO MOLTO and chased to the quarter marker,
swung three wide into the stretch and floated out AFTER MY OWN HEART, chased to the furlong marker, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth,
surged in the final strides, missed for the win and got up in time to secure second. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE allowed to settle and saved ground into the
backstretch run, tracked the decent pace from the inside and saved all of the ground into the far turn, chased CRESCENDO MOLTO to the quarter marker
and maintained an inside path into the stretch, rallied into the lane and loomed at the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was well
clear of the rest for third. AFTER MY OWN HEART rated off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and
stalked the pace from a two wide position, raced close up to the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, was
floated out a path nearing the top of the lane, recovered and chased to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. INFINITE
LOVE lunged at the break and was away slowly, was unhurried early and saved ground into the first turn, went outside of runners and pulled on the rider
into the backstretch run, made a middle move and came within aim three wide at the half-mile pole, raced three wide into the far turn, lost ground
approaching the quarter marker, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JAZZY LOVE was away from the gate in good order then was content to let the pace scenario play out up front while near the back of the tracking group,
moved closer through the turn, slipped through a big hole along the rail into the stretch and drew away as the rider pleased under a hand ride. TIZ A TIGER
shied from DRAW NEAR right after the break, lost a length or two then was unhurried racing three wide through the first turn, was content to race near the
rear of the field down the backstretch two deep, moved a little closer through the turn then took an inside path into the stretch, rallied up the rail and gained
the place. KERRYGOLD LADY tracked DRAW NEAR from well behind but also well ahead of the tracking group, went to challenge for the lead past the
quarter pole put a head in front at the top of the stretch but could not match strides with JAZZY LOVE and was past late for third. BIG JOLT went three wide
through the clubhouse turn then raced at the head of the tracking group to the half-mile pole, moved in tandem to challenge for the lead and took an outside
path into the stretch while the latter took to the inside, fanned four wide and ran on evenly to the finish. DRAW NEAR raced three wide into the first turn then
opened up a big lead setting fast fractions for the level, took the field to the quarter pole then gave way readily when challenged and hand nothing left for the
stretch run. PEACEHAVEN lacked early speed and raced near the back of the field for the first half-mile, lost ground through the far turn, chased behind the
field down the stretch but could not make an impact. LA POPIS was encouraged for speed from the gate, was beaten to the first turn but was able to secure
the inside and raced with the tracking group down the backstretch, began to struggle to keep up in the far turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARLENE'S DREAM broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a solid early pace while well handled into the turn, carved out decent
fractions heading to the quarter marker, raced in hand into upper stretch and kicked clear heading to the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady
urging into the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for the win. GRAND SLAM SMILE bumped at the start by her stablemate, was away in good order
and was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the decent pace and tracked CHARLENE'S DREAM into the turn, attended to the solid pace two wide
along the turn, lost ground to CHARLENE'S DREAM into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, could not make headway on the winner in deep stretch
and bested the rest. LUSMA exchanged bumps with WOK DON'T RUN leaving the start and was away slowly, was steered two wide and between runners
into the turn and gained ground heading to the quarter marker, tipped three wide into the stretch, needed more in the late stages and could not impact the
top two in deep stretch but was clear in the end for third. WOK DON'T RUN traded bumps with LUSMA at the start and was off slowly, chased the solid pace
from the inside and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. RANDOS LADY broke out
at the start and bumped GRAND SLAM SMILE, chased the solid early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn and made a mild gain
heading to the quarter marker, swung to the four path into the stretch and gave way. TOUR QUEEN forwardly placed in the early going and tracked the solid
pace from the inside, lost ground approaching the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired.

A DIME FOR ME allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the fast early pace two wide into the turn, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker,
was roused at the top of the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed fast into the final sixteenth, overtook BABY KRISTEN in deep stretch
and held off the oncoming runner-up in the final strides to prevail. CITY GLITTER tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, chased two wide to the
quarter marker then angled four wide into upper stretch, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just missed for
the win at the finish, while getting up in time to secure second. BABY KRISTEN showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, set
a fast pace into the turn and carved out solid fractions while prompted to the quarter pole, drifted to the two path into the stretch and kicked clear heading to
the furlong grounds, was tiring approaching the sixteenth-marker but held a narrow lead into deep stretch, was overtaken by the top two in the final strides
and just held for third at the finish. DRAW ME unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside position into the stretch and
advanced at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, closed willingly in deep stretch and just missed for third at the wire. MORNING
ADDICTION prominent leaving the start and stalked the fast early pace into the turn, prompted the fast pace two wide to the quarter marker, shifted to the
three path into the stretch and chased BABY KRISTEN to the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and checked while in tight quarters
approaching the wire. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, went three wide into the turn, came in a bit tight at the top
of the lane, shifted four wide heading to the furlong pole and found her best stride late. TIP TOP GAL tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, was

Footnotes
OUR BOLD PRINCE asked for speed in the early stages and was forwardly placed to begin, stalked the solid pace and was well positioned heading into the
turn, saved ground while on a hold heading to the quarter marker and advanced nearing the top of the lane, was roused into the stretch and vied for the lead
heading to the furlong marker, battled with TOP EXECUTIVE into the final sixteenth, shook free into deep stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming
runner-up. KANDEREL showed early speed and was forwardly placed in the opening stages, tracked the solid pace two wide into the turn, gained ground at
the quarter marker and was roused five wide into the stretch, continued his gain heading to the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth,
closed willingly in deep stretch, just missed for the win at the finish and was up in time to secure second. TOP EXECUTIVE away in good order and was
prominent early, conceded the lead and chased CAIRO CALLING through solid opening fractions, raced three wide into the turn and advanced heading to
the quarter pole, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, battled with OUR BOLD PRINCE to the
sixteenth-pole, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. FALSELY ACCUSED squeezed at the start and was off
slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn, swung six wide for the drive and gained ground at
mid-stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker but could not reel in the top three. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD broke in at the start and was off a step slowly,
settled off of the solid early pace and saved ground into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and rallied heading to the furlong marker, could not
sustain that bid into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. BOBBY'S ALIBI took back off of the solid early pace, tracked outside of rivals and raced three
wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and bid at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. SAINT IVES
prominent away from the start, chased the fast early pace from a two wide position, gained ground into the turn and vied for the lead nearing the top of the
lane, came in tight in upper stretch and lost ground heading to the furlong marker, chased into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. TORPEDO
AWAY allowed to settle away from the start, was floated out to the four path entering the turn then regrouped and chased two wide to the quarter marker,
swung to the three path into the stretch and gained ground approaching the furlong marker, finished evenly in deep stretch and did not threaten. CAIRO
CALLING hustled to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a fast pace into the turn, carved out the fractions along the bend and showed the
way while pressed to the quarter pole, came in tight into upper stretch and was shuffled back leaving the three-sixteenths marker, dropped back heading to
the furlong grounds and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN was allowed to settle into stride and content to race in the middle of the field around the first turn, made steady forward progress
down the backstretch, became boxed in through the far turn but found a seam as the field turned into the stretch, responded when set down, took command
near the furlong marker and prevailed under steady handling. HANKS got away from the gate in good order and was able to get over to the inside and put
pressure on AZURE STAR (IRE) early, pulled the rider to the front under a strong hold, then backed away preferring the stalking trip, went to challenge in
earnest passing the quarter pole, took a brief lead at the top of the stretch, was overtaken near the furlong marker by CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN but finished
well to hold second. WELLSWORT (IRE) reserved from the break, raced two deep near the rear of the field along with STRAIT OF GEORGIA, moved a little
closer heading into the far turn then deftly navigated through traffic, found an opening up the rail, rallied down the stretch and gained third. AZURE STAR
(IRE) was hustled for, and gained the early lead with the rider attempting to slow the pace down and still maintain a slight lead, kept the field at bay to
quarter pole, fought back gamely when met by a host of challengers from all sides, battled hard to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong. CHIEF
WILD EAGLE broke alertly, tracked two to three wide a few lengths behind the pace, lacked a middle move when the pace picked up on the turn, was kept
to task down the lane and split the field. QUALITY CAT was roused from the start but was outrun and trailed well behind the rest through the early going,
mounted a mild rally from last with three furlongs to run, kept grinding away down the stretch and managed to pass a few tired ones. WORTH LOOKING
was allowed to settle three wide through the first turn, moved a little too aggressively towards the leaders and had to check briefly passing the six furlong
marker, then moved out a path, tried to rally between several rivals through the far turn but was not able to keep up as they quickened pace then finished
one-paced. NUESTRO ENGREIDO broke well then got a good stalking position behind the leading pair, continued to shadow that pair to the far turn, waited
for some room through the turn, had an opening along the rail at the head of the stretch but was unable to quicken when called upon and was outrun in the
late stages. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW got a good start and was in the middle of a trio contesting for the lead going into the first turn, backed off to a tracking
position near the thirteen-sixteenths pole, launched a bid from the three-eighths marker, loomed a five-wide threat turning for home but flattened out.
STRAIT OF GEORGIA hopped in the air at the break then was roughed up between horses a few strides later, steadied out of traffic then was rank going
into the first turn, saved ground while racing in the back of the field to the far turn, tried to muster a rally but was unable improve and came up empty in the
stretch.
