wide throughout and closed strongly to gain place. DOS DE OROS settled off the leaders inside and continued willingly for the show. JAKNAVA urged off
the dueling leaders outside then flattened out. MY BROTHER CHARLIE prompted the winner to the quarter pole and faltered. QUICKER THAN QUICK
dropped back early and was always outrun. JAMAICAN WAR CRY chased three wide off the pace and stopped.

Footnotes
TWO MINUTE LICK settled off the pace, moved up outside on the backside, bid three wide entering the far turn, took charge, drew off in upper stretch, was
ridden out and in hand the final yards. ME SO LUCKY raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied for second. MAMMA MIA
ESTERINA was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn and gained mildly outside in the lane. PRACTICAL RACHEL
was off slowly and bumped at the start, raced off the pace, moved up on the far turn, made a mild bid, could not stay with the winner, then weakened.
JAMAICAN MI HAZEL was reluctant loading, off slowly, bumped and steadied, then raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. SPATIAL REALITY
stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals entering the far turn, chased and faded. FLIRTING tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and gave way.
LOST IN THOUGHT set the pace on the inside, dueled briefly and gave way.

GET SET bid inside to the front after half a mile, vied to the stretch, resisted challenges and just lasted. HURRICANE HIGHWAY trailed far behind early,
swung very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and missed. SILVER EDGE moved closer along the rail on the final turn, angled out and closed well.
EL HERMANO was firmly rated just off the pace finished willingly. PRACTICAL COACH dueled along the inside then the two path and weakened in the final
furlong. MAKABIM lacked speed then raced evenly inside through the stretch. SUIGU STAR lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. IT'S GAME TIME
urged close up outside, angled inside on the final turn and faltered. BRINDISI forced the pace for half a mile and stopped. SHIVAREE began fading after
half a mile and gave way readily.

MASROUR lunged at the start getting off very slowly, bid outside, wore down the pacesetter and was up late in a determined effort. COLD FEET alternated
for the lead dueling outside, moved clear in midstretch but was nailed nearing the wire. WORD ON A WING raced off the dueling leaders outside then
flattened out in the stretch. LANSDOWNE engaged in a heated duel inside for half a mile then proved empty in the stretch. MANAYUNK raced along the
inside and was never in contention. HELLO POP steadied just after the start and trailed far back throughout.
