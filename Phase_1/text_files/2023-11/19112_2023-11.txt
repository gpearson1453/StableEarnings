Footnotes
MY PERFECT MISTAKE broke in at the start brushing with TROUBLED LUCK and forcing TOUR JETE to steady in behind, raced seven paths off the
inside in aim of the duel up front, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced to vie for command outside a pair of rivals patiently handled until set down
swinging four wide into upper stretch, seized sole command straightened away, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole and held clear to the finish.
TOUR JETE lost her footing at the start getting away awkwardly then got forced to be steadied as rivals on each side broke her way to fill the vacancy,
conceded six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the
turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to offer up a mild kick closing in to
secure the place honors. TROUBLED LUCK broke out at the start brushing with MY PERFECT MISTAKE and forcing the aforementioned foe to steady in
behind, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued along
the inside into upper stretch before tipping out three to four wide near the eighth pole, then offered up a mild bid to procure the show honors. LA
INDECENTE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the four path with MYSARIA to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and vied inside a pair of rivals
coming under coaxing midway, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the final furlong.
MYSARIA coaxed from the start, dueled from the five path to the outside of LA INDECENTE, tucked to the two path and vied now between foes when joined
by the eventual winner to the outside, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ORGANA SOLO chased eight paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked inside briefly half a mile from home before getting out a bit green three wide once in the turn, came under coaxing just off the inside
three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was asked under threat in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage into
upper stretch, fought back gamely in the final furlong, regained the advantage in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. DIVA
BANKER was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, pursued the leading duo while
outside into the final furlong, gained to make a bid in the final sixteenth and just missed. SLACK TIDE showed early speed then dropped back near the
nine-sixteenths and tracked the pace, made a bid in the three path midway through the turn, took a short lead into upper stretch, battled outside the winner
into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole, fought with the top two to the finish and also just missed. JACKIE THE JOKER bobbled after the
start, was rated off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, chased the top three wide while remaining on
her inside lead into the final furlong then swapped to the proper lead, steadied while altering out behind horses late and finished willingly. ITS COLD IN
DEHERE threw her head at the start and was off slow, climbed under urging early, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then
moved out a path further and gained late but failed to seriously threaten. TRADE SECRET was fractious in the gate, dropped back under urging, went three
then four wide on the turn and was no factor. DIVA BANKER RAN FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY

under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, inched away briefly a furlong out, dug in under threat and held gamely to
prevail. REMEMBER THE NAME prompted the leader from the outside three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive getting shaken off briefly before coming again inside the eighth pole but was ultimately repelled while well clear of the rest and
along second best. MY MAN WOODY broke in at the start, chased four wide down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. THUNDERSLAM broke in at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. PICCATA PRINCE broke in at the start pinching back MAX S and bumping
QUICKER THAN QUICK solidly sideways, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before going three to four wide through the turn, swung five
wide into upper stretch and tired. QUICKER THAN QUICK got bumped solidly at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MAX S got pinched back between foes at the start, chased five
wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide at the head of the stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
TENEBRIS was taken in hand early then stalked the pace on the inside of a rival, moved up to get the lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on
the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, shook off foes into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging.
STJAMES came away a bit awkwardly and was slow into stride, raced at the rear under urging, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished fast to just miss. KANT BEAT THE ROCK was bumped in the hindquarters at the
start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid outside of two rivals in upper stretch, dropped back some into the final
furlong, kept on well to the finish and willingly earned the show. ANTHRACITE was taken under light restraint then rated in a good position down the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER was taken in hand early, moved up to prompt the pace leaving the chute, vied in the three path on the turn, was roused
near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. PETROLO stumbled in the hindquarters at the start and was off slow, spotted the front
a few lengths, moved in towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, came out into upper stretch and was no factor. PINE
VALLEY angled in while going to the front, led the way to the nine-sixteenths then lost the advantage, dropped back under urging while inside on the turn
and faded.

RUNNINGWSCISSORS was fractious in the gate then broke a step slow, angled in at the rear, was reserved on the inside, swung four wide into the stretch,
rallied outside to make a bid near the furlong marker, fought with two foes to the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling.
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final furlong then
was headed by the winner and was outfinished while just able to get the place. AGENT CREED was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn,
was well placed while rated off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path under urging on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, gained to
make a bid between horses near the furlong marker but was also outfinished then just missed the place but earned the show. BORN DANCER broke
through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, came away awkwardly but with the field, was taken back then moved in early, went
around the opening bend in the two path, was unhurried near the back, saved ground on the far turn, moved out into upper stretch and improved position.
LET'S GO BIG BLUE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, came six wide
into upper stretch, moved in while in a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. CITIZEN K was hustled to the front,
showed the way on the inside while inside of a foe, lost the lead while asked at the five-sixteenths and gave way. KING OF COMEDY dropped back
between horses nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. CURLY
LARRY AND MO traveled four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside without cover, was urged three wide on the far turn and came up
empty. STEELERSFANFORLIFE went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn, dropped to the
rail nearing the quarter-pole and failed to respond. ROUGH DRAFT went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace, came up empty in the two path on the
far turn and dropped out.
