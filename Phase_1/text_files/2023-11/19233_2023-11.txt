Footnotes
BRONZE ONE was hard to load prior to the start, was asked for speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early going, drew to a clear lead
heading to the half-mile marker and was well handled while setting the pace into the turn, carved out moderate fractions to the quarter pole, maintained a
clear lead into the stretch, was tiring a bit into the final sixteenth and kept to task late to prevail. DRAW SOME broke alertly and led away from the gate, lost
the early lead to BRONZE ONE and tracked that rival through decent fractions into the turn, gained ground two wide approaching the quarter marker, swung
to the three path into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished
DANZ TILL TEN for place honors. DANZ TILL TEN tracked the early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole,
tipped two wide into the stretch and chased BRONZE ONE to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch, was outfinished for second
and held safely for third. FANTASTIC DREAM chased the decent early pace from the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter marker then swung three wide
into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied into deep stretch but needed more in the final stages. RANCHO RED tracked the early pace
while on a hold, raced three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and did not threaten. DARK MYSTERY lacked early speed, chased four wide
along the turn, raced four then five wide into the stretch and did not factor. COUNT ASHER was away in good order and tracked the early pace outside of
runners, lost position into the turn, was eased through the stretch, walked off under his own power and was reported to have bled when pulled up.

Footnotes
HONORABLE GAL bobbled slightly at the break, started a step behind field then was pulling the rider into the early mix, steadied briefly just past the five
furlong marker, fell back a bit, then pulled into some traffic at the start of the turn, steadied again, swung out to the five path at the head of the stretch and
ran on strongly down the lane to get up in plenty of time. LADY WOLF broke well and took over the pacesetting duties when none of the others seemed
interested, was allowed to set comfortable fractions while uncontested early and held sway through the turn, kept all challengers at bay from the
five-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch with something in reserve, ran on but drifted out late and was outfinished for the win. ASSUREDLY came away
well from the inside and was content to sit behind LADY WOLF, stayed there through the turn, lacked room to make a move until the stretch, got clear,
made up some ground along the rail and kept to task well up to grab third. PRETTY THIRSTY lagged at the rear of the compact field then made an early
move passing the half-mile pole, loomed a threat while three wide past the five-sixteenths pole in a bid to challenge LADY WOLF for the lead, chased that
one through the stretch to no avail and flattened out in the late stages. BLACK ZABAT broke best but was outrun for the early lead, took up a three wide
stalking position and remained there through the turn, launched a bid from the quarter pole and loomed a threat to mid-stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
MISTY CAT broke alertly and was prominent leaving the start, ceded the early lead to BLOSSOMING and tracked the pacesetter from the inside, was well
placed while saving ground approaching the half-mile pole, pressured BLOSSOMING into the far turn, tipped two wide for the stretch drive and gained
command heading to the furlong marker, held the runner-up at bay into the final sixteenth and determinedly proved best in the late stages. BLOSSOMING
was sent leaving the start and assumed command into the first turn, set a prompted pace through the backstretch run and carved out decent fractions
approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way into the far turn while pressured by MISTY CAT, lost the lead into upper stretch and battled with MISTY
CAT to the furlong grounds, gamely fought into the final sixteenth, was bested by the determined winner in deep stretch and held for second at the finish.
GRIGORO was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace between runners through the backstretch run, advanced from the inside
along the far turn and tipped three wide into the lane, chased the leading pair to the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch and was well clear for third
at the finish. SPLICER was forwardly placed leaving the start and raced close to the pace into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and attended
to the decent pace to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace into the far turn, chased two wide into the stretch and gave way. NORTHERN ROSE settled
outside of runners into the early stages, advanced along the first turn and stalked the pace four wide into the backstretch run, maintained an outside path
into the far turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. ST HELENA was allowed to settle
away from the start and saved ground into the first turn, chased the decent pace through the backstretch run, maintained a inside path into the far turn,

Footnotes
CRYPTO MAN was content to track two wide in hand and well behind the pacesetter, started a rally from the three furlong pole, came four wide into the
stretch and responded to strong handling with a good finish to get up in time. PASS THE BATON reserved early, worked out an inside trip while gradually
moving into contention, awaited room through the far turn then slipped through a big opening along the rail, took a short lead, finished well but was
overtaken by CRYPTO MAN in deep stretch while well clear of the third finisher. DAZZLE THE COMMAND took a hard bump from DEO after the break then
raced near the back of the field through the early stages, came under a ride passing the half mile pole, continued to run on taking a three wide path through
the far turn, kept to task down the stretch to gain the third spot. BOOMING BERNARDO was rank through the first turn, settled down for the backstretch run
racing near the rail, was set down from the five-sixteenths, rallied into traffic then tipped out to the four path in the stretch but flattened passing the sixteenth
pole. DEO broke in at the start and made contact with DAZZLE THE COMMAND but was able to sprint clear and grab the early lead going into the first turn,
went uncontested while setting comfortable fractions to the far turn, fended off some initial challenges near the seven-sixteenths pole, extended the lead a
bit until challenged by CHELSIESDANZIGLITE approaching the five-sixteenths marker, started to weaken in mid-stretch and could not hold on.
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was up close through the early going but content to sit behind the modest pace set by DEO, went to challenge in earnest near the
five sixteenths pole, got close but proved unable to get past that rival in the stretch then was outrun in the late going.

PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL was hustled to be forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the pace into the first turn and prompted the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, was roused entering the far turn and pressured HELEN'S SUN to the quarter pole, drew to even terms with that rival into upper
stretch and batted to the furlong grounds, dueled outside of HELEN'S SUN into the final sixteenth, determinedly wore down the runner-up in deep stretch
and drew away late to prevail. HELEN'S SUN broke through the gate prior to the start, broke sharply and assumed command at the break, set the pace into
the first turn and showed the way into the backstretch run, was prompted through moderate fractions by PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL and was well handled
while setting the pace into the far turn, quickened the pace heading to the quarter marker and was pressured into upper stretch, battled with
PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL to the furlong marker, gamely dueled from the inside into the final sixteenth, was bested by the determined winner in deep
stretch and held safely for second at the finish. TWELVE VOLT was squeezed leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, settled in the two path into the
first turn, tracked the moderate pace two wide through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn and gained ground approaching the quarter
pole, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and continued his advance nearing the furlong pole, needed more in the final sixteenth but offered a mild late rally
and was up in the final strides to secure third. RIGHT HAND RYDER was asked to rate off of the early pace then came in tight while keen along the first
turn, settled into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from the inside, was well positioned while saving ground into the far turn, waited for
racing room along the rail nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide into the stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong pole, was outkicked into the final
sixteenth and was just edged for third in the final strides. ROAD HOUSE settled just off of the early pace, raced in tight quarters while keen into the first turn
and steadied approaching the backstretch run, was still a bit hard to place into the backstretch run and tracked the pace while between runners and on a
hold heading to the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, lost ground
at the furlong marker and did not offer a late response. LONG JACKET was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground
while not far back through the backstretch run, chased from the inside heading to the quarter pole, lacked a response in the stretch and did not factor.
RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND was forwardly placed leaving the start and tracked three wide into the first turn, tracked three wide along the backstretch run and
was well placed approaching the half-mile marker, was asked for run three wide into the far turn, lost ground at the quarter pole and swung four wide for the
drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

LADY'S SERMON tracked the pacesetter to the turn, then was set down passing the seven-sixteenths marker, took over the lead at the head of the stretch,
then was taken on by FRIED ASPARAGUS to the outside but dug in and held that rival at bay. FRIED ASPARAGUS broke a beat slow then shuffled back
when horses on both sides converged in front a few strides from the gate, recovered and then moved up easily into contention passing the five furlong pole,
was patiently ridden through the turn then tipped out near the five-sixteenths pole, set down at the top of the stretch, responded to strong handling but was
not able to get past the winner with a distance back to the next horse. MAJESTIC OOPS tracked three wide down the backstretch, started a bid from the
five-sixteenths marker, proved no match for the top two but kept to task and won the head bob for third. DRESS REHEARSAL was outrun down the
backstretch, chased the field to the turn, was put into a stiff drive with three furlongs to go and came up a nose short for third. WESTWARD BREEZE broke
well and easily gained an early uncontested lead, was challenged by LADY'S SERMON passing the quarter pole, proved no match, shortened strides and
faded back to last in the final sixteenth.

far turn and was asked for run approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong marker, kept to
task into the final sixteenth, dug in in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. WILL IS CHILL settled just off of the early pace and raced two wide into the
first turn, tracked the decent pace two wide through the backstretch run, maintained a two wide path into the far turn, was boxed in at the quarter marker
then was blocked approaching the top of the stretch, shifted to the four path and lost position at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, closed
willingly in deep stretch and got up at the wire for place honors. WALKING BOSS was squeezed a bit at the start and was away a step slowly, was
unhurried in the early going and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run while not far back, was guided three wide
into the far turn, waited for racing room at the quarter pole and swung five wide for the stretch drive, loomed at the furlong grounds, was outfinished by
TWIRLING DERBY in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second on the wire. MY SUNSHINE was asked for speed leaving the start and was
forwardly placed early on, raced a bit in tight into the first turn and steadied at the seven-furlong marker, tracked the decent pace from the inside through the
backstretch run and was well placed while saving ground heading to the far turn, was boxed in and waited for racing room at the quarter pole, found a
narrow opening into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth and weakened. DI
LAURIAN was hustled leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, set a prompted pace through the backstretch run and was pressured into
the far turn by MUAY THAI, held foes at bay into upper stretch, was overtaken heading to the furlong marker and faded in the late stages. EMERALD
MAGIC was prominent away from the start, came under a hold into the first turn and raced close up to the early pace while three wide, tracked the decent
pace outside of runners through the backstretch run, bid three wide at the quarter marker, lost position at the furlong grounds and tired in the final sixteenth.
MUAY THAI (IRE) was forwardly placed leaving the break and stalked the early pace into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the
decent pace to the half-mile marker, pressured DI LAURIAN into the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, dropped back nearing the furlong
marker and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
NOLDE was unhurried and relaxed through the early going while racing near the rail, became boxed in passing the half-mile pole then navigated a clear
path through the turn, moved easily into contention and emerged into the stretch on the outside of five horses across the track, responded when set down
passing the three-sixteenths pole, powered to the front and won going away. SHOT OF A LIFETIME broke alertly but was herded towards the rail and into A
MAN'S MAN by AMERICA GREAT, backed out a potential problem before the turn then switched out to the three path for the run through the first turn,
tracked the dueling leaders down the backstretch racing three to four wide, started a forward bid after the three furlong pole while also keeping BLACK
CASPIAN (IRE) pinned inside, came into stretch as the middle horse of five across, was no match for the winner but emerged from the pack to gain the
place. A MAN'S MAN broke well and was hustled forward to grab the rail and a share of the lead, then was put into a stiff hold by the rider while being
shadowed by AMERICAN GREAT to the quarter pole, responded when set down in the stretch, put away that rival, had a short lead passing the
three-sixteenths pole then had to deal with a host of challengers, dug in but was outfinished by the top pair while able to hold the third spot in a game effort.
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) raced mid-pack inside to the half, then made some forward progress through the turn while still saving ground, was stuck behind a
wall of horses at the top of the stretch, tried to go through an opening just past the furlong marker but was beaten to it by SHOT OF A LIFETIME, steadied
and switched out to the four path but could not recover. DRUIDIC threw his head up at the break then was content to settle in the two path mid-pack through
the first half-mile, swung wide into the stretch and made a mild late gain. AMERICA GREAT was hustled from the gate but was beaten to the turn by A
MAN'S MAN, shadowed that rival to the far turn through measured fractions seemingly traveling well, raced between horses spread five across the track at
the three-sixteenths pole then gave way with a furlong to run. DESCARTES broke well but then held up avoid getting caught five wide into the first turn,
angled over to the two path and was content to trail under a snug hold by the rider, was let loose going into the far turn and swung out to the five path for the
stretch run, came under pressure but had no response.

Footnotes
MEADOWOOD showed speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early running, set a fast pace into the turn, drew to a clear lead along the
bend and carved out quick fractions heading to the quarter marker, showed the way into upper stretch while in hand and maintained a clear lead to the
furlong pole, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off the runner-up in deep stretch, was fully extended in the final strides
and just lasted for the win on the wire. MAGIC WANDERER was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the fast pace two wide into the turn and
chased MEADOWOOD to the top of the lane, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, responded to urging and steadily advanced on MEADOWOOD into the final
sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. READY TO GIG chased the fast early pace two wide into
the turn, raced four wide along the bend and chased to the quarter marker, shifted to the two path into upper stretch and improved position at the furlong
pole, rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well in deep stretch and was clear for third. HANNAHAZA HETTY came in a bit tight soon after the break and
took back in the opening furlong, chased two wide into the turn, slipped to the rail nearing the top of the stretch and found her best stride late. ENCOLPION
was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the turn and tracked the fast pace to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the stretch drive, was not
able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest and closed willingly. NORTHERN LINCHPIN chased the fast early pace from the
inside, drifted to the three path approaching the quarter marker and carried out ANDRAMADA at that station, chased three wide into the stretch and did not
offer a late rally. CHRISTINA'S CANDY broke alertly and vied for the early lead, could not match strides with MEADOWOOD and chased the fast pace two
wide into the turn, chased along the bend, drifted to the two path at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.
ANDRAMADA showed speed leaving the start and was prominent in the early going, raced greenly into the turn, was taken off of the rail and chased three
wide along the bend, was carried out four to five wide into upper stretch by a drifting rival, dropped back approaching the furlong marker and tired in deep
stretch.
