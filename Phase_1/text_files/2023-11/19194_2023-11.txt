Footnotes
VANDOO stalked on the fence in the beginning, rated kindly taking closer order tucked in on the rail behind the engaging duo around the bend, angled out
with momentum four wide turning for home and wore down rivals through the lane to draw away convincingly crossing the wire. JUST FOLLOW ME broke in
at the start, had a good spot tracking the front duo three wide down the backside, moved three wide to prompt the pace outside running through the turn,
began to inch away for the lead in mid-stretch but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth comfortably besting the rest at the finish. NOVEL stalked
on the outside down the backstretch, was nudged three wide edging closer with three eighths left to run, shifted outside in the four path to be in range at the
top of the lane, showed some late energy to close in and pass the early frontrunner in deep stretch for third. CLASSY IMAGE had a slim advantage down
the backstretch running on the rail, continued up front maintaining a narrow margin throughout the turn, stubbornly battled up top in upper stretch, could find
no more at the sixteenth pole and faded to hold for a minor role in the end. GRADEVOLE broke outwards on the break, was void of early speed trailing on
the fence down the backside, saved ground around the bend making little progress, passed a tiring runner turning for home on the rail but could not get into
contention down the stretch. DIFFERENT DRUM pressed the issue outside down the back straight, gave way up front with challengers on each side three
furlongs from the wire, backed away through the turn and had little to show in the stretch.

Footnotes
SERENADE AT SEA pressed the pace inside in the beginning, was throttled back to track the front duo on the rail around the bend, pounced four wide
straightening out for the drive and got up to lead at the seventy yard pole edging clear at the finish. VERY DEBONAIRE took command from the onset, was
headed outside in midturn, repelled the early challenger by upper stretch, stubbornly ran to the finish and just gave way nearing the wire. YORKVILLE was
off a step slow trailing after the start, recovered along the back straight to travel on the rail in midfield, saved ground on the turn, rallied, slipping up the fence
at the quarter pole, waited briefly for running room on the rail in mid-stretch and closed late to be a clear third at the finish line. GRAND AMBITION tracked
the top two with runners on either side at the half, was scrubbed on throughout the turn making little impact and was one paced down the lane to settle on
the fringes in the end. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER broke outwards into rival on the break, advanced down the backstretch, forced the pace outside at the half,
dueled outside up front through the turn and faded between rivals at the furlong pole. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ was close up in the beginning under a snug
hold, retreated between runners to be near the rear at the half, offered little run around the turn and was no menace through the stretch drive.
COLLABORATIVE was coaxed in the early going trying to get better forward position down the backside, could see the field inside at the half, improved
mildly on the fence through the turn passing some runners but could not get involved driving to the wire. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE was bumped inside at the
start, settled in midfield four deep along the backside, was urged three wide keeping pace around the turn, had a chance for a minor share at the top of the
lane but lacked a closing bid down the stretch. SNOOKERED broke alertly, was then shuffled back between foes to stalk near the rear at the five furlong
marker, ran three wide through the turn making little impression, angled outside in the six path driving to the wire but offered little finish down the stretch.
BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was bounced around between horses at the start to trail in the beginning, offered a brief run four wide with three eighths left to
go, swung out widest in the seven path turning for home and emptied out down the lane.

TEXT ME UP stalked in the third flight on the inside at the half mile marker, patiently watched in hand behind the front engaging duo around the turn, shifted
outside for clear running room in the four path in mid-stretch and found more late to edge clear for the win at the wire. TIS A PITY tracked on the outside
down the back straight, commenced a rally three wide in midturn, bid for the lead in the four path straightening out for home, took command at the furlong
pole but could not hold off the late surge by the winner in the final eighth. UNIFIED FRONT was pinched at the start, stalked on the outside in the third flight
down the backside, was roused midpoint around the turn taking closer order to be in the mix of things five wide for the stretch drive and closed through the
lane to hold for third money crossing the wire. GORMLEY GIRL could see the field outside foes at the half, was ridden for more starting a rally four wide
around rivals three eighths remaining, was fanned outside in the seven path at the top of the lane and willingly ran to the finish line for a minor role in the
end. STOLE THE RING tracked inside down the backstretch, chased the frontrunner on the turn, briefly assumed command outside at the quarter pole,
battled through the early part of the stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. PHIL IN ECHO stalked three deep on the outside near the rear down the back
straight, offered a mild run four wide between horses at the quarter pole, swung out to the six path for the drive and finished up mildly on the wrong lead to
the finish line. ABSOLUTE JEWEL bobbled after the start to trail down the backside in the early stages, kept pace in hand with rivals around the turn, shifted
inwards improving on the fence in mid-stretch but could not offer a finishing kick in the final furlong. A GAL FOR T J stumbled on the break, stalked near the
rear down the backside, could not keep up with others when roused through the turn and passed the tiring early frontrunner in the stretch. SPIRIT BELLE
took control from the start, was encouraged right handed clinging to the lead midway on the turn and backed away through the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SONET'S NAME was coaxed forward at the start, soon took a narrow lead outside a rival, moved clear entering the turn, drew away in upper stretch when
asked, held safe. LOADED VIXEN got away alertly, settled stalking the eventual winner from outside three wide into the turn, made a swift advance at the
three-eighths to just off the leader's flank, could not match strides but held place. WICKED MIAH lacked early speed then settled off the pace, rallied up the
inside for show honors. MORE SAVVY raced mid-pack going about four wide on the turn, needed more late. AIRY FAIRY was a bit reluctant to load,
advanced some two to three wide on the turn, needed more late. LOIS was up close two wide into the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MI TORMENTA
switched out off the inside, swung six wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. AWILDAS TREASURE went evenly racing off the inside and made no bid.
BABY MO lacked early speed, swung eight wide, was never near enough to threaten. HIT AND RUN pressed inside the eventual winner, came up empty.

QUIET INTENT settled at the back shifting in, advanced inside foes willingly on the turn, came out a bit at the top of the stretch, bid between runners taking
a narrow lead in upper stretch, edged clear. AGILE DANCER pressed early from inside, continued to chase in behind, moved out three wide coming to the
quarter pole and a bit wider making a bid at the top of the stretch, was only second best. BASKETBALL JONES switched out off the inside racing mid-pack
into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, tipped out five deep for the stretch run, evened out. MOMENT OF PEACE was caught four wide on the
turn, needed more. MAGNIFICENT MARIO was outsprinted in the early going, forced four to five wide on the turn coming six deep into upper stretch, ran
on. BAJAN BULLET attended the early pace from outside under a hold and keen to go on, took over the lead after the opening quarter, moved clear, faded
when headed. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was outpaced early between runners at the back, ridden along coming past the seven-sixteenths, failed to menace.
SECRET STORM had the early lead, chased three wide after being overtaken, came up empty.

Footnotes
BIJOU BABY rated kindly under a good rhythm in hand down the backstretch in midfield, crept closer to the contesting leaders at the three furlong marker,
waited to pounce on the final turn, angled outside five wide driving to the finish line and won the stretch battle, beginning to edge away a few jumps before
the wire. SILENT SKY was content to track outside in the first turn, pressed the pace between foes down the backside, hounded the pacesetter outside
through the far turn, took control in the four path turning for home, was headed outside by the winner with an eighth to go, battled gamely until deep stretch
but gave way late settling for second best on this day. BEDAZZLE ME travelled on the outside in midfield along the backstretch, rallied three wide around
runners three eighths from the line, loomed in the six path at the top of the lane and stalled at the furlong marker to be a clear third crossing the wire.
QUEEN GYPSY stalked near the rear down the backstretch on the inside, inched closer to runners saving ground three furlongs from the wire, angled out in
the three path behind the top pair turning for home and willingly ran to the wire to be a fringe player in the end. FOXY DIVA trailed the field down the
backside, could not get interested running around the final bend and showed some late energy to duel for the minor share in deep stretch. MORAL
TURPITUDE assumed command into the first turn, had a narrow margin lead under a snug hold down the backside, was engulfed outside by rivals in upper
stretch and was empty for the drive. INSCRUTABLE tracked three wide on the outside down the backstretch, came under a ride three wide with three
eighths remaining, offered little response and weakened throughout the far turn. FRIENDS FOR LIFE bore out badly on the first turn, was eased through the
backstretch, cantered to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CLOUD STORAGE had a good position watching the top two down the backside, waited to move while tucked in on the rail behind the front pair around the
turn, swung outside four wide to bid turning for home, opened up mildly in mid-stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the wire. LINCOLNVILLE
BEACH was off a step slow to begin, stalking near the rear in the early stages of the race, began to pick up runners with five sixteenths from the finish, burst
between foes in the three path straightening out for home, weaved outside getting clear running room in the four path with an eighth remaining and was
gaining with each stride late but could not reel in the winner in time. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL settled on the outside in the middle of the pack down the backside,
improved some to be all alone in the third flight midpoint on the turn, swung outside gaining momentum widest in the six path for the drive to the finish, found
her best stride late and closed in to capture third money. MAKES SENSE TO ME travelled in mid-pack on the inside early on, saved ground keeping pace
with others through the turn, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize on the fence in upper stretch, angled outside off tiring runners in the three path at
the furlong marker and ran on to the finish for a minor share. VERY SAVVY dictated the pace down the backstretch, was pressed outside maintaining a slim
lead on the turn, was headed outside in upper stretch, fought gamely on the rail but yielded in the final seventy yards. UMNEYAAT settled on the outside in
the third flight down the back straight, kept a close eye on the leaders tracking three wide outside running around the turn, was in the mix in the five path at
the top of the lane but leveled out down the stretch. CHROME'S ANGEL broke out, bobbling on the start, recovered to prompt outside down the back
straight, dueled outside around the bend, briefly poked her head in front between foes in upper stretch, could not find another gear late and faltered in the
final furlong. NO MORE DIAMONDS tracked two wide between horses in the third flight down the backside, was hard ridden midway on the turn trying to
match strides with the runners on either side and retreated in upper stretch. HELLUVA HOLIDAY had a slow start to begin trailing down the backside, lost
contact with the leaders around the turn and passed a straggler in the stretch. SWEET SERENADE was void of early speed having one beat down the
backside as well as throughout the turn and had little to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TAYLORMOON tracked the front pair just outside down the backstretch, moved closer three wide at the quarter pole, posed the main threat outside turning
for home and cleared to the lead in deep stretch for the win. FEDALINE was hustled on the rail taking command down the backside, opened up mildly on
rivals at the quarter pole, was collared outside clinging to the lead at the furlong marker, gave way to the winner late and just held on saving the place share
at the wire. GOLD FORESTER travelled between runners in midfield in the two path down the backside, progressed smartly inside through the turn to be in
range of the top trio at the quarter pole, rallied smartly on the rail down the lane and just missed closing in for second at the wire. THATSITTHATSALL
forced the issue between foes down the back straight, chased the pacesetter through the turn, could not make any gains on the leader at the quarter pole
and determinedly ran down the stretch to hold for a minor role in the end. GOLDEN TRAIN was coaxed on the fence in mid-pack trying to maintain position
down the backside, was shuffled back some in tight quarters on the fence around the turn losing positions and ran on willingly to the finish, improving past
runners down the stretch. TAMANA stalked near the rear in the early stages, tried to mount a rally three wide between foes entering the turn, was checked
briefly at the three furlong marker losing its run, regrouped through the turn, angled outside in the four path straightening out for the drive and finished with
intent to the wire. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was away poorly on the break to co-trail on the inside down the backstretch, saved ground making little headway
around the turn and showed good late interest on the fence running on end at the finish. LULU'S LULLABY was hard ridden trying to maintain position
entering the turn, kept pace with rivals around the bend, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize five wide at the top of the lane and ran on evenly to the
finish. FOREST CHOICE was throttled back behind a wall of runners at the three furlong marker, just started to commence her run four wide at the quarter
pole, lost its path and had to be steadied turning for home and could not regroup in time to be a factor at the finish. BOSSKAYE stalked six deep on the
outside at the half, offered a mild run four wide around horses through the turn, swung out widest in the six path turning for home but could not offer a finish
in the stretch. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS had a slow start co-trailing on the outside down the back straight, made little progress outside foes throughout the
