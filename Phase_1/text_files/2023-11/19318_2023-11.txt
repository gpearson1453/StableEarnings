PONTIFFANY quickly moved clear, was engaged on the turn then held on gamely repelling challenge following a long duel. REITERATE close up outside,
went after the winner on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. ANGINETTI raced off the leaders three wide then went evenly in the
stretch. WICKED JANE trailed early, advanced wide on the turn with a mild bid. GIA'S FUEGO was urged close up inside early then began weakening on
the turn. LEVIOSA chased inside and faded steadily. PURRFECT MISTRESS was urged off the pace in the two path and gave way. MISS ALEX lacked
speed wide and stopped abruptly.

MAXIMUS MERIDIUS broke slowest, rushed up inside, collared the leader passing the quarter pole and quickly pulled away while ridden out.
CARCHAROTH lacked speed, advanced four wide on turn then rallied inside late to gain the place. BERNIE'S MITTS hustled to clear lead inside, was
hooked at the quarter pole and weakened. CHACHACHING dropped well behind then offered some late energy. LONESOME BOY angled inside with a
brief bid on the turn then flattened out. ROSSINGTON trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PARTY AT SAM'S ducked out at the start,
moved close up three wide and stopped. CHOCHOCHO was urged close up in the opening quarter then gave way on the turn. BIAGIO dropped back inside
and raced far behind throughout.

Footnotes
ABIDALE vied inside for the early lead, then set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when challenged, battled heads apart
with UNADULTERATED in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. UNADULTERATED raced three wide early, stalked outside, chased between rivals on the
far turn, rallied outside of ABIDALE entering the stretch, dueled with that rival, dug in gamely outside in the final sixteenth and came up second best.
CONNELMAURA stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and earned the show spot. IFIHADACHANCE tracked on the
inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. SALAGADOOLA was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. TOURING MARYANNE raced three wide
early, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and faded. SCOTT ALAIA raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
