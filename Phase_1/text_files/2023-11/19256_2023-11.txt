Footnotes
COLLECT A LIL tracked along the inside, bumped an outer rival while taking aim outside of the clear leader at the three sixteenths pole, bid leaving the
furlong grounds, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole and held late. VALIANT PRAISE was fractious in the starting gate, saved ground off of the pace,
improved inside of rivals entering the lane, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied between rivals to offer a bid outside of the new leader in the late stages,
but needed more. DAISY JONES also acted up in the starting gate awaiting the off, set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook free of that one at the
three sixteenths pole, but encountered an outer challenge in the final furlong and was bested passing the sixteenth pole. LIL TOWN SIS broke a step slow,
laid off of the pace despite urging in the three path into the turn, floated five wide in upper stretch and ran on willingly. SQUASH BLOSSOM broke a step
slow then steadied when forced to crowded quarters by an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path, swung eight wide entering the lane and failed to
menace. MAMBA OUT pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch before taking contact from an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, then
gave way between horses in the final furlong. SEVENTEENSEVITYSIX tracked two wide, shifted outside of foes to the four path at the three furlong pole,
then fanned seven wide entering the lane and tired. WILLADEAN broke outwardly, stalked outside of the top pair but faded around the turn.

Footnotes
AIR COMBAT bumped with rivals on both sides soon after the start, prompted the pace three wide, took the turn in the four path, bid entering the lane,
drove clear nearing midstretch and held sway from an outer pursuer. TRIGGER HAPPY bumped with an inner rival a few strides after the off, stalked
outside of the leading trio, chased them from the five path around the turn, ran on well while drifting about through the lane but only managed to pursue the
clear leader home. EL FRANCO trailed along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, tipped back in to maneuver around a rival soon after, then
stayed on between horses to gain show leaving the sixteenth pole. G T FIVE HUNDRED leaned outwardly leaving the gates, tracked the leaders from the
three to four path, shifted further out to the seven path in upper stretch, stayed on mildly to bid for show at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by an inner
rival leaving that marker. FIRE BRYAN vied along the inside, led narrowly from a pair of outer prompters around the turn, but was headed by the eventual
winner in upper stretch and weakened. CATIPARI bumped with rivals on both sides soon after the start, vied two wide and between horses, but came under
urging in the three path into the turn and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
DR KRINGLE was last away but advanced to midpack in the three path around the first turn, shifted to the four path with five furlongs to go, was roused
while chasing from within striking range outside of the top trio turning for home. EMPIRE'S BEST perched himself outside of the top pair while stalking in
hand, bid and vied around the far turn, led turning for home before meeting an outer challenge entering the lane, dueled gamely with that one through the
lane but was bested late. VIGANO tracked along the inside under moderate yet consistent coaxing, chased the leading trio around the far turn, shifted to the
four path in upper stretch and ran on evenly. MY SANCTUARY laid off of the pace two wide, but came under urging in the three to four path into the far turn,
shifted to the six path entering the lane and flattened out while hanging on his left lead. BEAUMONT RED saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in
upper stretch and moved up. ACTIVE DUTY lacked speed along the inside, trailed around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch and
failed to factor. WE WILL CONQUER pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. AWAY FROM HOME set
the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far turn and weakened entering the lane. EGYPTIAN KING lacked speed in the three
path, failed to respond to urging in the five path around the far turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARCHIE THE GIZA shied slightly from an inner pair leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the three path, took aim inching closer between horses in the
five path entering the lane, but leaned inwardly in upper stretch, straightened course then sustained a rally while requiring correction to keep from lugging in
through midstretch, bid while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. CROSSING stalked two wide, bid in the three path at the
three furlong pole, drew clear entering the lane, held sway through midstretch but was caught by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole. MOHEGAN was slow
into stride after being off half a step slow, trailed early on, gained ground readily in the four path turning for home, then sustained a rally to gain show in the
final sixteenth. MAIN LINE CIPHER tracked in the three to two path, advanced between horses turning for home before taking aim on the clearing leader
from the four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase that one into the final furlong before yielding. ELEGANT TRIP took contact from an inner
rival nearing the exit of the chute, pursued from midpack along the inside, but chased into the turn, then kept on mildly in the final furlong. ATHENS MOON
set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder while taking the turn in the two path, got headed by that one turning for home and weakened. BEL
AMI leaned outwardly and floated a rival into another at the thirteen sixteenths pole, stalked along the inside early on, shifted outside of the leading pair
approaching the turn, chased them from the four path around the bend, but was floated to the six path entering the lane and weakened. STONKS bumped
the outer part of the gate upon leaving it, then made little impact from the three path. FUNSTRUCK lacked speed in the two path and faded. BE THERE was
floated outwardly by an inner rival and forced to bump an outer foe approaching the end of the chute, then lacked speed along the inside and was outrun
turning for home.

Footnotes
UPSTRIKER set the pace outside of a prompting foe, cleared that one at the three furlong pole, maintained a clear advantage through midstretch, then
lasted from an outer bidder late. PALACE KITTEN exchanged brushed with an outer rival at the start, then checked out of cramped quarters between foes at
the eleven sixteenths pole, pursued form off of the pace, came under urging in the four path around the turn, bid for place entering the lane, forged that
position in upper stretch, then slowly narrowed the clear leader's advantage through the final furlong, attempted a bid approaching the wire but came up
short. SPEIGHT AND MALICE tracked in the three path, shifted a bit further out in upper stretch and ran on evenly to reach show at the sixteenth pole.
WELLMAN broke slowly and shied from an inner rival at the start, raced towards the rear along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then
improved between tiring rivals in the final furlong. MACHO ROCCO chased forwardly in the three path, bid for place along with an outer rival entering the
lane, but was outkicked and gave way. RISK PROFILE hopped and spotted the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed two wide, spun for home in the five
path and failed to factor. DEVOTED TO YOU shifted outwardly at the start, prompted inside of the leader early on, but failed to keep pace with three
furlongs to go, chased turning for home and faded. STEINBECK exchanged brushes with an inner rival at the start, tracked from the two path, but tired.

Footnotes
STANDOUTSENSATION set the pace along the inside, showed the way from an outer presser into the far turn, shook free of that one entering the lane,
drove clear and held sway. BROUGHTY FERRY laid off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride shifting five wide and between horses in midstretch,
then sustained a rally outside of foes in the closing stages to gain place late. SAVANNAMARIE bumped an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the
pace two wide, came under urging in the four path around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path, then stayed on along with an outer rival in the final
furlong to bid for place in the closing stages, but got outfinished. CORKAGE FEE tracked three wide, chased around the far turn, pursued while hanging on
his left lead through the lane, gained place at the furlong grounds, but was bested by an outer pair in the final sixteenth. BUSINESS AS USUAL took contact
to her hind quarters from an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide, pressed the leader into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the
lane and gave way. VINO FROM ERNIES broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, but steadied behind rivals inside the seven furlong pole,
came under urging in the three path while between horses around the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and lacked a bid. AVALON GIRL bumped
with rivals on both sides at the start, trailed in the four path around the first turn and made little impact. MONEY WORKS bumped with rivals on both sides
and took back from crowded quarters between them soon after the start, then failed to factor from the three path. MOTHER FREEDOM tracked two wide
and between horses while keen under a snug hold around the first turn, then chased along the inside into the far turn and faded. SHOW ME THE CANDY
raced forwardly along the inside, but faded with five furlongs to go and was done early.

Footnotes
BORN FLAWLESS set the pace inside of pressing foes, showed the way in the two path around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, drove clear and held
sway. CHANCE bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the two path at the three furlong pole, took aim
outside of the leaders and from the four path entering the lane, then chased willingly to gain place at the sixteenth pole. AIRBORNE ELITE was briefly
forward four wide, but failed to sustain position approaching the turn, pursued from the four path around the bend, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, then
offered a late kick to gain show from an outer rival nearing the wire. SUPREMELY stalked along the inside, claimed place from an outer rival while taking
aim outside of clear leader at the three sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase that one in to the final furlong and tired between horses late. ATTACHE
bumped with an inner rival at the start, prompted three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, bid turning for home, then gave way in
upper stretch. OLLIEMEISTER stalked five to four wide, chased under urging in the four path around the turn, spun for home in the five path and yielded.
DR. PERRY broke half a beat slow, saved ground while trailing but to no avail. ROCKING ROCKET took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at
the start, prompted two wide and between horses but faded into the turn.

NAPA CANDY saved ground off of the pace, inched closer behind the leaders through midstretch, split them in the final sixteenth and edged ahead. AUNT
BECCA vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, got headed turning for home, fought on to reclaim an advantage in midstretch, but was bested by an outer
bidder in the closing stages. WILLOW BEND stalked along the inside, pursued behind the leading trio from just off the fence around the turn, loomed a
danger in hand tipping outside of them entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but only managed to vie through midstretch, got outkicked by an inner rallying
rival in the final sixteenth and was denied reaching place. JOKE SISI (CHI) chased four wide, floated six wide into upper stretch and kept on in the late
stages. MORE THAN VOWS vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the final sixteenth. ZAWISH tracked two wide,
gradually shifted out in upper stretch and gave way between horses in the final furlong. LET'S BE CLEAR trailed in the three path, moved out to the eight
path in upper stretch and made little impact. UNSOLVED MYSTERY prompted three wide, vied around the turn, led nearing the lane, but hung on his left
lead while vying between horses in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WECALLEMFUNCOUPONS dueled for the lead along the inside, was headed while inside of a trio of foes around the turn, fought on gamely through the
final sixteenth and prevailed. RUN JALEN RUN pursued from midpack in the four path, tipped six wide entering the lane, then rallied to offer a late bid but
missed. BEAR RIVER stalked four wide, bid and vied around the turn, dueled through midstretch but yielded between the eventual top pair approaching the
wire. MOHAWK RIVER saved ground well back then rallied along the rail. SALMING stalked in the two to three path behind the leaders, then chased
between horses. MACKVILLE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and between horses but yielded in the final furlong.
ADRIFT was bumped and floated inwardly by outer rivals at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted outwardly in midstretch and failed to
menace. RUNAWAY JOKE prompted three wide and between horses, chased them around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the lane but yielded.
DEBT PAID broke slowly, lacked speed in the four to five path, then failed to factor in the seven path. COUNTY JUDGE broke slowly and was outrun in the
three path. MOR ZIP broke outwardly, and made little impact in the four to eight path. STRADIVARIAN transferred firm contact from an outer rival to an
inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path and tired.
