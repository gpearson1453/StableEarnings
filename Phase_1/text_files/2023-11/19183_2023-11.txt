Footnotes
PARIS STYLE (FR) three to four wide off a duel early on, advanced three wide through the turn to take command at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. AFRICAN WATERS was bumped at the start by TOOSHAY, who broke
outwards, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and proved no match for the top one
while along clear for the place honors. TOOSHAY broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased two then three wide coming under urging
at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. DREAMING OF MO dueled from the two path with
ALLEGEDLY to the inside, vied briefly between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths before being shaken off, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. ALLEGEDLY dueled inside of the aforementioned rival, then vied briefly inside a pair coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got
headed for command with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHASING DAYLIGHT tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage while roused for more outside
the quarter-pole, shook off the pacesetter inside the furlong marker and edged clear under steady urging. HOWZYOURCASHFLOW settled off the pace,
moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, came under a strong drive in upper stretch, pursued the winner
into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was
challenged to her outside while in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, fought with the winner under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened then was just caught for the place. RACING COLORS settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the turn,
pursued the leader in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. AMITY ISLAND broke out at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around
the turn in the two path, came out six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. JOLLY MISS JILL was hustled from the gate, moved out while settling
off the pace, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, chased two then three wide on the turn and came up empty. DIAMOND COLLECTOR settled on the
inside of a foe, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FORTUNE'S NEPHEW was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside of two foes, took the lead in the four path at the three-eighths pole,
responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, led while tired into the final sixteenth and held desperately under strong urging. CLEVER
FOREVER was ridden along off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch,
gained on the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. BEARY FUNNY was off a step slow, settled off the pace, was urged while two
then three wide for most of the turn, moved to the four path late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and willingly earned
the show. CALDO CANDY disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back some at the five-sixteenths
pole, fought on well with the winner into the final sixteenth and weakened. SCHERZANDO broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, went four then
three wide on the turn and gained in the final furlong but failed to seriously threaten. CLANCY FANCY was fractious behind the gate and unseated the rider,
contested the pace loosely between horses, vied in the two path while between foes on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
BE OF COURAGE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied coming in under an
active right rein despite a left handed crop seizing command inside the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive kept to task. SELL SOMETHING just off
the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on
the outside of the leader, had the aforementioned foe come inwards while going on by and pulled stiffly on the left rein bumping ROCKET AND ROLL into
LEFTEMBEHIND, then kept on to secure the place honors. LEFTEMBEHIND chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, angled in to rally up the rail and was bumped by ROCKET AND ROLL due to pressure from SELL
SOMETHING, then kept on to be along for the show honors. ROCKET AND ROLL got bumped at the start by TOP ENVOY, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and
was bumped by SELL SOMETHING and in turn bumped LEFTEMBEHIND just inside the eighth pole when being overhauled by the top one, then weakened
in the late stages. BARREL OF QUESTS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, improved position to the finish while one paced to the end. ZAPRUDER chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LORD FLINTSHIRE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. COURAGEOOUS OH LA just off the inside in closest aim of the early
leader, took over command midway down the backstretch and tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go, then tired to the finish. TOP ENVOY broke out at the start bumping ROCKET AND
ROLL, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. NOBLE HUNTSMAN chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SHINSUN chased along the inside, tipped two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LT. MITCHELL led early on inside, got headed for the front five furlongs from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths briefly, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the finish, then was reported to have bled.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of ROCKET AND ROLL alleging interference against BE OF
COURAGE. After review, it was deemed that BE OF COURAGE had caused interference to ROCKET AND ROLL and therefore BE OF COURAGE was
disqualified and placed fourth before the result was declared official.

Footnotes
SWEETEST PRINCESS dropped back quickly after the start, was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the four path, swung seven wide into
upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. MAJESTIC RETURN brushed with a foe at the start, chased the pace on
the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, fought outside of a foe into the final
furlong, disposed of that rival into the final sixteenth but was denied by the winner. TEMPERMENTAL was urged along off the pace, moved from three to
five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. COUSIN KRISTI broke out and bumped
with a foe then was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, fought
on under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. TIMELY CONQUEST brushed with a foe at the start, was urged
along on the inside of a foe, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. MZ BIG BUCKS was hustled from the gate, chased the
pace, saved ground on the turn and tired. FONTANAFREDDA was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the
turn and came up empty. CARBON settled off the pace, dropped back while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. SILVER FIST bobbled at the start then bumped with an opponent, settled towards the back, traveled around the turn in the two
path and was no factor.

TAKE ME TO JIMMY three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and was up in the final jumps to prevail in a blanket finish to the end. CHAMPAGNE JUAN just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was up for the place honors in the final strides to the finish. SCAT TU TAP coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from PUJOL to the outside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from HEART N SOUL to the outside and clung to command until overtaken in the last jumps to the wire and was able to preserve the show honors on
the line by a sliver. HEART N SOUL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive getting on near even terms through the final furlong with the aforementioned foe and could not go by and was ultimately repelled to the end by
that rival while along for the last major share. BREES tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WAR OFFICER chased three then two wide, got let out angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was
outfinished. TRIUMPHANT ROAD broke half a beat slow, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside
route into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish but was outkicked. WILD GUESS chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NOSTALGIC ONE saved ground at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. ONE BITE settled just off the inside near the rear of the
field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered no kick. PUJOL showed the way early on then
prompted the leader from the outside in the two path coming under a drive with five-sixteenths to go, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then
weakened to the finish.
