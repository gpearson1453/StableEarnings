Footnotes
GAMMA SQUEEZE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure and turned back WINDSOR'S TRACKER leaving the three eighths
pole, raced clear at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. The latter stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole
and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but ultimately, had to settle for second best. NO ME DIGAS stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. SCHMEAR settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, but showed little in the lane. ONE MORE CHAPTER rounded the
first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed
little in the stretch. DAD'S LIL SPARK bobbled at the break and was pinched back soon afterward, raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

CRUZ IN THE CASTLE accelerated to the lead inside approaching the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, raced clear
leaving the eighth pole and held well under steady handling. AT THE HALF gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail then eased out past the eighth
pole and dug in to take second the final strides. THUNDER PUNCH set a pressured early pace then gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, raced at a
close disadvantage two deep on the turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and was nipped from second the final strides. EMBERLY chased through
the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, steadied leaving the eighth pole but came back to finish evenly. SISTER JOANN gave chase through
the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little more. ULTRA DIVA was not a factor. MISS GRANDSTANDER
was taken up shortly after the start and walked off post race. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of At The Half for alleged
interference leaving the turn, lodged by the rider of Emberly.

MITOLE'S BAYTOWN rated a slim lead inside and kept the edge over A LOTTA MOXIE leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the
five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. The latter stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. OREO ANGEL settled off the rail the
first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and entered the far turn at the rail, angled out midway through the turn and finished evenly at the outside
flank of the runner-up. RAGAZZA MIA saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in
the lane. OLD FASHIONED GIRL stalked the early pace from the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path on
the far turn. COLLECTED SUCCESS became fractious in the gate and angled to the five path into the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase to no
avail leaving the seven sixteenths pole. BRASSIC stalked from the three path the first turn then weakened leaving the three eighths pole.

the backstretch, but checked approaching the quarter pole, resumed his efforts two deep past the pole and held on for third. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE came
away sharply with a brief lead then gave chase outside leaving the half mile pole, rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane.
