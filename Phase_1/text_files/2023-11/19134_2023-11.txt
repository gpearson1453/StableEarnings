Footnotes
OLD TRIANGLE raced close to the decent early pace and tracked two wide into the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker and confronted ITS
HAPPY HOUR at the top of the lane, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, shook free nearing the sixteenth-marker and kicked clear under mild urging in
deep stretch. ITS HAPPY HOUR showed speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set a a decent pace into the turn and was well
handled while carving the fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by OLD TRIANGLE in upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong
grounds, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and ran on to be second best in the end. THICKEY BOY broke in a step at the start and was away a bit slowly,
chased from the rear in the early stages, raced in tight entering the turn and steadied at the three-furlong pole, raced three wide into the stretch, could not
impact the top pair in the final furlong and held clearly for third. DAD'S JUBILEE stalked the early pace from the inside, chased into the stretch, could not
match strides with the leaders inside of the furlong pole and weakened in the late stages. CRAZY STORM broke alertly and vied for the early lead leaving
the start, took back and tracked the decent pace while outside of runners, raced four wide into the turn and gained ground heading to the quarter pole, lost
position into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. MOOLA MAN came in a bit tight leaving the start and steadied in the early going, chased the decent
early pace and raced four wide into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not factor. AUTISM SPECIAL was prominent leaving the start and contested
the decent early pace, maintained a three wide path into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LYINATTHEBAR was rated kindly and allowed to set a dawdling pace with the rest in close pursuit, opened up when roused at the top of the stretch and
was widening at the finish. ALESHA settled four wide into the first turn, slipped to the inside and saved ground into the far turn, was not able to keep pace
with the winner in the final furlong and held well for second in deep stretch. LUCY L tracked three wide to the far turn, came under some pressure to keep
up passing the half-mile marker, loomed a threat passing the quarter pole but ran on but was outfinished for the place. LA POPIS was content to sit just to
the outside of LYINATTHEBAR for six furlongs, had no response when that one sprinted away at the three-sixteenths pole and was passed by the others in
deep stretch.

approaching the top of the stretch, angled four wide for the drive and chased to the furlong grounds, closed well in deep stretch, could not impact the winner
in the final stages but ran on late to be second best. RUNNING ON FIRE tracked the fast pace from the inside, chased the pacesetter to the quarter pole,
could not keep pace with the winner in the stretch drive, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third.
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE tracked the fast early pace, chased two wide to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way. DANZING

BOLD MISTRESS vied for the lead away from the start, conceded the early advantage to SHEMAKESCENTS and stalked that rival into the turn, pressed
SHEMAKESCENTS through fast fractions approaching the quarter pole, took command in upper stretch, drew clear inside of the furlong marker, drew away
into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish in a convincing win. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN bobbled slightly leaving the start and was off a step
slowly, tracked the solid early pace between runners, advanced two wide into the turn, chased into the stretch, could not impact the winner in the late stages
but made a mild late gain and was second best in the end. SHEMAKESCENTS showed speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early stages,
set a fast pace into the turn, was pressed along the bend by BOLD MISTRESS, battled for the lead with that rival into upper stretch, lost ground to BOLD
MISTRESS at the furlong pole, faded in the final furlong and just held for third at the finish. LADY IN A HURRY chased the fast early pace from the inside,
ran in pursuit while saving ground to the quarter marker, could not muster the needed response in the stretch and just missed for third at the wire.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER tracked the fast early pace from the outside, chased two wide into the turn, angled three wide into upper stretch and did not
factor. MISS SKI broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, tracked the fast early pace from the outside and raced three wide into the turn, chased
the pace to the quarter pole and swung four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GONNA GETCHA GOOD was forwardly placed leaving the start and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, tracked the quick pace to the quarter pole,
tipped two wide into upper stretch and was asked for run heading to the furlong grounds, reeled in his stablemate approaching the sixteenth-pole and drove
clear to prevail. PETER FLIES showed good speed away from the gate and set the early pace, extended the lead into the turn and carved out solid fractions
approaching the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was overtaken by his stablemate nearing the
sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. GIANOLA bobbled slightly leaving the break, chased the fast early
pace from a two wide position, was a bit green and climbed while chasing into the turn, slipped to the inside and chased the top two into the stretch, lacked
a late response in the final furlong and was well clear in the end for third. CARDINAL TRICK broke in leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried in the early stages and slipped to the inside to save ground heading into the turn, improved position at the quarter marker, was not able to impact
the top three in the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. AS LUCK HAPPENS was prominent leaving the start and chased the fast early pace,
maintained a two wide path into the turn, and ran in pursuit to the quarter pole, lost position at the furlong marker and gave way. DEFENSOR FORTIS broke
out at the start, bothered a neighboring rival and was away a bit slowly, chased the fast early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the turn and
was outrun to the quarter pole, swung to the four path into the stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. ATTA BOY LLOYD was squeezed at the start
and was away a bit slowly, pulled on the rider in the early going and rushed up three wide to race close to the fast pace, maintained that three wide path into
the turn and chased to the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SLEW'S JOY broke alertly, rider used enough early speed to hold the rail position racing just off the flank of HOGMANAY (IRE) through the initial furlong
then went head to head with that foe once past the half-mile marker and through the turn, the pair was joined by SILENT SUNDAY and JERRY JEFF
WALKER top of the stretch, then while still holding the inside position kept a head in front through a spirited stretch battle and was unrelenting in the end.
SILENT SUNDAY was first out of the gate and rushed to get a share of the early lead then was content to sit behind the developing speed duel, bid for the
lead passing the three furlong marker, came into the stretch on the outside SLEW'S JOY and HOGMANY (IRE) then battled gamely with those two to the
line and just missed. ATKINS was off a step slow but was content to settle close up but in the back of the forward pack, saved ground through the turn and
waited behind horses to make a bid, tipped out five wide for the stretch run and made a nice run down the middle of the track to grab third. JERRY JEFF
WALKER was hustled away from the gate and raced forwardly but four wide in the early stages, improved through the turn while still racing wide, was in
contention though four wide into the stretch, lost some ground turning for home but battled back and was slowly clawing back that lost ground in the end.
HOGMANAY (IRE) broke well, bumped lightly with SLEW'S JOY a few jumps from the gate set a solid pace while being pressured by SLEW'S JOY through
the initial quarter-mile, became surrounded by challengers at the quarter pole, soldiered on gamely between rivals down the stretch then gave way
grudgingly in the final yards. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY was slow into stride, lagged behind the field to the turn, attempted to make a run through the turn but
was unable to make up any ground and chased the field to the wire.

Footnotes
BLUE WILDCAT was allowed to settle leaving the break, steadied slightly approaching the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide
into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, drifted in a bit under firm urging in deep stretch,
surged in the final strides and got up on the wire to nail SMILING MOLLY for the win. SMILING MOLLY was hard sent away from the start and assumed
command in the early running, set a fast pace while pressed into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out quick fractions approaching the quarter
marker, raced in hand into upper stretch and extended the lead at the furlong pole, held foes at bay while kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure in
the final strides, was nailed on the wire for the win by BLUE WILDCAT and held for second in a game effort. MORNING ADDICTION was prominent leaving
the start and contested the fast early pace three deep, pressed the pace into the turn and kept close attendance approaching the quarter pole, chased
SMILING MOLLY to mid-stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and just held for third at the wire. DULCE EMMA rated off
of the fast early pace and tracked between runners, checked slightly approaching the turn and chased from the rail heading to the quarter marker, came in a
bit tight at the top of the stretch and angled three wide for the drive, improved position at the furlong marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth, steadied
just before the wire when CANAM GAL came over into her path and just missed for third at the finish. CANAM GAL tracked the fast early pace from the
second flight, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came three wide to the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch, rallied and came
within aim at the furlong grounds, needed more in the final sixteenth, was crowded a bit by the winner in the final strides and steadied just before the wire.
LASTING LOVE tracked the fast early pace from the inside, was well placed while saving ground along the turn, mounted an inside rally in upper stretch,
could not sustain that bid into the final furlong and weakened. GOLDEN PRAYER broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, stalked the fast early
pace while between rivals, chased two wide and between runners to the quarter marker, raced in traffic into upper stretch and angled four wide nearing the
furlong pole, continued to race in tight into the final sixteenth and lacked a rally in deep stretch.

Footnotes
WILD JEWELS broke alertly, raced close to the fast early pace and tracked outside of the leading pair heading to the turn, inched closer along the bend and
vied for the lead three wide at the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground to GOOD LOVIN into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, closed into the final
sixteenth, wore down GOOD LOVIN in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to determinedly prevail. GOOD LOVIN showed speed away from the
start and was prominent in the early going, contested the fast pace with TOUGHERTHANTHEREST and dueled with that rival into the turn, battled for pace
duties along the bend and held a narrow lead at the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch and was kept to task to the furlong grounds, gamely fought
with WILD JEWELS into deep stretch, was bested in the final strides and held clearly at the finish for second. MELANIE'S TIGER was crowded by
neighboring rivals at the start and was away a step slowly, tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, maintained an outside path into the turn and
raced three then four wide to the quarter pole, gained ground four wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top two in the late stages but was gaining
in the final furlong and was clear for third at the wire. TOUGHERTHANTHEREST vied for the early lead leaving the start and contested the fast pace
between runners heading to the turn, lost a bit of ground along the bend but continued to battle for the lead while between and two wide at the quarter pole,
chased into the stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong and gave way. CAPO LUIGI broke out at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, recovered
and tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, raced between runners into the turn, came in tight midway through the bend and was shuffled back
approaching the quarter pole, chased three wide into the stretch, re-rallied into the final furlong but was not able to threaten in the late stages. SPINNIN
PISTOLS was crowded at the start and was off slowly, chased the fast early pace from the rear and saved ground into the turn, drifted out a bit midway
through the bend and raced two wide to the quarter pole, angled thee wide into upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response and finished
evenly. DRUM BUNNY lunged at the start, was away slowly and spotted the field to begin, chased the fast early pace from the inside, improved position
along the turn and saved ground into the drive, was outrun in the final furlong and tired in deep stretch.

Footnotes
RHONDA'S COOKIN was caught four to five wide through the clubhouse turn, emerged onto the backstretch run just behind the leaders while rating kindly
in hand, stalked FOREVER LOVELY to the far turn then responded when given the cue to engage that one passing the seven-sixteenths pole, assumed
command while still in hand passing the quarter pole, quickened away under a steady hand ride and won clear. PRESTIGIOUS bobbled at the start and
came out a bit awkwardly, was outrun to the first turn and caught three wide, stayed in the clear in the three to four path throughout while making steady
forward progress down the backstretch, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, followed the eventual winner into the stretch, was unable to keep pace but
held second. DORINE'S WILD CAT was held up in the back of the field and content with that position to the far turn, waited for room from the three furlong
marker, took advantage of a hole at the top of the stretch and finished up well to gain third while well clear of the next horse. ALLOCATE broke slightly
inward then straightened and settled nicely mid-pack through the first half mile, lacked room to make a move through the far turn but held position then
tipped out to the five path for the stretch run, had the rider drop the crop near the three sixteenths pole then finished evenly in the stretch. SHEZA LUCKY
CHARM was keen from the break and pulled the rider forward through the first turn, settled into a tracking position in the two path, looked for some racing
room while behind horses on the far turn but lacked a rally once clear. AMMARA broke a step behind the field then had to steady when ALLOCATE came
over from the outside, was keen and became hard to place through the first turn, tried to mount a rally four to five wide from the seven-sixteenths marker but
flattened out in the stretch and finished evenly. GLORIOUS DIVINITY broke well to gain forward inside position into the first turn, then began to fight the
rider passing the seven-eighths pole and through the first turn, settled down for the run down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, steadied
near the furlong marker when put in tight by AMMARA and could not recover. FOREVER LOVELY was pushed to gain forward position from the break then
pulled hard when the rider attempted to temper the pace, was let loose passing the three-quarter pole, sprinted clear, held sway through the far turn was
overtaken near the quarter pole and wilted in the stretch.
