break pressed the pace dueling through the turn extending along the inside down the lane missing in a game effort. KAIYAS SONG chased the pace
looming into upper stretch surging late between horses to be right there on the wire. BEA BEA KAZ pressed the pace dueling through the turn battling from
the rail down the lane staying on to the end. FOREST ACCLAMATION veered in sharply checking at the break, chased the pace then tired in upper stretch.
ZIPPITY DAY in close at the break would fade on the turn. ARTISTIC ALIBI folded up on the turn. DON'T LOOK UP pressed early then gave way on the
