Footnotes
D' KITTEN led inside, drew off in the stretch and held sway under mild urging. EMPIRE SUNRISE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the eighth pole
but was no threat while gaining the place spot. MEAN ELENITA was unrushed inside, bid in the three path at the top of the stretch and gained the show late.
BICARB BETTY pressed the pace outside of the winner and gave way nearing the quarter pole. MYGALJUSTICE stalked the pace in the four path before
fading. TRIP CHARGE pressed the early pace between foes before fading. QUITE WHIMSICAL was not a factor.

Footnotes
SKYS IMAGE chased the two rival duel through the turn while along the inside, split rivals into the lane when gaining momentum, cleared outside the eighth
pole, widened to the sixteenth and lasted. GOODY FOUR SHOES trailed through the turn while along the inside into the lane, gained momentum quickly
through the final sixteenth while along the inside and was closing in. AJIC JAY in the two path through the turn when near the back came into the lane from
the two path, shifted to the four path inside the sixteenth pole and rallied. LEXI SUN vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, cleared in mid-turn then
yielded to the top ones while weakening. BEREA vied for the lead two wide into the far turn, lost some ground to the pacesetter in late turn then weakened.
PASSIONFORJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn then tired once straightened in the lane. BREAKUP WITH TITOS raced near
the back while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never factored.

Footnotes
LONG DAYS settled off the pace while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path, was asked for more outside the eighth
pole and came rolling past inside the sixteenth pole and was going away at the wire. CHARMING JAZEL raced along the inside through the turn when in
mid-pack, angled into the three or four path inside the eighth pole, looked to be a winner then was no match for the fast closing winner while settling for
second best. NO LACA CHARM set the pace through the turn while under pressure, cleared into the lane then yielded to the top two late. LUNA DIVA
pressed the pace two wide into the turn, continued in close proximity into the lane then weakened. WHEN'S FOREVER chased the pace from the three path
through mid-turn, was asked for more in late turn and tired through the lane. ROSAS FOR LUZ stumbled inwardly at the start, trailed through the turn and
into the lane then passed a couple tired ones. WHAT YOU WISHED never a factor while in the two path through the turn. SAME O SAME O was outrun
while in the three path through the t urn.

Footnotes
TIGER TAP raced in the two path when reserved into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn while between rivals, came into the lane from the five path,
gained momentum inside the eighth pole, caught the leader approaching the sixteenth pole and drove past. SKYVIEW DRIVE saved ground through the
turn when never far back, bid three wide into the lane, appeared to be moving to the lead approaching the sixteenth pole then passed by the winner then
stayed on to save the place spot. MS. LILIBET raced in the four path through the turns when in mid-pack, came four wide into the lane, settled in the six
path and moved up for the show spot. OGEMA BAY saved ground through the turns, came into the lane from the three path, angled back to the rail inside
the eighth pole and was gaining to the wire. EASTERN MARKET chased the pace while along the inside, bid into the lane, gained a short lead with an
eighth to go then could not sustain. ENGLISHED was in the three or four path through the turn when near the back, swung into the lane from the five or six
path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole, shifted into the eight path and moved up. FROTHY raced near the inside throughout and lacked a closing
response. STARLIT SOFI was in the five path down the backstretch and into the far turn then never factored. NO NO NO NEVER (IRE) was bumped and
put in tight at the start, trailed for three-quarters while in the two path and never was a menace. PEEPING set the pace while near the inside into the far turn
then retreated through the lane. ANGORA DEB chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more near the three-eighths pole and
was empty into the lane. GOLD OAK chased the top two into the turn while in the three path then had nothing to give after entering the lane.

Footnotes
LUCKIES JOY cleared at once, raced on a comfortable advantage through the turn while in the two path, entered the lane from the three path and widened
while being kept to the task. LAST OUTLAW was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and finished with
good energy for the place spot. ROCK THE RED was in the three or four path through the turn when keeping interest, came into the lane from the six path
and moved up. CASPER JUSTICE saved ground through the turn and into the lane and just missed the show spot. MARIACHI JUSTICE was in the two
path through the turn when well back, came into the lane from the three path, guided to the seven path inside the sixteenth pole and improved. FOREVER
LASTING chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and faded. MUSTY RED raced in the five to the four
path into and through mid-turn, moved to the inside into the lane and never was a factor. JENNY'S BEIGNET stumbled badly at the start and settled to the
back, raced near the inside into the lane and never made an impact. MYSTERY IMPACT never a factor while racing near the inside through the turn. BINGE
chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane and was empty. BUMPY chased the winner into the turn while in the two path then was
done in mid-turn.
