close up between rivals, could not keep up with the winner but ran on to be clearly second best. WARRIOR AT BAT tracked the early pace and made a
three wide bid on the turn to press the winner but weakened, held show award. WORK FROM HOME was settled early on the inside, two wide advance two
wide on the turn but lacked a late rally while just missing the show award. BIG SMILE hit the gate and stumbled breaking from the gate, then was four wide
by the quarter pole and had no rally. DRAMA KEY was bumped and then bobbled after the start, saved ground into the lane and had no rally. POLIE

TOURING MARYANNE set a pressured pace early on the inside, then dueled for the lead by the quarter pole, made a bid to shake clear off the turn, then
maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. STASSI was well placed on the inside, eased out and made a four wide bid off the turn, was
given one pop left handed with the crop but then seemed like crop got stuck and was not available and was given a vigorous hand ride late to be second
best. PACHELBEL was allowed to settle on the inside, saved ground on the turn and then finished well on the inside to gain the show award late. FREYDIS
pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command but could not keep pace in the lane, lost show award late. MORGANS COVE
chased the pace four to three wide but lacked the needed bid.

and swung out five wide leaving the turn and closed to get up in time to prove best under a drive. JACK SLYE set the pace on the inside, was well handled
and dug in gamely in the drive but was caught late to just fail. EL POLICIA was off slow, then advanced up the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn but
flattened out, bested rest. MONEYONTHELINE was settled early, advanced four wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane but could not sustain that
bid. STREET LAMP stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened. LONG TOM was reserved early and failed to manace.
