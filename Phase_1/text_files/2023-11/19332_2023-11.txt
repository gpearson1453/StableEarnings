Footnotes
GIRVIN'S PRINCESS tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and dueled in the lane to edge clear late.
LADY PROSPECT dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and dug in in the lane, giving way in late
stretch but keeping on to the finish. CARSONSTRONG raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
three path and improved position in the lane. LIVING IN STYLE bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to duel up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the turn and weakened in late stretch. DERBY GIFT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to race
in the two path around the bend and weakened in the final furlong. KHO KHO bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced off the pace through the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick. FLORINDIA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend, began a mild bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. R FASHIONABLY LATE hopped up and veered out leaving
the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and was never a factor.

CHARLOTTE THE BRIT saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and kicked clear
in the lane. SLIME QUEEN bumped soundly with the horse to her inside at the break, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack in the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground
steadily to the wire. STARRY HOPE raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend still in the three path,
launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. NICOLAR raced in the three path early, settled at the back of the pack on the outside from there,
came around the far turn in the two path and improved position in the stretch. INANNA'S QUEST was reluctant to load and fractious once in the gate,
bumped with the horses to either side at the start, saved ground around the first bend, raced in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. SHABAM bumped repeatedly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate,
settled at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the two path and improved position in the lane.
CHICA BOOM was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch and around the far turn in the middle of the
pack on the outside and was outkicked in the stretch. SING SCAT raced in the three path around the first bend, tracked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the lane. HIGH VIBES raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the inside
up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. SPECTACULAR GAL raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the stretch. DREAMING BIZ bumped

Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path,
launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to hold the win. BIRD'S EYE VIEW raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground quickly to the
wire, just missing. ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground
around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SANDY LANE KITTEN saved ground around the first bend, chased the
leader up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and kept on to the finish. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE saved ground early, led the way up the
backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and weakened in late stretch. BIG RED ROCKS stumbled mildly leaving the gate, recovered and
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and never threatened. ULTIMATE IRONY raced
in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two
path and showed no kick. OCEANS MAP raced in the middle of the pack between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the two path and made no bid. ERIC THE SALESMAN raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded from there. CHESS'S DREAM reared up leaving the gate, raced in the three path
around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, dropped further back while saving ground around the far bend and was not a factor. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE ELEVEN, CHESS'S DREAM, HAD A FAIR BEGINNING
AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
