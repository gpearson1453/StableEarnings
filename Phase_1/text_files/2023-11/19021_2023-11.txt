Footnotes
NATURE OFTHE BEAST sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace under pressure, turned back a strong bid from the runner up near the furlong
marker and proved best in a game effort under left handed urging. WHEN IN ROME was a forward factor from the start along the rail, lacked room on the
turn, shifted out five wide before the quarter pole, drew on even terms for the lead with the winner at the furlong marker then was denied. LEAVENWORTH
void of early speed, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. HEART OF AN ANGEL pressed the pace two wide into the stretch
then weakened. ANGEL'S SOUPERSTAR pressed the early pace three wide and was through after a half. LIGHTNING CASHES had speed from the start,
offered a mild bid four wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.

saved ground, rallied along the rail under right handed urging to make the lead past the sixteenth pole and just missed hanging on. LADY FORTUNE
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished while two wide. FABULOUS CLOWN trailed into the stretch,
swung wide, and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. PRICELESS PICTURE failed to menace. BODE'S ROSE offered a mild bid three wide
midway on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. MERE BAG OF SHELLS was a forward factor three wide into the stretch and faded late. BEAUTIFUL
LASS had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half.

right handed urging to make the lead past the furlong marker and widened rapidly to win as much the best. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR bore out at the
start bumping the winner, was unhurried, rallied four then three wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. HUNTER SCOTT set a pressured
pace along the inside for a half, gave up a narrow lead, came on again to regain a slight advantage along the rail in upper stretch then was outfinished.
OUTLIER unhurried while settling outside, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then weakened. STATESBORO pressed the pace two wide for
a half, gained a narrow advantage, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up. AYE AYE SIR pressed the pace for four and one half furlongs,
stopped abruptly on the far turn, was eased in upper stretch and walked off.

RAINBOW SHIP broke in full stride to set all the pace and drew off through the stretch under mild right handed urging. CROSSED UP stalked the pace
three wide, had a mild late rally while drifting to the eight path and finished clear for second. HIGH FIRE slow early, swung wide and found her best stride
late while angled in from the seven to the four path. APPEALING SENORITA chased the winner down the backstretch, moved closer two wide on the turn
then came up empty. TWERK failed to menace. POWER BANKER close up along the inside early, was through after a half. SOLE FACTOR had good early
speed five wide and gave way in the stretch. PENNY SHOTS stumbled at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
O SHAUGHESEY pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run under right handed urging to win
going away in the six path. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD saved ground through the turn, altered course to the eighth path at the top of the stretch then rallied
for second. LADY LOTTIE unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the nine path through the stretch. MUSICMANSANDY hopped at the start,
stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT was no factor. SHEZ SHACKED UP
away alertly, set the pace along the inside for a half then gave way. CAUSE OF LOVE trailed.
