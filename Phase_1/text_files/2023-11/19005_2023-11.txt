Footnotes
NEVERPOPTHECORK saved early ground then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased outward toward mid-stretch and
dug in to get up the final yards. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT took a quick slim lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn, but was caught flattening stride in the final yards. HARDLY EVER
BETTER stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened leaving the eighth pole. MAKIN'
GOLD stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened.
HAZEDNCONFUSED raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. JAZZ WITH DENIS raced off the rail the first
turn, proved to be no factor and was eased.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S THRILL settled toward the inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved two deep on the far turn, took the nod leaving the turn and
dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage through the stretch. MR HOOVER rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole
and raced at the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod leaving the turn but dug in gamely to the finish. MOON OVER MONTANA saved early ground, bid
leaving the half mile pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and dug in to clear third later yards. MAKE WAY stalked the early pace, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then flattened late stretch. MONGOLIAN HERO settled inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. ROYAL CRUSADER raced off the pace about the four path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and weakened in the five path of the far turn. PRACTICALLY THERE raced in the four and five path the first two turns and showed little
response through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Curlin's Thrill for alleged interference leaving the
far turn, lodged by the rider of Mr Hoover.

Footnotes
KASIMBA rated close toward the inside, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead passing the five sixteenths, cleared Fast Forward
two deep midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold off LUNAR MISSION, while the latter settled back inside on the first turn, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. RUM CUP became fractious in the gate
then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced two deep on the far turn and came along to take third past the eighth pole.
TEMPESTIVO raced two deep on the first turn and left the turn outside, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five
path and showed little more. FAST FORWARD closed to a slim lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met past the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. GETTIN SPICY stalked the early
pace in the three path then moved to the inside midway on the opening turn and showed little response. KNOWWHATIMEAN came away awkwardly and
steadied leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.

raced clear into the stretch and steadily increased his lead the final sixteenth. RAD PAISLEY stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and dueled through later yards for second. SCOTTSDALE rated a
short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back entering the stretch and
relented in the later duel for second. MARTINKELLY raced off the rail on the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, gave chase approaching the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. FEARNOUGHT saved ground and showed little response. CLASSY

VAGABOND VIRGIN settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn,
was bumped off stride passing the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to edge ahead of the runner-up late yards. REY O REYES angled in approaching the
mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but ducked out and made sharp contact
with Vagabond Virgin passing the eighth pole, dug in to that one from that point but succumbed inside the sixteenth pole. O'RIGSBY settled off the rail early,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third late yards. SUMMONING DENIS steadied off the
inside flank of Leg Up into the first turn then settled back in the four and five paths, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the five path on
the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS raced off the rail early, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and showed little in the lane. LEG UP was forced in approaching the mile pole then stalked inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE rated close to the early pace inside and rounded the second turn about the three
path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn. S S SPARTAN ENERGY was not a factor. CHASE LIL ME raced in the
six path early and never factored. MY BUDDY DUANE saved ground well off the pace and faded leaving the half mile pole. The Steward reviewed then
rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Rey O Reyes for alleged interference in the vicinity of the mile pole, lodged by the rider of Summoning Denis.

Footnotes
STORMI VANNA rated close inside through the backstretch, eased to the three path with a bid leaving the quarter pole, dug in from the head of the lane, got
up later yards and widened approaching the wire. LIME STAR gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in from the eighth
pole, eased out late and took second under the wire. MIRACLE SONDE had a brief early lead then pressured the pace and took the lead passing the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail but was met while flattening stride later yards. VIESTE gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and
could only improve her position. VERITAS LUX MEA chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. JUST ASK ME took the
lead toward the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured early pace, but was met at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole and weakened. BIT OF
BLESSINGS became fractious in the gate, fell leaving the gate but got up and walked off post race. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race before
declaring it official.
