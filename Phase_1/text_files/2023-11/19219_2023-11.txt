Footnotes
CARICIA was roused from inside after the first quarter mile, angled two wide upper stretch and got up in time. TINA'S TAPIZAR soon shared the lead
outside TENSE, moved clear into the bend, widened command in the lane but began to wear down inside the final furlong. BLAZE BEAUTY was boxed in
on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide through the bend and rallied deep stretch to gain third. TENSE displayed early speed from inside, angled
outside TINA'S TAPIZAR on the turn and gradually wore down for the drive. HER SPEAKER'S ON soon trailed, angled in on the bend, gradually angled out
upper stretch, improved position then leveled off. GABRIELLA ATTACK chased while toward the outside, came widest into the stretch and had no late bid.
FREEDOM ATTACK in contention early began to yield three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
MUD HUT soon shared the lead outside HALLIE'S RAINBOW, battled in the lane and edged ahead late. HALLIE'S RAINBOW broke on top, was soon
challenged from outside, fought gamely in the stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. CAT TALE BREEZE raced in contention between
rivals from the beginning, was three wide through the bend, angled out some for a clear path upper stretch, moved clear for third, could only make up minor
ground on the top pair deep stretch and narrowly held third. ZENCHUA SKY progressed four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning six wide for the
stretch run, closed well but was too late. SENORITA AURORA chased from outside, began her bid two wide on the bend, advanced to midstretch then also
could only make up minor ground in the late going. NIFF bumped with SANGFROID shortly after the break, was widest taking the turn then passed outside
tired ones in the stretch. SANGFROID squeezed between horses shortly after the start, was an early factor but began to fade along the rail on the turn.
DRAGONFLY KISSES also bumped with SANGFROID shortly after the start, saved ground taking the bend and had no late bid. LORI ATTACK raced in
contention on the backstretch but faded three wide on the turn. LUNARCHY soon overcame an awkward start to be prominent just outside the early speed
but quit between rivals through the stretch.

FOLLOW THE SIGNS was settled off the early speed, commenced his bid from outside on the bend, came into the lane from path six, rallied and edged
ahead of TAPIT SAM in the waning yards. TAPIT SAM prominent from the early going, progressed along the rail through the turn, took the lead inside the
last eighth, drifted out with a sixteenth left, held a straight path with seventy yards to go but was outfinished. STOSH bumped at the start, was without early
speed, just off the inside on the bend, was blocked behind a rival upper stretch, gained a clear path two wide inside the sixteenth marker and caught
SIRCORRI for third. SIRCORRI disputed the pace from outside, was four wide through the turn and gradually wore down deep stretch. W W RUSSIAN
GOLD chased in midpack, lost considerable ground six wide taking the bend then showed a willingness to run the last furlong. PACHI bounced off
KANITHAPPEN at the break then into STOSH, quickly recovered to vie for the lead inside rivals, was just off the rail on the turn, fanned out some for the
drive and began to wear down between horses inside the final eighth. FLASHY RICHIE without early speed, saved ground through the bend then surged
belatedly inside the last furlong. KANITHAPPEN bumped at the start, was prominent early, found himself boxed in on the turn, was steadied behind traffic
with two furlongs to go, altered in some, floated back to path three midstretch and gradually yielded. TEA AFTER BALLET soon trailed, was just off the rail
taking the bend, angled out some for the drive and failed to have a significant bid. GREAT PLAINES displayed early speed between rivals for a half mile
then gave way.

Footnotes
LIFE OF SATURDAYS set the pace from inside, moved clear in the lane, began to wear down deep stretch but held on. BEIRUT BEAUTY pressed LIFE OF
SATURDAYS from just outside, drifted out to path four entering the stretch, drifted out again in the waning yards and came up short for the win. PALACE
MAGIC drew clear for third from path three on the bend and rallied belatedly inside the final furlong. WAR COLORS hesitated at the break, began to
progress two wide on the turn, fanned out behind BEIRUT BEAUTY for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. TEMPLUNA chased four or five
wide and lacked a significant stretch bid. LINDALOUIMAGE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. SUPERTRIX hesitated then bumped solidly with DIXIE
LOVING at the break and was never a factor in a wide trip. DIXIE LOVING also hesitated at the start, bumped solidly with SUPERTRIX, angled in some
nearing the bend and also had little to offer for the drive. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly but bobbled a couple strides from the gate, was soon chasing
others from outside and faded two wide on the turn. HIDDEN FIGURE a bit unruly in the gate, was an early factor but gave way three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME rated on the front end just outside BOURBON DELIGHT, moved clear when asked leaving the quarter pole, gradually drifted out as he
drew off under left-handed pressure in the lane and proved much the best. ZARMAE well back early while just off the inside, swung out five wide making his
bid on the second bend, battled from outside for second in the lane and got the nod for the place at the wire. STORM BORN was also without early speed,
picked up his pace after a half mile, was three wide on the second turn, angled in some for the stretch run, fought for second, was narrowly outfinished in a
game effort but easily best of the others. BOURBON DELIGHT was hustled up to the early lead, was challenged from outside on the backstretch, had the
rail on the second bend, did not stay with ONE WAY HOME leaving that turn, swung outside the latter entering the lane and began to flatten out. ORBITAL
STARR soon trailed from along the rail, angled out on the second turn, was steadied behind traffic with two furlongs to go, swung out six wide for a clear
path into the stretch and passed tired ones. COPPER CROSSING well placed from inside, angled out some on the second bend, came into the lane four
wide and faded. CAMPAIGN SPY gradually retreated along the rail and second turn, came off the inside some for the drive, lacked a significant response
and bumped with CHERNYAHOVSKIY deep stretch. CHERNYAHOVSKIY chased from between rivals, advanced along the rail on the second turn, gave
way in the lane and bumped with CAMPAIGN SPY in the late going. CAMARGO pressed the early leaders from just outside but gave way four wide on the
second bend. TRIPLE CHROME chased from between rivals, was two to four wide taking the second turn then quit.

progressed along the rail on the second bend, angled out to path four at the top of the lane and took over second with seventy yards left. MERLOTTI
squeezed between rivals briefly at the start, came into contention four wide on the backstretch, went for the lead just outside PAYNT BY LETTERS on the
second turn, was no match for that one in the stretch and began to wear down the final sixteenth. DIAMND CON SUERTE reluctant to load, chased from
path three, tried to split rivals at the quarter pole, jostled with SMILE LIKE KYLE, was steadied, gained a clear path behind MERLOTTI into the stretch,
improved position some, angled in inside the last furlong and leveled off. CHARLIE'S BEACH bumped with MERLOTTI at the start, soon trailed, picked up
his pace after a half mile, lost ground four to six wide taking the second turn and advanced without threatening in the lane. UH OH IT'S MAGIC chased from
inside, angled out some on the second bend, swung out seven wide for the stretch run and lacked a significant bid. SMILE LIKE KYLE gradually advanced
from outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn, jostled with DIAMND CON SUERTE when that one tried to squeeze through inside the
latter, fanned out some for the drive and faded. MINNESOTA MOON prompted the early pace, was two wide on the second bend, brushed from the rear by
DIAMND CON SUERTE with two furlongs left and gave way through the stretch. KRUELESS displayed brief speed from inside, quit after a half mile,
distanced himself from the field through the stretch and walked off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was a step slow then bumped at the break, settled just off the inside, gradually advanced once on the backstretch, angled
inside ARROW STRIKE midway on the second bend, bumped with that one as he squeezed through two wide at the quarter pole, had the lead into the lane,
drifted out approaching the furlong marker, was straightened and maintained full control. ARROW STRIKE advanced from outside on the backstretch,
angled in between rivals after a half mile, reached contention two wide on the second turn, was crowded and forced out some leaving the quarter pole then
pulled ahead for second deep stretch. SANTINO'S FANTASY fractious in the gate, broke on top, was soon chasing others, went for the two wide on the
second bend, floated out to path four into the lane and gradually yielded. MAC PANDOWDY bumped with PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN shortly after the start,
raced in contention toward the outside, made his bid outside SANTINO'S FANTASY on the second turn, flattened out for the drive but was easily best of the
others. LONESOME DREAM moved clear on the backstretch but began to tire along the rail before finishing six furlongs. DEVIL'S RULE chased from
between horses, was four to six wide through the second bend and had no late bid. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was squeezed between rivals shortly after the
start, checked back and was never a factor. LASTFORTINOFAMILY broke inward, bumping ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, chased from outside, advanced
five wide on the second turn, angled in entering the lane and did not sustain his bid. BRIANS WAY faded from inside on the backstretch, came off the rail
some on the second turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. SWISS GUARD displayed brief speed from inside then gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
AVIANO gradually progressed inside rivals, came into contention along the rail on the second bend, angled out nearing the end of six furlongs, came five
wide into the lane, engaged TRY TRY AGAIN, slowly drifted out as he battled on even terms then edged ahead in the waning yards. TRY TRY AGAIN vied
for the early lead between horses, moved ahead on the second turn, floated out some as he came into the stretch, was challenged from outside, also
gradually drifted out as he fought to hold on inside the last furlong and did not have enough left near the wire. IRISH DECLARATION well back from inside,
came off the rail some entering the lane, surged three wide in traffic and came up a bit short. CHICKS FOR FREE also without early speed, was just off the
rail on the second bend, fanned four wide into the lane, made a strong move and angled in deep stretch as he closed on the leaders. TONYS MORNING
LINE chased from well off the inside, lost ground five wide on the second turn, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the final furlong and also closed
well. SEMINOLE BEACH prominent just outside TRY TR AGAIN, weakened deep stretch. RIGHT ON RICHIE displayed early speed from inside, did not
stay with TRY TRY AGAIN on the second bend, angled out some, continued to yield as he came into the lane from path three, lugged in nearing the eighth
pole, was steadied, altered out, was steadied again to avoid IRISH DECLARATION and faded from just of the inside. TWO COOKIE RULE chased from
outside, had the rail on the second turn, rallied leaving that bend, was steadied when his path was compromised at the eighth pole and yielded soon after.
WILDWOOD MINISTRY chased from path three, angled out through the second bend and gave way six wide for the drive. BABA'S BOY forwardly placed
inside, angled out on the second turn and gave way from between rivals in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEZ STUCK UP was kept close outside the early speed, went for the lead from path three leaving the bend, moved clear upper stretch, widened
command inside the final furlong and kept GO MADI GO at bay under steady handling. GO MADI GO was steadied briefly when his path was taken nearing
the bend, angled out on the turn, came widest into the lane, was bumped midstretch, rallied belatedly the final furlong but was clearly second best. AROSE
FOR LYLA chased from just off the inside, was two wide through the bend and found best stride too late the last eighth. SAY CHEESE chased from outside,
closed the gap some four wide on the turn, drifted out midstretch, bumped GO MADI GO and finished evenly. ICY RIVER broke on top, moved clear after
the first furlong, saved ground taking the bend, was overtaken upper stretch and flattened out the last furlong. RACEDAY ATTIRE moved up to contention
along the rail on the turn but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
CREEKMORE bumped with MARY'S BOY at the start, shared the lead between rivals, moved clear on the bend, angled in some nearing the end of a half
mile, was two wide into the lane and drew off inside the final furlong. D' YANK chased from off the rail, lost ground five wide through the turn, rallied the last
eighth and got up for third. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY vied for the early lead between horses, did not keep up two wide on the bend, angled outside
CREEKMORE nearing the quarter pole and ran evenly through the stretch. SHANGHAI POINT prominent from just off the inside, advanced along the rail on
the turn, threatened midstretch, was no match for CREEKMORE inside the final eighth and weakened in the late going. JACK VAN BERG dwelt at the start,
quickly recovered to vie for the lead from outside but began to yield four wide on the bend. MARY'S BOY bumped with CREEKMORE at the break, soon
trailed, was just off the rail on the turn, swung to the outside for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. BLAZEN ROAD in contention early, failed
to stay close four wide on the bend and had no late bid. U S HONOUR NAP well placed inside on the backstretch, gave way on the turn.
