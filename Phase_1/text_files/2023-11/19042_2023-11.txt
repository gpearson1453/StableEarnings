Footnotes
SLAMMIN GOLD followed the leader on the outside, gained in the three path on the turn, took over in the four path into upper stretch and drew away while
kept to the task. LIBERTY CENTRAL was a bit reluctant to load then broke a half-step slow, settled under some urging, came under stronger
encouragement in the four path on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and secured the place. COLLECTED SPECIAL showed speed then
chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, drifted out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show.
MALIBU MARGARITA was forced out at the start and off a half-step slow, raced on the outside while ridden along, dropped from the four path to the rail
early on the turn, angled back to the four path near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into upper stretch, moved in around the furlong marker, dropped
further in near the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show. PRICE IS TRUTH broke in but was corrected very quickly by the rider then hustled to the front,
showed the way with a clear advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper
stretch and tired. SAVAGE SPIRIT was fractious coming onto the track for post parade then also reluctant to load, dropped to the rear, traveled around the
turn in the two path and was no factor. SORORITY PRANK dropped back off the pace, climbed into the kickback while moving out around the
nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
LORD GATLING coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide into the first turn showing the way, tucked to the two path midway, settled in hand just off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths when HANG TIGHT advanced and placed that rival in tight encouraging him to back
off, remained along the inside through the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held
safe to prevail. HANG TIGHT chased along the inside, was given some rein to work with and advanced along an open rail to latch on the leader near the
nine-sixteenths, had that rival come inwards and was forced to briefly steady when put in tight at that station losing about two lengths of position and ground,
came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place
honors. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. GOLDINI hustled from the start, chased two to three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung three wide into
upper stretch and weakened. DATESFREEDOM four then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, tipped four wide for home, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANGELAS PARTY GIRL went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage
coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when shaken up in upper stretch, drew off under one tap of the crop into the final furlong and proved much the
best under a strong hand-ride to the finish. JUST A NYQUIST settled off the pace, was urged between foes in the two path early on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place. ACCEL ROSE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped
back coming to the quarter-pole and tired while best of the rest. SWEET AS SUGAR settled off the pace, was urged along inside foes while along the rail
early on the turn, dropped back near the three-eighths pole, shifted to the three path in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SIMPLE
SUGAR settled off the pace, was urged between rivals in the three path early on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and capitulated.
SYNONYMOUS dropped back quickly while showing no speed, was urged at the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. LUNA LOCA was
hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
LET IT RIDE two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under
a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. JUST CALL RAY coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick. FORCED RANKING showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under coaxing under challenge just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front
near the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. LEDDY coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the last major share. BEZOS chased just off the inside early on,
tipped to the five path with nine-sixteenths to go, continued five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and tired. REGISTER chased along the inside, balked in a little tight along the fence with six furlongs to go flinching slightly from the rail, came under
coaxing still along the inside at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. LAFITTE'S FLEET grew unsettled in the gate and was
backed out and reloaded, chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, chased just off the inside through the turn
and then three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC PRICING (IRE) was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging with three furlongs
to run, went around the far turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, chased the runner-up while swapping leads back and forth in the drive and
surged late to get up in the final stride. WAY TO BE MARIE tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the
lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear outside the furlong marker, led until the final stride but was denied. KATHERINE THOMAS settled on the
inside, was asked on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. JUST JULES went to the
front, showed the way on the inside with a clear advantage, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter-pole, dropped back
into the final furlong and weakened. JUST MUSIC bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked in the
two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HOLLYWOOD DREAM was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved
ground towards the rear and failed to threaten. DAY AWAY saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn and
failed to respond. STYLE POINTS broke in at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths,
traveled around the far turn in the two path and also failed to respond. PUBLIC ASSEMBLY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three
wide on the turns and never reached contention. Z TRAIN (IRE) rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn
and also was no factor. CHANNEL LOOP bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, moved off the rail late on the far turn and showed little.
THAT'STHEFACTJACK went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, traveled three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PLEASE ADVISE chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths,
took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied along the inside behind the leader through to the sixteenth marker, tipped out just inside that station forcing
SPLIT STRIKE to pause and brush APOLLO TEN, then surged late to get up in the final jumps to the wire. IRISH GENT (IRE) coaxed from the gate, chased
four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and missed at the end getting up for
the place honors. WORKS FOR ME broke in at the start trading a bump with GET SPOOLED who broke outwards, cut the pace under pressure from a pair
while along the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, then got caught in the final jumps by a
pair and was forced to settle for the show honors. APOLLO TEN chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, got set down angled three wide into
upper stretch, got brushed just inside the sixteenth marker and offered up a mild bid. SPLIT STRIKE prompted the pace just off the inside between foes
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent to inside the eighth pole, began to
back away when forced to pause and brush with APOLLO TEN just inside the sixteenth marker as the eventual winner tipped off the inside, then continued
to weaken in the late going. GET SPOOLED broke out at the start trading a bump with WORKS FOR ME, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. RUDDY BUDDY coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. DILGER (IRE) broke a beat slow and got taken in hand when he lost his lane to a pair of rivals who broke towards one another exchanging a
bump directly in front, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
WOKE UP QUICK hustled from the gate, prompted the pace outside a pair four then three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped four
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY dueled early on from the four path with the runner up to his inside, eased off that foe when THRILL OF IT advanced inside and tracked
that pair into the far turn, advanced tucked three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung six wide into upper stretch,
seized command at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS dueled from the two path with MAKER'S CANDY
through to the five-eighths when that rival backed off and was confronted by THRILL OF IT to his inside, knocked heads with that rival through the turn and
had the aforementioned advance once more three furlongs out and took back narrow command between foes, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to run, dug in under a drive and held for the place honors
over a late running rival. COLLOQUY hustled from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and kept on to miss for the place honors. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. THRILL OF IT coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside early on before
advancing to duel with PRONCE OF PHAROAHS from the five furlong marker, knocked heads through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MASON MANIA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, angled
five wide into upper stretch and tired. WILD BANKER two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TOUPIE left the gate in good order, was rated just off the pace, came under a vigorous hold while just behind the leader from the nine-sixteenths into the
turn, drafted along the rail on that bend, was shuffled back some behind the tiring pacesetter near the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path outside the
quarter-pole, angled out while put to a drive in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper
lead, closed well to get the advantage near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady handling. MARCO T. brushed the outside of the gate at the
start, settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved in while gaining in the final furlong and finished with
good energy for the place. GREAVETTE stalked the pace, made a bid with a half-mile to run, took the lead in the three path at the three-eighths pole,
dropped to the two path later on that bend, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth-pole and
weakened but just held the show. SHOP LIFTING came outward at the start, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and improved to just miss the show. EVER SO SWEET (IRE) was forwardly placed on the far outside, went four wide while asked
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. CAMILA T (IRE) was rated just off the pace, came under urging
while two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. GRAM settled off the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, was taken in hand inside the
three-eighths pole, dropped to the rail late on the bend, moved out while asked for her best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SHE'S FIRE
settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. NICKY JOLENE was urged along towards the
front, chased three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty. ROSIE JEEKS settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. LOVE TO EAT was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged inside
on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths pole, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and capitulated.
