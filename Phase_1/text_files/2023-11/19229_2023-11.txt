Footnotes
LESLIE'S ROSE broke very fast and went straight to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, spun three wide into
the stretch, responded when asked near the three-sixteenths then kicked clear quickly, powered away under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then
was eased up while much the best. VALUE AREA bumped with a rival at the start and was taken in hand while last away, angled out inside the
three-quarter pole, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and earned the place while no
match for the winner. SHOP LIFTING was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and weakened while clear for the show. KINGDOM COME bumped with a rival at the start, moved up under urging then was well
placed just off the pace, shifted from the rail to the three path on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. WOVEN RED was
hustled from the gate then ridden along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. OROZIMBA
was carried out inside the three-quarter pole then urged along on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SCORING CHANCE broke out at the start bumping and pinching back FOXY CARA in tandem with KRYSTALHEIR, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch and then along the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and nudged MONETARY MONARCH straightened away
looking for a clear path, got it when EASTERN STAR drifted more towards the rail just inside the three-sixteenths and came on through the seam to take
command a furlong out, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. MONETARY MONARCH chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got nudged swinging three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to just procure the place honors.
EASTERN STAR showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, proved no match for that rival, kept on to just preserve the show
honors on the wire. FOXY CARA got bumped between foes at the start and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, advanced four then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and kept on under a drive but was just bested by a pair on the wire. RUN CHATA brushed the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide and was
steadied briefly near the three-eighths appearing to be in tight prior to angling back four wide, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.
KRYSTALHEIR came in just after the initial jump at the start and bumped and pinched back FOXY CARA in tandem with SCORING CHANCE, chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AGGREGATION went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when asked near
the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. JUST CALL RAY was hustled from the gate then well placed
just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn and secured the place while no match for the winner. BENDOOG hit the inside of the gate and was off a
step slow, settled on the outside, lugged in slightly late on the backstretch, was asked four wide on the turn, lugged inward in the stretch and lacked the
needed response. DADDY KNOWS attended the pace on the far outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, turned
into upper stretch between horses and came up empty. FROMANOTHAMUTHA settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHILI FLAG (FR) angled in quickly and carried several foes in, saved ground while well placed just off the pace, came out in front of rivals while roused into
upper stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling. TASS went
around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, pursued the
leader in the stretch and finished with good courage for the place. UNCORKED (AUS) saved ground on the first turn, settled near the rear, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path, found her best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to just miss the
place while up for the show. WILLAKIA was carried in early then dropped back in tight quarters, angled from the two path to the four path on the first turn,
settled off the pace, went three then two wide on the far turn, steadied briefly near the three-sixteenths, was roused for her best outside the furlong marker,
gained between horses late and finished willingly. REGAL REALM went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader on
the far turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, led under a drive until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken. CIGAMIA was carried in early, went two
then three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside without cover, came under urging in the three then four path on the far turn and lacked the
needed kick. FAITH IN HUMANITY (FR) showed early speed, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, vied
inside on the far turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. MALAVATH (IRE) was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside, was urged along
late on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and failed to respond. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF WILLAKIA CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
BUNTY WINDERMERE three wide just off the duel, advanced to take command nearing the quarter pole and swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, began to shorten stride and grow leg weary inside the final sixteenth and held on to score. ROJA LIGERA
broke out a step at the start, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive gaining up
the rail and surging late and missed at the end. TRY IT AGAIN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. WILLFUL DESIRE dueled inside of WARTAPPED coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outfinished in the late going.
BERN ROSEY BERN bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and was outkicked. CUPIDS GIRL chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. U SHOULD B DANCING chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made
no impact. WARTAPPED dueled from the two path with WILLFUL DESIRE to the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got shaken off and
floated four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SPOOKY LADY went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, dueled
inside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. SUPERS LUCKY LADY stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid
on the far turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, dueled outside of the winner to the finish and missed while just able to get the place.
LINARITE settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out, drifted out under a left-handed crop
outside the furlong marker then was straightened and finished with good energy to just miss the place. SAIL WITH THE WIND went three wide on the first
turn, settled just off the pace, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased the leading duo into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished
well. DISRUPTION was rated on the inside, came a bit off the inside on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. SARATOGA KISSES broke a step slow, went around the turns in the two path and failed to rally. CAN'T FOOL ME moved in early, settled on the
inside, saved ground into the stretch and also failed to rally. DREAM ROAD went two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch then moved
out and failed to threaten. LADY OF THOROTON was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, had the rider fall back in the saddle leaving the chute,
tossed her head while taken up a couple times in the three then four path on the first turn, settled on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, came six
wide into the stretch and was no factor. MARY KATHERINE broke in at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked
three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CHARISSE broke a step slow, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the
turns and showed little. FROSTY INVASION was restless in the gate, went three to four wide on the turns and faltered then was vanned off after the race.
