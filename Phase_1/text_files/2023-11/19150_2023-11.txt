Footnotes
CLUCK CLUCK was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside while pressured, kicked clear leaving the turn and then remained clear to prove best
under a mild drive. LITTLE CRYBABY was taken back early, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane, shifted out to finish well on the outside
to be clearly second best. AT FIRST SIGHT pressed the winner three deep, then was ridden along by the five sixteenths marker two wide, came three wide
into the lane and faded in the drive, held show award. SHEHERHERS stumbled at the break, chased the pace two wide, came three wide into the lane,
shifted in and had a mild late kick towards the inside. IRISH RAGE tracked the early pace from between rivals, two wide on the turn and made a mild bid off
the turn but flattened out late. DENNISON GIRLS was well placed on the inside and weakened in the drive. JUST THE THING prompted the pace four wide
and then was empty.

best, driving. EVENLY DIVIDED was rated along the inside, two wide off the turn and was blocked, angled out for racing room and rallied well but was
outfinished by the winner while getting the nod for the place award. C C GOLDRUSH pressed the early pace three wide, then fell off the front leaving the
turn, then made a bid between rivals leaving the furlong marker and was outfinished late, lost bob for the p;lace award. MONCRIEF set a pressured pace
early on the inside, made a bid to shake clear off the turn, still lead by the sixteenth marker but faded late. DUCKPINS chased the early pace from between
rivals, then was in traffic and lacked room by leaving the quarter pole and to the furlong marker, angled out for racing room and had a late rally. REAP
WHAT YOU SOW was reserved early, two wide off the turn and was blocked in the stretch and tacked out nearing the sixteenth marker and finished well
late. HAMPDEN LANE tracked the pace on the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid. STRONG FINISH chased the pace four to three wide and had no

Footnotes
CORACLE was rated two wide and bumped by the half mile marker, then tipped out and made a four wide bid off the turn, tried to lug in and was hand
ridden to the furlong marker, then went on even terms for command and given one pop right handed and drew clear to prove best. MAYFLY tracked the
early pace four wide, made a three wide bid off the turn and kept on but needed more. ARIEL MOON tracked the pace on the inside, made a inside bid off
the turn but needed more late, held show award. BLUE TRILLION was settled on the inside, angled out by the furlong marker and had a late kick to just
miss the show award. DONATE LIFE set the early pace and shook clear on the turn on the inside, then was headed and faded in the final furlong.
FOREVER MIA was settled early, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no kick. MY SUGAR BOO passed the tiring rivals.
OUTFACTORED was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally. RUE CAMBON was settled three wide, steadied slightly around the three eighths marker
and had no rally. SPENCER TIARA failed to menace. VAI GATTINA was squeezed back at the start, failed to menace. SHARMIN showed good early speed
three wide and then was bumped around the half mile marker and got out on the turn and stopped. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY into the running into
the far turn and after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
MATOULA set the early pace on the inside, then was pressured on the turn, then kicked away leaving the turn and drew off in the drive to prove much the
best while being wrapped up. TRUE BLUE PEARL was bumped and in tight after the start, rushed up between rivals and made a two wide bid on the turn to
press the winner, proved to be no match for that rival. while staying on to be clearly second best. SWEET TALIA tracked the early pace four wide, came six
wide into the lane and was along for the show award. CHICA RABIOSA chased the pace on the inside, eased out and came three wide off the turn but
flattened out in the drive. RAISE YOUR GAME was settled early, between rivals on the turn and came three wide off the turn and had no kick. CONGRESS
HALL was bumped at the start and squeezed back, four wide on the turn and then angled out wide in the lane and improved late. CAGED PIXIE stalked the
pace three wide and weakened. SNEAKY CHEEKY was settled early, saved ground on the turn and angled out off the turn and was empty. FORTUNATA
ITALIA tracked the pace five wide and tired.
