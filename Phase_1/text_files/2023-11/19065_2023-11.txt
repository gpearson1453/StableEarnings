Footnotes
RED SUN DRESS laid off the pace in the three path, ranged up in the four path around the far turn, swept to the lead turning into the stretch, and was
driven clear. TOURIST STYLE broke out bumping an outer foe, rated inside, tipped out to the six path going into the far turn, fanned out to the eight path
into the stretch, and kept on for place. SPANISH GIRL got bumped at the start by an inner foe, tracked in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn,
angled out to the six path turning into the lane, and finished evenly on her left lead for show. WONDERFULVENEZUELA chased in the two path, tipped to
the rail under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened. DREAMY broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked in the five path, bid in the four path around
the far turn, but faded from the five path in the stretch. MAELSTROM SPIRIT got pinched at the start, trailed in the three path, and did not factor in from the
six path in the stretch. FUMBLEROOSKI raced up close along the inside, vied for the lead midway down the backstretch, but gaveway from the rail around
the far turn. CAJUN ANTHEM had an awkward start, led from the three path into the backstretch, vied with an inner foe midway down the backstretch, was
roused while shifting inside early into the far turn, but faded from the three path down the lane.

Footnotes
NEOGEM bumped CHAINA at the start, saved ground off the pace, circled five wide around the far turn, took over in midstretch and drove clear. CONFER
stalked the pace two wide between foes, bid three wide between foes rounding the far turn, led near the quarter pole, battled inside of the winner through
midstretch and lasted for the place. GRANDMA'S PUDDING settled off the pace while racing two and three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and
rallied for the show. CHAINA was bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and weakened in the stretch. R AWESOME SAUCE stalked the pace
from the rail and lacked the needed rally. KILKENNY BELLA pressed the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. NEVER SO
LUCKY (IRE) trailed in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
JULIET'S ROSE prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the five path turning into the stretch, took the lead before the eighth pole, and was driven clear.
ABBY'S PLAID set the pace in the three path, shifted to the rail going into the turn, was cued passing the quarter, lost the lead to the eventual winner
nearing the eighth pole, began to fade in the final furlong, but held place. MILLIE JEAN stalked in the five path, was driven in the six path turning into the
stretch, and kept on for show. VIBING raced off the pace inside, floated out around the turn, was in the eight path at the top of the lane, but made no impact.
DIVINE tracked in the six path, but flattened in the seven path down the lane. CERCHI chased between foes in the two path early but did not threaten.
SILLY LILY trailed in the three path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
MAKE DECISIONS raced off the pace four wide, made good progress four wide around the far turn, struck the front in midstretch and edged ahead under a
drive. MANNIX (IRE) stalked the pace two wide, bid inside of foes in upper stretch, vied inside of the winner through much of the stretch but was outfinished.
MONTANA MAN tracked the pace three wide, bid three deep rounding the far turn, led near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was
no match for the top two. EMBER was sluggish at the start, trailed inside, advanced five wide around the far turn and evened out late to miss the show.
GONNA BE EPIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide. FORTY FLASH dueled three wide and faltered in the stretch. KEANU set the pace in
the two path, steadied entering the far turn, chased inside around that bend, angled four wide near the quarter pole and had no further bids. EMERGENCY
RESPONSE was hard held inside and had no response when roused.

Footnotes
GOATS ON A TREE rated in the three path, was roused in the five path early into the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and
rallied past an inner foe in the closing stages. MAJESTIC VENEZUELA chased in the four path, ranged up in the six path around the far turn, bid passing
the quarter, swept to the lead and kicked away from the four path in upper stretch, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. SPUNFORFUN laid off the
pace in the five path, was driven in the six path around the far turn, angled into the three path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. SADIE THE GOAT
stalked in the three path, was under coaxing in the two path around the far turn, but was one paced in the stretch. JOYFUL LASS prompted the pace in the
five path, bid under a drive in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, but faded. A PALACE FOR MOM raced off the
pace in the six path, was coaxed from the seven path into the far turn, fanned out to the ten path into the stretch, and did not factor. THE MYTH had to
check midway around the first turn, pressed the pacesetter in the four path, bid under a ride in the three path early around the far turn, but yielded entering
the stretch. FLOWER MOUND set the pace in the three path, tipped to the rail going into the far turn, but gaveway at the top of the lane. BROKEN BANKER
tracked in the two path but backed up from the rail early around the far turn. MY GIRLSTORMY raced wellback along the rail and never menaced.
RAVENNA always trailed from the three to five paths.

Footnotes
ETERNAL FLAME pressed the pace from the rail, took over midway around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. FORT
ATTITUDE stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner in the lane. SHASTREE hit the starting gate,
trailed outside, made progress five wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the show. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY chased the
pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. NATURE BOY broke awkwardly and slowly, saved ground and never threatened. FEDERAL EXCHANGE
failed to menace while racing three wide. MAJOR KING chased the pace four wide and was through after half. GRAND MACALLAN set the early pace two
wide and retreated after three furlongs.
