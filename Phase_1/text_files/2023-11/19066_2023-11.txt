Footnotes
STORM TRAPPE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in mid stretch, drifted out late and lasted. WHERE IS MIKE , four wide
around the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. KBCYA LATER sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, finished willingly
and switched leads twice in the drive. PICO D'ORO , lacked speed, was caught behind several horses in upper stretch, swung to the far outside near the
sixteenth pole and rallied. SCIENCE (IRE) raced in the two path between horses around the turn, remained between foes in the stretch and flattened out.
FLASH IS BACK prompted the pace outside KBCYA LATER and weakened the final furlong. BILL OF RIGHTS raced along the inner rail on the turn and
was no factor. FUTURE PERFECT hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to mid turn and weakened. GENERAL NOOZ , squeezed back leaving the
starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
NINJA ABARRIO , well placed under some rating and inside tracking the leaders, came out leaving the far turn, advanced three wide and bid near the
quarter pole, drifted in a bit and brushed with THUNDER BUGGY near the three sixteenths, corrected and took over in mid stretch, spurted clear under left
handed asks heading to the sixteenth marker then continued under pressure to hold sway. VIKING QUEEN prompted the pace outside THUNDER BUGGY,
dropped in towards the rail nearing the lane, altered out for room nearing the eighth pole, straightened away and came back gamely to gain. THUNDER
BUGGY came out some at the break and made contact with a rival, corrected and moved up between runners to take command onto the main track, edged
clear and set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit soon into the lane and brushed with the winner, straightened to battle past mid stretch then weakened
through the final sixteenth. BEAUTIFUL STAR , three wide between rivals near the half mile marker, was under pressure pursuing mid turn but came up
empty. REDWHITEANDTACOS , brushed at the break and was away last, was sent up two wide between foes, angled in around the turn but lacked a rally.
UNICORN SALLY lost ground while four deep heading to the half, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faded. An objection by the trainer of VIKING
QUEEN against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

ROSY TOMORROWS , stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the three path on the far turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and lasted
under brisk urging. COMPASS RISES lacked speed well off the rail down the backstretch, turned for home in the three path, moved to the four path in upper
stretch and rallied outside the winner. SULTRY SKY , three deep the first turn, was well back into the far turn, raced between horses in the stretch and
offered a slight rally. KEEP IT SWEET , four deep around the far turn, drifted out while dropping back some entering the stretch then rallied outside foes.
NAMI bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside BOLT OF PARADISE, drifted in near the eighth pole and gave way. BOLT OF PARADISE
set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch, checked in tight quarters behind NAMI approaching the eighth pole and faded. REES , caught
in close quarters at the start, circled the far turn four wide and weakened. STORM CREED chased the pace and gave way. TIME GOES FAST was outrun.

Footnotes
BERKS , bumped at the break, was nudged up soon after and took over outside a rival heading to the first turn, dropped in when clear past the seven
eighths then set a rated pace, responded when asked entering the lane, opened up under left handed rousing in mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden
the final sixteenth. LUIGI'S SPIRIT stalked two wide early on, moved to the rail near the five eighths, edged up and was well within range leaving the far
turn, gave hard chase saving ground past the five sixteenths, eased out and continued well though no threat late. IT'S VIPER bumped with the winner at the
break, pulled his way forward when keen three wide past the seven eighths, prompted outside, was put to a hearty ride to try and keep close past the three
eighths, gave futile pursuit into the lane then faded. PICTURE THIS eased back along the rail near the five eighths, dropped into the far turn, made a mild
three wide run nearing the stretch then flattened out. TREASURE TROVE , four wide into the backstretch, dropped in a path and rated close into the far
turn, came under a ride near the five sixteenths, lacked a punch in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NICHIREN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and was kept to her business in the drive. BY THE SEY SHORE , in the two path
around the turn, gamely chased the winner through out. THE JUDGE AND JURY stalked the pace along the inner rail and rallied mildly. TAUBER lacked
speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied mildly. B DETERMINED , three deep around the turn,
chased the pace to the stretch then weakened. EDDIE THE GREAT , never a factor, swung to the six path in upper stretch. SOUPER ENERGIZER , four
deep on the turn, weakened. CAZADERO was outrun.

BY ITS ABSENCE vied outside a rival before clearing after a quarter mile, dropped in and set the pace, widened under a drive past mid stretch and was
kept alert to the wire. PRINS FIRE , bumped at the break, gave hard chase to the inside of a rival mid turn, advanced along the rail soon after, eased out
into the lane and kept on with good energy to be second best. ICE COLD FROSTY , off the pace three wide, was under a ride mid turn, shifted in for the
drive and churned on. FREESTANDING had speed to contest the pace inside the winner, angled out leaving the half after that one cleared, pursued three
wide into the lane, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded. IRISH WARLOCK , bumped and then bobbled soon after the break, was hustled up off
the inside, chased outside a rival mid turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. DR RAGS lagged back while saving ground, swung wide in upper
stretch but failed to menace. RIVER FULL saved ground and retreated past the five sixteenths. GEOTHERMAL sustained an injury through the backstretch
run, was pulled up entering the far turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ELDEST SON lacked speed, was caught behind horses in upper stretch, altered course to the five path in mid stretch, closed determinedly outside and was
up near the finish. WICKED PRANKSTER sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth pole and gave way
grudgingly. THE ADDISON POUR , shuffled back soon after the break, was patiently handled down the backstretch, advanced three wide leaving the far
turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. WOW WHATA SUMMER lacked speed, raced outside the winner through the stretch, was
fanned six wide in mid stretch and closed nicely. WISH ME HOME , steadied when outrun for position entering the first turn, chased the pace two wide to
the stretch, faded and steadied in traffic near the sixteenth pole. CLEAR VISION stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, remained along the rail in the
stretch and was steadied when lacking room near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED STORM , three wide while confidently handled stalking the pace, moved up and bid three deep leaving the far turn, took over into the lane,
responded and opened up leaving the three sixteenths then continued to widen through the final furlong while kept to task. ELUSIVE AGENT prompted the
pace outside the leader, battled between foes leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit leaving the five sixteenths, swung out for the drive and found more
through the final eighth to earn the place. CAVALRY COMMAND took over early and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure leaving the
far turn, ceded to the winner near the lane, stayed on with effort past mid stretch then faded late. GAMBLING TZAR , inside and in range past the five
eighths, was under a strong ride past the three eighths, swung out wide for the drive but lacked a bid. MY MAMBA eased back from between runners
entering the backstretch, dropped in towards the rail near the five eighths, dropped back around the final turn and was eased late. COCO SHELL lost
ground four wide, failed to respond around the far turn, faltered and was eased through the final quarter mile.
