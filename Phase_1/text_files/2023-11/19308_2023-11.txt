Footnotes
TAGLIATELLE broke a bit awkwardly and brushed an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, paused while taking kickback behind a
foe into the turn, tipped to the two path shortly after, split foes entering the lane before launching a four path rally, bid outside of the clear leader nearing the
final sixteenth and edged past. PETINGAS TWIN pressed two wide, vied around the turn, cleared in the three path entering the lane but was caught by an
outer bidder in the final sixteenth. SUMMER IN AIKEN laid off of the pace three to two wide, then stayed on to gain show between horses at the wire.
MASTER OF DISGUISE set the pace, met an outer challenge into the turn, gave way to that bidder entering the lane, weakened and lost show late.
EXPRESS CRUISER chased forwardly along the inside but lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead. DON'T STOP chased three wide then gave way in
the five path entering the lane. PALHACO brushed with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, then inside around the
turn and failed to menace. DANCING NOAH broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two to four path around the turn and failed to factor. KING BUKELE
failed to factor from the four to five path. THE RUSH IS ON hopped slightly and broke slow, lacked speed in the four to six path and made little impact.
PILOT MOUNTAIN brushed the inner half of the gate before taking light contact between rivals at the start, lagged into the turn and was outrun. CAMILAS
WARRIOR chased briefly four wide but steadily faded approaching the turn.

Footnotes
PROMISEMEANEMPIRE vied three wide, led two wide turning for home as an outer AARALYN loomed a danger, dug in to resist that foe's challenge
entering the lane, sparred gamely while clinging to an advantage through midstretch, then edged away in the final sixteenth and shifted out. AARALYN
tracked three wide, loomed boldly ranging up in hand outside of the leader nearing the lane, sparked a duel at the quarter pole, battled through midstretch
but was turned away in the final sixteenth. ROSELEE MAY broke outwardly, prompted the pace two wide and between the leading pair approaching the
turn, but failed to sustain pressure at the three furlong pole, chased turning for home then held show. UP ON THE EDGE stalked along the inside, shifted
two wide entering the lane before lacking a rail challenge. LOST LOVE bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued along the inside, shifted to the three path
into the turn, moved forward between horses before floating to the five path entering the lane and failed to menace. CHEYENNE MOON took simultaneous
bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from the four path, came under strong urging nearing the three sixteenths pole, floated six wide into
the turn and tired on her left lead. KENTUCKYTERMINATOR broke in and bumped a rival at the start, then made little impact from the four path. BRIGHT
LADY DAY set the pace inside of a pair of rivals approaching the turn, failed to keep pace with her outermost counterpart nearing the five sixteenths pole
and faded. YOU PROOF broke a step slow but avoided being pinched between horses in the process, then showed little.

Footnotes
DEAR LADY laid off of the pace along the inside, gained ground in the three path around the turn, loomed a danger outside of the top pair entering the lane
in the four path, bid in upper stretch, cleared passing the furlong grounds and resented the rider's crop use by flagging her tail through the late stages.
MIGHTY MADISON set the pace inside of a vying rival, but proved no match for an outer bidder while repelling her closest counterpart in upper stretch,
flopped back to her left lead while tiring in the final furlong then lasted for place. METHODOLOGY stalked along the inside, chased the embattled leading
pair around the turn, sustained stride shifting ground outwardly in midstretch, stayed on late but missed reaching place. MALIBU SMART lacked speed in
the four to three path around the turn, shifted inwardly in midstretch and ran on willingly. H. T. XENA prompted two wide, vied around the turn then
weakened between horses in upper stretch. UNSTABLE PRINCESS raced at the rear in the five to four path into the turn and made little impact. LAKESIDE
MUSIC was outrun along the inside. DEVIL BLUE DRESS stalked three wide but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
ALPINE PRINCESS leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path before tucking to the inside entering the backstretch,
crept closer to loom a danger from the pocket around the far turn, brushed with an outer foe at the five sixteenth pole, smoothly took aim two wide and
between the leaders entering the lane, bid and vied inside of a pair of foes into the final furlong then edged clear with a sixteenth to go. SISTINA CHAPEL
transferred light contact from an inner rival into firm contact into an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to two path early on, ranged up
four wide around the far turn to bid entering the lane, vied into the final furlong but failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in the final sixteenth and
was second best. PHAROAH'S WINE was fractious awaiting the start, tracked three wide, bid outside of the leader and from the three path turning for
home, led briefly entering the lane, vied between bidders through upper stretch, but flopped back to her left lead at the furlong grounds and yielded in the
aftermath. WELLAREYOUHAPPYNOW broke a step slow before taking a bump from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path, shifted out to the
five path entering the lane and moved up. TOASTED ROLL set a clear pace, but was headed turning for home and caved inside of a trio of rivals in upper
stretch. COPPER EM was a bit antsy in the gate just before the start, stalked two wide, chased between horses around the far turn, brushed with her inner
counterpart at the five sixteenths pole and weakened entering the lane. LATE NITE LIZZIE pursued from the four path and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
LA V. vied two wide under a snug hold, led in hand passing the three furlong pole, drew clear entering the lane in the three path, maintained a clear margin
into the final sixteenth, then lasted from an outer late challenger. CHARGE ACCOUNT tracked two wide and between horse, took aim on the clear leader
from the four path entering the lane, slowly closed in inside the final furlong, attempted a late bid but needed more. LOOKIN ROYAL broke a beat slow,
trailed in the four path into the turn, picked up stride shifting to the six path entering the lane and ran on willingly. CACTUS FLOWER prompted the pace
three wide, but was floated to the five path by an inner rival entering the lane and gave way on his left lead. SHE DAZZLE broke a step slow and was put to
a bit of crowded quarters between horses at the start, raced off of the pace three to two wide, then moved up between horses. EVERYOTHERWON chased
four wide but faded between horses turning for home. DONYA KNOW IT tossed her head leaving the gates, tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back
behind a faltering foe approaching the lane and failed to factor thereafter. O'BABE vied inside of the eventual winner, but yielded with three furlongs to go
and weakened. FUTURE FLAY snagged the gate upon leaving it, pursued from midpack hung five wide and tired entering the lane in the seven path. ELIA
broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace and was outrun.

ARRO SMASH set the pace inside of a vying foe, sparred with that one while taking the turn in the two path, shook free in upper stretch, held sway into the
final sixteenth before meeting a late challenge and found the wire in time. ZAMBEZI stalked two wide and between horses, took aim on the leaders from the
five path in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to offer a late bid but missed. BOURBON RESOLVE laid off of the pace under urging in the four path
into the turn, sustained stride entering the lane in the six path, then rallied along with an outer rival while hanging on his left lead, closed in on the top pair in
the final sixteenth but needed more. SPEND BENJAMINS broke a step slow, trailed, advanced in the five to seven path around the turn and ran on willingly.
JUILLIARD prompted two wide, vied in the three to four path around the turn, but weakened between horses in midstretch. SHOWDOWN KING raced at the
rear in the two path and failed to factor. LAVER stalked three wide and weakened entering the lane in the five path. FORCED RANKING broke a step slow,
chased while forwardly placed along the inside but faltered turning for home.

DENINGTON trailed in the three path into the turn, gained noticeably while fanning six wide entering the lane, sustained a rally to offer a bid leaving the
furlong grounds and drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole. WICO (IRE) vied four wide, led turning for home, drew clear entering the lane, but was
confronted by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and was bested entering the final sixteenth. BROMLEY was briefly fractious in the starting gate,
tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn, took aim in the four path and between horses entering the lane, then chased evenly to
edge show from an outer foe in the final furlong. CYCLONE MISCHIEF tracked two wide, pursued in the three to five path around the turn, took aim entering
the lane, but lacked a bid along with an outer foe in midstretch and yielded. CURLY JACK lacked speed in the two path around the turn, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch and surpassed tiring rivals. PROMISE ME A RIDE vied two wide and between horses but weakened entering the lane.
BRITERDAYZAHEAD vied three wide and between horses but weakened entering upper stretch. ACT A FOOL broke inwardly, vied inside of a trio of rivals
but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
TRAEGAR stalked two wide, bid in the three path entering the lane, drove clear approaching the final furlong and held sway. GIANT MISCHIEF tracked two
wide and between horses, stalked in the four path and outside of foes around the turn, sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the clear leader in the final
furlong, but was kept at bay and held place. MINNESOTA READY chased in the five path, tucked to the three path at the three furlong pole, moved back out
to the five path entering the lane and ran on willingly. KUPUNA set the pace along the inside, encountered a challenge from an outer bidder while entering
the lane in the two path, but got headed in upper stretch and gave way. SHOOTERS SHOOT brushed with an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three
path, shifted to the five to six path in upper stretch and stayed on. PAYNE brushed with an outer rival at the start, then failed to menace from the two path.
FRIAR LAURENCE tracked along the inside, chased into the lane and faded. GO WEST broke outwardly, stalked forwardly n the six path while remaining
multiple paths away from inner foes into and around the turn, but entered the lane in the seven path and faded.

Footnotes
GIGANTE prompted between the leaders before easing back from tight quarters into the first turn, stalked the embattled leading trio from the two to three
path, split them to take aim from the four path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch and drove clear. NORTHERN INVADER broke a step slow, trailed in the
two path, gained in the four path around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but leveled off in upper stretch, sustained stride to bid for
place in the final sixteenth and reeled in that position at the wire. SMOKEY MANDATE vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, led entering the lane, but
was bested by an outer foe in midstretch, dug in for place in the final sixteenth but was nailed at the wire. WINTERS LION laid off of the pace along the
inside, was urged along towards the rear in the three to four path around the far turn, then moved up. LINCOLN HIGHWAY brushed with an outer rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the three path, came under urging around the far turn and failed to menace. WILD SEAN brushed with an inner foe at the start,
vied two wide and between horses, entered the lane in the three path but faded. WORTHINGTON steadied out of tight quarters into the first turn, pursued
along the inside and faded around the far turn. J. P. RACE vied three wide then weakened entering the lane in the five path.

Footnotes
BOURBON TO BLAME broke outwardly, prompted two wide and drew clear entering the lane. MISINTENTION laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, fanned to the six path entering the lane and rallied. RITA'S ONTHE BEACH saved ground off of the pace, offered a rail grind to vie for place coming
to midstretch, but was outkicked then saved show. LISA'S NONNO broke a step slow, raced at the rear in the six to seven path and ran on. VICTORIOUS
broke inwardly, set the pace inside of a pressing foe, was bested entering the lane and gave way between horses. FAST N HAPPY bumped with an outer
rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside inched closer in the four path around the turn but flattened out between horses. RUBIA tracked in
the two path and lacked a bid. BEAUTIFUL BOLT tracked four wide but faded between horses at the three furlong pole. A DOLLAR A DAY lacked speed in
the four path into the turn and was outrun. MISSILE bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide then weakened between horses. JOHANNY
pursued from the five path, but was pulled up around the turn and got vanned off.
