Footnotes
LEGISLATOR tracked in the two path in range from mid-pack, went between rivals on the backstretch and far turn, roused at the quarter pole and tipped out
to take aim at the leaders from outside, reached the front at the eighth pole, kicked clear midstretch and held safely under a drive. GHOST COAST sat off
the pace two wide, angled out into the stretch, finished well but had to settle for second best. CARIBBEAN KING stalked the pace from inside, coaxed along
into the lane, put in a rail bid in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but kept on for the show honors. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES reserved in the early
going and moved inside, ridden along through the far turn, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch, altered out into the clear and kept on for a minor award.
PRECISION STRIKE trailed early along the rail, worked on around the far turn and tipped to the two path, angled out in the stretch and summoned a mild
rally to improve position. KHANTARO D'ORO stalked in the two path early, moved up to press the pace from between rivals on the backstretch, stayed
alongside the leader through the far turn and into the lane, fought to the eighth pole and weakened. SURF AFFAIR vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals on
the clubhouse turn, dueled into the backstretch, inched ahead to take control, maintained a short lead through the far turn, lost command at the eighth pole
and weakened. MY PARTNER GLEN traveled three deep out of range, rounded the far turn four then three wide and failed to menace. UNCLE REG vied for
the lead outside a pair of rivals and four wide into the first turn, pulled and became a bit rank around the bend, stalked four deep in the middle stages, spun
five wide into the lane and had little left in the final furlong. BERT'S PROSPECT vied three wide through the clubhouse turn, pressed three deep on the
backstretch, lost touch with the leader and chased three then four wide on the far turn, then faded in the drive.

Footnotes
TEDDY'S TRIUMPH sprinted clear early, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, put to right then left handed urging in upper stretch, got a bit weary on
the wrong late but managed to hold. THIRSTY LOV hustled from the gate, switch off the rail to give chase, ran two wide around the bend, continued within
range into the final furlong, put in a mild late bid and was gaining to the wire. GRAZEN BOY brushed with inner rival at the start, stalked from inside into the
turn, fought the rider on the turn before eventually drifting out with a quarter mile remaining, churned on through the lane and held the show. WINNING BIG
chased two wide into the turn, climbed early on the bend and lost ground while moving out to the four path, straightened out in the lane and kept on through
the late stages but could not pass GRAZEN BOY for third. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL brushed with outer rival at the start, raced greenly early and steered
out into the clear, traveled four then five wide around the turn and lacked a needed response. SIR LOOKING GLASS chased three wide into the turn, got
floated out out to the five path late on the bend and weakened. SEASEID RIDE raced greenly early and dropped back, saved ground lagging far back and
was never a factor.

Footnotes
GRAZED set the pace under pressure early, dueled inside GYPSY KING through the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and held gamely under right
handed urging. LEMON SUSHI was off slow to begin, pulled hard chasing early, bobbled and took hold briefly at the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide
with a quarter mile remaining, rallied from outside and got up for second. GYPSY KING broke well then pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the
bend and into the lane, shifted in to bother rival midstretch and finished gamely to the wire but got edged for second. X J RASCAL (IRE) bobbled and got
bumped from outside at the start, trailed under a hold early, went three wide into the turn, moved out to the four path then angled in leaving the bend to
enter the stretch two wide, steered out in the lane and lacked a rally. MISTER ICEMAN bobbled and bumped inner rival in the beginning, showed keen early
foot while tugging the rider along on the inside, saved ground through the turn and never found room in the stretch. HAWKER sat off the pace on the inside,
went two wide into the turn, drew closer around the bend, had to pause in traffic in upper stretch, found room and roused at the eighth pole, lost his path and
was forced to check midstretch and failed to find room late. KING APOLLO chased four deep early, three deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. ADARE broke a step slow, chased three deep into the turn, moved into the two path the asked three wide into the stretch and failed to
make an impact. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GYPSY KING FROM THIRD TO SIXTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND
CAUSING HAWKER TO STEADY SHARPLY IN MIDSTRETCH, COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
INDIAN DREAMER sent early and pressed the pace from inside, ceded command to the leader, chased along the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the lane,
came again from outside with a sixteenth remaining and drove past inner rivals. BOSSY BRUIN GAL chased early, bid three then two wide on the turn,
dueled into the final furlong, took over at the sixteenth pole but got outkicked by the winner. CAPO SORELLA set the pace outside INDIAN DREAMER then
cleared leaving the backstretch, challenged by BOSSY BRUIN GAL on the turn, resisted to midstretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and yielded late.
COCONUT GIRL chased from off the pace, went four wide into the turn, angled in and went between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, then flattened out in
the furlong grounds. ALMOST GOT LUCKY was off slow to begin, raced head-high and was very green in the early stages, trailed off the inside into the lane
and failed to threaten. LOVE HONOR AND PAY bobbled shortly after the start, chased between early, went four wide into the turn, lost ground and angled
over to the inside around the bend, then weakened in the lane. GOLDEN AND BLUE had to steady briefly when rival came across early, chased five deep
into the turn, three deep into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG SWEDE lacked early quickness, chased five wide outside rivals into the turn, moved into the four path before tipping five wide into the lane, rallied
steadily from outside and swept by late. PACO'S PICO chased from inside, challenged STORMY SAMURAI approaching the sixteenth pole, got by that rival
but was outkicked by the winner. STORMY SAMURAI took control early, showed the way in the two path through the turn, tested in the final sixteenth and
yielded late. HANDR'SDREAM chased two wide into the turn, coaxed between rivals around the bend, moved out in the lane, finished willingly but got
outkicked. SONIC BREES sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, angled over to the inside around the bend and weakened. QUICK FINISH chased
from off the pace outside a rival, four wide between into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, swung out into the stretch and was not
persevered with in deep stretch. FOREIGN PROTOCOL closest in pursuit off the inside, chased three deep around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
CLOSING REMARKS unhurried in the opening stages from inside, raced well off the pace into the far turn, asked left handed entering the lane while tipping
off the fence, rallied under right handed encouragement and reeled in the runner-up in the final strides. QUEEN GODDESS closest in pursuit from the two
path, challenged from outside with a quarter mile left to run, put away HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) past the eighth pole but got run down by the winner
approaching the wire. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) controlled the pace from inside then moved off the rail on the backstretch, steered back to the inside for the
far turn, tested by QUEEN GODDESS at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead at the top of the stretch, kept on from the fence and held third. FULL
COUNT FELICIA was a bit rank early when asked to rate, settled in the two path, went two to three wide on the far turn and lacked a bid in the stretch run.
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked from inside through both turns and failed to threaten in the stretch run. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) settled two wide outside a rival at
the back, asked right handed on the far turn, moved out in the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH INFO settled off the pace, made progress two wide then along the inside around the turn, continued to cut into the lead entering the final
furlong, tipped out midstretch, then overhauled the leader in the final fifty yards. TANGLEDUPINGREY forwardly placed early, chased along the rail into the
turn, tipped out and came three wide into the drive, rallied in the drive but was outclosed by the winner. I'M A LUCKY MAN showed the way up the
backstretch under pressure, cleared past the seven-sixteenths pole, asked right handed into the lane, switch to the left then back to the right hand
midstretch still clear but weakened late. KISLOVODSK pressed from outside early, chased two wide around the turn, kept in range through the lane but
could not summon a late bid. TAHOE SECRETS stalked the pace from inside, lost ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and kept on trying to the wire.
JIMMY THE BOOT coaxed along early, chased wide up the backstretch, four to five wide on the turn and lacked a rally. HEARTBREAK KID coaxed early
between rivals at the back, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. WARRENS WORLD tossed his head to lose a
step at the start, raced in range outside rivals or three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and faded. SPIRITIST tracked four deep leaving the
backstretch, round the bend five then four wide and failed to menace.

traveled well clear without being asked through the far turn, asked right handed in upper stretch, switched to the left hand midstretch and remained
unchallenged to the under steady handling to the wire. ANISETTE (GB) settled three then two wide early, angled to the inside on the far turn, tipped out in
the stretch and bested the rest. BREATH AWAY (GB) rated along the inside then got put in a bit tight early on the clubhouse turn, ridden along saving
ground into the lane, urged left handed in upper stretch and held the show. JUSTIQUE bumped leaving the gate, rated three deep then moved into the two
path on the first turn, raced between then two wide on the far turn, churned on through the lane and missed the show. COFFEE IN BED bumped with
JUSTIQUE at the start, was rank briefly early before settling inside at the back, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten.
TEA N CONVERSATION traveled outside a rival at the back early, asked right handed three wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. IMPACT

Footnotes
MOOSE MITCHELL raced up close outside the leader then between into the turn, fought for command through the bend and into the stretch, put a head in
front at the eighth pole, battled in deep stretch and dug in to prevail. DISCO BALL raced up close from outside, fought four wide into the turn and three deep
around the bend, battled down the lane and finished gamely to the wire. IT'S MY HOUSE set the pace from inside, vied with outer pair around the turn and
into the lane, lost command at the eighth pole but battled back from the fence only to get weary approaching the wire. REDLINE bobbled leaving the gate,
moved in range up the backstretch, moved off the rail and came three wide into the lane but lacked a rally. PATRON D'ORO stumbled badly in the
beginning, chased three wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and could not threaten. STAY IN THE GAME chased from off the pace, rounded the
bend two to three wide, angled out into the lane and was not a factor. MY RANSOM dropped back early, trailed on the inside then two wide into the drive
and never got involved.

CROSBY BEACH dueled for command from outside into the clubhouse turn then ceded command to take a stalking position, drew alongside SANTO DIOS
(ARG) once again on the far turn, took over past the eighth pole, drifted in and brushed rival at the sixteenth pole, then edged away late. SANTO DIOS
(ARG) brushed leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on the inside into the first turn then cleared around the bend, controlled the pace to the far turn,
challenged by CROSBY BEACH on the far turn, lost command past the eighth pole, got brushed by the winner at the sixteenth pole and was outkicked in
end. RECKLESS SPIRIT reserved and moved inside early, steadied off heels at the five-eighths pole, advanced once gaining a clear path on the
backstretch, chased along the rail to the stretch, tipped two wide upper and finished well. LIVING LIFE traveled towards the rear in the two path, trailed into
the far turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. EVENING SUN (GB) took back early and
was reserved in the two path, on the move four deep through the far turn but needed to find more in the furlong grounds. IRISH PROPHET stalked three
deep, took aim three wide into the drive and lacked a bid. LAHAINA FLAVOR tracked from inside, went between on the backstretch, continued between in
the two path on the far turn, tried to rally in the lane but failed to find room until it was too late. BAJ brushed leaving the gate, raced in range two wide, exited
the far turn three wide and lacked a rally. DEL MAR JERRY went three wide into the first turn then shifted out to the four path briefly, went three deep into
the far turn, found traffic past the five-sixteenths pole, continued three wide into the lane and never threatened. STAMP MY PASSPORT showed early
speed then took a stalk keenly in hand, roused midway on the far turn, urged left handed into the lane and lacked further response. EASTBOUND unhurried
in the two path, chased three deep on the backstretch, checked between into the far turn, angled in on the far turn and was kept to task while trailing through
the lane.
