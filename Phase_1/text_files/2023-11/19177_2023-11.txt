Footnotes
WAVERLEY rated close inside on the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and edged clear under steady handling. NELLY TOO settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. DASHING LASS stalked from the three path the first turn, bid past the three
eighths pole and raced close in the four path on the far turn, but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WILD N' SASSY raced well off the pace and
off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased outward through the upper stretch and
passed some rivals. RED RIVER SUSI rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of EMBRACEABLE approaching the seven sixteenths pole and
cleared that one approaching the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn but weakened leaving the eighth pole. The latter stalked off the rail,
challenged Red River Susi nearing the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed
little more. LADY CAIRO bobbled at the break then stalked from the four path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened
in the six path on the far turn. MAGNOLIA ROAD, well off the pace in the four path the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little
response. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CAJUN CASHEW ducked in at the break then took the lead passing the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and just lasted
under steady stretch handling. UNALTERED chased outside through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the six path, left the turn outside, lugged in
nearing mid-stretch, dueled for second and just missed the win in a strong finish. BET YOUR BOOTS gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. RUMORGOINGAROUND steadied early and dropped well back from early contention, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the turn in the three path and finished well to close the gap through the lane. S S CASINO GIRL gave chase through the
backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn, steadied from between horses nearing mid-stretch and flattened stride. SWISS HORIZON gave chase
through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. GANGSTER AMERICANO chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and
weakened. MIREYA dropped well back and saved ground. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the riders of both, Bet Your Boots
and Unaltered, for interference nearing mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of S S Casino Girl.

WINDSOR'S TRACKER closed toward contention while tapering in and stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear past the eighth pole and held on under steady handling. SARGENT KOBE saved ground
well off the early pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, drew close in the three path on the far turn and finished evenly at the outside
withers of the winner. S S SPARTAN ENERGY was shuffled back early and rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase past the half mile
pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and came along for third mid-stretch. EISELE saved early ground then picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. PERSONAL FINANCE raced with the early pace two deep then took over and
showed the way into the backstretch, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened inside
the eighth pole. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY came away outwardly then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but
flattened at the rail on the far turn. SEIZE THE BREEZE raced with the early pace inside but dropped back at the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase nearing
the seven sixteenths, though weakened at the rail on the far turn. BLAME B B was forced outward leaving the gate, raced two deep on the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
DIAL HER settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily improved from that point, took the nod three wide approaching the
eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. GRACE AND CHARM raced with the pace three wide through the front stretch then stalked the
opening turn, moved to even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge off the rail on the far turn but was met entering the lane and
relented the final sixteenth. BREEZY CONNECTION rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
raced close two deep on the far turn, but dropped back passing the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. THUNDERTURTLE raced two deep the first
turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. SAVE THE FLAG raced with the early
pace inside, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and flattened at the rail on the far turn. HONEY BELLA
raced with the pace two deep and between horses through the front stretch, was met past the half mile pole and dueled from that point, but dropped back at
the rail midway on the far turn and weakened into the lane. ONLY KIDDING saved ground the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened at the rail into the far turn.

Footnotes
DONTINVADEMYSPACE rated close inside on the opening turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path toward the
head of the lane and dug in determinedly to clear SUPERSTITIEUX in the final yards. The latter took over at the three quarter pole and gradually moved to
the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was met nearing
the head of the lane but dug in gamely to deep stretch before relenting. SIR SMOAK rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase into
the backstretch and raced close at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. AKINGISALWAYSKING raced off the rail the first turn,
gave chase leaving the half mile pole but showed little response. PURSUING PACE saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, eased out into the
backstretch and showed little response. VIOLENT ROCK stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in
the four path on the far turn. STAVANGER saved ground.
