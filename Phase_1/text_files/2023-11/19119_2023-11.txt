Footnotes
SPIRIT OF LIGHT set the pace in the four path, tipped into the two path entering the turn, opened up while gradually drifting out on her left lead entering the
stretch, straightened out after switching leads passing the sixteenth, and held sway. BABY SASSICAIA tracked in the three path, was roused into the turn,
got herded and bumped out to the seven path turning into the lane, but was able to run on for place. FLUFFY had a slow start, trailed in the three path,
fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. LADY KHOZ broke out at the start, rated inside of foes, was coaxed
along from the rail midway around the turn, but flattened. PLATINUM ROCKER prompted the pace in the four path, but lost ground going into the turn, and
did not threaten. KHOZY COLBY stalked in the six path, bid from the three path going into the turn, but drifted out to the six path bumping an outer foe at
the top of the lane, and faded. JAZZIN raced off the pace in the two path but was empty entering the lane.

EILAT stalked in the five path, loomed from the four path rounding the turn, bumped with an inner foe while making a bid in the six path at the top of the
stretch, held a short lead passing the eighth pole, and dug in to hold on. TOP LOOK chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the turn, and
ran on from the seven path down the lane for place. ROUGH ENOUGH pressed in the three path, bumped with an outer foe while making a bid in the five
path at the top of the stretch, and kept on while on her left lead for show. ACTION ROSE prompted the pace in the four path, was cued between foes in the
three path midway around the turn, angled inside at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. VAL'S GAL had a slow start, rated in the five path, was driven in
the six path around the turn, but made no impact from the eight path in the stretch. LUNA WEST led from the two path into the turn, floated out to the four
path going into the stretch, but yielded between foes in the final furlong. BINGO STAR had to steady passing the five-eighths, tracked inside but backed up

Footnotes
WIND NINETY NINE prompted the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened while ridden out.
SURROGATE stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to
be clearly second best. THENORTHREMEMBERS broke awkwardly and bumped ALMASHRIQ at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four
wide around the far turn and kept on to gain the show. WATCH THE MUSIC raced in range two wide and lacked the needed rally. DRILLOMATIC trailed
inside, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. PERFORMING ARTS saved ground and failed to menace. ALMASHRIQ was bumped at
the start, set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths marker, steadied near the quarter pole and faltered.

Footnotes
JAYANA broke in at the start, stalked in the five path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, bid in the six path at the top of the stretch, and
drew past an inner pair around the final sixteenth. PERILOUS tracked inside, was ridden from the rail into the stretch, and ran on for place. CITRUS BELLE
rated in the five path, moved up under a drive around the turn, tipped out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. LUCY'S COOKIE set a
contested pace in the two path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, drifted out to the five path while on her left lead in upper stretch, and
faded in the final furlong. RUN FOR HOME bumped with an outer foe at the start, was hustled from off the pace in the four path, shifted to the rail early
around the turn, swung back out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but was no factor. SISTER SERENDIPITY prompted the pace in the four path, but
drifted out to the ten path turning into the lane, and flattened. ROYAL UPSTART settled wellback in the two path, fanned out to the eight path turning into
the stretch, but made no impact. MOBAY PRINCESS bumped with foes on both sides at the start, raced off the pace in the four path and did not factor from
around the six path in the stretch. ANNAMARIA chased in the three path but was tired while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch.
MARSHMALLOW QUEEN bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the three path, but yielded between foes at the top of the lane. LADY LYLA
dwelt, raced wellback in the four path and never menaced. SOUTHERN COTTON always trailed around the two path.

Footnotes
SUMMER'S COMIN rated off the pace while racing two wide between foes, edged closer between rivals down the backstretch, angled four wide midway
around the far turn, made a quick bid to take over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and just lasted under steady left-handed urging.
ESCAPE ROOM bumped REFUGIADA nearing the first turn, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained outside
of the winner through the lane and hung late. LADY CHA CHA raced off the pace two wide, made progress around the far turn and finished evenly to hold
the show. REFUGIADA was pinched back nearing the first turn, trailed inside early, circled five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch.
LET'S GO PHILLY raced in range four wide around the fist turn, moved up to press the pace down the backstretch, led three wide near the five-sixteenths
pole but came up empty in the lane. FAST MOTION set the pace inside and faltered around the far turn. CAT ONE chased the pace five wide and retreated
around the far turn.

HAPPY TOGETHER stalked in the five path, was roused to bid in the three path midway around the turn, took a clear lead turning into the stretch, and went
clear on her left lead under a drive. BROOKMESA had a slow start, raced off the pace along the rail, was roused from the two path early around the turn,
tipped out to the four path turning into the lane, was on her left lead before switching just after the eighth pole, and ran on for place. MAS VINO pressed the
outer pacesetter in the two path, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, got stymied turning into the stretch, and evened out along the inside for show.
DEFLECTION tracked in the three path, floated out to the seven path under a drive turning into the lane, but flattened. LACONIA set the pace in the four
path, was roused from the two path into the turn, but yielded between foes at the top of the stretch. SMART JENNY rated in the six path but never
threatened. SHINING SKYE raced wellback in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
RACE CRAFT settled off the pace while racing three wide, closed determinedly through the lane and was up in the final strides. FLY THE W stalked the
pace in the clear in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. THE BEST DISTANCE set a
clear pace in the three path around the first turn, set a pressured pace in the two path around the far turn, yielded near the quarter pole and held well
enough to preserve the show. ARTIE'S ANGEL raced off the pace two wide, was blocked in upper stretch, shifted out in midstretch and rallied belatedly.
VALENTINE BUG went evenly while racing two and three wide. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE failed to menace while saving ground. GRADED ON A CURVE
steadied early on the first, raced off the pace two wide between foes and lacked a closing bid. CADET CORPS played no factor while racing four and five
wide. MOMZA was fractious in the gate, chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
GRAND DAVID set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path midway around the far turn, opened up from said position in upper stretch, and
held safe under a drive. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY rated inside, was roused from the three path early around the far turn, swung out to the seven path into
the stretch, and ran on for place. THE DOORMAN was unhurried in midpack around the three path, cued from the rail passing the three-eighths, and kept
on in the two path down the stretch for show. BROOKLYN STRONG raced off the pace in the two path, was urged from the four path into the stretch, but
made no impact. NIGHT JUMPER broke out at the start, tracked in the six path, ranged up in the five path turning into the lane, but flattened out between
foes on his left lead. ENGLISH PAINTER trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch, and did not threaten. RED FLAG ALERT
raced up close in the four path but faded in the stretch. GENTLEMAN GERRY stalked in the five path but was empty at the top of the lane.
