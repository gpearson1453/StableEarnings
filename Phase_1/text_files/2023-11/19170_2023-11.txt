SHIP OF DREAMS set a nicely rated pace from the start, drew clear turning for home and was clearly much the best in the end. STAYUPTHERE was
saving ground on the turn while inside, rallied and swung out to be three wide in upper stretch and was second best. HOORAY FOR CREDIT chased the
early pace while two wide, was used up then gave way in the stretch. DRAMEDY'S BLUR was unhurried early and failed to menace. BIG UN was three
wide on the turn and was no factor. GOSPEL HOPE showed early speed while three wide, stopped suddenly in upper stretch and was pulled then walked
off.
