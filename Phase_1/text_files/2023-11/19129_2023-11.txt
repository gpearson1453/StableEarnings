before being outkicked between rivals in the final furlong. COLONEL BARTON pursued from midpack three wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, then ran
on mildly between horses while requiring rider's correction to keep him from lugging inwardly. COAL BOSS chased two wide and between horses then ran
on five wide while in tight among rivals in the final furlong. ABSOLUTE COURAGE prompted three wide ad between horses, chased under urging around
the turn, then yielded between horses nearing midstretch. WINGER broke slowly, laid off of the pace two wide, but was bumped into an outer rival while

Footnotes
FRIAR LAURENCE tracked four wide, shifted ground outwardly in midstretch and rallied to drive past the leaders in the final sixteenth. COLD AS HELL
prompted two wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, inched clear in midstretch but was bested by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole.
HOWBEIT was last away, lacked speed along the inside, came under urging around the turn, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and stayed on
late to reach show at the wire. CAMP DAVID dueled for the lead with an outer rival around the turn, was headed entering the lane, yielded in the final furlong
and was caught at the wire for show. TEXAS RED HOT brushed with an outer rival trailed around the turn, then rallied between horses in the late stages to
miss reaching show. DERBY DATE stalked along the inside, was roused outside of the leading pair turning for home, but only managed to chase them while
subtly drifting out in midstretch and tired between horses. FLAGS UP was brushed by an inner rival and slow into stride, laid off of the pace two to three

Footnotes
WICKED HALO bumped with inner rivals leaving the chute, tracked two wide, easily split the leaders two wide when the seas-split entering the lane, gained
an advantage passing the three sixteenths pole, drew clear soon after and held sway while being geared down in the late stages. LITTLE PRANKSTER
exchanged multiple brushes with an inner rival at the start before being simultaneously bumped by that one and an outer foe leaving the chute, stalked three
wide and outside of the leading pair, but was floated four wide entering the lane before being outmoved by an inner rival in upper stretch, and chased that
one home to prove second best. LAST LEAF tracked along the inside, faded turning for home, yet regained stride after shifting five wide in upper stretch and
re-rallied to gain show. YOUR SO SILLEA set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, proved no
match entering midstretch and weakened. FIRE ON TIME exchanged brushes with an outer rival at the start before bumping with that one in a slightly firmer
manner leaving the chute, prompted outside of the leader, required right handed shoulder taps to keep from drifting out turning for home, but lugged to the
three path entering the lane allowing for racing room for the eventual winner and weakened between horses in upper stretch. ROYAL COUNTY trailed in the
three path, got floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TWIRL AROUND set the pace outside of a trio of rivals early on, crossed over to the two path showing the way into the turn, then drew off in upper stretch
and was ridden out under moderate urging. HAMBLE brushed the outer half of the starting gate upon leaving it, tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the
leading pair turning for home, but only managed to chase the clearing leader thereafter and secured place in the final furlong. SHORE WAR pursued from
midpack in the three to two path into the turn, gained between horses turning for home, vied for place with outer rivals through midstretch but flattened out.
DESTINY STAR laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path passing the three furlong pole, then ran on willingly through the late stages, yet
was found to have bled. TAMMY LYNN raced forwardly three wide and between horses, exchanged bumps with an inner rival coming to the half mile pole,
was roused in recovery to press the leader from the three path into the turn, failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, vied for place with rivals on
both sides through midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go. RENFREW laid close up along the inside, chased around the turn and gave way. BOYNE
VALLEY prompted two wide and between horses, bumped with an outer rival multiple times at the half mile pole, steadied back once rank between foes
entering the turn, faltered then continued to weaken while hanging on her left lead. SPEIGHTFUL MISS stumbled at the start, trailed in the three path and
made little impact. SERENE WATERS broke a step slow and was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
AUGUSTINE RED came out at the start, stalked outside of the top pair into the turn, took aim entering the lane in the four path, inched closer to bid while
being subtly herded out nearing the midstretch, vied and bumped his inner counterpart inside the final furlong, jostled with that one again while forging an
advantage at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. BIRCHTON dueled for the lead two wide, led turning for home, entered the lane in the three path as an
outer rival threatened, subtly drifted out while meeting that one's bid coming to midstretch, took firm contact inside the final furlong, leaned out and shared
blame in jostling with his outer counterpart again while getting headed at the sixteenth pole, then was bested soon after and lasted for place. STINGER BEE
broke a step slow, pursued from midpack two wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding charge slowly closing in on the top pair
in the final furlong but missed reaching place. LATTA dueled along the inside but gave way entering the lane. MIDNIGHT AMBITION was hesitant to load,
then got forced outwardly by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four to three path, shifted out to the six path leaving upper stretch and ran
on willingly. STORMIN LOVE pursued from midpack three wide, spun to the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid. CRUISIN AND BOOZIN lacked
speed despite urging in the three to two path into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and made little impact. JIMMY THE HAT leaned in at the start and
failed to factor two wide. FASTER broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three path into the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and was
outrun. SUPERHERO tracked along the inside, chased around the turn then weakened on his left lead. TAPITBOY laid off of the pace two wide, checked
when uncomfortable between rivals at the five furlong pole, dropped back to trail approaching the turn, bore very wide around that bend, then was pulled up
entering the lane and walked off. THE RIDER OFBIRCHTON CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF AUGUSTINE RED FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE FINAL FURLONG. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER

EASY ACTION prompted outside of the leader and from the four to three path into the turn, vied turning for home, led passing the three sixteenths marker
and drove clear. TUNISIAN SPRING set the pace along the inside, vied with the bidding eventual winner turning for home, got headed in upper stretch,
yielded in the final furlong and held place. PENSACOLA tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch, tipped out at the furlong grounds and ran on to
miss reaching place. UNDERHILL'S TAB raced forwardly two wide and between horses, chased around the turn, then kept on while hanging on his left lead
among rivals but lacked a bid. ZAMBEZI tracked in the three to four path and yielded. WHERE'S RANDY lacked speed in the two path and failed to factor.
FLIPARINO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SISTINA CHAPEL tracked in the four path, bid three wide at the three furlong pole, vied before leading entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch,
embraced a late challenge from an outer bidder approaching the wire and held firm. EXTREMELY GRUNTLED tracked two wide and between horses while
tugging keenly around the first turn, settled into stride among foes entering the backstretch, gained in the three to four path around the far turn, took aim
outside of the clearing leader from the five path entering the lane, gradually closed in on that one in the final furlong, attempted a late bid but was denied.
AMY Z pressed the leader from the three path, vied in the two path into the far turn before an outer rival bid with three furlongs to go, vied with that one
turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, yielded yet held show. MONTCLAIR ROAD laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to
the six path entering the lane and ran on while one paced. CHEYENNE MOON saved ground off of the pace, vacated the inside in upper stretch and failed
to menace. DASH OF LEMON raced at the rear in the two path while pulling under strong restraint around the first turn, trailed around the far turn, then
improved between tiring rivals. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and weakened. SAVE THE MISCHIEF set the
pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer pair passing the three furlong pole and weakened nearing the lane. CALLE REINA pursued from midpack
in the five path, chased into the far turn and weakened turning for home.

COMMANDPERFORMANCE laid off of the pace in the three to two path, gained four wide around the far turn to bid turning for home, drew clear
straightening for home, held sway through midstretch as a pair of outer rivals pursued, drifted out while meeting ESCAPOLOGIST's challenge in the final
sixteenth and just held. ESCAPOLOGIST settled off of the pace in the two path, gained in the four to five path turning for home, sustained a rally range up to
the leader in the final sixteenth but narrowly missed. MAGIC TAP took contact from an outer rival at the start before brushing an inner foe in the aftermath,
stalked three wide, then two wide into the far turn, bid along with an outer oncharging foe turning for home, but was outmoved by that one entering the lane,
shifted out while sustaining stride, took aim outside of the leader along with an outer foe entering the final furlong, kept on in hopes of bidding between
horses in the final furlong but needed more. GALT pressed two wide and between rivals, came under strong urging along the inside into the far turn, was
shuffled back behind a faltering foe while entering the lane in the two path, yet sustained a chase between horses in upper stretch and kept on for a minor
share. COOKE CREEK bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, failed to sustain position around the far turn, yet regained
stride after swinging to the six path entering the lane and moved up outside of rivals. CREATIVE MINISTER pursued from midpack four wide, chased three
wide around the far turn, then lacked a bid between horses. ROMAN CENTURIAN took light contact from an outer rival while put to a bit of tight quarters
between horses at the start, lagged behind along the inside, entered the lane in the four path and surpassed tired rivals. UNINVITED GUEST tracked along
the inside, but was shuffled back behind a chasing foe with three furlongs to go and faded. TIWANAKU was sent forward after the start to set the pace, but
was headed by an outer pair nearing the five sixteenths pole and subsequently stopped.

Footnotes
I'M A MESS bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside under snug restraint around the first turn, fanned from the four to six
path entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage from an inner bidding counterpart soon after and inched away. ENIGMATIC
stalked along the inside, loomed a danger with run from the pocket around the far turn, brushed an outer rival to take aim in the four path in upper stretch,
bid with an outer foe at the furlong grounds, but was headed by that one in the process, failed to keep pace late and saved place. GENETICS laid off of the
pace two wide and between horses, was outmoved to trail the field entering the lane in the six path, tipped outwardly in upper stretch, then unleashed a
strong late kick outside of foes to miss reaching place. CLASS ACT bobbled and bumped with an inner rival at the start before being brushed between foes
soon after, trailed around both turns, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to bid for show in the final furlong but was outkicked late.
AMERICA'S VOW pursued from midpack two wide and between horses and chased evenly. MURPHY'S GIFT pressed two wide, bid in the three path
entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch but was outkicked by outer rivals at the furlong grounds and gave way. HER BEST FRIEND pursued four
wide, ranged up to attempted a bid entering the lane, but was brushed by an inner rival in upper stretch, yielded between horses in the aftermath, yet
sustained a chase on his left lead late. HAPPY TALK failed to menace three wide. CHARLOTTESAPPROVAL saved ground in midpack, chased and lacked
a bid between horses in the final sixteenth. LOVELAND set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer bidder through upper stretch but weakened at
the furlong grounds. CARARRA tracked three wide and faded between horses in upper stretch.
