Footnotes
SYDNEY STREET (GB) rated in the two path outside rival, ridden along at the quarter pole, launched a bid four deep at the eighth pole, dueled with
FLAVIUS late and got up in the closing moments. FLAVIUS stalked along the rail inside a rival, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out in upper
stretch, challenged between rivals past the eighth pole, inched ahead with a sixteenth remaining, fought with SYDNEY STREET (GB) late and was edged
near the wire. TIZ PLUS prominent early in the two path then moved up to press from outside, raced on even terms approaching the quarter pole, gained
command at the top of the stretch, put away inner rival outside the eighth pole but was soon challenged by a pair of rivals to the outside, lost the lead
entering deep stretch and flattened to third. HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) broke a step slow, settled inside while racing keenly in hand, saved ground through
the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and showed a mild response. DEPARTURE grabbed the early lead and moved inside, set the pace under
pressure from TIZ PLUS to the far turn, dueled with a quarter mile remaining, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened. OVERDUE traveled
three deep at the back early then moved into the two path for the first turn, went between rivals three deep on the backstretch, got put in tight at the
three-eighths pole, moved back into the two path then angled out into the stretch and weakened. BRAZENLY brushed with OVERDUE at the start, settled
between rivals then moved out three wide on the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, trailed two wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SIGNOFTHECROSS fanned five wide into the first turn then dropped back and angled into the three path, moved into range outside rivals up the
backstretch, headed the leader at the five-sixteenths pole then inched ahead, kicked clear three wide into the drive and drew away under a few taps of the
crop and steady handling. TEMBO raced up close four deep and between rivals into the first turn, moved into a stalking position and angled down to the two
path, advanced between rivals then angled in on the backstretch, steered out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, could not make any headway
on the winner in the furlong grounds but churned on for a clear second. SOL DEL SUR sped to the front in the two path, showed the way up the backstretch,
headed at the five-sixteenths pole and relinquished the lead shortly after, chased the winner into the lane and churned on for the show. WARRENS CANDY
MAN coaxed from the gate and showed early speed three deep into the clubhouse turn, chased in the three path into the backstretch, got put in tight
between rivals and steadied at the three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn two wide and faded. PAPALE stalked along the rail, dropped back in the middle
stages, trailed on the inside through the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BIG HAT WILLIE stalked two wide then had to take hold when on heels on the first turn, bid three deep around the second bend, fought into deep stretch,
gained the advantage, had the rider lose his whip then drifted out and bumped BEEF near the wire and held on. BEEF WINSLOW stumbled leaving the
gate, had to steady leaving the first turn, moved inside on the backstretch, drew closer in the two path on the far turn, got boxed in upper stretch, angled out
past the eighth pole, rallied from outside, took a bump from BIG HAT WILLIE near the wire and missed. BIG COUPE dueled into the first turn then took a
stalking position, drew alongside the leader to apply pressure on the backstretch, chased that rival into the far turn, came again to challenge around that
bend, fought between rivals in the lane and got outkicked. LEMON SUSHI dueled into the first turn then took control around the bend, set the pace under
pressure then cleared briefly into the far turn, challenged again by BIG COUPE, maintained a short lead into the stretch, fought inside rivals down the
stretch and yielded grudgingly. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU chased along the rail then tugged the rider forward inside the top pair, settled into a stalking
position on the backstretch, saved ground to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path but could not rally. BIRTH OF COOL threw his head
and came away slow, traveled two wide at the back early, rounded the far turn two then three wide and lacked a response when needed.
RODRIGOKNOWS settled inside then got put in tight on the first turn, trailed into the stretch and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BIG HAT WILLIE FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND MAKING CONTACT WITH BEEF WINSLOW
NEARING THE WIRE, HALTING THAT RIVALS MOMENTUM AND COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
MATANZAS CREEK sped clear and showed the way early, traveled near the inside then two wide into the lane, kept to task through the stretch and was
never challenged. JUDGE MILLER chased three then four wide on the turn, finished willingly down the lane but could not threaten the winner. DEVILISH
DESIRE drifted out a bit to bother rivals early, chased two then three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. HEY BROTHER broke a bit slow, forced out and
steadied early, rounded the bend four then five wide and failed to respond. YANGARRA broke a step slow, got forced out and had to steady early, traveled
along the inside off the pace into the turn and weakened.

rallied to the front at the eighth pole and drove clear. ALLURING veered in and bumped rival at the start, traveled in mid-pack two wide into the turn, angled
out and came four wide into the lane, rallied and got up for second. ASHLEY bumped outer rival at the start, vied for the lead from inside then took hold to
cede command past the half-mile pole, chased along the rail through the turn, had an opening along the fence into the drive but was ridden a bit cautiously
before being given her cue, finished willingly through the late stages but lacked the needed late punch while holding the show. NOT A SINNER (GB)
bumped both sides leaving the gate, had to steady a bit running up behind ASHLEY at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail then two wide into
the stretch, angled out from behind the leaders in upper stretch and showed a mild response to miss the show honors. IMPEC (IRE) vied four then three
deep early, dueled outside rival around the bend and three wide into the stretch, then weakened in the late stages. MO PEARLS PLEASE broke a step
slow, chased off the rail early, exited the bend four wide and lacked a rally. SPIRIT RULES vied three deep then between early, moved over to the rail once
clear of inner rival, dueled around the bend and two wide into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. SCARLET AVENUE broke a step
slow, sat off the pace early, saved ground around the bend, then angled out approaching the stretch and was not a factor. IN YOUR LIFE got bumped on
both sides leaving the gate, saved ground around the bend and failed to menace. LAHAR BLOCKADE broke slow and lost her path, trailed early, went
outside a rival on the turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.

COCKTAIL CUTIE tracked two wide out of range into the turn, drew closer and took aim at the top pair three wide into the stretch, collared the leader at the
eighth pole, kicked clear midstretch and won going away. MUMBLES BROCKMAN off slow to begin, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, went three
then two wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and bested the rest. GIRLCANTHELPIT was off slowest of the tardy starters in the beginning, trailed
to the turn, ran four wide into the lane, produced a mild rally and gained the show. HOT DANZING came away slow then rushed up to take control from
ENVISIONED, cleared that rival near the half-mile pole, put to right handed urging entering the lane, tested at the eighth pole and weakened once
overtaken. SIGNORA VITTORIA raced near the back early, went outside a rival leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail around the bend, improved
position in the lane but failed to threaten. LOVME LIKEAFOOL chased from off the pace along the inside into the turn, had the rider lose his whip
approaching the quarter pole and was never a factor. ENVISIONED broke alertly and took the front, passed by HOT DANZING then chased that rival past
the half-mile pole, remained in range two wide through the turn but weakened in the stretch run. LOOKATHERGLIDE chased three to four wide and faded
down the lane.

Footnotes
BROTHER REID settled off the pace and moved inside, got put in tight approaching the half-mile pole, continued along the rail then in the two path on the
far turn, angled out in upper stretch and surged late to overhaul rivals. DERECHO DANDY traveled along the inside, moved out two wide backstretch, came
three wide into the lane, rallied and took over briefly late but was outclosed by the winner. THIRTY FOUR COUPE stalked from the rail, inched closer on the
far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, drew alongside the leader past the eighth pole and put a head in front midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair in the
final sixteenth. CENTRE CIRCLE tracked from the rail through both turns, moved off the fence in the drive, finished determinedly but needed to find more
late. NUMERO DIX (GB) tucked inside at the back, moved outside rivals on the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, angled out in the drive and kept
on to improve position. WORSE READ SANCHEZ unhurried early on and steered inside, saved ground to the stretch, waited for room through the lane and
was given a mild coaxing once a clear path opened late. PAPA TIGER sped clear from inside, opened up a large lead in the middle stages, remained well
clear through the far turn, started to grow weary entering the final furlong, lost command shortly after and weakened in deep stretch. THE KEY IS UNITY
traveled three deep around both turns, moved out in the drive and lacked further response. WORKDAY stalked in the two path, cut into the lead on the far
turn but flattened out in the lane. NOBLE UNION broke a step slow, pulled early between rivals then raced two wide near the back, lost positions in to the far
turn, trailed exiting that bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LORD TRIPPING rated three wide early, bid outside the leader past the half-mile pole, took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, fought between rivals leaving
the bend, battled inside GHOSTLY ACT through the length of the stretch and held gamely. GHOSTLY ACT chased three then two wide early, bid three
deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost touch with inner rivals into the far turn, re-bid three deep around the bend, fought with LORD TRIPPING down the
lane while drifting out some and could not get by. ANTIBES rank in the early going while traveling two wide, continued to fight the rider early on the
backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide, summoned a mild rally and gained the show honors. MAXVILLE saved ground off the pace, tipped
three wide on the far turn and lacked a late bid. TOPPERS WAGER taken back and moved inside, pulled on the first turn and backstretch, tried to sneak
through a tight spot leaving the far turn and brushed with AVIATOR NATION, continued along the fence and got put in tight in upper stretch, kept on
determinedly in the late stages and improved position. DARK MARCUS settled three deep near the back, moved into range four deep in the middle stages,
bothered by inner rival and steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, entered the stretch three wide and lacked a rally. TOUCHDOWN KITTLE pulled early on
the inside, shifted to the two path on the far turn, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch and weakened. AVIATOR NATION stalked in the two path,
between rivals into the far turn, brushed with TOPPERS WAGER entering the stretch, tipped out and could not rally. THE FUSS was off slow to begin,
trailed early and had to steady behind rival into the first turn, continued at the back and never got involved. SEA BREEZE BOY stepped to the front and
moved inside, challenged past the half-mile pole, dueled into and around the far turn, chased outer rivals into the stretch, got bumped from outside in upper
stretch and gave way.
