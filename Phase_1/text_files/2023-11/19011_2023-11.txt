settled then raced four wide in upper stretch making a mild bid but was no menace. ACERTIVE MISS was two wide early then shuffled back into the turn,
made a mild rally but was no threat. G KATE chased the early pace while inside, was used up and faltered. MY GOLDEN BLING was unruly in the gate then

pace while three wide into the turn, was making a bid in the stretch and gaining ground and was up for the place in deep stretch. BLAME DAY chased the
early pace while inside on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but was out finished in late stretch for the place. HOT SPRINGS BLING was settled then
rallied four wide in upper stretch but was no menace in late stretch. WILD EXPRESS chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, was used up then
faltered in the stretch drive. HOW BOUT ME was unhurried early and no menace in the stretch. GIMME CANDY was inside on the turn and no factor in the
