Footnotes
EARLY DAWN showed good early speed to set the pace, drew clear on the turn and as clearly much the best in the end. THURSDAY MORNING was hard
to load then settled early, rallied four wide on the turn and was making up ground to be second best. LUNCH LADY chased the early pace while inside into
the turn, made a bid then faltered in the stretch. BRIDLED UP broke very slow from the gate then settled, rallied and moved out to be five wide for the
stretch run and closed willingly in the end. BROOKE'S ALL IN was unhurried early then saved ground on the turn, made a mild rally but was no threat. OUR
CLOVER GAL rallied four wide on into the turn making a bid but flattened out in the drive. GRACE'S SOLDIER was unhurried early while inside on the turn
and no threat. PIECE OF ME chased the early pace while two wide, was used up and gave way. APRIORITY GIRL chased the early pace while three wide
then stopped on the turn. ROADSIDE GIRL bucked jumped soon after the start and was pulled up by the rider and walked off.
