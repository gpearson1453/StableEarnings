MINEOLA MIKE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept sharp through
the stretch. PRESSURE settled inside on the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came
along to take second nearing mid-stretch. RAGTIME RICHES stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
then flattened passing the eighth pole. NORLANDER raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail
on the far turn. TAPADINE raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole but showed little response.

contested the edge through the far turn, dueled at even terms in the upper stretch but was met a sixteenth away and flattened later yards. LA MADDALENA
took over and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, remained
close at the rail on the far turn but weakened the final sixteenth. VERY VENUS stalked two deep the first turn, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole
and raced close between horses on the far turn, but flattened stride mid-stretch. FRENCHIES GOLD stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, angled in leaving the turn but showed little more. ABUNDANT STORY saved ground.
UNUSUALLY LUCKY dwelled several lengths behind her opposition leaving the gate and could only save ground.
