Footnotes
LUST FOR LIFE took command shortly from the gate, opened a well rated advantage, pulled clear in upper stretch and was never seriously threatened.
RIVERS OF DENIRO stalked the pacesetter throughout, was unable to match the winner and finished willingly to be second best. AFTER SUNRISE tracked
the leader into the turn, split rivals with a bid on the bend to loom turning for home, lugged in while tiring through the lane causing REIGNING DREAM to be
in tight and steady down the lane. REIGNING DREAM raced up the fence prompting the early pace, dropped back on the turn losing positions, cut the
corner turning for home and rallied up the rail down the lane while in close quarters. HEZA PISTOL broke a step slow to be at the rear, rushed up down the
backside to contend, rallied six wide in the turn with an early bid and finished evenly passing weakening rivals in the lane. C V DYNAMIC well placed while
caught five wide in the turn and lacked a closing response. KELLEHER was never a threat. ONE STEP ASIDE was not a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND THE RIDER OF REIGNING DREAM CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN,
UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS PLACED AFTER SUNRISE FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
KERANOS stalked the pace from three wide, made a steady advance on the turn to engage the leaders turning for home and drew clear convincingly. DOMI
tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied willingly down the lane to gain the place while no match for the winner. MAS ORO dueled on the lead from the
rail, briefly surrendered the lead in the turn, regained the lead turning for home and kept on well through the stretch. SWELTER well placed just off the pace
down the backside, dropped back losing position in the turn and came on again late down the lane. MINDSHIP Q raced wide through the turn and in the
stretch while showing some late interest. OUTSLEWTHEM bobbled slightly leaving the gate, hustled up two wide to duel on the pace briefly taking the lead
in the turn and tired in the stretch. BELL CURVE was never a threat.

Footnotes
COUNTEVERYBLESSING bumped by outside rival leaving the gate to be near the rear early, rallied three wide with an early bid in the turn to take
command turning for home, repelled the challenge of the runner-up in mid-stretch and pulled away nearing the wire. JUSTA LITTLE MOORE broke inward
to bump rival, raced up mid-pack down the backside, had to be hard held off heels, found racing room on the bend angling to the rail to cut the corner
turning for home, challenged the winner in the lane and was out-finished. LIVING THE DREAM reserved off the pace to the quarter pole and rallied willingly
in the lane to be the best of the rest. SHAKE THE FROST pressed the pace from three wide through the turn and finished evenly down the lane. STRIKING
LAD raced near the rear of the field to the head of the stretch, angled six wide and showed some late interest. LUCKY VICTOR tracked the leaders through
the turn and failed to respond with a closing rally. AKIMBO showed brief speed and gave way. SEEKING FREEDOM failed to menace. TAHLEQUAH JOE
sped up between rivals to duel on the early pace, took command in the turn and tired turning for home.

Footnotes
SAVESOMEFORME pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn, rallied determinedly through the lane and prevailed late in the drive. SWEET AS
MERRIE set a pressured pace to the head of the lane, briefly opened the advantage in mid-stretch and was outkicked late in the lane. HALO EFFECT broke
outward to bump rival leaving the gate, tracked the leaders from between horses in the second flight into the turn and finished well while drifting out through
the stretch. TITEBLUEJEANS reserved off the pace from three wide to the top of the lane and mounted a mild bid in the lane. DEE'S KY WILDCAT well
placed early along the rail in the second group, lost position dropping back through the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. HAUGHTY PRAISE bumped
hard by inside rival leaving the gate to be squeezed between horses and forced to the back of the pack and never menaced from there. TWILIGHT BEAUTY
chased the pace from three wide to midway on the bend and faded. OHIO LADY trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
SAVVY LAYLA set the pace shortly away from the gates, cleared in the turn, responded when called upon at the head of the lane when threatened and
drew off in deep stretch. PAT DADDY prompted the pace to the quarter pole, made a threatening bid in upper stretch, was repelled and kept on well in the
lane a clear second best. UNCLEJACKOMO chased the pacesetter through the turn from four wide and failed to gain ground on the top pair while holding
on to the show. LOCK ON unhurried in the early going, angled out to the seven path at the head of the lane and mounted a mild bid in the lane. CALL
WEST slow early to be near the back of the pack and made up positions with a late gain. ROYAL CRUSADER rated in mid-pack to the quarter pole and
passed weaker down the stretch while rallying along the fence. NYOMAN contended for a half mile and flattened out in the drive. NOBLE BEHAVIOR went
one paced failing to menace. CAPTAIN MAD JACK showed speed to be on the pace for a quarter mile and was through early. TIDE RISING was never a
factor.

ALEXIS N NIKO set a pressured pace from the fence, dueled through the far turn with the runner-up, shook clear in mid-stretch and drew away gamely.
ONEMORANDTHECHECK pressed the pace from three wide into the backstretch, dueled with the winner through the far turn taking a brief lead and kept
on well as the obvious second best in a good effort. KILLER BEE slow early to be the distant trailer, rallied into the far turn and made a steady advance to
gain the show. THE EQUINEST tracked the leaders to the top of the lane saving ground and failed to gain ground. THISPOINTINTIME unhurried for the first
half mile and rallied mildly passing tiring rivals in the stretch. RED COMET failed to menace. DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND prompted the pace from five wide
to the quarter pole and faded in the lane. GOTIGER SPECIAL chased the leaders from wide on the track for three quarters and never posed a threat.
UNION LEAGUE showed speed for a half mile, was through early and was pulled up and walked off.

SCRIMPER settled in hand from three wide to prompt the pace to the turn, assumed command on the bend, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and
drew away while geared down late. WHO DA BOSS tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide in the turn to make a bid, was no match for the winner
and finished well to be second best. GAPPER slow early to trail the field, made a five wide steady advance to be up for the show. VILLIAN reserved off the
pace to be near the rear of the pack, and made a mild stretch rally passed weaker rivals. ROLL ON BIG O pressed the pace for a half mile and weakened in
the lane. SOCIAL HISTORY contended early, dropped back to the rear in the turn and gained position along the fence in the stretch. KINDERHOOK well
placed in the early going and faded. RED CHILI PEPPER flashed speed up the fence to take the lead in the first quarter and came up empty.

Footnotes
NEED TO KNOW BASIS reserved off the pace down the backside to be mid-pack, commenced a rally into the far turn splitting rivals in the second flight,
waited behind the three front-runners at the quarter pole while angling four wide, angled back to inside the drifting leader in upper stretch and pulled clear
late in the drive. MUGSY MALONE stalked the pace to the far turn, made an early bid to take command nearing the quarter pole from three wide, continued
to drift out turning for home and kept on through the lane while unable to match the winner. AULD LANGE SYNE well placed along the fence after settling
just off the leaders, cut the corner turning for home and failed to gain on the top pair. VAIL OF HONOR slow early to be the distant trailer, closed significant
ground to the turn and showed good late energy in the lane. OKLAHOMA JOE set the pace under pressure down the backside and weakened coming
home. DISTORTED LIMITS went evenly failing to menace. EXONERATED PREZ was forced to be well wide in the first turn, dropped to the rail down the
backstretch and was never a threat having failed to mount a closing rally when called upon. DEVIL'S HARVEST pressed the pace for a half mile, made an
early bid in the turn to threaten and gave way at the top of the lane.
