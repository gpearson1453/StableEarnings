Footnotes
DIXIERIBSY was throttled down nestling smartly on the rail at the half, waited patiently inside throughout the far turn, pounced on the fence at the top of the
lane, wore down the leader in mid- stretch and was drawing off in the late running. I'M TENACIOUS settled in midfield under a snug hold along the
backstretch, made a bold move rallying four wide around horses at the quarter pole, took command at the eighth pole, could not sustain the run and faded in
deep stretch just holding for second money. POWAQA trailed the field in the early going, began to pick up foes at the three furlong pole, swung outside five
wide gaining momentum turning for home and closed in down the lane just missing the place share in the end. I'M AWESOME tracked two wide between
rivals at the half, could not match strides with others making a move at the quarter pole and willingly ran to the wire for a minor role. LADIES RUM stalked
near the rear on the rail in the beginning, was roused inside three eighths from home, offered no response and showed a little energy passing a couple of
weary runners down the stretch. GET MY DRIFT was off a step sow to begin, was nudged three deep down the backside taking closer order tracking three
deep at the half, was scrubbed on for more three wide at the quarter pole to be in the hunt at the top of the lane, drifted inwards weakening to the rail at the
furlong marker and gave way on the fence late. FEATHERWEIGHT was hustled down the backside to emerge with a clear lead at the half mile marker,
continued up front dictating the pace around the bend, was engulfed by runners on either side turning for home and emptied out in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY had one rival beat down the backside, started to uncork her run four wide going outside runners at the quarter pole, loomed widest in
the six path driving to the wire and was full of run late to draw off convincingly in deep stretch. BAREFOOT SERVANTU travelled in midfield on the outside
down the backstretch, was steadied between rivals at the seven sixteenths marker, quickly recovered to swoop around horses four wide through the far turn,
took command at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner late. ALMONTE PRINCESS was brushed inside on the break, stalked near the rear
in the beginning, improved on the rail along the backside, shifted outside three furlongs to go starting a run, was in the hunt four wide straightening out for
the drive and finished up mildly to be a non threatening third crossing the wire. SNOW LAKE settled in mid-pack on the inside down the back straight, was
stuck on the rail behind the tiring early leader with five sixteenths to run, angled outside at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest to the finish
line to settle on the fringes in the end. QUEEN OF THE COURT had a good position down the backside all alone watching the pair up front dueling, was
asked midway on the final turn, made a mild run, lost some positioning turning for home and was one paced through the stretch passing tired foes.
DEFAMATION tracked the front pair outside foes on the first turn, was shuffled back some down the backside, made a brief move running three wide
outside horses at the three eighths marker until the quarter pole and levelled off on the wrong lead with a furlong to go. MOMASCREST prompted two wide
on the outside in the first turn, contested up front outside down the backstretch, assumed control three furlongs from the line, was clinging to the lead inside
at the top of the lane, could not find more and retreated on the fence in mid-stretch. CLASSIC GLORY was unhurried to trail the field in the early stages,
could not catch up to runners on the field turn and passed the tiring early frontrunner in upper stretch. IRON PRINCESS was brushed outside on the break,
regrouped to take this field on the rail into the first turn, dueled inside down the back straight, had no more to give on the fence with three furlongs to go and
backed away through the field on the inside around the far turn.

Footnotes
HEEZESPEEDY tracked outside in the second flight down the back straight, pounced three wide for the lead at the quarter pole, determinedly fought on
gamely between runners up front at the furlong marker and held off the closing rival in deep stretch. CHUNKY MONKEY had one beaten down the backside,
rallied three wide circling foes at the quarter pole, posed the main threat four wide on the outside turning for home, chased the winner through the stretch
but could not reel in the winner at the wire. MENDELJOHN (IRE) seized the lead on the break, hounded the pace outside through the turn, bid for the front
with rivals on each side at the quarter pole and faded from the top pair in mid-stretch to settle for a clear third in the end. WILD CONVERSATION tracked on
the rail in the second flight inside down the backstretch, waited patiently behind the front pair through the turn, angled outside in the three path at the top of
the lane and mildly finished to the wire to be a fringe player. CHICAGO FREDDY pressed the issue on the rail down the backside, had a slim advantage on
the fence entering the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole and yielded on the fence in upper stretch. J M R TUREK leapt up on the break spotting
the field by many down the back straight, could not get involved around the bend and could not overcome the poor start to be a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MI CORAZON settled in midpack along the inside, angle out to the four path on the turn and into range turning for home, drove by the leaders at the seventy
yard pole and inched away late. HOT CARGO sat midpack early, moved up to stalk and press the leader on the turn, bid outside the eventual third place
finisher for the front at the eighth pole and outgamed that one for place late. CHROMEPLATED HEART chased inside the leaders, angled out to split rivals
for the lead at the furlong pole, but was outgamed for the top two spots in the final stages. REMEMBERING RHODA had one rival beat early, circled four to
five wide on the turn but could not match the winner's late run, rallying on for a minor award while still widest late. GOLDEN SUZIE in midpack two wide
down the backside outside the eventual winner, but could only finish evenly down the lane without threatening. MACHINA stumbled just after the break and
trailed the field, put in a rail run into upper stretch, navigated around a stopping rival at the eighth pole and was in hand late. BIG GINGER stalked the early
leader, dropped off around the turn but was still in range upper stretch before fading late. WINGS FROM ABOVE quickly crossed over to lead from his
outside stall, was pressed by a rival on the turn and held stubbornly to the eighth pole before retreating.

Footnotes
SOCIAL DRINKER was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backside, continued to see the field around the turn, cruised around horses in hand five
wide at the quarter pole, had a quick turn of foot when set down at the furlong marker, took control at the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task to hold
comfortably at the wire. RIFLING travelled near the front between the two leaders at the half, was shuffled back some losing positioning at the three furlong
marker, began to edge closer on the inside with two furlongs to go, shot up the rail to poke her head in front momentarily at the eighth pole but could not
hold off the fast moving winner in deep stretch. SWIRLING DANCER pressed the pace outside down the back straight, dueled up front outside throughout
the turn, was in the mix between rivals on the lead straightening out for home, stubbornly fought on with runners on each side and held for the show money
in the end. SPANISH BEAUTY stalked three wide outside down the backstretch, made a strong move bursting between foes at the three furlong marker,
loomed boldly five wide at the top of the lane but could not find another gear late and stalled in the final furlong for a minor role at the wire. ROOKIE COURT
settled in midfield four wide down the backstretch, kept pace outside rivals running four wide around the bend, was in range behind the leaders in the three
path straightening out for the drive but could not offer a finish to be a factor in deep stretch. PERFECT PROVISION emerged with the lead running inside
rivals at the half, battled on the fence maintaining a slim advantage through the turn, was headed outside by horses at the top of the lane and tired between
foes at the sixteenth pole. MISS BIKINI stalked near the rear on the rail in the early going, was steadied two times on the fence through the turn and could
not recover to reach contention on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
PUDDINGONTHERITZ took control from the start, opened up on the field down the backstretch, cruised up front unchallenged through the turn, had mild
pressure on his outside at the top of the lane, was asked for more in mid-stretch and drew off smartly in the final furlong. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW tracked the
pace outside down the backside, chased outside around the turn, was in range if good enough three wide straightening out to the wire, could not reel in the
winner who had something left at the furlong pole and stubbornly saved the place share in a photo at the finish line. ZAKHARI stalked near the rear between
horses in the early going, could see the field with three furlongs remaining, swung five wide turning for home, found his best stride late splitting runners in
the two path in deep stretch and just missed the pace share at the finish. SOCIETY'S THUNDER broke outwards at the start, tracked the frontrunning
winner on the fence down the backside, chased through the turn, dueled on the fence for the runners up share in mid-stretch but faded on the rail late to
garner a small piece of the prize at the wire. SANDRONE began to lengthen stride three wide outside runners at the half mile marker, made a brief run three
wide at the three eighths pole closing in on the leaders through the turn, posed a threat four wide at the top of the lane, could not find more in upper stretch
and evened out in the last furlong. WEALLLIKEDHIM was coaxed outside for position after the start, made little progress travelling in mid-pack around the
bend and could not make any impact driving to the finish line. SUPER SICILY was pinched on the break trailing on the fence down the backstretch, was
urged at the seven sixteenths marker catching up to the field, made little headway on the turn and had nothing to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LONG POND stumbled on the break, quickly recovered to track two wide between horses down the backstretch, was tucked in smartly behind the
frontrunner on the turn, waiting for his cue, bullied his way between foes in the two path turning for home and wore down the pacesetter through the lane to
inch away for the win at the wire. AMBER LIGHT emerged with the lead entering the backstretch, was pressed outside through the running around the bend,
collared outside by the winner at the furlong pole, fought on gamely to the wire, never giving up but could not re-rally in deep stretch. ROOKIE RADAR
trailed the field down the backside, commenced a run three wide around horses at the three eighths marker, loomed a threat four wide at the top of the lane,
could not quicken with the top pair in upper stretch but tenaciously held off challengers at the wire for third money. HIGHLAND LIFE tracked three deep
outside of foes down the back straight, closed in prompting the pace outside around the oval, was in the thick of things in the three path turning for home
and finished up mildly with rivals on each side to hold for a small share at the wire. FOREST STAR tracked the pacesetter on the rail in the early going,
could not maintain forward position at the half mile marker, saved ground on the fence throughout the the turn and willingly finished up on the fence down
the lane to be involved for a minor placing in the end. PRINCE OF THIEVES stalked near the back three wide outside horses, took closer order to track
outside beside the eventual winner on the turn, could not keep pace with others at the quarter pole and flattened out in upper stretch. MIDNIGHT ARKLE
had one beaten stalking between foes down the back straight, could see the field running outside rivals on the turn and was not a presence in the drive to
the finish line.

Footnotes
SPANISH SERENADE had a good spot on the outside tracking the engaged duo down the backside, pounced to take command at the quarter pole and
courageously held off all challengers from either side down the stretch for the hard fought victory. BROTHER BELEN was alone in the third flight stalking the
leaders at the half, crept closer to the front pair three wide between horses at the quarter pole, had his sights locked in on the winner in the three path
straightening out for the drive and was determinedly inching closer with every stride to the wire but just could not get there in the end. MANETKA advanced
smartly on the fence having clear run with five sixteenths from home, shifted outside in the three path at the top of the lane, lacked room, quickly veered
inside in upper stretch and weaved through runners to the wire and surged between foes closing in late in a three way finish for the win. GET READY SET
FIRE had a slim advantage on the rail while hounded outside down the backstretch, was headed outside by the winner at the quarter pole, fought stubbornly
on the fence in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong showing a solid effort inside through to the wire. DIXIE'S FLATTER had a good
position in the second flight tracking on the rail down the backside, patiently waited behind the front trio midway on the turn, angled outside for clear run in
the three path turning for home, was in tight quarters at the furlong pole and lacked a late run nearing the wire. DISCOVERY CHART stalked between foes
near the back in the early stages, was steadied with runners on each side at the five sixteenths marker, regrouped advancing on the fence in upper stretch,
lacked running room in the final sixteenth, angled outside at the seventy yard marker but could not rally in deep stretch. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN was slow to
start, settled in midfield down the backstretch, made a good rally three wide midway through the turn to be in range in the five path straightening out for
home, could not sustain the run and levelled out in the final furlong. NGABE stalked three deep outside foes down the back straight, made a mild run three
wide at the three eighths marker until the quarter pole, was fanned out six wide turning for home and could not offer a finish on the wrong lead to the line.
STREET SERENADE travelled in mid-pack down the backstretch through the turn, shifted outside in the five path for the stretch run, began to reach for
ground gaining on rivals in mid-stretch, lost its path at the seventy yard pole, clipping heels and could not recover in time in deep stretch to pose a threat.
HOLIDAY IN CHILE missed the break slightly to see the field down the backstretch, caught up to runners by the three furlong marker, was checked briefly
inside the five sixteenths marker and could not get involved driving to the wire. FIRST CLASS LOVE was away slowly having one rival beaten down the
backstretch, could not get interested trailing the field around the bend and was not a factor in the running down the stretch. LITTLE DOMI pressed the issue
on the outside down the back straight, could not go on between runners giving way midpoint through the turn and was not persevered with in upper stretch.
