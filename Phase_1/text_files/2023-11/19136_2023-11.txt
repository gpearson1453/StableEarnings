Footnotes
IRISH FLIGHT exchanged contact with MOON FALL leaving the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, took the
lead in the three path approaching the head of the lane and was kept alert to draw away the final sixteenth. The latter exchanged contact with Irish Flight
leaving the gate and was bumped by JUBA'S MOCHA a stride later, rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and got up for second under the wire. JUBA'S MOCHA angled out and made contact
with Moon Fall soon after the start then stalked from the three path, closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole, was met nearing the head of the
lane then nipped from second under the wire. LORD CLANCY took a slim lead at the rail at the nine sixteenths pole, was met and gave chase toward the
three eighths, raced close near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. LUNAR GHOST angled in early and settled well
off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and passed rivals outside. COLONIAL ROAD saved
ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. TO THE TOP rated close inside on the first turn, was kept in check through
the backstretch and offered no response on the far turn. SHINEY GHOST set the early pace off the rail but was met and gave chase leaving the nine
sixteenths pole, dropped back toward the three eighths and faded readily.

Footnotes
ALDRINALINE saved ground on the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the four and five paths on the far turn, dug in from the
head of the lane to get up later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. SIENTE EL AMOR rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole and took the nod two deep approaching the head of the lane but was met passing the sixteenths pole and relented later yards. MODERN
DAY ROMANCE was forced out then bore out into the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but
steadied at the heels of Charitable Windsor approaching the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. OCEAN STORM came out a path into the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. CHARITABLE WINDSOR took over in
the three path entering the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail approaching the eighth
pole and weakened the final sixteenth. WELL EQUIPPED saved ground racing well back, showed little response through the backstretch then angled to the
outside leaving the far turn. MEETMARYSMAN showed little response. JEFFERSON SECURITY rated close inside on the opening turn then faded through
the backstretch.

REIGN ON AND ON pressured the pace and took the nod in the three path approaching the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to
hold on well. GRANDIOSELY steadied at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted leaving the turn but finished well to take
second later yards. SCARLET TANAGER gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and dug in to take third the final yards.
DING DING was hustled to the front leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge at the rail on the turn but was met toward the
eighth pole and flattened from mid-stretch. MAKE IT A DOUBLE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and five paths, left the
turn outside and passed some rivals. ONE TOUGH ROSE chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, angled out entering the lane
and showed little more. SALSA RITA gave chase inside but flattened at the rail on the turn. SECRET AFFIRMATION was not a factor.

Footnotes
AIR MEDAL settled off the pace about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn then only
moderately urged in the lane. MARCUS JUNIUS raced in the six path early, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
settled for second best. MOON SIGN rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn
and weakened. ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more.
TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rounded the first turn about the five path, moved to the inside afterward and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. I SEE NOTHING raced off the rail early on, picked up the chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole but showed
little response. GET OFF MY CLOUD stalked the early pace about the three path then faded through the backstretch. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK stalked the
early pace from the three and four paths then faded leaving the second turn. LOVE MACHINE was taken up shortly after the start and walked off post race.

through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn, left the turn outside and finished well to take third the final strides. BRION took an immediate lead
and set a pressured pace, contested the edge off the rail on the turn, but was met nearing mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. TRAPPE THE GOLD
gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND gave only distant chase and saved ground into the turn. HUEY
DUEY pressured the pace inside, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. ADIOS SEE YA was

Footnotes
SOMEDAY IS TODAY stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the nod between horses approaching the head of the lane, dueled
clear past the eighth pole and drew off the final sixteenth. LUCKY BLONDE was reluctant to load then saved ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and got up for second under the wire. NO DENYING DENIS raced in the four path early
then saved ground leaving the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, was eased to the four
path into the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. JUBASLILBALLERINA settled close in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the half
mile pole and dueled to a slim brief lead three wide midway on the far turn, but was met entering the stretch and flattened late. MOONLIT SHADOW rated
the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the nine sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened inside the eighth pole.
SENECA ROCKS raced off the pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane.
AZZURRA raced off the early pace about the three path, left the second turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path
on the far turn and showed little in the lane. REVEIRS MINUTE rounded the opening turn about the five path then stalked two deep from the seven eighths
pole, moved to even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole but gave way toward the three eighths.
