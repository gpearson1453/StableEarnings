DIANE'S MERLOT dueled outside, took over at the quarter pole then pulled away under urging through the stretch. STEAL THE DEAL stalked the dueling
leaders three wide, bid on the turn then proved no match for the winner. BONNIE PARKER earned a narrow advantage inside, vied to the stretch and faded.
EMILY'S ON FIRE lagged far behind inside then passed rivals without menacing. HYACINTH BUCKET raced within striking range early then began fading
on the turn. VICTORIOUSVICTORIA broke a bit awkwardly, raced just off the pace inside then gave way in the stretch.

WHISKEY PRIZE, took over and drew clear under urging. MAJESTIC LION raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch,
rallied outside and finished well for the place spot. WHISKEY PRIZE set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, dueled with the
winner in upper stretch, dug in and was outfinished for second. BIG POPPER tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a rally.
MCMAGIC stumbled after the start, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. LAST DREAM raced off the pace, chased on the far turn
and failed to threaten. PRINCIPE was outrun.

TIPSY GIRL controlled the pace, repelled a challenge and pulled away rapidly through the stretch while ridden out. SO FULLY SUE settled inside, bid on
the final turn and rallied for the place. TWIST HER prompted the pacesetter outside to the stretch and weakened. GRYPHON'S WINGS lacked speed,
moved wide on the final turn and was no factor. CIVIL NOTION chased off the pace outside and was finished after half a mile. DIXIE GROOVE broke
poorly, trailed most of the trip then caught a fading rival. FANCY SCEPTER prompted the pace inside then began faltering on the final turn.

MADURAI broke slowest, rushed to contention, bid inside to the front before half a mile, led and stayed safe under urging. CLANCY O'TOOLE far behind
early, advanced wide and finished strongly too late. STANDPOINT went after the winner after half a mile, pressed that one then went evenly late. LOVE
SHAQ trailed for half a mile then picked off rivals without menacing. ZIO SALINO unruly prior to the start, saved ground and lacked a response. ZONA DE
AMIGOS dropped back early and was never involved. CHECKING BOXES prompted the pace outside briefly then gave way. I CAN DO MAGIC was
prominent for three furlongs and stopped. CRAIGH NA DUN led clearly inside then gave way before half a mile.
