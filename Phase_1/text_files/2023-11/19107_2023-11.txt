Footnotes
RB NASH BASH broke outwardly and bumped rival, then set the pace while two wide, drew off leaving the bend and held sway down the stretch to prove
best. SAINT SILKIE AA stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn to gain second position at the quarter pole
then rallied in the stretch but it was not enough to win in the end. UPTOWN WALK THE LINE stalked the pace from the inside then menaced on the turn
with an outer rival for the place position then flattened out in the stretch. WMA OLIVER was bumped at the start, then raced at the back of the pack, made a
mild bid on the turn and came up empty in the end. CONSEQUENTLY settled along the inside and was no threat. BLAZING STAR AA raced in the middle of
the pack while two wide at a moderate pace then faded after the turn. WMA BADGE bid briefly from the inside at the start then settled back and failed to
rally.
