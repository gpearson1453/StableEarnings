Footnotes
PRINCESS JAVONCIA rated along from the inside down the backstretch under a firm hold, ridden along between two deep near the five sixteenths pole
and finished well to prove best under strong handling. ESPERANNNA was rushed early on to set the early pace, dug in from the inside and kept on gamely
to the wire. INSTINCTIVE settled early to race mid pack early, was three deep near the five eighths pole, angled in a bit through the drive and rallied
willingly to the wire. POUNDING MUSIC stalked the pace from the outside of rivals, shifted out to three to four wide and flattened out in the final stages.
NICOLAR lag early on along the inside, angled out through the drive and moved up to improve position. BRAMBLE BUSH was off slowly, raced off the early
going after the poor start, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. COMPLETE was checked in the early stages, raced off the early pace,
was three deep near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. CUPIDS DREAM dropped back early, hard ridden near the rail through the far turn and needed
more. CHA CHA MISSION was in tight at the break, waited for racing room near the three eighths pole and had no late response. BRUMMAGEM was
forwardly place to lay up close early on, checked near the quarter pole and faded from the outside.

Footnotes
SPEEDYNESS was clear early on near the rail, asked near the eighth pole and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. CAP COM tracked the early
leader from the outside, dug in to keep on to secure the second place finish. MASAKADO settled off the early pace, raced near the inside throughout and
finished well late. KING'S RIVER tracked the early pace setters from the inside, continued its inside run through the far turn, angled through the stretch and
gave way grudgingly. NOTION OF LOVE stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide and was empty late. CATALEYA STRIKE raced off the
early pace four deep, was fanned eight wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. THEDINGOATEYOBABY was roughed up at the break, raced
near the back after the poor start, swung wide into the lane and never threatened. SUGA STEVE stumbled badly at the break, bumped soundly, coaxed
along early and was empty in the drive. SECRET ZIPPER raced off the early going, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and never menaced. HIS
RIGHTS void of early speed, saved ground through the far turn into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
FLOGE rated along under a hold from the outside, ridden along near the three eighths pole, raced four wide in the drive and edged up in a determined run
under strong pressure. NO WALK INTHE PARK dueled two deep from the outside of rival, dug in inside the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire.
SKIP THRU DA FIRE dueled for the early lead near the rail and weakened a bit in the final stages. SHOCKING FACTS tracked the pace setters from the
inside, took aim into the upper stretch but weakened the final three sixteenths of a mile. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS dropped back to race mid pack early, was
four deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a response. FLINNY TIN TIN raced with the second flight early on, saved ground through the far turn
and lacked a bid. PRINCESS ANISA was off a step slow, saved ground and never threatened. VALLEY STAR failed to respond. MARTHA'S HEART was in
early pursuit from the far outside and tired readily. IT STARTS NOW prompt the early pace three deep, faltered past the five sixteenths pole and was eased
up on late while racing far back.
