BLACKTECA dueled for the early lead two deep from the outside of rival, shook duel nearing the five sixteenths pole, dug in late near the inside and proved
best under strong handling. COURTMAN chased the early dueling pair near the inside, eased out near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire.
FIELD OF VISION raced off the early pace, three deep around the far turn, swung six wide into the upper lane and closed in well late on the to pair. OLDER
AND WISER was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, moved up four to six wide around rivals through the far turn, raced from the far
outside in the drive and closed in mildly. GYPSY'S SOULMATE dropped back early, raced three wide around far turn and had no final winning bid in the
drive racing five deep. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE dueled for the early lead near the rail and gave way. SCORING DRIVE void of early speed, raced four to
five wide in the stretch run and had no response. MAIN DUDE raced mid pack, saved ground and never threatened. SALUTE NOW chased the pace from
the outside and faded.

prevailed under strong handling in a determined run. OKUDAH raced four wide near the seven eighths pole, settled off the early pace setters, made a three
wide bid nearing the five sixteenths to challenge, raced from the outside in the drive and missed in a game effort. TURN ON THE MAGIC settled off the
early going, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ROOSTER RUN raced mid pack early, was two deep around the
far turn, raced, from the inside in the drive and had not enough. KEYS INCLUDED was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break,
raced back early after the poor start, shifted wide into the upper lane and had no late rally. ARCTIC ROSE was unhurried early on, angled wide in the drive
and had no late rally. VIM AND VIGOR raced off the early pace, hard ridden near the three eighths pole from the inside, angled through the upper lane and

Footnotes
NEXT LEVEL showed good early foot to set his own uncontested early pace, dug in near the rail at the eighth pole and prevailed under all out pressure.
FUNNYFLAME tracked the early leader two deep in hand, took aim nearing the three sixteenths pole racing two to three wide but couldn't get by in a game
effort. NIGHT OUT rated along under a firm hold from the inside, waited for racing room into the upper stretch, angled out nearing the three sixteenths pole
and finished gamely to the wire. Jockey of Night Out claimed objection for interference in the stretch run against Funnyflame and stewards ruled no change.
POPWEISER broke awkwardly, rated back early, ridden from the inside near the three eighths pole and was even with no closing run. SPOKEN CODE
raced near the back of the pack in the early stages, swung six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. NIGHT MOVER stalked the top trio, raced three
to four wide around the far turn and was empty in the drive.

racing from the outside. SWIFT AS I AM raced at the back of the pack early on, was two to three wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position
while racing from the outside. CHASING TIME raced off the early pace, saved ground through the far turn, eased out through the upper stretch and

Footnotes
ANGELIC KNIGHT stalked the pace from the outside, continued an outside run in the stretch, took command near the eighth pole and drew off under steady
handling. AZTEC GEM sprinted clear early on and was no match for the winner the final eighth of a mile. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE broke through the gate
pre-race, ran off a short distance, stalked the top trio, raced five wide into the upper lane, shifted ins and kept on to the wire. YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU raced
mid pack early, was three to four wide and had no final winning bid. GRAY DANE dropped back to race with the second flight early, raced near the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. PARKER NOW chased the pace from the inside and gave way. HE'S A GOOD CHAP raced
mid pack early on, five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. OUR MAJESTIC raced off the early going, swung seven wide into the upper
stretch had no late rally. RENATI raced five wide around the far turn, fanned wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. HARD KINGS lost ground to
race far back and never menaced.
