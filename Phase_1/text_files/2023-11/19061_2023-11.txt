Footnotes
SAN PANTALEO broke in but was away quickly, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, shook off a foe in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady handling. CURLIN'S
GIRL was slow into stride and spotted the winner several lengths, settled while unhurried at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, was roused six
wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, gained while lugging in to the finish and secured the place then galloped out in front. MITOLE
MAGIC bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was asked while saving ground on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, moved
out late and just got up for the show. RADIANT QUEEN made light contact with a foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted
along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch and just missed the show. AGRA stalked the pace on the
outside, ranged up in the three path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner while asked for her best in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. ECHO BAYBE (IRE) was hustled from the gate, tracked the leader down the backstretch, dropped back
in the two path early on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, shifted to the three path late on that bend, came four wide into upper stretch, moved
out near the three-sixteenths pole then drifted out under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and came up empty. STREET VIEW was urged along
off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, was carried out outside the furlong marker and failed to respond.

GREEN UP chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. FRANK'S ROCKETTE pressed the pace of KANT HURRY LOVE from the outside five then four
wide taking command at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was caught a furlong out, ran on clear for the place honors. INTO HAPPINESS six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. KANT HURRY LOVE coaxed from the
gate, cut the pace four then three wide under pressure from FRANK'S ROCKETTE to the outside and then a pair midway on the turn, yielded the front with
five-sixteenths to go under coaxing, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, had the rider lose the crop to the right side just inside the eighth pole and

WHERE'S CHRIS prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch
on even terms for the lead, dueled outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. BOOK'EM DANNO went to the front, showed the
way with company to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue near the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch
and was outfinished while well clear for the place. BILLAL was rated off the pace on the inside, came off the rail late on the turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. PRIVATE DESIRE broke awkwardly and was off slow, raced erratically at the rear leaving the chute, was urged
four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. YO YO CANDY was rated on the outside, came under urging in the three to four path on the turn and
capitulated.

Footnotes
DELAHAYE tracked along the inside early on before tipping four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command three-sixteenths from home, then edged clear under a drive and
was ridden out to the finish. WAR PRINCESS showed the way in hand two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared with three-sixteenths to run, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and second best. I'M A
SURE THING broke in at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. DARK POOL broke out at the start pinching back STARTS NOW in tandem with MADAKET'S ARROW, tracked along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no late headway. REMIND (IRE) chased two to three wide
until tucked inside into the far turn, offered up a bid coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MADAKET'S
ARROW broke in at the start pinching back STARTS NOW in concert with DARK POOL, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. AKAYLA (IRE) three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WHY WASTE WORDS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. STARTS NOW struck the right side stall at the start and then got pinched
back between foes who each broke her way, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and made no
impact.

Footnotes
GIVE ME KISSES went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear when asked for her best in
upper stretch and proved much the best while kept to the task. SECURITY CODE broke out and bumped with a foe, settled just off the pace, dropped back
late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and got up for the place. WICKED SIGHT was hustled from the gate,
pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and weakened. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT tracked the pace between horses, went around
the turn in the two path, bumped with a foe inside the three-eighths pole, was roused inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
AWILLAWAY settled just off the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty.
MONGOLIAN PANTHER was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail under restraint on the turn, bumped with a foe inside the
three-eighths pole, saved ground into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. FREE TO ROAM broke out at the start, was urged along off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FREDDYMO FACTOR bumped with a rival at the start,
was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. CARAGATE dropped well behind, was urged at
the rear, moved from the rail to the four path on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
QUALITY CHIC was rated just off the pace in the two to three path, drafted behind horses on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then came four
wide into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final turn then made a bid, passed the sixteenth-pole on even terms for the lead and got up under
strong urging to prevail. SUERTE was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside in the three path, responded well when asked for his best in
upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole, fought between foes to the finish and missed while narrowly able to get the place. RIVALRY went to the front,
rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, battled under a drive in upper stretch, fought on gamely in the final furlong and
just missed the place. MISTICAL CURLIN rounded the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the far turn,
spun five wide into upper stretch and was outfinished. SUNDAESWITHSANDY was rated between foes in the three path on the first turn, settled outside on
the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY was
carried in at the start, saved ground while reserved towards the rear, moved out late on the far turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and failed to
threaten. FENWICK charged the front of the gate just prior to the start and was off a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear,
was urged while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. STANDARD OF PROOF broke
in at the start, was well placed on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated.
