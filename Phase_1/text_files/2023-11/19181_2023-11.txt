Footnotes
NICKEL NICKEL broke alertly and controlled the pace, widened easily on the final turn and coasted home while extending his advantage. DANGEROUS
MIND raced in closest pursuit of the winner throughout and was easily second best. PRACTICALLYMINE broke slowest, chased outside and gained late for
the show. MERGING TRAFFIC settled off the pace outside and began tiring after half a mile. SOCIAL JOE trailed to the stretch then caught tiring rivals. BIG
POPPER saved ground and was never involved. SETTE STELLE dropped back early and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
HEART LIGHT raced two wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, came wide into the stretch, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final furlong
and finished best for the win. SOLEMN OATH raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, rallied between horses entering the stretch, then closed in
the two path and dug in late to earn the place award. TILSA was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up entering the stretch, rallied
late outside and missed for second. MS MERRABEL dueled two wide for commmand, dueled on the backside, took over and opened up on the far turn,
then dug in gamely in the stretch run and weakened late. PEACH PERFECT raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, came wide into the stretch,
then angled in, made a rail bid passing the furlong marker, lacked room at the sixteenth pole, altered course off the rail and gained mildly. SIRENETTA did
not factor. MADAME ROUGE tracked the dueling leaders, chased three wide on the far turn, lacked a bid and faded. IYIYI was bumped at the start, dueled
inside for the lead, gave way on the far turn and stopped.

GRAY LIGHTNING away alertly to set the pace, opened up a comfortable lead, responded when roused in upper stretch and was kept to the task. KATE'S
LOVE steadied at the start, raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail in the stretch and finished well for second.
SHUDABEENACOWGIRL chased on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied mildly, then finished evenly between horses. REIGERT GIRLS raced two wide
off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and missed for third.
CORONA CAMPIONE raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, checked at the quarter pole and then gained mildly inside.
SUMMERSATTHESHORE was outrun early and closed belatedly outside. EMILY'S ON FIRE chased the pacesetter, continued two wide on the turn and
weakened. BREEZY DANCE chased four wide, went five wide past the quarter pole and tired. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND chased between rivals and faded.
APOLLONIA VITELLI was a bit reluctant to load, bobbled at the break, chased three wide and faded. WARRIOR ON THE RUN bobbled at the break, raced
off the pace inside and did not factor.

and was ridden out. BEACHFRONT BREEZE set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and
held well for the place spot. SIRANI stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the turn, rallied mildly in the stretch run and earned the show award. SHARP
EYES tracked on the inside, moved up on the turn, rallied three wide entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KISS FOR LUCK raced two
wide off the pace, chased on the turn and failed to threaten. BAILINTIN raced off the pace inside and did not factor. FIRST JOKE vied three wide for the
early lead, chased three wide on the turn and faded.

LIVING WATER stalked close up two wide early, tracked the leaders on the turn, rallied between rivals in the three path, hooked up with NEIGH DUDE past
the furlong marker, dueled with that rival and gamely prevailed. NEIGH DUDE dueled four wide for the lead, continued three wide on the turn, gained a short
lead, dueled with the winner in the final sixteenth and dug in gamely outside to the finish. HIDE THE RANSOM chased close up on the inside, chased on the
turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied mildly for third. COUSIN ANDREW raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, closed mildly and got
fourth. NICK THE CARDSHARK raced off the pace inside, waited for room passing the quarter pole, then rallied mildly and just missed for fourth.
LAZARETTO chased the pace racing three or four wide and weakened. INDIRECTLY trailed the field, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
WAGON BOSS dueled three wide for the lead, chased on the turn and faded. AMIGOS GUITAR dueled inside for command, dueled on the turn and
