Footnotes
NIGHT OPS advanced inside to upper stretch angling out late getting up in time. EMPEROR'S GOLD set the pace saving ground to upper stretch being
hooked late ceding grudgingly on the inside. HROTHGAR stalked the pace looming into upper stretch coming up a bit short. BACK ALLEY CAT slow early
rallied on the far turn then moved evenly the final eighth. GRAVE DANGER stalked the pace pressing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. STRAUS'S
PLACE faded on the far turn. PARTY OF NO stalked the pace pressing on the far turn flattening out in upper stretch. HOBE SOUND played no factor.
CAPTAIN RILEY gave early retreat. GOLDEN OAK hustled along folded up on the far turn.
