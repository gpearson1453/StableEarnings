Footnotes
DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN was rated early, four wide by the quarter pole and made a outside bid off the turn and drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best under a drive while being wrapped up the final fifty yards. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY was settled early two to three wide, came three wide into
the lane, split rivals by the sixteenth marker and got up for the place award late. PICTOR lunged at the start, then went up to set the pace and cross over to
be in the two path, dug in off the turn and was headed by the winner by the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival while saving the show
award. EAGLES CRY chased the pace on the inside and lacked the needed bid, missed show award. LOST IN NEWYORK stalked the pace and amde a
three wide bid off the turn but flattened out the final furlong.

Footnotes
WILD VINE set the pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn and then was headed leaving the quarter pole, repelled that bid and edged clear late to prove
best, driving. KEEN LOOKIN was well rated early, shifted out four wide to launch a bid at the seven sixteenths and was bumped hard by a tiring SALVO
TRIGGER, got back into stride and made a bold four wide move on the turn to engage with the front runner and dueled with that rival off the turn to the
furlong marker but hung in the final furlong, second best. JUMPING RAINBOWS was well placed on the inside, shifted out by the quarter pole, came four
wide into the lane and was along for the show award late. BRADY stalked the pace three wide and weakened, lost show award late. CHANNEL Z was
unruly in the paddock, bobbled at the start and was far back early, four wide into the lane and was not a threat. SALVO TRIGGER prompted the pace two
wide, in between rivals by the half mile marker, then dropped back and bumped a foe by the seven sixteenths and stopped.

TEMPESTUOUS was reserved early on the inside, advanced while saving ground by the half mile marker, then made a inside bid leaving the turn and
edged clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL set the pace while in the two path, then was headed nearing the furlong
marker and dug in gamely but was out-kicked by the winner. MERCURY TEN stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and finished
willingly but needed more. LAWLESSNESS chased the pace four wide, continued four wide on the backstretch, then dropped to the two path on the far turn,
angled out nearing the furlong marker and had a mild late kick. MONEYONTHELINE was settled early four wide, advanced five wide and was four wide on
the far turn and weakened. LONG TOM lacked a rally. SWEEPIN HARD was void of early speed and failed to menace. LARZ was well placed on the inside
and tired. MR BOLDACIOUS was washed out and was four wide into the first turn and showed little.

DYNAMITE KARMA prompted the slow early pace in between rivals, then made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then slowly edged clear
in the drive to prove best under a drive. CAERUS three wide into the first turn and vied for command, then set a pressured pace, then vied for the lead in
between rivals on the backstretch, dueled for the lead to the inside of the winner on the turn but was outfinished by that rival while clearly second best.
PATTY'S BOY was settled early, three wide on the far turn and had no rally, bested rest. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was off slowly, then tracked the slow pace
on the first turn, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole to loom boldly but tired in the drive. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU was off a step slow, rushed up
the inside to vie for command, then gave way on the turn.
