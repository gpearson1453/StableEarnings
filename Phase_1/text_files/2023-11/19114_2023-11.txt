Footnotes
RAYMOND stalked two wide, bid in upper stretch, dueled neck-and-neck through the final furlong and wrestled a narrow advantage inside the final
sixteenth. SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN set the pace along the inside, spun into the lane just off of the inner rail, but drifted towards it while meeting an outer
challenge in upper stretch, gamely clung to a short advantage while sparring through midstretch, but was grudgingly headed inside the final sixteenth and
missed. ASPEN CLUB stalked along the inside, chased the top pair through the lane and saved show via a dead-heat with an outer bidder. ASHAAB laid off
of the pace in the two to three path, tipped out to the six path in midstretch, stayed on between horses through the late stages and reached show via a
dead-heat. READY PURSUIT chased three wide under strong urging, sustained pursuit in the five path nearing midstretch, but lacked a bid between horses
late. LONGSHADOW broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the four path, floated to the six path in upper stretch, then failed to factor in the eight path
through the final furlong. FASTBYTE trailed in the three path around the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
BARAYE dueled for the lead outside of a rival, forged a narrow advantage entering the lane and clung to that margin through a long battle. SILENT HEART
dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, got slightly headed entering the lane, fought on gamely to continue the battle through the final furlong but
just missed. TRUST ISSUES broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out turning for home, then to the five path entering the lane, sustained a
rally tipping further out to maneuver around inner rivals at the furlong grounds and belatedly closed in on the top pair late. CAMARO Z took contact from an
inner rival at the start, pursued closest to the top pair from the two to three path around the turn, failed to progress on them in upper stretch and lost show to
an outer foe leaving the furlong grounds. TROUBLE'S ROARING took light contact from an inner foe at the start, pursued in the five path and between
horses while exchanging brushes with his inner counterpart, bumped with that one and an outer rival simultaneously at the half mile pole, raced in midpack
in the three to two path around the turn and ran on mildly between horses. IN A JAM bumped an outer rival at the start before taking contact to his hind
quarters from that one soon after, but steadied out of tight quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses,
attempted to inch closer turning for home before cutting the corner entering the lane, but lacked an inside rally. BRENNAN'S HONOR leaned out and
brushed a foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses while exchanging brushes with an outer counterpart, bumped with that
one at the half mile pole, moved forward to track in the four path, but chased in upper stretch and faded between horses at the furlong grounds. IRISH
RANSOM bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. CRASH THE GATE tracked in the three path while
between horses early on, leaded outwardly while chasing in upper stretch and gave way. AUSTIN STRONG took contact from an inner rival at the start,
brushed that one soon after, dropped back within the opening furlong, trailed in the four path around the turn and was outrun. MEET YOU NOW broke
outwardly while off a step slow, raced off of the pace in the six path, bumped with an inner rival at the half mile pole and faded in the four path passing the
three furlong pole.

Footnotes
DIGITAL tracked along the inside, pursued the top pair from the two path around the far turn, took aim outside of them and from the four path entering the
lane, bid before gaining an advantage passing the furlong pole and drove clear. EXPENSIVE CUT stalked from the three path and between horses, moved
forward to vie with the leader around the far turn, dueled through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and edged
place from his inner counterpart in the late stages. W W CRAZY laid off of the pace in the three path, chased under urging in the five path around the far
turn, yet stayed on late to reach show at the wire. HEARTBREAKER set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, dueled with
that one through upper stretch, but was surpassed by a wider foe at the furlong grounds and gradually yielded. HE'S GOT THIS saved ground off of the
pace, took aim inside of foes in upper stretch but lacked a bid. BIRD KING tracked in the four path, inched closer to press into the far turn, but chased soon
after and faded turning for home. LAND MARK DEAL trailed in the two path and was outrun.

Footnotes
TENENBAUM brushed with an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, gained an advantage with three furlongs to go, inched clear in the three
path entering the lane and drew off. MUSICAL PRAYER stalked along the inside, moved out to the four path and between horses to claim place in upper
stretch and ran on. A DOLLAR A DAY laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, then moved up willingly.
MARMALADE SKYE set the pace inside of a pressing foe, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole, subtly bobbled at the quarter pole while failing
to keep pace and gave way. PORT TOWNSEND was fractious behind the gate, then brushed with an inner rival before nudging an outer foe in the
aftermath, subtly eased back from between horses with eleven sixteenths to go, but tugged in the three path to be back among them before checking at the
half mile pole, tracked in the two path and between foes around the turn, got floated to the five path in upper stretch and yielded. TAPITARA was outrun.
KID'S LAST LAUGH took light contact from an inner rival soon after the start, tracked in the four to three path into the turn, but floated five to six wide in
upper stretch and tired between horses.

Footnotes
ONE GIANT LEAP set the pace in the four path, inched clear in the three path into the turn and inched further away through the final furlong. FORREST
CITY prompted in the five path, chased the clear leader from the four path around the turn and kept on to secure place. OWN THE FIELD laid off of the
pace in the three path, shifted to the five path while inside of a rival entering the lane, then ran on between horses in the final furlong to gain show late.
BACKSIDE BUZZ stalked along the inside, hugged the fence around the turn, but failed to change leads while chasing through the lane and tired late.
EMPERADOR was bothered by an outer rival and steadied at the start, trailed in the four path, moved out of last fanning to the six path nearing the lane and
failed to menace. GOODASIWONSWAS leaned inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and failed to threaten. CAPTAIN
JACK bumped the gate upon leaving it and made little impact at the start. HOCUS was bumped and forced inwardly by an outer rival at the start, chased
from midpack along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
THORPEDO ANNA bobbled outwardly upon leaving the gates, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, ranged up to offer a
bold bid entering the lane, drew off when let out in upper stretch, quickly opened up and widened under moderate urging. PEIGNOIR vied for the lead two
wide, sparred in the three path around the turn but proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane and was second best. COZEE RAGS bumped with
an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, moved to the two path turning for home, and ran on willingly between horses to gain show in midstretch.
BOURBON BREEZE broke a step slow and bumped with an inner rival at the start, subtly clipped the hind heels of an outer rival in the aftermath, raced off
of the pace three wide and between horses, tracked in the four to five path and outside of rivals around the turn, but faded. UMEBOSHI vied along the
inside, but yielded to a pair of outer rivals nearing the lane and weakened. MISS TENA MARIE had her hind heels clipped by an inner rival soon after the
start, chased two wide and between horses, but retreated to trail entering the turn and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside while a path off of the inner railing, pursued in the two to three path around the
far turn before taking aim outside of the top pair and from the five path entering the lane, only managed to chase them through upper stretch, yet slowly
closed in inside the final furlong, bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past late. O P FIRECRACKER stalked outside of the leader and from the three to four
path around the first turn, vied into and around the far turn while exchanging light contact around the far turn, dueled as contact continued through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth and edged place. TOUGH TICKETS set the pace in the two to three path around the
first turn, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, dueled while exchanging light contact with that one turning for home and through upper stretch,
sustained the battle in the final furlong, but was outkicked by a wider bidder in the late stages and yielded. FOWLER BLUE bumped with an inner rival at the
start, tracked from the three to five path around the first turn, chased outside of rivals around the far turn, but was floated to the six path entering the lane,
yielded on his left lead in upper stretch, then drifted inwardly after changing over at the furlong grounds, yet sustained a chase. CORELLI brushed with an
outer rival at the start and failed to factor from the three path. WIND TWIST brushed with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to six path
around the first turn, trailed in the three path around the far turn and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
ZEITLOS stalked along the inside, tipped three wide and between horses as the leading MARIAH'S APPEAL shook clear, took aim inside of that one in
upper stretch, bid after that foe drifted at the furlong pole and edged past. MARIAH'S APPEAL vied outside of a trio foes, tucked from the five to four path
into the turn, led turning for home before drawing clear entering the lane, drifted out slightly entering midstretch before meeting an inner challenge passing
the furlong grounds, and was bested in the late stages. PUMPKIN SCONE dueled for the lead inside of a trio of rivals, proved no match for his widest
counterpart entering the lane, yielded and lasted for show. THE GREAT MAYBE tracked in the four path, shifted to the six path entering upper stretch, but
only managed to chase while drifting inwardly in midstretch and needed more to reach show late. SWEET CURALINA lagged well behind into the turn, cut
the gap on the rest while entering the lane in the five path and moved up. ERVADEAN broke through the gate pre-race, jogged for a furlong before being
brought back and re-loaded without further incident, raced off of the pace two wide, shifted out in upper stretch and failed to menace. RO TOWN dueled for
the
lead
two
wide
and
between
horses,
proved
no
match
for
an
outer
counterpart
entering
the
lane
and
weakened

PAT'SCHROMECOMPASS laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. THREE POLKS vied for the lead three wide and between horses, but
faltered nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BRIGHT SPARK broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, launched a rally while splitting foes four wide in upper stretch and drove past the leaders at the
sixteenth pole. PRINCELY settled far back two wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane and rallied to gain place late. WINSTON WOLF laid off of the
pace in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, tipped to the three path in upper stretch and stayed on between horses. SINGLE RULER tracked in
the four path and between horses, split foes in the three path into the far turn, progressed to bid outside of the leader turning for home, drew clear entering
the lane, but tired in the final furlong, was caught a sixteenth from home and faded. DANCE SOME MO tugged clear in the three to two path around the first
turn, showed the way as an outer rival loomed up turning for home, got headed nearing the lane and gave way. STAR NATION broke a beat slow, lacked
speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four path before fanning to the nine path entering the lane, and moved up on his left lead. HONED leaned
inwardly at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped to the four path entering the lane but lacked a bid and weakened between horses. GLEN AIRY laid off
of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane and lacked a rally.
ICONICUS tracked in the three path and faded between horses turning for home. GAMER tracked in the five path, chased in the four path into the far turn,
but weakened between horses once floated to the eight path entering the lane.
