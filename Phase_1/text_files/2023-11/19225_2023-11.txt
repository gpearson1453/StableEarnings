Footnotes
ASPHALT ANDY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, advanced three wide late on the turn, took aim and powered
away when asked, in a convincing win. CAPACITY stalked pace along the inside, continued to be along the inside on the turn, swung aggressively five wide
into the lane, kept to task in the lane to get up for second. REAL THIRSTY went to rail as rivals stayed wide on the backstretch, had to ride cautiously into
the turn when rivals came over, had to steady off heels mid turn, regathered and tried to ease out and had to steady again when lacking room due to
ASPHALT ANDY beating him to the spot, altered inside in upper stretch and earned third along the rail. GOTHAM'S FINALE vied three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in mix, kept on gamely till faltering late. POCO DIABLO ROJO away best, kept in the six path
and vied for lead along with outside rival, angled to rail entering the turn, continued to vie for lead on the turn, entered lane in the lead and kept trying till
weakening in the final sixteenth. ACCELERAY away cleanly, climbed early and dropped back, settled well off the pace and showed mild interest late.
FEVER away well, settled off the pace near the rail, continued near rail on the turn and failed to produce a rally. LORD MO settled off the pace three wide
on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
