AWESOME PAL dueled two wide for command, continued to duel with STARSHIP BIANCA on the turn, led into the stretch, edged away and then held well
late, driving. STARSHIP BLANCA dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch drive and
battled on to the end. WICKED JANE chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied mildly in the stretch run and was along for the show spot. BAHAMA PEARL
stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn, rallied outside the leaders turning for home, made a bid and then weakened. TONALA was outrun early and
passed tired rivals. CRAZY SERENA raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. ROSE LEGACY chased between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
HUSHION showed good speed between rivals to set the pace, showed the way on the turn, shook free nearing the quarter pole, responded when roused,
drew clear and held well under urging. GENGHIS raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside and closed
well late for second. POWERFULLY BUILT chased close up three wide, chased three wide on the turn, finished evenly in the stretch and was outkicked for
the place spot. JOHNNY RITT chased close up between rivals, chased between horses on the turn and weakened in the stretch. EGO MAN raced close up
early on the rail, chased inside on the turn and weakened in the stretch. JACK BEANSTALK raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to respond.
COLLECTORATE steadied in the early stages in tight between rivals, then chased the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally.

RICH'S WAY trailed far behind, advanced very wide on the turn and stretch, offered a late surge and quickly pulled clear. UNCLE IRISH prompted the pace
three wide and dueled throughout in a game effort. BAAFEED dropped back early, moved inside rallying in the stretch to gain the show. ALLEVARE saved
ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat then weakened slightly. TOPS THE CHART settled just behind the dueling leaders outside and lacked a bid.
MARGIN OF AIR set a pressured pace just off the inside to midstretch and faltered. CATCH THE SMOKE rated close up along the inside then flattened out
in the stretch. HOLDTHEFLIGHT fanned very wide on the first turn and always outrun. DIVINE MIRACLE flashed speed four wide and stopped abruptly
after half a mile.
