STEELY DANZA led off the inside, moved clear nearing the quarter pole and extended his lead through the stretch. LORD UHTRED prompted the pace
inside, faded briefly then came again for the place. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS moved closer three wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.
MISCHIEVOUS JONES dropped far behind, angled wide on the turn and offered some late energy inside. DANGNABBIT flashed speed inside then gave
way readily. PORSUPUESTO trailed down the backstretch, remained wide and lacked a bid.

THE KING CHEEK quickly moved clear in hand then easily widened throughout under moderate pressure. DREAMING OF GERRY urged just off the pace
in the two path, faded briefly on the final turn then came again to gain the place. DUST DEVIL went after the winner four wide on the final turn then flattened
out. SUIGU STAR lagged far behind then showed some late energy. IT'S GAME TIME saved ground rating off the pace and faded in the stretch. COBBLE
ROAD broke awkwardly, trailed early and was never a factor. NOSTALGIC RUN was urged close up wide for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BEACH DAZE settled off the pace, bid three wide on the final turn then quickly drew of while ridden out. SCOTT ALAIA alternated for the lead inside, was
challenged on the final turn, proved no match but continued well for the place. GOLD MEDAL ANNA urged close up three wide early then flattened out in
the stretch. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE led narrowly inside, dueled for three quarters and weakened. LINDALOVESGOLD broke sluggishly, was asked for
run into the far turn then had no response. CATTI LA BELLE steadied nearing the first turn and was never a factor. CLOUT CHASER stopped after a
quarter mile and gave way readily.
