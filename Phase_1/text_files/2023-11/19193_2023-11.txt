MOBEER was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace while uncontested on the inside, then dug in gamely in the drive and held on late to prove best,
driving. REMEMBERING WILBUR stalked the winner two wide and made a bid in the drive and was gaining late but missed and a good effort. TRIBAL
NOTION was well rated early, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and finished well but needed more. YES IT'S ROO chased the early pace on
the outside and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive. YES SIR ROBERT chased the early pace on the inside, made a
middle move leaving the three eighths marker but then was empty.

MORNING THOUGHTS was rated early on the outside, made a four wide advance on the turn, came five wide off the turn and closed on the left lead before
changing to the correct lead by the sixteenth marker and got up in time to prove best under a drive. BAYOU SHACK tracked the early pace from between
rivals, shifted out and was three wide on the turn, made a bid by the quarter pole, then rallied well in the lane and was between rivals late but was
outfinished by the winner while getting the bob for the place award. WARRIOR'S CAUSE pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the
turn to shake clear, then spurted clear leaving the turn but was caught late to just fail. ORASHI was void of early speed, swung out four wide leaving the turn
and had a belated rally. FREEDOM'S START chased the pace four wide, then was four to five wide on the turn and weakened. DISCO DEVIL tracked the
early pace on the inside and weakened. DORSODURO failed to menace. GIUSEPPE set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped.

GIRVINIZED was well rated early four wide, made a three wide move to take over on the turn while in hand, then drew off of the turn and was ridden out to
prove much the best with speed to spare. WARRIOR'S MISS chased the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and finished willingly but
proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. LONDON LADY was settled early, made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole and came
five wide into the lane but could not sustain that bid, bested rest. KENTUCKY REIGN set the pace on the inside and was headed by the five sixteenths and
weakened. STEPHANIE MY LOVE was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. WAHINE MEANIE stalked the pace three wide early,
two wide on the turn and was chasing and then weakened. OUT OF AMMO failed to menace.

THUNDER BOSS set a pressured pace on the outside, made a two wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then kept a safe margin to the wire to prove best
under a drive. UPTOWN SERAPHINA tracked the early pace between rivals, two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and lugged in by the
furlong marker and then finished willingly to gain the place award late. MADI'S TUNE stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but hung in the
lane, lost place award late. THROWBACK pressed the early pace from the inside, steadied leaving the three eighths marker and fell back on the turn,
swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a mild late kick. MACRELLETTA stumbled at the start, outrun early, came five wide into the lane and had no
rally. SECRET WISPER chased the early pace from between rivals, checked by the seven sixteenths and then stopped in the lane.
