Footnotes
MUFRIH stalked the pace in the four path, steadily gained on the pacesetter in the lane and inched ahead under a drive. LITTLE STEVEN set the pace in
the three path, fought on inside of the winner, drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole and was narrowly outfinished. BANDERO raced off the pace four wide,
rallied outside in the lane, drifted in a bit as LITTLE STEVEN drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole, steadied off that foe's heels and finished evenly from
there. NOBLE TIGER was up close inside around the first turn, rated back early on the backstretch, continued to save ground off the pace around the far
turn, rallied at the rail in upper stretch but failed to sustain the bid. HONOR GOLD raced in range two and three wide, bid between foes nearing the eighth
pole and flattened out in the final furlong. NOBLE AND KIND raced in range four wide and lacked the needed rally. MUCHOMACHOMAC saved ground to
no avail. BULLETONTHECHARTS failed to menace while racing three and four wide. TUMIGA broke a step slowly, raced well back two wide, went five wide
around the far turn and never threatened. REDISUR steadied soon after the start, raced three and four wide and never contended. RULE IT played no factor
while racing two wide. DOC BALLARD bobbled at the start and was outrun inside. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BANDERO AGAINST
LITTLE STEVEN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
FULL NELSON prompted the pace in the four path, bid passing the three eighths, took the lead and was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the five
path into the stretch, and was driven clear. SUMMER STORM STRIC broke a step slow and trailed in the four path, circled inner foes from the six path
around the far turn, drifted in to the two path in upper stretch, and chased on for place. DONTBESOOGROUCHY rated in the two path, was nudged along
from the rail around the far turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on for show. MAGICSHADOW tracked in the five path, was ridden
into the far turn, swung from the six path into the lane, but flattened. EL CHATO stalked in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, but
failed to kick on from the four path in the stretch. DOWN IN THE VALLEY raced off the pace in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and did not threaten. FLIGHT CATCHER set the pace in the two path but yielded nearing the quarter pole.

WHATEVERWILBEWILBE stalked the pace inside, took over near the quarter pole and drove clear. JIGSAW set the pace in the two path, was collared near
the quarter pole, drifted out in upper stretch and kept on to hold well clear of the rest. AWESOME TRAIN prompted the pace three wide, could not keep
pace with top two nearing the quarter pole but churned on for the show. EKATI KING stumbled at the start, saved ground and never threatened. DIXIE
PREACH failed to menace while racing three wide. BEYOND REPROACH played no factor while racing two wide. RUNNINGTHENUMBERS steadied
entering the turn, raced five wide and made little impact. LOVE HOPE FAITH chased the early pace and retreated two wide.

Footnotes
OPUS broke in a tangle, raced off the pace in the six path, ranged up to bid in the five path passing the three-eighths pole, stayed on from said position
turning into the stretch, and drew past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. NEOM CITY stalked in the five path, bid between foes in the four path passing the
three-eighths pole, took a short lead from the two path into the stretch, kept on into the final furlong, but was caught in the final sixteenth to place.
GULLFAXI prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path passing the three-eighths, was driven along the inside into the stretch, but evened out
for show. DARLING DARLEY trailed in the four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but drifted out after a left handed cue passing the eighth
pole, and did not factor. BELLY DANCE rated in the three path but never threatened. DREAM DIAMOND set the pace in the three path, was challenged by
an outer trio while along the inside passing the three-eighths pole, and yielded at the top of the lane. QUEEN AIKO tracked in the two path but backed up
from the rail around the turn.

ST. PAT'S DAY rated inside, waited in the three path around the turn, ranged up to bid in the seven path at the top of the lane, took the lead approaching
the eighth pole, and inched clear under a drive. BAHAMIAN MOON prompted the pace in the four path, was roused in the three path midway around the
turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for place. OMO TEN GIRL set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside
early around the turn, swung out to the five path entering the lane, lost the lead while still on her left lead approaching the eighth pole, and drifted in while
flattening for show. MAGIC MOONSTAR stalked under a hold along the rail, waited rounding the turn, was cued along the inside into the stretch, finished
evenly, and had to steady late. ALA TURKA bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, was cued while fanning out to the eight path
turning into the stretch, but did not factor. BABY'S DIALED IN bumped with an inner foe at the start and always trailed around the four path. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF MAGIC MOONSTER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AGAINST THE RIDER OF OMO TEN GIRL

Footnotes
DESERT RULER stalked the pace in the four path, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. NOBLE DRAMA lacked early speed, advanced four wide
around the turn and rallied for the place. COPPERMASTER raced well back in the four path and finished well to just miss second. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP
set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch and weakened. ROD TWO ROD pressed the pace in the three path and faded nearing the quarter
pole. HUNTER saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
STARSHIP WIZARD stalked in the five path, was driven from the three path around the far turn, took aim in the four path at the top of the lane, ran on, and
got up on the wire to win. HAPPYISASHAPPYDOES vied for the lead in the three path, held a short lead going into the far turn, was roused from the two
path into the stretch, and stayed on, but was nailed at the wire by an outer foe to place. BACKCHAT rated in the three path, was cued in the five path
midway around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. CAPTAIN ANTHONY raced in midpack in the four path,
was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. C MY MEISTER tracked in the two path, was driven from
said position into the stretch, but flattened. RARE JEWEL dueled for the lead along the inside but yielded in the final furlong. HONESTO trailed in the two
path, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, but made no impact. KNOX chased in the five path but was never a threat. BELTS 'N BROOKS steadied
at the start, raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.
