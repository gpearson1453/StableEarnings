Footnotes
TIZ A SHARPIE trailed early, bid inside rivals through the stretch and edged clear in the final sixteenth. MANI PEDI saved ground off the leaders, drifted out
in the stretch and finished willingly. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE controlled the pace, widened on the final turn then weakened in the late stages. BEYOND A
MILLION raced wide off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. CARLY HUSTLE pursued the pacesetter for three quarters and gave way. BRODY SLAM
dropped far behind early and was always outrun. ADVOCATE HARBOR angled inside early then was finished after half a mile.

Footnotes
WISHING ONA PRAYER hustled to a clear lead inside, widened in the stretch and was kept to task while never threatened. RUNNIN REDBIRD chased
three wide, was put to urging on the turn and continued willingly for the place. AKNA steadied early, moved up inside then drifted out in the stretch racing
evenly. SIRENETTA lacked speed, angled inside in the stretch with some late energy. DANCING ON MY OWN hustled closer four wide on the turn then
flattened out in the stretch. CALIENTE RUM dropped back inside and was never in contention. LA LUISA prompted the pace in the two path then began
fading on the turn. LUNA T raced wide throughout and gave way readily in a dull effort.

SPEIGHTSTER RED engaged in race long duel outside then held rival safe through the stretch in a sustained drive. BRILLIANT CHASE alternated for the
advantage inside and continued gamely to the finish. SAINT MARCO saved ground off the dueling leaders and went evenly through the stretch. MIDNIGHT
CHROME raced just off the pace in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly. KINGSVILLE began fading after half a mile and was eased through the final
furlong. CHAIN REACTION stumbled badly at the start unseating his rider.

came again in the final furlong. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE settled just off pace, bid in midstrech, loomed a threat and hung. FINANCIAL STRENGTH
trailed early, moved out in the stretch and finished strongly. BOBBY'S CANDY moved up inside on the turn, was blocked repeatedly from the five sixteenths
to the eighth pole and flattened out late. BADBADBOBBY settled outside the dueling leaders early and faded on the turn. COWBOY JIM rated off the
leaders four wide and faltered. UNION REWARD dropped back along the inside and lacked a response.

Footnotes
BURN THE EVIDENCE vied inside briefly, moved clear on the turn and increased his margin under moderate pressure. ALPHA COMPANY saved ground
off the pace, angled out in the stretch and closed well. TATUM forced the pace to the far turn then continued well but was nailed for the place. ISLAND
SPIRIT prompted the pace three wide to midstretch and faltered. FOUR DAYS EARLY dropped back early racing wide and lacked a rally. NICKY DA FOX
trailed for half a mile racing wide and was never a factor. KNOCKOUT WIN raced just off the leaders for quarter mile and stopped losing contact with his
field. PER RULING FROM HIWU, BURN THE EVIDENCE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S VENDETTA trailed early racing wide, angled inside on the final turn, remained along the rail and surged away in the final furlong.
FICTIONALFAIRYTALE reserved off the pace three wide, bid on the final turn and was up for the place late. TAKEMETOTHEMOON set clear pace, was
collared at the quarter pole and continued willingly. JEWELS IN THE BAY settled inside behind the leaders then flattened out in the stretch. RETWEET
prompted the pacesetter to the stretch and weakened. DEPLANE lacked speed outside, was asked for run on the final turn and had no response.
MIDNIGHT CAT dropped back outside and faded steadily. BRONX TALE fanned four wide into the first turn, raced close up and stopped after the half.

GABE quickly took control, was never threatened then extended his lead through the stretch under urging. FATIH raced in closest pursuit of the winner
throughout but was no match. BOOM BOOM KABOOM angled inside rallying on the turn and finished well. LONG LEGGED BOY chased five wide down the
backstretch and rallied mildly. ALONZO MOSELY moved inside on the turn, was taken up sharply near the five sixteenths and no factor. WEGOTTAGUY
hustle off the leaders inside and retreated. GO GREEN dropped back early and was never involved. HANEY BOYS prompted just off the leader for a quarter
mile and stopped.
