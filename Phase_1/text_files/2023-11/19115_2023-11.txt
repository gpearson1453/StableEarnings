Footnotes
SHEZMISBEHAVING rated in the two path, on the move while under a ride on the far turn, challenged the leader leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper
stretch and was kept to task to hold safely. KATERINI tracked along the rail, drew closer under urging on the far turn and shifted out to the two path, chased
after the winner willingly through the lane but had to settle for second best. LEOPARDESS (GB) stumbled leaving the gate, traveled on the inside at the
back, moved off the rail on the backstretch, entered the lane two wide and gained the show. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) sped clear in the two path then
moved inside, challenged leaving the far turn, overtaken at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened to fourth. VIOLET STORM bumped with MAGAZINE at
the start, closest in pursuit early next to the fence, coaxed along on the far turn chasing behind the leader and weakened down the lane. MAGAZINE took a
bump from VIOLET STORM in the beginning, raced outside a rival at the back two then three wide, trailed three then two wide on the far turn and failed to
menace.

HALO UNCLE raced up close then chased the top pair, chased along the rail into the turn, angled out and asked three wide late on the turn, took over in
upper stretch, kicked clear past the eight pole and drew away. THIRSTY THURSDAY chased off the rail then between foes, rounded the bend two then
three wide, then rallied and overtook UNCLE JUJU for the place honors. UNCLE JUJU sprinted to the front then dueled outside FACT OR FICTION for the
lead, kept the pressure on the through the turn, fought between in upper stretch, could not match HALO UNCLE in the furlong grounds, stayed through deep
stretch but got outfinished for second. FACT OR FICTION broke a step slow then went up to fight for the lead inside UNCLE JUJU, inched ahead around
the bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BEAR COAST broke a step slow, chased three deep into the turn, moved
out four wide then steered back into the three path leaving the bend and weakened. EDDIE'S WAVE bothered by inner rival shifting out early, started to

JULIAS DREAM dueled for command from outside, kept the pressure on THERMAL through the turn, gained the advantage approaching the sixteenth pole,
put THERMAL away then met the challenge from CHEEKY GAL and held gamely. CHEEKY GAL broke a step slow, chased three deep then angled over to
the inside, ran up on the heels of the leaders at the quarter pole, tipped out into the lane, finished gamely from outside but could not get by. THERMAL
dueled from inside, inched ahead from JULIAS DREAM on the turn, battled into the final furlong then yielded in the final sixteenth. APRIL VINTAGE raced
up close outside the top pair, chased three wide through the turn and weakened. BECKY'S DREAM (FR) chased between rivals early, two wide outside a
rival on the turn and lacked a rally. BELLA VIENNA saved ground through the turn and proved no menace.

Footnotes
ST IGNACIO unhurried in the early going and moved inside, moved out on the backstretch, gained three wide on the far turn, cleared in upper stretch and
was kept busy to the line. SMOOTH SALUTE sat well off the pace two wide early, driven three wide into the lane, closed well and gained second.
AUTOLINE (IRE) brushed leaving the gate, settled in the two path then moved inside, shifted back to the two path on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and
was along for the show. ADVENTURESOME antsy in the gate, closest early in the two path, pressed between in the middle stages, dueled into the far turn,
cleared at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and faltered. QUINTECENTS brushed inner rival leaving the gate, raced up close three deep,
chased two wide leaving the far turn, bid at the top of the stretch but was no match late. HARD TIMES brushed at the start, rated in the two path, traveled in
mid-pack up the backstretch, altered out at the quarter pole, steered back inside in upper stretch and could not rally. PINEHURST (IRE) brushed leaving the
gate, stalked two to three wide, steadied at the quarter pole and could not rally. NYQUILER broke a step slow, had to take hold twice when rank early,
angled three wide on the far turn and could not make an impact. THANK YOU HONEY antsy in the gate, went up to take control from inside, pressured in
the middle stages, dueled into the far turn, hit the rail at the quarter pole and faded. THRUST rated along the inside, got put in tight and steadied at the
quarter pole, then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) reserved early on and moved inside then in the two path, advanced three then four deep on the far turn, took over in upper
stretch, quickly cleared inner rivals and was ridden out to the wire. AH JEEZ stalked in the two path then between rivals, entered the lane two to three wide,
asked left handed then right handed in deep stretch and gained the place. SHARP AZA TACK showed early speed to take control from the rail, pressured
from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn and upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the furlong grounds, faltered late but
managed to save the show. CALM SEA closest in two path around the clubhouse turn, applied pressure from outside on the backstretch, dueled around the
far turn, fought to upper stretch and flattened to fourth. CAMILO took a stalking position along the inside, ridden patiently through the far turn while
continuing to save ground, moved off the fence in the lane and could not produce a bid when called upon. SMART MO rated three deep in the early going,
started to weaken under urging on the far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FURY dueled for the lead from outside then ceded command leaving the first turn, pressed up the backstretch, lost touch past the three-eighths
pole, re-bid between rivals at the quarter pole, battled head to head with LONESOME STEW in the final furlong and was all out to prevail. LONESOME
STEW stalked in the three path, bid outside the top pair at the quarter pole, took a narrow advantage in upper stretch, battled MIDNIGHT FURY to the wire
and just missed. HONDO CROUCH chased five wide into the clubhouse turn then angled down to the two path, stalked between rivals then moved inside,
angled out in the stretch, finished well and whittle the gap on the top pair late. DUTY FIRST dueled from inside then cleared approaching the backstretch,
pressure again from outside in the middle stages, cleared once more past the three-eighths pole, challenged by MIDNIGHT FURY again with LONESOME
STEW to the outside of that rival at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane and weakened. ZE'BUL antsy in the gate, trailed five then
four wide around the first turn, moved closer while widest in the middle stages, spun six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BENDETTIJOE stalked
four wide early, ridden along on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. NOKIE chased four then three wide early, pulled at the
five-eighths pole, chased between into the second bend, two to three wide into the lane and weakened. TORQUEWRENCH chased three then two wide,
trailed into the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CREATIVE WAY chased two wide then moved inside, traveled inside rivals
up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and tired.
