Footnotes
BRIEF travelled near the rear three wide outside of her rivals down the back straight, began to lengthen stride quickly moving in on the leaders around the
far bend, pounced to the lead four wide straightening out for home and drew away when roused in the final furlong. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY stalked near the
back on the rail at the half, shifted just outside off the fence with five sixteenths to go passing horses, swung out to be five wide extending her stride smartly
turning for home and was no match for the winner down the lane but finished up well to be a clear second on this day. HIGH TREASON stalked near the
rear between horses down the backside, commenced her run closing in on others midway on the final turn, angled outside to the five path for the drive and
gamely prevailed for the show battle. TAKE CHANCES co-trailed on the outside at the half, began to rally around runners three wide on the far turn, swung
out widest in the six path with run at the top of the stretch and dueled for third to the wire just losing the photo in the end. FOREVER DANISH tracked the
front two into the first turn, continued rating comfortably waiting for her que down the backstretch, began to close in on the leaders at the three furlong
marker, briefly had the lead between foes in upper stretch and stalled in the final sixteenth never switching leads. SMOKEN CHLOE stumbled on the break,
recovered to have a nice tracking position outside runners in midfield down the backside, was roused for more at the three eighths marker, put in a mild run
on the fence until the top of the lane and faded inside in deep stretch. SEATTLE SIGNAL took this field into the first turn, continued to dictate the pace
unchallenged down the backside, was collared outside by rivals in upper stretch, offered no resistance and folded in the last sixteenth. QUEEN OF THE
COURT co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, saved all the ground but could not get involved running around the final bend and was not a factor in
the stretch drive. QUEEN SAHARA chased the pace down the backstretch, was roused trying to keep up with the frontrunner three furlongs out, had no
more to offer on the far turn and backed away through the field at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
STOLEN was lightly brushed at the start, settled mid-pack tracking inside on or just off the rail, came four wide in upper stretch with aim on the leaders, took
over in mid-stretch and kicked clear. T'PRING broke inwardly lightly brushing a rival, settled outside just off the eventual winner racing two to three wide into
the turn, came out six to seven wide in the stretch, gained place. ROSES ARE FREE attended the pace two to three wide, kept on but needed more.
TATOOSONMYSOUL broke out a bit, stalked from outside close up going four wide on the turn, came out six deep for the drive, ran on evenly. SAKE AND
SUSHI pursued from inside a foe but off the fence three to four deep, dropped back on the turn, came out ten wide in upper stretch, finished up strongly
again. CANTHO was lightly brushed at the start, forced the pace from inside, gave way in the stretch. SMART IRENE shifted in, saved ground on the turn,
tipped out a bit in mid-stretch when in behind a tiring rival, ran on. IRON PRINCESS broke outwardly, raced at the back, was not a threat. CASTLETON
came out for the drive racing far back, was never a threat. CLASSIC GLORY was not a factor.

Footnotes
CANDID CANDACE tracked the pace outside down the backstretch, shadowed the frontrunner around the turn and tenaciously wore down the leader
through the stretch to get up just a few strides before the wire. GET MY DRIFT took command from the start, continued up front with mild pressure from the
winner throughout the turn, spurted clear turning for home, stubbornly fought down the lane but could could not hold off the winner in deep stretch.
SIGIRIYA was off slowly to begin, had one beat down the backside, started to rally circling runners three wide three furlongs from the wire and had good late
energy in the four path down the stretch to determinedly get up at the wire to win third money. HYPER HOLIDAY was all alone in midfield down the
backside, was nudged on for more taking closer order three furlongs from the finish, continued to be in the hunt three wide turning for home and was
outfinished in deep stretch for the show award. NACHO GIRL stalked outside near the back in the beginning, offered a mild run three furlongs from the wire
and was one paced through the stretch. ZODIAC BEACH travelled near the back of the pack between foes in the two path down the back straight, made
little impression through the turn and could not get into contention down the stretch. WORKING HOLIDAY tracked the front two on the inside at the half, was
roused on the fence three eighths from the line, could not gain on the leaders through the turn, was still in the mix at the top of the lane for a piece of the
prize but tired in the final furlong. MADAM GWEN settled near the rear on the rail down the backside, could not make any headway running around the bend
and failed to menace driving to the wire. VIRGINIA'S LEGACY was away slowly at the start trailing by many down the backside, lost contact with the field
around the turn and was eased crossing the finish line.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER rated in behind the leaders, bided time into the far turn, moved out and took the lead three wide and between foes by the quarter
pole, drew clear in upper stretch, was kept busy to the wire and held. ROCKLAND EXPRESS was in just a hair tight between runners at the start while
receiving a light brush, settled two to three wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn swinging seven wide for the stretch run, drifted in a path in
mid-stretch then straightened out and continued to gain steadily on the winner but needed more. CHELSEA DAGGER bumped lightly with a rival at the start,
settled off the pace moving up to mid-pack racing near but off the rail, came out for the stretch run in range, drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole and
steadied on heels, ran on for show. SILENT LUCIDITY settled stalking the leaders just off the pace outside two to three wide, moved out five wide
advancing into upper stretch, could not match stride with the winner, was carried out by a rival and steadied in tight past the sixteenth pole. KODIAK
MAMBA (IRE) settled toward the back three to four deep, swung out a bit into upper stretch then shifted out further to be nine wide at the furlong marker,
kicked on mildly. QUIET REBEL stumbled at the start, was under a hold inside at the back early, came off the inside on the far turn, passed tired rivals. THY
KINGDOM raced outside four to five wide at the rear, failed to menace. BAYTOWN ELVIS was encouraged forward from the start, settled in just off the
leading pair to stalk three wide, moved to within range four abreast coming past the quarter pole, faltered and faded. TOURIST'S DREAM had the early lead
after breaking well enough, vied inside up the backstretch, gave way in the stretch. CANYOUHEARMENOW was urged forward at the break gaining forward
position between the early leaders, prompted the pace up the backstretch, was done by the three-eighths. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDERS
OF SILENT LUCIDITY AND CHELSEA DAGGER AGAINST ROCKLAND EXPRESS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
VINCENZINO took control from the onset, set a soft pace down the backstretch, was collared outside by rivals turning for home, had something left in
reserve down the stretch and was resilient to prevail holding off numerous foes at the wire. ROCK BULLET stalked near the rear down the backstretch,
began to uncork a rally three wide midway on the far turn ,loomed in the five path outside rivals at the top of the lane, drifted inwards under right handed
encouragement driving to the finish at the sixteenth pole and just missed getting up at the line. GREYSTONE had a good position tucked in behind the
pacesetter down the backside, had to wait around the final turn looking for a seam, lacked running room inside at the top of the stretch, finally found clear
run in the two path at the sixteenth pole and finished up to just win the nod for third at the finish line. PHANTOM JEWEL tracked three wide on the outside
down the back straight, continued to gain on the leaders outside running on the final bend, posed a serious threat four wide at the top of the lane,
determinedly battled to the finish, was bounced around trying to maintain position at the sixteenth pole and stubbornly held for a share in the end. JACK
travelled in mid-pack between foes on the first turn, was shuffled back losing positions on the rail at the three eighths marker, shifted outside behind a wall of
runners at the furlong marker and was mildly gaining on rivals at the finish. HEY LUIGI prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, closed in to bid
between horses in the three path turning for home, stubbornly dueled with rivals on each side to the wire, was steadied in tight quarters at the sixteenth pole
and could not offer a finish afterwards. LE GRAND GARCON was unhurried trailing the field in the beginning, continued to see the field down the backside,
could not close the gap on others through the far turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 HEY LUIGI AGAINST #1
GREYSTONE AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED. STEWARD'S INQUIRY REGARDING #7 ROCK BULLET THROUGH THE STRETCH
RESULTED IN A DISQULIFACTION FROM 2ND AND PLACED 6TH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE

Footnotes
MISTER MESEEKS settled three wide at the back, advanced five to six deep, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, bid in mid-stretch, drifted in a path while
clear, prevailed under steady handling. COACH ABERNATHY took back and tucked in early racing two wide at the back into the first turn, advanced near
but off the rail on the far turn, moved out five wide coming to the top of the stretch, was bumped lightly in mid-stretch, kept on for the place. TWIXTER
settled three to four wide early moving out five wide on the first turn, advanced on the far turn three deep shifting five wide into upper stretch, exchanged
light bumps while drifting out near the furlong grounds and kept on. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS set the early tempo from inside on or just off the rail, was
overtaken leaving the first turn but still stalked from inside just off the fence, regained the lead past the three-eighths, was clear coming to the quarter pole,
drifted out a bit into upper stretch, was overtaken and outkicked. SOCIAL JUSTICE settled inside toward the back, advanced while coming out off the fence
on the far turn, continued to progress in the stretch coming in just a bit near the sixteenth and kept on. GOOD SOLDIER received a saddle adjustment
behind the gate, settled outside at the back four to five wide, advanced still in the same path through the far turn into upper stretch, was in range between
runners, clipped heels in mid-stretch stumbling and ran on. GLENHOLME was caught outside foes four then six wide in the early going, moved up some into
the far turn, was carried nine wide by the drifting and tiring lead late on that bend, ran on. CHAIRMAN LAYLA tracked from inside mid-pack, steadied slightly
at the sixteenth pole when in just a hair tight. READY ON THE LINE forced the pace from outside while kept four deep and drifting to the six path on the first
turn, had a clear advantage up the backstretch still racing wide and entering the far turn in the four path, drifted eight wide while weakening late on that
bend, came up empty. SILENT WARNING chased three to four wide early, dropped back between runners entering the far turn, tired. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING TWIXTER IN THE STRETCH AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CHAIRMAN LAYLA AGAINST
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GOOD SOLDIER AGAINST MISTER MESEEKS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE TWO
OBJECTIONS WERE NOT ALLOWED BUT TWIXTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH BEHIND GOOD SOLDIER FOR
CAUSING A REACTION LEADING TO THE LATTER CLIPPING HEELS IN MID-STRETCH.

Footnotes
JIM'S HOPE travelled in midfield on the outside of horses down the backside, took closer order tracking three deep at the half, pounced three wide midpoint
on the far turn, cleared away in mid-stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish. RAPID TEST stalked near the rear in the early stages, was
roused for more three eighths from the line but did not quicken with others, could see the field at the top of the stretch and finally found another gear
bursting by runners swinging out to the six path at the furlong pole to nab the place award at the wire. SOUPED UP had a good spot nestled behind the
pacesetter down the backside, waited patiently behind the wall of the contesting front three runners at the quarter pole, angled in to the two path turning for
home, battled stubbornly to the wire just missing out on holding for place in the end. CHASING TROUBLE co-trailed on the outside down the back straight,
advanced three wide around foes with five sixteenths to run, loomed a threat outside in the five path straightening out for the drive but stalled late, losing a
couple of placings at the wire. POULIN IN O T set a modest pace at the half, was collared outside by runners midway on the far turn, bravely fought on
through the lane until the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch. GUNS N' ROJAS was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backstretch, saved
ground advancing smartly through the far turn, was in range for a share on the fence at the top of the lane but could not offer a finishing bid to the wire.
SILENT MIRACLE kept a close eye on the leader down the backstretch, bid for the lead in the two path with rivals on each side at the quarter pole, could
not find more turning for home and yielded in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB was content to track the frontrunner outside in the first turn, hounded the pace down the backside, was let loose at the quarter pole,
quickly cruised outside to the lead turning for home and drew off convincingly when set down in the final furlong. TITO'S CALLING tracked in the two path
under a snug hold between runners down the backstretch, was asked for more run at the quarter marker to be in the hunt four wide at the top of the stretch,
could not reel in the long gone winner but gamely battled to the finish just edging away for the place share crossing the wire. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY
assumed command from the start, set a modest pace with mild pressure outside at the half, could not fend off the much the best winner cruising to the lead
at the quarter pole but stubbornly dug in down the stretch and just missed holding for the runners up share at the wire. VERI GIZMO tracked just a couple of
lengths off the pacesetter down the backside, was nudged to keep pace behind the engaging duo midway through the far turn, swung just outside in the
three path to be in the mix of things straightening out for home and ran evenly to the wire to settle on the fringes in the end. GREAT KATE tracked three
deep on the outside down the back straight, could not match strides with others running four wide outside foes on the far turn and lacked a finish making
little progress through the stretch. SOUPER SINCLAIR trailed the compact field rating kindly in hand with a half mile left to run, came under a hard ride
midway on the final turn, made little impact and could not get involved running outside of horses down the stretch.

Footnotes
DREAM ON BABY was content to watch to loose frontrunner down the backside, began to reel in the pacesetter on the turn, bid three wide outside foes at
the quarter pole and cleared off in the final furlong for a decisive win. WICKEDBLACKBULLET tracked on the rail down the backside, made a sharp move
on the the turn to battle for the lead on the fence at the quarter marker, could no match strides with the winner down the stretch and easily bested the rest at
the finish in a solid effort. MR. RUDY took a commanding lead down the backstretch, was engulfed on each side at the quarter pole, could not go on with the
top pair turning for home and gamely finished up to hold safe for third money at the wire. DIXIE'S FLATTER trailed the field down the back straight, began to
pick up rivals on the outside two furlongs from the prize, angled out to the four path for the stretch drive and closed smartly for a minor role down the lane.
TONKA WAKAN stalked near the back early on, improved down the backside, began to creep closer to rivals running around the bend and was one paced
through the stretch making little presence. HOLIDAY IN CHILE stalked near the rear down the backside, was hard ridden on the fence through the turn, was
in with a chance for a minor share inside turning for home but could not offer a finish down the stretch. WONT FORGET YOU broke outwards at the start,
stalked in midfield outside at the half, offered a brief run splitting rivals around the bend, was in with a chance for a small share turning for home but faltered
in the final furlong. ROYAL CHROME had a good position on the outside keeping track of the front two down the backstretch, was roused but could not
quicken with others on the turn and retreated six wide in upper stretch. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY ducked in sharply at the start, dislodged the rider and
walked off back to the barn.
