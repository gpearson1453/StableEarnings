Footnotes
VULIN raced up close in the two path early, bid outside the pacesetter at the half-mile pole, dueled leaving the backstretch, put away inner rival and moved
over to the rail while fighting with FAST INVESTMENT on the far turn, shook free from that foe at the quarter pole, kept to task through the lane and held
safely. BOGINSKAYA settled well off the rail then angled down to the two path on the first turn, gave chased two wide then along the rail into the lane,
moved out in the drive and chased willingly through the final furlong but could not reach the winner. FAST INVESTMENT stalked four then three wide on the
first turn, bid three deep in the middle stages, dueled outside VULIN on the far turn, could not kick on with that rival at the quarter pole, chased two wide into
the drive, flattened in the furlong grounds but churned on to secure the show. BEST YEAR EVER bobbled and took up shortly after the start, trailed five
wide around the first turn, moved into range then put in a mild bid four deep on the backstretch, failed to sustain the challenge and chased the top pair four
wide into the stretch before weakining. ROUND IN CIRCLES stepped to the front from inside, pressure by outer rivals midway up the backstretch, lost
command approaching the far turn, dropped back around that bend and weakened.

MAN O ROSE coaxed clear and moved into the two path, took pressure from outside, cleared at the quarter pole and held well through the final furlong.
RHYTHEM ON STAGE was off a bit slow to begin, moved inside racing at the back, saved ground through the turn, then rallied to edge ANTONSEN for
second. ANTONSEN chased two wide into the turn, eased out around the turn and spun four wide into the lane, finished determinedly from outside but got
outkicked for the place honors. MORE TRY got put in tight inside the leader early and took hold, moved into the two path on the turn, tipped three wide into
the lane and finished evenly. GRAND TIGER chased off the rail then bid outside leaving the backstretch, chased the winner past the quarter pole and

LA PALOMA BLANCA pressed three deep early, dueled outside rival in the two path on the far turn, inched ahead into the stretch, cleared at the top of the
lane, tested by BLONDE BOMBSHELL in deep stretch and held gamely. BLONDE BOMBSHELL got bumped a few times at the start, chased along the rail,
roused two wide leaving the turn, bid inside LA POLOMA BLANCA with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by. SWEET MOTHER MARY came in to
bother rivals at the start, went up to press the pace from between rivals, lost positions around the bend, tipped out into the lane and came back on to gain
the show honors. YOLO CALLS raced in range widest up the backstretch, chased four wide into the turn, moved into the there path then tipped back out
leaving the bend, drifted in and out a bit in the drive from right and left handed encouragement and could not produce a bid. AMERICAN HEIGHTS got
forced into rival leaving the gate, went up to set the pace inside a pair of rivals, dueled around the turn, overtaken late on the bend and weakened down the

Footnotes
MIXTO stepped to the front and showed the way early from inside, took pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, lost command in upper
stretch, battled back along the fence and edged BAD SNEAKERS in the closing moments. BAD SNEAKERS brushed with inner rival at the start, was
prominent early in the two path, moved up to pressure the leader in the middle stages, dueled around the second bend, took over in upper stretch, fought
head to head with MIXTO in the late stages and was overtaken nearing the wire. EXCEL CALCULATOR broke a step slow, stalked from the rail, roused on
the far turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, tipped out in the drive, could not summon the needed late kick but stayed on to hold the show. MAUNA
KEA BOUND chased in the four path early, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and came four wide into the drive and lacked the needed response.
PIONEER PRINCE stalked three deep through both turns and weakened when called upon. SHIP AND SCAM broke a step slow and brushed with outer
rival, tracked in the two path, along the rail into second bend, angled out with a quarter mile left to run, spun five wide into the lane and had little left for the
drive.

Footnotes
IMMELMANN hustled clear from outside, crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, roused and put to left then right handed urging and held well. SHADY
TIGER chased two wide outside a rival, moved out in the lane, finished willingly but needed more to overtake the winner late. CURLIN'S KAOS off slow to
begin, raced a bit greenly early and dove down to the inside trailing the field, tipped out past the quarter pole, produced a mild rally and gained the show.
CLEMENTS RIDE traveled near the back on the inside into the turn, saved ground through the bend, angled out in upper stretch and offered a mild
response to round out the superfecta. ANNAN coaxed from the gate, forwardly placed early while racing greenly on the inside, asked left handed into the
lane and weakened. JETFIRE chased three deep then angled in at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. MONSIEUR took
up early when JETFIRE cut over at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two to three wide around the bend and lacked a rally. PRINCE PRANCEALOT broke
a step slow, traveled near the back outside a rival into the turn, trailed into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SILENT HEAT coaxed from the gate then had to pause when put in tight next to the rail, rated along the inside then pulled leaving the first turn, angled four
wide at the quarter pole and launched a bid outside the top trio, took over past the eighth pole and drove clear. TALKLESSWORKMORE hustled from the
gate, stalked four then three wide early, went up to challenge three deep on the backstretch, fought three wide to the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch,
lost command past the eight pole and held the place. BILLY'S BET tracked two wide off the pace, made progress on the inside through the far turn, tipped
out into the lane and finished willingly to gain the show. ALPINE THUNDER reserved in the three path, went between rivals in the middle stages, angled out
on the far turn, exited the bend five wide and kept on for a minor award. FORE FLAG rated on the inside then in the two path, traveled between runners at
the half-mil pole, spun three wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and lacked a rally. LUKA GRAZIE reserved early on and angled over to the rail on the
clubhouse turn, moved outside rivals on the backstretch, trailed two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. YO TIME broke well and showed keen early
speed on the front-end while moving inside, challenged by a pair of rivals up the backstretch, fought through the far turn and into the lane, then weakened in
the final furlong. BRAVESTONE off in a slow beginning, pulled early on, trailed on the inside up the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane, steered out at
the eighth pole and failed to menace. BIGOFROMFRESNO forwardly placed in the two path, pressed the issue leaving the first turn, vied between rivals up
the backstretch and second bend, lost touch with the leaders in upper stretch and gave way. SUPER CHIEF up close three wide early, chased three deep in
the middle stages, spun four wide into the drive and weakened.
