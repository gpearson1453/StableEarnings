Footnotes
NO BULL DARWIN broke outwardly, stalked the leading pair from outside, travelled four to five wide through the turn edging nearer by the top of the stretch,
bid in mid-stretch while drifting in a bit, dueled briefly then edged away. ART CURATOR dueled inside a rival but off the fence in the two to three path, put
that one away but was engaged by a new foe in upper stretch, could not match strides with that one. WHISPER'S MARK switched out off the inside in the
early going, was off the leaders three wide into the turn moving out five wide later on that bend, swung nine deep turning into upper stretch, was gaining but
too late. CANDY TRACK settled off the pace inside saving ground through the turn, came out in mid-stretch bumping and bothering a rival nearing the
sixteenth pole. CHARLIENE contested the early pace from outside three wide, weakened and switched out in mid-stretch. MI PRINCESA broke a step
slowly and in a bit tight, was coaxed along two to three wide into the turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, was put in tight quarters between
runners when lightly bumped nearing the sixteenth pole, steadied and altered out and was not persevered with thereafter. KAMMYS KASH broke a step
slowly, lacked early speed, raced a bit erratic and greenly while kept well off the rail in the five path, floated nine deep leaving the turn, was never near
enough to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN CANDY TRACK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND
PLACED SIXTH BEHIND MI PRINCESA FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
BEAU VERO ran off pace from the leaders then dueled late on the turn taking the lead in the stretch and held to the wire. DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH ran in
the middle of the pack then caused interference up the backstretch with KING BRYCE but kept hard driving down the stretch finishing up in second.
UNBRIDLED OPTIMIST pressed the pace early on in the race then started dueling BEAU VERO in the middle of the turn as they came down the stretch
they lost the edge on BEAU VERO close to the wire. NO GAIN N NO WILL ran in the middle of the pack on the outside then coming out of the turn they
drifted inside and started making a closing bid to end up in fourth. STACKERS was bumped into a rival early, raced in the back of the pack but with a steady
gain in pace made up ground as the race progressed. LET EM RIP had good speed leaving the gate then maintained their pace throughout the turn then
hung mid stretch. KING BRYCE ran with good early speed then was forced into a foe and shuffled back and maintained pace after. MIST N SEVEN was
bumped early, ran in the middle of the pack with a steady pace they maintained throughout the race. JEWELS AND JAZZ ran with a good early pacing then
coming around the turn started to fall back but ended up fading around the quarter pole. ONEDRUNKNIGHT got off slow from the start then trailed
throughout the race. THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION FROM KING BRYCE ON DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH FOR INTERFERENCE, AFTER THE
STEWARDS REVIEW THEY DETERMINED THAT DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH DID IMPEDED THE PATH OF KING BRYCE AND CAUSED A CHAIN
REACTION TO OTHERS AND DISQUALIFIED THAT RUNNER TO EIGHTH.

Footnotes
COMMUNITY LEADER stalked from outside four wide into the turn, edged nearer to reach contention coming to the quarter pole, was floated out a bit
coming out of that bend and with the lead at the top of the stretch, forged clear and held sway. MILK IT was urged clear soon after the start, set the pace
racing off the rail in the three path, drifted out a bit leaving the turn and was overtaken at the top of the stretch, switched outside the new leader in
mid-stretch, was no match but second best. HEZEKIAH'S RULE was hard to load, forced out a bit at the start, was kept wide racing in the five path into the
turn, kept on to get up for show while no threat to the top pair. AARON WHO chased from inside, came out in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair
and lost show honors late. AMIGO LOCO lacked early speed racing inside, was not a threat. EVERYROSEHASATHORN broke outwardly, shifted in leaving
the backstretch racing just off the rail last but one into the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
BELLA DONA blew from the gate then started to pull away from the pack throughout the race with an increase in margin at every call. MARQUIS LIGHTS
ran on the rail off pace from the leaders then had a good rally coming down the stretch. CHARLIES HURRICANE ran off pace on the outside as they
rounded the turn they made a slight bid to the outside to end in the show position. CAYCEE'S MARK ran in the middle of the pack with an even pace but
coming on to the stretch ran down the six path on the outside of the pack. DELIA ran in the back of the pack with a steady pace then passed a tired foe late
into the race on the outside. TIGHT FITTIN JEANS ran in the front of the pack pressing the pace but BELLA DONA's pace was too quick and they ran out of
gas and fading around the sixteenth pole. SHUGS CHARLIE lost rider in the gate. THERE WAS STEWARDS INQUIRY AT THE START FOR SHUGS
CHARLIE LOSING THEIR RIDER, THEY DETERMINED AFTER A REPLAY THAT IT WAS THEIR OWN FAULT AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CORRINA CORRINA was a bit slow to gather, moved up inside on the first turn before being guided out heading up the backstretch bumping a rival in the
process while seeking room, advanced four wide on the far turn engaging the leader at the quarter pole, edged away in the final furlong under just mild
urging. BYE BYE BRANDI moved to the fore soon after the start, set the pace racing off the rail in the two to three path, was engaged by the winner at the
quarter pole, fought on gamely before yielding grudgingly. OUR TIME TO SHINE angled in early on the turn to race nearer the rail two to three wide
mid-division, was between foes early up the backstretch, kept on one-paced. DESERT SPIRIT exchanged a bump at the start, was kept wide off the rail and
was not a threat. PASSION BELLE stalked from just outside and off the leader, raced mostly three to four wide, steadily weakened. CATTY DOM trailed
near the inside and was not a threat. FLAXY LADY exchanged a light bump at the start, raced outside foes mid-pack about four wide, was bumped out
heading up the backstretch to the far turn, failed to rally.

MARK THE WINNER ran off pace in front for most of the race then coming onto the stretch drifted out and was between two foes charging hard to the wire
and took the lead just before the wire. PAYINGOFFMYMARKER set the early pace as they left the gate, their pace was pressed on the inside as they outran
that foe they got caught at the wire by foe on the outside. MAKE UP A STORY ran in the middle of the pack with a steady pace then coming down the
stretch took to the outside to have a strong rally to contest the lead at the wire. WAY TO RULE ran in the front of the pack as they pressed the pace they
hung mid stretch around the sixteenth pole. MARK IT DOWN ran in the middle of the pack throughout the race with an even pace. STREET MARK trailed
early on in the race then passed a tired foe late into the stretch. STORM IN THE VALLE ran in the front of the pack off pace from the leaders then after the
turn they hung slightly as they dropped back down the stretch.

Footnotes
LET HIM BE moved straight to the front, set the pace racing just off the rail, drew clear when asked, was kept to the task but lugged out a bit late.
SMARTSREALGOOD raced in behind foes in the four path into the turn, was hard to corner into that bend, shifted out six wide coming to the quarter pole,
kept on under stout urging and got the nod for place. ANTONIOS MARK advanced outside five wide into and on the turn, lost the nod for place. SAMBAS
MARK switched out early up the backstretch, was in the three path into the turn, steadied on heels slightly nearing the three-eighths, ran on. MAMIE'S LAST
HOPE chased from outside then between runners four wide, had no extra for the drive. SWEET MONEY bumped the inside rival at the start, lacked early
speed racing off the inside, swung eight deep into upper stretch, was not a threat. STORM LEADER was within range three wide into the turn, dropped back
and faded. NEW MEXICO JEREMY was bumped inward fairly hard at the start, angled in further and moved forward inside, was within range into the turn,
weakened.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY WHISKY ran almost gate to wire as they ran, they had multiple foes press the pace but none to take the lead away and they pulled away
from the pack at the last hundred feet. DIABOLICAL STORM ran in the middle of the pack then had a late rally down the stretch. DELBERT TOO ran in the
middle of the pack then coming down the stretch followed the winner to the wire. EVACUEE was off slow from the gate then took the rail to make up ground
and had a strong rally down the stretch. ONE MARK ran in the back of the pack then took to the far outside and with a strong bid made up ground. BYE
BYE MATTY P ran in the front of the pack pressing the pace of the leader but the pace was too much and hung at the sixteenth pole. MASSIVE ROAR ran
off pace from the leader then hung back slightly and took to outside for a slight bid. TUCUM ran in the middle of the pack then hung late stretch dropping
back. NO PASA NADA ran in the middle of the pack with an even pace then dropped a few positions after the turn. IZERIGHT trailed early for most of the
race then passed a tired foe late into the stretch. DIABOLICAL RULER ran off pace from the leader then faded at the start of the stretch.

Footnotes
DOER NOT A FAKER had the early lead, was overtaken before the half-mile marker ceding the lead to press from inside but just off the fence, was
resurgent turning into upper stretch retaking command, moved clear by mid-stretch then lasted to hold off a late run of a rallying foe. FIRST AGAIN moved
up inside foes but just off the fence into the turn, moved out further coming into upper stretch three to four wide in behind the leaders, surged late but just
missed. MAMA WAS A ROCKET was bumped at the start, coaxed forward between runners, made the lead outside the half racing three to four wide, was
challenged late on the turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TIZ A JOURNEY was forwardly-placed pressing outside five
wide just off the leaders, kept on evenly in the stretch. MOONLIGHT WARRIOR broke outwardly bumping and bothering the outer two foes, was forced out
by a rival heading to the turn, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, evened out. SHAME ON CHARLOTTE was in a bit tight just after the break and raced a
little awkwardly early, trailed, saved ground, passed tired foes inside. JENNY'S PENNY switched out off the inside up the backstretch, raced toward the
back three wide into the turn, came out wider for the drive, had no rally. LEONAS GIRL was forced out and had some bumps at the start while being
shuffled back a bit, lacked early speed racing well off the inside going in the five to six path into the turn, floated nine wide into upper stretch, was not a
threat. LEAP YEAR NIGHT was forwardly-placed pressing briefly from between runners four wide, dropped back on the turn, floated out wider into upper
stretch and continued fading. BETTER BELIEVE reared at the start losing the rider. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED
ALL RUNNERS RECEIVED A FAIR BEGINNING.

Footnotes
ANCIENT LAND had the early lead inside into the first turn but was overtaken past the seven-eighths easing back content to track from in behind the
leaders up the backstretch, shifted out five wide coming to the quarter pole, drifted out a bit further in upper stretch taking the lead just past the eighth pole
and continuing to drift a bit, prevailed. HENRY ON THE RUN went back to the paddock to get a new rider, was floated five wide into the first turn, made a
strong middle move still about five wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths making a bid outside runners, was in command with a narrow advantage
while drifting in a bit in upper stretch, overtaken in mid-stretch and outfinished but saved the place. ALL CHROME was floated six wide into the first turn,
made a steady advance widest of all into the far turn, kept on in the stretch, missed second. SPINNING BLACK broke outwardly, moved forward three wide
pressing into the first turn, took the lead soon after and moved clear while shifting in a bit to set the pace from just off the rail up the backstretch, was
challenged by a couple outside foes on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. COMET CAUSEY was caught five wide outside runners into the first turn
stalking the pace, moved forward up the backstretch to press four then three wide, bid between foes on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. THUNDER
DOME was forwardly-positioned early between foes, eased back then was taken back further early up the backstretch, switched out and was urged along
about the half-mile marker, swung eight wide into upper stretch, passed tired foes. MCTHANKS angled in early on the first turn to avoid being caught extra
wide, raced in behind about three deep, steadied on heels near the five-eighths, was encouraged along on the far turn racing five to six deep, ran on evenly.
MCMERCELUS was forced out at the start, drifted four wide into the first turn then came back in a bit racing off the pace, was in behind about mid-pack and
off the rail into the far turn, made no late bid. COLOR ME GONE had forward position four deep between runners into the first turn, steadily dropped back up
the backstretch, shifted in, failed to rally.
