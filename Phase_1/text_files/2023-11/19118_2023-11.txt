Footnotes
BLUE SILVER broke alertly and raced close to the early pace, advanced and moderately pressed the pace two wide into the turn, disputed the solid pace
along the bend and battled with IMPERIAL HORNET into the stretch, wore down that rival into the final sixteenth and determinedly held in a drive to prevail.
GEORGE HERMAN RUTH was pinched back at the start and was away slowly, regrouped and chased the solid early pace from the rear, was guided to the
outside entering the turn and chased four wide to the quarter marker, swung to the five path into upper stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, was
outfinished by the determined winner in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for second. IMPERIAL HORNET was asked for speed leaving the start
and assumed command in the early running, set a pressured pace into the turn while carving solid fractions, maintained a narrow lead into the stretch,
battled BLUE SILVER into the final sixteenth, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely for third at the
wire. DRUMADOON was prominent in the early running, chased the solid pace from a two wide path, ran in pursuit while between runners approaching the
quarter marker, mounted a two wide bid into the stretch and raced within aim nearing the furlong pole, could not sustain that run into deep stretch and
weakened. LET GEORGE DO IT broke out at the start and crowded neighboring rivals, raced close to the solid early pace and tracked the leading pair into
the turn, saved ground while well placed approaching the top of the stretch, lost position heading to the furlong grounds and did not offer a late rally. EL
CAPRICHO broke in at the start and crowded neighboring rivals, chased the early pace from the outside, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground
into the stretch and did not threaten in the final furlong. ZHIVAGO bobbled a bit at the start then was squeezed by neighboring runners and was away
slowly, chased three wide into the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and lacked a late response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE START OF THE RACE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
SEASON TO REMEMBER came away well then tracked EXTREME BLAZE just off the pace and a path out while always traveling well, responded when
asked to go after the that foe at the quarter pole, got some resistance to that challenge through the stretch run but kept to task and gained the advantage
inside the sixteenth pole. EXTREME BLAZE sprinted clear from the break under some urging, lead the field to the stretch, battled back when challenged by
SEASON TO REMEMBER at the top of the stretch, held on gamely but gave way grudgingly inside the final sixteenth. TIME TO SMILE broke well, but was
not asked for speed from the break, settled in a tracking spot along the rail, then was kept in a drive from the half and was slowly gaining ground at the end.
OUT OF STARS broke well but could not keep pace in the initial stages, raced four wide down the backstretch then continued that path through the turn,
swung out another two paths for the stretch run then dove towards the rail approaching the furlong marker and ran with some late interest to improve to
fourth. LUCKY LOCKETT was away a beat slow then allowed to settle into stride near the rear, kept to the inside and bided time behind horses through the
turn, responded when asked to swing out a path and split horses near the five-sixteenths pole, ran on some but was outfinished. SHEZA QUEEN BEE broke
a bit slowly then was hustled to race mid-pack to the turn, started to make a run approaching the five-sixteenths, came in to the stretch four wide and
flattened out under pressure.

Footnotes
SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) bobbled slightly leaving the start, settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground while
unhurried through the backstretch run, was roused into the far turn and improved position at the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch and chased
ANNIE'S HOPE to the furlong grounds, closed well into the final sixteenth, pressured ANNIE'S HOPE in deep stretch and overtook the runner-up in the final
strides to prevail. ANNIE'S HOPE was sent leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, set solid early fractions then was well handled
through a moderate half-mile pace, showed the way along the far turn and was asked for more into the stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker,
was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off SAKURA FLAVOR in deep stretch and was tagged for the win on the wire, while
holding safely for second. ADAPTED MEMORY was forwardly placed into the first turn, maintained a three wide path into the backstretch run and tracked
the decent pace to the half-mile marker, chased three wide along the far turn, was asked for run four wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong
pole, re-bid into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. STORMY ROUGE was prominent leaving the start, was
hard to place and lugged out along the first turn, recovered and settled three wide into the backstretch run, chased four wide into the far turn and maintained
that four wide path into the stretch, offered a mild late rally but was not able to impact the top three in the final stages. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE broke alertly,
took back and tracked the early pace from a two wide position, was well positioned while saving ground through the backstretch run, chased two wide to the
quarter marker, lacked a response at mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. INFINITE LOVE settled three wide into the first turn, pulled on the rider
through the backstretch run and made a middle move to prompt the pace to the half-mile marker, pressured ANNIE'S HOPE into the far turn, could not keep
pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
RAFANELLI broke out a bit but went straight to the lead, opened up while always well-handled, responded at the top of the stretch when asked to quicken,
put some distance on the field and won handily under intermittent urging. I'M A RISQUE GIRL settled near the rear of the compact field to the stretch, made
a forward move from the seven-sixteenths pole and through the turn while three wide, responded to strong handling down the stretch to rally for second. A
ROUSING BABE was under some restraint from the start but pulled the rider into a forward position going into the turn, loomed a threat inside passing the
quarter pole, chased the winner home, could not match strides late and was lost the place in the late stages. LAURA BRANIGAN raced close up early and
through the turn, was set down with a quarter mile to go and ran on well between horses but was not able to produce another gear when needed. DADDY
INDEED was outrun in the early stages, chased under pressure through the turn then was unable to improve down the stretch.

Footnotes
SAREEHA (IRE) vied for the early lead leaving the chute, assumed command and established the front into the first turn, showed the way into the
backstretch run then drew off while setting a solid pace to the half-mile marker, extended the lead along the far turn while in hand, raced well clear into
mid-stretch, kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth, felt moderate pressure in deep stretch, dug in and held safely in a drive at the finish.
BOURBON GLAZE tracked the early pace leaving the chute, forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked SAREEHA from the two path into the
backstretch run, raced closest to the loose leader through the backstretch run, ran in pursuit into the far turn, cut into the leader's margin at mid-stretch,
closed into the final sixteenth, mildly pressured SAREEHA in deep stretch but could not reel in the winner and held for second at the finish. OH ANGEL
broke a step slowly leaving the start, unhurried in the early stages and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail to the half-mile marker and saved
ground into the far turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch, closed willingly in the final furlong, just missed for second at the finish and held safely in
the end for third. TIZ MY PRINCESS settled off of the solid early pace, tracked outside of rivals through the backstretch run, was steered three wide into the
far turn and roused four wide into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong but was not able to impact the top three in deep stretch. TURIAF broke alertly and
vied for the early lead leaving the chute, took back into the first turn and tracked from the inside into the backstretch run, saved ground while tracking the
solid pace to the half-mile marker, chased to the quarter pole, swung to the three path into upper stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but needed more in
the late stages. SHE'S A BIT SASSY settled in the second flight in the early stages, raced three wide into the first turn and tracked the solid pace outside of
runners along the backstretch run, chased two wide along the far turn, lost position into the stretch and lacked a response in the final furlong. HAPPY IS
settled in the second flight to begin, was a bit keen into the first turn and steadied off of heels into the turn, tracked the solid pace two wide and between
runners through the backstretch run, dropped back into the far turn and did not factor in the stretch.

IT AINT OVER took back in the early stages and tracked the decent pace outside of runners, chased two wide to the quarter marker and swung four wide
for the drive, improved position at the furlong pole, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and was up in the final strides for a
determined win. DADS DREAM broke alertly and was prominent away from the start, stalked the decent early pace two wide into the turn and pressed
AUTISM PUZZLE to the quarter pole, battled with that foe into the stretch, took command and shook free inside of the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead
heading to the sixteenth-pole, was all out to hold off IT AINT OVER in deep stretch and was nailed on the wire for the win, while besting the rest. AUTISM
INCLUSION tracked the decent pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the drive
and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final furlong but could not impact the top pair in the final stages and was clear in the end for third. DIAMOND
CONCERTO was squeezed leaving the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the turn, improved position
at the quarter marker and tipped two wide into the stretch, rallied two wide at the quarter pole, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and
finished evenly. CORAL CAT lacked early speed, chased two wide into the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, made a steady advance through the lane
and improved position in the final sixteenth. AUTISM PUZZLE was sent to establish the early lead and set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out decent
fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, fought with DADS DREAM into the stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and faded in
deep stretch. CLEAR THE COAST vied for the early lead leaving the start and raced close to the decent pace, was a bit rank and hard to place while just off
of the leading pair heading into the turn, chased two then three wide along the bend, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, could not keep pace at the
furlong grounds and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
WODETON (FR) was forwardly placed away from the start, came under a snug early hold and tugged on the rider while two wide into the first turn, was still
a bit keen into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, loomed three wide into the far turn, rallied
into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled with HOT JOURNEY into the final sixteenth, shook free from the runner-up in deep stretch
and drew away to prevail. HOT JOURNEY was prominent leaving the start and stalked the pace into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and
attended to the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, was given his cue into the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, took command
in upper stretch and held a narrow lead at the furlong marker, met the bid of WODETON into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in
deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely in the end for second. MOVIETIME was forwardly placed leaving the break, stalked the decent early
pace from the inside, was well positioned through the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn, advanced along the second turn, waited for racing
room at the quarter marker and tipped two wide into the stretch, continued to race in tight into upper stretch and found room at the furlong grounds, could
not match strides with the top two into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and held well for third at the finish. KEEN HEIR was crowded by
TEAGANS ATM leaving the start and was away a step slowly, settled in the second flight early on and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate
pace while two wide heading to the half-mile marker, was coaxed along two wide to the quarter pole and advanced nearing the top of the lane, swung to the
four path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, offered a mild rally in deep stretch, was outfinished and just missed for third. ALGERIA (IRE)
broke a step slowly at the start and was allowed to settle, raced two wide along the backstretch run then was steered to the three path heading to the
half-mile marker, chased outside of rivals into the far turn and loomed at the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong
marker, offered a mild late rally in deep stretch but needed more in the final stages. RICH GOLD was crowded at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried
in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run and advanced approaching the half-mile marker,
saved ground into the far turn and continued his gain at the quarter marker, mounted an inside rally into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong pole,
could not sustain his run into deep stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. YOU KIDDING ME settled outside of runners leaving the start, tracked the
moderate pace from the second flight through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the far turn and lost position at the quarter pole, trailed into the
stretch and lacked a late rally. TEAGANS ATM broke in at the start and crowded neighboring rivals, recovered and assumed command leaving the break,
set the pace into the first turn, carved out moderate fractions while showing the way to the half-mile marker, came under pressure at the quarter marker, was
overtaken into upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
HERSABIGGIRL broke in a bit at the break then took the worst of the bumping out of the gate, took up, and spotted the field a few lengths head start, got
into a good rhythm passing the five furlong marker, angled over to the two path to save some ground, navigated a clear path through the turn, emerged four
wide for the stretch run, produced a strong rally gained the lead inside the final sixteenth and was widening at the wire. TIZ THE PROSPECT broke well and
was content to stalk DAWN AT LAST to the turn, was the outside horse of a trio that went to challenge that one passing the three furlong marker, pulled
away with ZOE'S PRIDE at the top of the stretch, battled that rival to deep stretch, took a short lead past the eighth pole but could not hold of the winner.
ZOE'S PRIDE broke well then was not pressed to be part of the early mix, moved up on the inside to challenge DAWN AT LAST passing the three furlong
pole, moved out to the two path and was between horses turning for home, battled with TIZ THE PROSPECT down the lane but was outfinished. BLUE
BREEZE broke well then got pinballed between ZOE'S PRIDE and HERSABIGGIRL in the initial strides, recovered and stayed in the clear three to four
wide down the backstretch and through the turn, launched a rally from the three furlong pole, sustained the run into the stretch but was unable to catch the
top three. STANDFORGRIT came away in good order, was allowed to settle into stride while the pace scenario played out, moved up just behind the pace
through the turn then backed off a bit when put in tight by ZOE'S PRIDE at the three-furlong pole, loomed but did not have a clear path through the turn then
was unable to mount a serious rally down the stretch, finishing evenly. LISA'S VALENTINE veered out sharply after the break, bumped with BLUE BREEZE
on the outside then rebounded into DAWN AT LAST inside, recovered to race mid-pack to the turn, started to lose ground after passing the half-mile pole,
struggled to keep up through the turn and only managed to pass one straggler in the late stages. DAWN AT LAST broke in after the break, made some
contact with LISA'S VALENTINE then set out for the lead, took the field to the turn, fought back the bids of a pair of challengers from the five-sixteenths
pole, battled to mid-stretch then tired in the final furlong.
