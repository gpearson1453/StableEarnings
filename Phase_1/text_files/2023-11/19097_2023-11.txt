Footnotes
KINGDOM QUEEN was well rated early on the outside, made a three wide move on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, then drew clear in the
furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR tracked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command on
the inside by the quarter pole to the furlong marker, but could not go with the winner while saving the place award. CHARM ALARM was rated early two
wide, shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn to be in contention but needed more kick late while just missing the place award, bested rest.
POSITIVE FORCE set the pace on the inside, then chased the pace three wide off the turn and weakened, held last spot in the superfecta.
LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT was settled early and saved ground on the turn but lacked a rally. SURPRISINGLY SWEET checked leaving the eleven
sixteenths and then was wide on the turn and was not a factor. BOWTOTHEQUEEN stumbled at the start, saved ground on the turn and then was eased
late, walked off.

Footnotes
GRAND WISER was well rated on the inside, made a three wide move on the turn and took over leaving the three sixteenths and then drew away while
being ridden out, wrapped up late. LAUGHING BOY pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then was headed off
the turn by the winner and could not go with that rival while being clearly second best. MIDNIGHT ACT stalked the early pace three wide, between rivals by
the half mile marker, then chased the pace two wide by the quarter pole and held the show award late. MY REDEMPTION was settled three wide and came
five wide into the lane and improved position late but needed more. KAZ SUGAR BANK was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside and
weakened. CRITICAL THINKING was settled early on the inside, shifted off the inside on the turn and had no rally. HERE'S WALDO set a pressured pace
on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
EGOT A POKER FACE was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a three wide move on the far turn, then loomed boldly off the
turn and drew away in the final furlong to prove best, driving. JAYJAYDEE was four wide into the first turn, pressed the early fast pace three wide, made a
two wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then was headed by the winner leaving the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival the final
sixteenth, second best. RADIEUX was settled on the inside, shifted off the inside on the far turn to go around the tiring pace setter, then dropped back to the
inside in the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. STRAWBERRY TREAT was settled early, between rivals on the backstretch, dropped back to trail
the field on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. COOL COMEDIAN was settled early on the outside and weakened. RUBY BLEU was
three wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace while racing off the inside, then dropped to the inside on the far turn and stopped.

IF WE GET LUCKY stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to vie for command off the turn and then took over and drew off in the final
furlong to prove much the best, ridden out. NORTHWOODS trackd the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to be second
best. SUNSHINE HARRY chased the pace in between rivals and was along for the show award. MACHO HONCHO chased the pace and was three deep
on the turn but lacked the needed rally while improving to gain the last spot in the superfecta. STORMY FIRE was settled early, four wide on the turn and
came widest into the lane and had no rally. LETSGETLUCKYTONITE chased the pace on the inside, three wide into the lane, then angled in nearing the
furlong marker and had no rally. HE IS BAD set the pace on the inside and weakened in the final furlong. HARVEY SPECTER was well placed on the inside
and weakened.

BECKON bobbled at the start, then stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn, drew out off the turn and then maintained a safe margin late
to prove best, driving. MIKEY'S JEWEL was well rated early two wide, three wide by the quarter pole and had a late rally to be second best. MERCY
MERCY was three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace in the two path, inside on the far turn and then faded, held show award. JUSTIN
TIME was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and had a late rally. TEACHER DRAMA was reluctant to load, off slowly, advanced three wide
nearing the half mile marker and then weakened on the turn. SWITCHRATTLENROLL chased the pace on the inside and tired.
