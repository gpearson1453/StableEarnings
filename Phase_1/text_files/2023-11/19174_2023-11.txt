Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY was roused to the front to press the pace to the quarter pole then took command and drew clear. GOLD CRUSHER went to the early
lead on the inside to the quarter pole then was over taken from outside rival but held on to be second best. IN THE ARCH was unhurried around the first
turn then raced five wide down the backstretch, tipped in to four wide on the final turn and rallied to be best of the rest. MISSED THE BOAT raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid but flattened out. EYE DEE KAY raced near the back down the backstretch then made a
three wide bid on the final turn, moved out to four wide in the stretch and improved position late. DRIED PEPPER raced off the pace from the inside through
the final turn but failed to menace. SPERLE saved ground to no avail. COUSVINNYSACANUCK raced in the middle of the pack from three wide through the
final turn then moved out to four wide into the stretch but didn't make a rally. DOUBLE THUNDER raced near the back and was not a threat.

Footnotes
KAHAAL sprinted away from the gate to a clear lead and was kept to task in the stretch. ADIEU ACES was off the pace early then launched his three wide
bid at the three furlong marker but was no match for the winner. FLOWER CAT tracked the leaders to the turn then made an inside bid on the turn but was
outfinished in the stretch. HALF A BUCK raced near the back to the turn while racing on the inside then made a rail bid in the stretch to improve his position
in the drive. CLASSIC RED RACER raced in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. CUSTOM PRAYER raced near the back then moved between
horses at the three furlong marker and faltered. LOVE TO SINGH trailed the field and was not a factor. PRICED RIGHT was reluctant to load into the
starting gate then was hustle along to be off the pace on the backstretch and gave way on the turn.

TRUE CRIMSON stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally and drew off in the final
sixteenth. ALPHIN went to the front to a pressured lead to midway through the final turn then drew clear going into the stretch but was overtaken in the final
sixteenth but held on for the place. COLE'S SENSATION vied for the early lead into the first turn then settled off the pace through the final turn, slipped
through on the inside and held on for the show. STYLING HOOK pressed the pace from the two path to the end of the final turn and weakened. TINCAN
CAT was unruly behind the gate while being reluctant to load then was roused to the to off the pace going five wide into the first turn and raced three wide
down the backstretch and was not a factor. SMOOTH CUSTOM was bumped by outside rival leaving the gate then was allowed to settle on the inside,
moved up the rail down the backstretch and faltered. ST PIERRE was allowed to settle down the backstretch but was never a threat. GRAYSONS
MALAGRA was pinched back at the start and trailed the field through the final turn. A FOOL FOR CARLOS broke inward at the start then lacked room going
into the first turn and had to steady slightly, settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then dropped back going into the final turn and was
eased, walked off.

Footnotes
MBAGNICK (CHI) went four wide into the first turn then made a looming three wide bid at the three furlong marker and dueled down the stretch outside of
FLEETRIDGE to prevail. FLEETRIDGE pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, vied for the lead on the final turn and took a brief lead
into the stretch and dueled on the inside of MBAGNICK (CHI) to the wire and was outnodded. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. was a little rank going into the first
turn then cut the corner to take a challenged lead to the eighth pole and gave way but held on for the show. WISE VERDICT was allowed to settle while
saving ground down the backstretch then slipped up the rail on the final turn to improve his position. BLUE CHEESE saved ground while racing in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild inside bid on the final turn but was empty in the stretch. EXTIRPATOR raced off the pace to the
three furlong maker then gave way. SMART N INTUITIVE raced in the middle of the pack from the two path down the backstretch then retreated.
AMERICAN CODE was unhurried and trailed the field.

Footnotes
ROYAL CONSORT went to the front to an unchallenged lead and proved best. BARAHIN stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then tipped
out to three wide into upper stretch for a late run but couldn't catch the winner and was second best. CARLOS' BLAST raced in the middle of the pack from
off the rail and was able to pass the tiring rival to move up and hold on for the show. G'S STORM was off a step slow, saved ground while racing in the
middle of the pack then made a rail bid in the stretch for a late run to improve position and miss the show. NEW DICE was unhurried down the backstretch
then moved up on the inside around the final turn and split horse in mid stretch while making a late run and improved position. LET'S GO RANDOM tracked
the leaders to the top of the stretch and weakened. HOMELAND MESSA was never a threat. WEIRD YEAR was always back. BYATHREAD was off the
pace down the backstretch and gave way.

MISS TULSA raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then took aim at the leader with a three wide bid at the quarter pole and took command
at the sixteenth pole to draw clear. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN went to the front to a clear lead to set the pace and held that position to the top of the stretch and
was overtaken in the final sixteenth but was able to hold on for the place. ABSOLUTELY raced off the pace on the inside through the final turn then moved
out to two wide in the final sixteenth showing late effort but missed the place. R T'S GEM tracked the leaders from the two path to the top of the stretch but
lacked the late response needed. ADDI BUG was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch and saved ground around the final turn angle out
into the stretch for the late run. MISS DARLENE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside to the final turn then moved out to three wide in the stretch but
had no impact. MAGNA COLORS was unhurried around the first turn then made up ground through the final turn, went four wide into the stretch but was too
little too late. RIOBELLA stalked the pace from three wide to the three furlong marker and weakened. ROSIE'S ANGUS raced in the middle of the pack from
three wide but never made a bid.

Footnotes
HOT LE ROY stalked the pace from three or four wide then made a bid on the final turn to take the lead at the top of the stretch and drew clear. DRAFT
CHOICE went to the front to set the pace and pulled clear on the final turn but was collared at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. JEFFROW saved
ground from off the pace then made a rail bid on the final turn, angled out to three wide in the stretch and closed well. MO CREDO raced near the back
down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and angled out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally. REDDINGANDLEE was allowed to
settle down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn and passed tiring rivals. CALLINGINTHENIGHT vied for the lead from two wide to
midway through the final turn then slowly retreated. THROWIN' SHADE rushed up and tracked the leaders on the backstretch but was not a threat. BET
AGAIN broke inward at the start to be off the pace from three wide to the final turn then gave way.

Footnotes
DREWMANIA raced off the pace then moved between horses midway through the turn then cut the corner into the stretch to take the lead and drew off.
THE DONEGAL CLAN chased the leaders around the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch to make a strong late rally. MR. SHORTY went to
the front to a pressured lead through the turn then was overtaken at the top of the stretch and weakened. UPTURNED BRIM pressed the pace from three
wide to mid turn and gave way. DEFIANT MALICE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground around the turn and proved to be best of others.
MICHAEL'S MOON rushed up to vie for the lead from the inside to the middle of the turn and tired. HELLO MR COPELAND raced evenly and was not a
factor. LEGENDARY DRAGON broke inward at the start but was never in contention. COWBOY CAUSE was not a threat. HASTKRAFTER trailed the field
and was outrun.
