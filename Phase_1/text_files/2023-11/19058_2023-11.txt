Footnotes
SALESMAN (IRE) was squeezed early, jammed through and opened clear to control the tempo, lobbed along in hand through the opening mile, let out a
notch and widened his advantage into the final turn, settled into the lane well clear, remained unchallenged and was geared down in the final yards. WIN
THE DAY was allowed to settle off of the inside, worked his way forward down the backstretch, ranged into striking distance on the final turn, but failed to
seriously menace the winner while clearly proving best of the rest. KISS TODAY GOODBYE was nearest the pace three wide, dropped off of the leader
after a mile, weakened further but toiled on to preserve the minor award. SERIFOS saved ground to little avail. SISKANY (GB) tracked off of the inside for a
mile and dropped out.

Footnotes
SEAL TEAM (GB) traveled along the inside and got put in tight quarters entering the first turn, went between rivals on the backstretch, made progress in the
two path on the second bend, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied four deep into the final sixteenth and proved best under right handed
encouragement. SILVER KNOTT (GB) showed early speed between rivals then stalked in the two path, ridden along into the lane, moved out and launched
a bid three deep with a sixteenth left to run and got outkicked by the winner. WEBSLINGER traveled three wide early then outside a rival near the back,
steered out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane, closed well and missed the place. REIQUIST stalked the pace
from the rail, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out into the lane, fought between rivals into the final sixteenth and got outkicked. ALMENDARES (GB)
traveled between rivals near the back early on, three deep on the backstretch, continued three wide into the lane and finished willingly. WATSONVILLE
stumbled a bit leaving the gate, dueled three deep early then took a stalking position in the two path, applied pressure on the backstretch, dueled on the far
turn, cleared in upper stretch but yielded to rivals in the final sixteenth. PANIC ALARM (IRE) reserved and steered to the inside, moved out in upper stretch
and summoned a mild rally. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside, moved out on the far turn, came five wide into the lane,
angled out widest in the stretch and kept on to improve. REINCARNATE bumped with inner rival at the start, forwardly placed early then had to steady off
heels into the clubhouse turn, moved over to the inside, settled in mid-pack, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. PACKS A WAHLOP dueled from
inside then cleared around the clubhouse turn, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the second bend, lost command in upper
stretch and weakened. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) chased in the two path in mid-pack, inched closer on the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn,
exited the bend five wide and failed to respond when called upon. MONDEGO (GB) broke a step slow, tracked three deep early, moved up outside the top
pair on the backstretch, could not keep pace and chased the leaders on the far turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the lane. CALIFORNIA BAY
pulled and had to steady off heels first time through the stretch, traveled three deep around the clubhouse turn, four deep leaving the backstretch, started to
weaken on the second bend, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CODY'S WISH, crowded at the start, was unhurried near the back of the pack, split horses into the second turn to commence his advance, moved into
striking distance toward the inside, angled out leaving the quarter pole, took dead aim once straightened for drive, came to level terms inside the furlong
marker, came in and brushed with NATIONAL TREASURE near the sixteenth pole, came in again bumping that one late and was fully extended to prevail
by the narrowest margin. NATIONAL TREASURE opened clear to dictate terms just off of the inside, settled into the stretch still clear, drifted out and dug in
to meet the daunting challenge of CODY'S WISH inside the furlong marker, brushed with that one a sixteenth out, was bumped nearing the wire when
CODY'S WISH came in some, fought hard but was denied in the final bob. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING tracked the pace three deep, was fanned out further
leaving the second turn when CODY'S WISH came out, flattened during the drive but safely maintained the minor award. CHARGE IT was allowed to settle
three wide in mid pack and failed to make headway. ZOZOS was forwardly placed along the inside to the second turn and faltered. STAGE RAIDER lagged
well back and was never a factor. SHIRL'S BEE bobbled at the start, recovered quick and move up three wide for a contending position, but came up empty
after six furlongs and dropped out. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving CODY'S WISH and NATIONAL TREASURE, but
following the review made no change to the order of finish.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE was away in good order, settled in hand off of the inside, launched a bold bid three deep, forged command leaving the turn, drifted in
taking the path of SOCIETY near the three-sixteenths pole, quickly opened clear and held safely. YUUGIRI tracked the pace three wide, moved with
GOODNIGHT OLIVE leaving the turn, came four wide, was unable to go on with that one, but continued on well to earn the runner up spot. THREE
WITCHES was allowed to settle, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, split horses and advanced on the turn, angled out four wide and was making
up ground. SOCIETY broke inward bumping MEIKEI YELL (JPN) at the start, was straightened away quickly and contested the pace to the outside of EDA
through the turn, met the bid of GOODNIGHT OLIVE into the stretch, checked when that one came in near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened
thereafter. KIRSTENBOSCH broke a step slow, was bumped hard and forced in at the start, settled saving ground at the tail of the field, shifted out and
finished with belated improvement. CLEARLY UNHINGED was allowed to settle along the inside, tipped out to make a mild bid between rivals entering the
stretch, but failed to sustain the drive. EDA dueled along the inside, but came up empty leaving the turn and retreated. MATAREYA was allowed to settle,
tucked in to save ground, but lacked a response when called upon. MEIKEI YELL (JPN) was jostled between foes at the start, moved into contention four
wide, but was through after a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
MASTER OF THE SEAS (IRE) dropped back and angled into the two path, ridden along on the far turn, swung wide into the stretch, flew late and nailed the
runner-up on the line. MAWJ (IRE) had early speed between rivals then took a stalking position along the rail, remained inside on the far turn then took aim
a bit off the rail into the stretch, launched a bid from outside in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole, led into the final moments but got caught at the wire.
CASA CREED tracked three deep then steered into the two path, inched closer on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied but lacked the needed
late punch in deep stretch. GINA ROMANTICA raced along the inside in mid-pack, shifted two wide on the far turn, angled out and bumped rival in upper
stretch, then produced a mild late bid to earn a minor award. SONGLINE (JPN) pulled and became rank early, settled into stride three then two wide,
continued in the two path into the second bend, steered out and entered the lane five wide, got bumped from inside in upper stretch and finished willingly in
the late stages. MORE THAN LOOKS taken back early and moved inside, trailed through the far turn, angled out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally
to improve position. LUCKY SCORE sat off the pace two wide then moved inside, cut the corner into the lane and lacked room in traffic in deep stretch.
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT tracked from inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked the needed late kick. KELINA (IRE) pulled early three
then two wide, remained off the rail into the drive and failed to threaten. DU JOUR chased three then two wide off the pace around the first turn, swung out
into the lane and lacked a rally. WIN CARNELIAN (JPN) away quickly to take the front, set the pace from inside, roused at the quarter pole, overtaken in
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ASTRONOMER showed early speed three deep then pressed from outside on the clubhouse turn, stalked
the pacesetter up the backstretch, came under a ride on the far turn and faded down the lane. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS antsy in the gate, came away
slow and lost his path, tucked inside near the back, ran up on heels and steadied into the far turn, remained inside to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IDIOMATIC prompted the pace to the outside of RANDOMIZED, poked her head in front nearing the furlong marker, fought determinedly and held the slim
advantage. RANDOMIZED came away in good order, angled in to set the pressured pace, relinquished the lead a furlong out, drifted out a smidge in the
drive keeping CLAIRIERE in tight, fought on doggedly but grudgingly gave in. LE DA VIDA (CHI) settled in hand off of the inside, moved up four wide
through the second turn and into the lane, tipped out further a furlong out, quickened once uncovered and was getting to the leaders late. CLAIRIERE came
away a bit slow, was unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, got through in rail skimming fashion, shifted out and slipped between
horses, churned on while in tight but failed to make headway. DESERT DAWN was allowed to settle, advanced between rivals on the second turn, came
four wide and battled on in tight traffic through the drive. SEARCH RESULTS settled in hand, made a sweeping bid five wide, came in a bit snugging up
ADARE MANOR a furlong out, but flattened thereafter and gave way. ADARE MANOR tracked three deep, bid between horses, was caught in tight in traffic
in the final sixteenth and weakened slghtly. WET PAINT settled saving ground, but lacked a response when asked. HOOSIER PHILLY was forwardly placed
along the inside through the second turn and stopped.

Footnotes
AUGUSTE RODIN (IRE) steadied behind rival crossing onto the dirt, settled two wide then moved inside, cut the corner into the lane, challenged from inside
at the top of the lane, cleared with a furlong left to run and remained strong under a drive to the wire. UP TO THE MARK got put in tight crossing onto the
dirt, tracked out of range off the inside, stalked three deep into the final turn, bid four wide into the stretch and got outkicked by the winner in the final furlong.
SHAHRYAR (JPN) pulled when trying to rate on the inside early, raced in mid-pack under hold, moved closer into the far turn, tipped out but lacked room
around the final bend, then finished determinedly for the show honors. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, saved ground
to the stretch, chased within striking range entering the final furlong but could not find more in the late stages. KING OF STEEL came away slow, tracked off
the rail then moved inside, shifted to the two path on the clubhouse turn, got blocked and had to alter around weakening rival at the five-sixteenths pole and
finished evenly in the furlong grounds. ONESTO (IRE) reserved two to three wide early, raced outside a rival into the far turn still near the back, angled out
and came five wide into the stretch but failed to threaten. WAR LIKE GODDESS traveled two wide outside a rival then moved out to the four path on the first
turn, moved to the inside trailing the field, went outside a rival on the backstretch, remained two wide into the lane, altered out in upper stretch, found traffic
at the sixteenth pole and could not rally late. MOSTAHDAF (IRE) pulled early and became rank on the first turn, settled between then two wide outside a
rival, went three deep into the final turn, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. BALLADEER sprinted clear and steered across to the inside, controlled
the pace to the final furlong, roused around the bend, clung to a narrow lead entering the stretch and gave way once overtaken. ADHAMO (IRE) showed
early speed then took a stalking position on the inside, tipped out and put in a mild bid with a quarter mile left to run but could not sustain the challenge and
weakened down the lane. BROOME (IRE) off slow to begin, stalked in the two path, pushed on into the far turn, dropped back around the bend, trailed three
wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO attended the pace along the inside, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, loomed large three deep entering the stretch, struck the front
three-sixteenths out, opened clear and held sway. DERMA SOTOGAKE (JPN) stalked the leaders in hand three wide, came four wide to make his bid,
kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. PROXY was allowed to settle, advanced between rivals through the second turn, wheeled out eight wide
into the stretch, churned on and was up late to earn the minor award. ARABIAN KNIGHT broke sharp, crossed over leaving the chute, set a contested pace
along the inside, was headed once straightened for the drive, stayed on to the final furlong and succumbed. USHBA TESORO (JPN) came away a bit slow,
settled saving ground, mounted a long drive on the backstretch, moved into contention on the second turn, angled out four wide to make his bid, but
flattened in the final sixteenth. BRIGHT FUTURE was allowed to settle off of the inside, came four wide and finished with a belated advance between foes.
SENOR BUSCADOR was bumped slightly at the start, settled at the tail of the field, moved up five wide on the second turn, but faltered in the final furlong
and faded. DREAMLIKE broke in a bit and bumped SENOR BUSCADOR slightly, tucked in to save ground, swung to the far outside leaving the second turn
but passed only the tiring ones. ZANDON was forwardly placed along the inside through the second turn and dropped out. SAUDI CROWN hounded
ARABIAN KNIGHT from the outside, was collared between horses leaving the second turn and came up empty entering the stretch. CLAPTON failed to
respond. MISSED THE CUT saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
NOBALS chased three deep between rivals, took a bump from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved over to the inside, saved ground through the
turn, rallied up the fence, drove clear in the final sixteenth and held over the late run from the runner-up. BIG INVASION settled inside, got put in tight near
the seven-sixteenths pole, hugged the rail through the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path at the eighth pole, launched a late bid but ran
out of time. AESOP'S FABLES (IRE) was off a bit slow to begin, raced outside a rival into the bend, angled four wide around the turn, moved out further in
the lane and closed well for third. LIVE IN THE DREAM (IRE) took control early and set the pace with JASPER KRONE alongside, cleared that rival into the
turn, showed the way clear into the final furlong, caught by the winner at the sixteenth pole, flattened late but managed to hold on for a minor award.
MOTORIOUS (GB) stalked outside rivals, bumped with NOBALS at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground when caught behind a rival on the turn, got boxed
in upper stretch, moved out to a clear path and finished willingly. ARZAK coaxed from the gate, chased four deep into and around the turn, raced within
striking distance into the final furlong but finished evenly late. BEER CAN MAN stalked five, four, then three deep early, forced to steady by a trouble rival
into the turn, came three wide into the lane and kept trying while unable to threaten. TONY ANN unhurried in the early going and moved inside, saved
ground to the stretch, then steered out and failed to threaten. ROSES FOR DEBRA forwardly placed off the inside then between rivals, exited the bend two
wide, got put in a bit tight in upper stretch and weakened. CARAVEL chased along the inside, drew closer around the bend, tipped two wide into the drive
and weakened. GEAR JOCKEY allowed to settle early off the rail, steadied inside the seven-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the drive and proved no
menace. JASPER KRONE pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader leaving the backstretch, became rank at the three-eighths pole, chased
in the three path into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER settled in hand, ranged into striking distance four wide through the turn, was full bore a furlong out, reeled in the leaders and edged clear in
the final yards. GUNITE stalked the pace, mounted a bold bid three wide leaving the turn, came to level terms nearing the furlong marker, kept on well but
was unable to resist the winner. NAKATOMI disputed the pace along the inside, dropped off of the leaders on the turn, got through and came again entering
the stretch, altered out in the final sixteenth and continued on willingly. SPEED BOAT BEACH broke sharp, contested the pace from the outside to the turn,
then towards the inside to the furlong marker, weakened slightly in the drive and grudgingly gave way. THE CHOSEN VRON settled in hand, came four
wide but went evenly and failed to seriously threaten. HOIST THE GOLD settled between horses in mid pack and lacked a response. DR. SCHIVEL settled
saving ground, was hemmed in and steadied midway through the turn, shifted out leaving the turn but came up empty thereafter. THREE TECHNIQUE was
unhurried, came four wide but was never a factor.
