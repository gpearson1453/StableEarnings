Footnotes
YES HE CAN rated nicely off of the solid early pace, tracked three wide to the quarter marker, was roused into upper stretch, took command at the furlong
marker and kept to task into deep stretch to prevail. BANDERA AZTECA tracked the solid early pace two wide, went two wide and between runners to the
quarter pole, swung three wide for the drive, closed willingly in the late stages and was up in the final strides to dead heat for the place. MIDNIGHT
SPECIAL was away in good order, conceded the early lead and stalked the solid pace into the turn, advanced two wide into the bend and pressed the pace
to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and chased YES HE CAN to the furlong pole, needed more in deep stretch and held for a share of
second at the wire. WINTER FALCON was allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the solid pace two wide into the turn, raced three wide to the
quarter marker and was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied while widest in the final sixteenth and just missed for the minor awards. HORSE DOCTOR
tracked the solid early pace from the inside, waited for racing room while two wide at the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and offered a
belated rally in the late stages. COWBOY CHARLIE was sent to establish the early lead, set a solid pace into the turn, was pressed by MIDNIGHT SPECIAL
to the quarter pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and chased YES HE CAN to the furlong grounds, lacked a response in deep stretch and faded. LAW
ABIDING tracked the quick early pace from the inside, lost ground at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch, could not keep pace
at the furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
J. B. BOOKS tracked the pace while racing three deep down the backstretch, jumped a shadow at the three-eighths pole, swung four to five wind into the
stretch finished well under strong handling, drifted in three paths in the late stages, put COME OUT FIGHTING in a bit tight near the rail but prevailed.
COME OUT FIGHTING took a bump from THICKEY BOY a few strides out of the gate then had to steady behind J.B. BOOKS, became hard to place and
lost some ground on the field, moved over to the rail but was racing greenly down the backstretch, kept to the inside path through the turn, ducked in at the
head of the stretch, almost hit the rail, tipped out to the two path for racing room and finished up well despite taking a bump from the winner in deep stretch
and getting crowded near the wire. SINGING N DANZING broke a step slow then was hustled forward, grabbed the early lead somewhat easily before the
five furlong pole, repelled a couple of challenges near the quarter pole, held clear turning into the stretch, lugged in perilously close to the rail, lost
momentum and was passed in the last furlong. THICKEY BOY broke well then veered in and bumped COME OUT FIGHTING a few strides after the break,
raced four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn, lugged in turning for home and took the path of READY TO STORM then had no to offer
in the late stages and was outrun to the wire. READY TO STORM broke well and was quickly up to press the pace before the turn, attempted to make a bid
through the turn but came under pressure passing the quarter pole, was already tiring when forced to steady when THICKIE BOY took the path in the
stretch and could not recover.

Footnotes
LILA AT THE BEACH took back to track the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and was well positioned nearing the quarter marker, mounted an
inside bid into upper stretch, took command and drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong marker, pulled away under moderate late urging and was
much the best. SMOOVE AS SILK ducked in a bit in the first few strides away from the start, tracked the decent early pace two wide and between runners
into the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and was boxed in into upper stretch, slipped to the inside and chased LILA AT THE
BEACH to the furlong grounds, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and outfinished AMANDA ROSE in deep stretch to secure second.
AMANDA ROSE was allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the decent early pace three wide into the turn and gained ground three wide at the
quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, needed more in the final sixteenth, was outfinished by SMOOVE AS
SILK for second and was clear in the end for third. THREAD COUNT broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, tracked the decent pace three
wide into the turn and gained ground three wide approaching the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker and did
not offer a late rally. HARBOR'S ROSE vied for the early lead away from the start, conceded the lead to FEELING FLUSH and raced close up to the decent
heading into the turn, advanced into the bend and pressed two wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased three then four wide
heading to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace into deep stretch and gave way. SEASON TO REMEMBER tracked the decent early pace from the
inside, lost position into the turn and chased to the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and re-rallied at the furlong marker, lacked the
needed response in the final sixteenth and did not factor. FEELING FLUSH was sent to establish the early pace, dictated terms into the turn and was
pressed through decent fractions along the bend, drifted to the two path nearing the top of the stretch, lost the lead to LILA AT THE BEACH and tired in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
CHAOKOON broke well and tracked behind the developing pace duel, went to challenge AMANOFMYSTATURE around the turn when that one slipped
away, pulled about even a the quarter pole, battled that stubborn rival down the stretch, gained a slight advantage inside the last sixteenth and held.
AMANOFMYSTATURE came away well and dueled in-hand with EDDIE CROSSWIRE in the early going, left that rival behind passing the seven-sixteenth
pole, opened up on the field through the turn, was taken on by CHAOKOON at the quarter pole, battled that one down the stretch, lost the lead in deep
stretch but battle back to the end in a game effort. DR PESCADO broke well and got good inside position racing close up to the half mile marker, got put in a
little tight before the turn, steadied briefly, lost some ground, switched to the outside for the run through the turn, responded to strong handling and ran on
down the stretch to get up for third. THE SANDY SURPRISE broke out at the start and made contact with EL BERRINCHES, then lacked any early speed
and raced well behind the field for the first quarter mile, shifting paths first in towards the rail then to the extreme outside, stared a run from the
seven-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch and ran on well enough to improve position. EDDIE CROSSWIRE bobbled at the break then broke
inward and put EL BERRINCHES in a tight spot, recovered nicely to get to the front and dueled inside of AMANOFMYSTATURE through the early stages,
could not keep pace with that one passing the seven-sixteenths pole, came under pressure near the five-sixteenths pole and kept on evenly the rest of the
way. EL BERRINCHES got pinballed at the start, recovered and rushed into contention by the half-mile pole, came under a drive passing the three furlong
pole then flattened out in the stretch. SURPRISE FASHION broke slowly then fought the rider a bit in the initial stages, dropped far behind in the early going,
made up a little ground by the turn but was never a factor.

Footnotes
R SWEET CANDY broke a bit awkwardly and was off a step slowly away from the gate, saved ground into the first turn and settled off of the solid early
pace, came in a bit tight approaching the backstretch run and steadied off of heels at the six-furlong pole, recovered and tracked the decent pace to the
half-mile pole, was well placed into the far turn, navigated around a tiring rival and made an inside move at the quarter pole, battled for the lead into upper
stretch, took command and turned away ARCTIC BREEZE at the furlong grounds, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and drew away in the late stages to
prove best. BEADS unhurried away from the start and settled two wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace two wide and between runners through the
backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile pole, roused four wide into the far turn and loomed at the quarter pole, maintained that four wide path
into the stretch, could not impact the winner inside of the furlong pole and ran on in the final sixteenth to be second best. ARCTIC BREEZE broke alertly and
vied for the lead away from the start, conceded the early advantage to MIRAGE CODE and stalked that runner through solid fractions into the backstretch
run, inched closer heading to the half-mile pole and gained command nearing the quarter marker, battled into upper stretch with R SWEET CANDY, could
not match strides with the winner into the final furlong, gave way in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. STAY UP
took back off of the early pace and tracked from the second flight, raced three wide into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace outside of runners
heading to the half-mile marker, improved position three wide into the far turn and came within aim of the lead approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked
into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, lacked a response in the late stages and weakened in deep stretch. CANDY LITZ chased the early pace
and went three wide into the first turn, tracked outside of runners into the backstretch and gained ground at the half-mile marker, was outrun heading to the
quarter pole, eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power. MIRAGE CODE showed early speed and vied for the lead leaving the break,
assumed command into the first turn and showed the way into the backstretch run, set solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was
pressed by ARCTIC BREEZE into the far turn, lost the lead to that rival nearing the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch, eased through the lane
and walked off under her own power.

AMERICAN FARMER rated nicely off of the early pace and settled into the first turn, was steered to the two path into the backstretch run and gained ground
heading to the half-mile marker, was well positioned into the second turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole,
mounted a sustained rally into the final sixteenth and responded into deep stretch, overtook KENNEBEC and was up in the final strides for a determined
win. KENNEBEC forwardly placed leaving the start and stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, was guided to the three path into the backstretch
run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile maker, was well placed into the far turn and gained ground three wide at the quarter pole, raced four
wide into the stretch and chased NO ICE NO GLASS to the furlong marker, confronted that rival inside of the furlong pole and took command into the final
sixteenth, felt late pressure from AMERICAN FARMER, was bested by the winner in the final strides and held for second at the finish. AVENUE was slow
into stride leaving the break and was given a few reminder taps in the early going, allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the
moderate pace through the backstretch run and improved position two wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive, closed willingly in the final
furlong, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. NO ICE NO GLASS assumed command leaving the break and set the
pace into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run and contested the pace with DULAS into the far turn, shook free
into the stretch, was confronted by KENNEBEC inside of the furlong marker and met that bid to the sixteenth-pole, could not keep pace into deep stretch
and weakened. TESORO prominent leaving the break, raced in tight into the first turn and was keen while on heels approaching the backstretch run, settled
into the backstretch and tracked the moderate pace from the inside, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn and came in tight at the quarter pole, swung
to the three path into upper stretch and raced in traffic at the three-sixteenths marker, found room heading to the furlong pole, lost ground at mid-stretch and
could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth. DULAS (IRE) forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the pace into the first turn,
advanced into the backstretch run and contested the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace with NO ICE NO GLASS into the far turn and
vied for the lead nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a response in the final sixteenth
and faded. BOASTER tracked the early pace two wide into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run and was well placed heading to the
half-mile pole, lost position into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
AMERICAN EMPIRE managed to avoid the trouble before the first turn but was forced to wide, moved into contention down the backstretch while always
traveling well, surged into the lead when asked to quicken with three furlongs to run, opened up under strong handling in the stretch and won going away.
THE SLAP was put in tight quarters at the fifteen-sixteenths pole when several runners converged, worked out into the clear around the first turn then
started making up ground on the leaders during the run down the backstretch, had to steady briefly near the seven-sixteenths marker, tipped out a path and
made a sweeping move through the far turn, responded when set down in the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished well clear of the third horse.
PLAYBOY STYLE ducked in at the start, making light contact with AMERICAN EMPIRE, took up, and was last in the early running, made a sustained run
when put into a stiff drive passing the three furlong pole, came into the stretch five wide and managed to gain the third spot. UPRIGHT broke sharply and
was hustled to the front, was joined by UNCLE DUSAN by the midpoint of he first turn, kept slightly in front of that rival to the seven-sixteenths marker, was
taken on by AMERICAN EMPIRE near the five-sixteenths pole, had no response, kept on with some courage down the lane but came up short of a minor
placing. COUNTRY BOY got away well and got a good tracking position through the first turn, held that position down the backstretch run, became boxed in
briefly through the far turn, followed the eventual winner into the stretch and ran on well up the rail but could not find another gear when needed. UPDRAFT
was hustled from the start but unable to contest the early pace, got put in tight near the fifteen-sixteenths pole and was shuffled back, worked up into better
position down the backstretch then launched a three wide bid around the far turn, came into the stretch about five wide and flattened out. L L L COOL raced
mid-pack through the far turn, was boxed in through the far turn but had no response once clear. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY lacked any speed from the break,
moved over to save ground before the turn, trailed far back down the backstretch, regained contact going into the far turn but continued to chase and never
made an impact. UNCLE DUSAN was hustled away from the gate and able to clear the field and move towards the inside going into the clubhouse turn, was
eager to engage but was restrained from doing so by the rider all the way down the backstretch then came under pressure and was put into a drive between
the seven-sixteenths and three furlong poles, struggle to keep up and came up empty in the stretch. THE RIDER OF THE SLAP LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE RIDER OF AMERICAN EMPIRE FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT THE OBJECTION WOULD BE DISALLOWED AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
BEAUDACIOUS allowed to settle leaving the start, was asked for a bit of run heading to the half-mile marker and tracked the fast pace into the turn, gained
ground along the bend and loomed four wide at the quarter pole, chased four wide into the stretch and continued his rally approaching the furlong marker,
battled for the lead with PROOF HE RIDES into the final sixteenth, repelled the runner-up in deep stretch and drew away in the final strides to prevail.
PROOF HE RIDES was prominent away from the start and tracked the fast early pace, was keen heading to the turn and raced a bit in tight nearing the
three-eighths marker, advanced two wide into the turn and was asked for run three wide into the stretch, chased MOB BOSS to the furlong marker and
matched strides with BEAUDACIOUS into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. SATANTA
settled off of the solid early pace and saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch, advanced at the furlong marker, finished well and was
up in time to secure third. MOB BOSS was prominent away from the start and raced close up to the fast early pace, stalked DINOS DIXIE into the turn then
advanced to press his stablemate to the quarter pole, battled into upper stretch then took command nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken nearing the
sixteenth-marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and weakened. WILD BILLY D chased the fast early pace from the inside, gained ground along the
turn, continued that advance into the stretch and mounted an inside bid nearing the furlong pole, tipped two wide heading to the final sixteenth, could not
sustain his run into deep stretch and flattened out. STORMIN GALILEO lost his path at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle and tracked the
fast early pace while between runners heading into the turn, improved position two wide along the bend, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong grounds and did not threaten. DINOS DIXIE was asked for speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, dictated terms to the
half-mile marker and set a fast pace into the turn, was engaged along the bend by MOB BOSS and disputed the pace with that rival to the quarter pole,
battled with MOB BOSS into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded. LESSONS OF AUTISM settled off of the solid early pace,
raced two wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and did not have an impact. FEROCIOUSLY broke out at the start, was pinched by neighboring
rivals then took up and was off slowly, tracked the fast pace from the inside, steadied while in tight quarters entering the turn, lost position and chased to the
quarter pole, lacked a response in the drive and did not factor.
