FACE IT ALONE was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, drew off leaving the turn and widened the margin while being wrapped up for the easy
score. NOW I'M HERE was rated three wide, made a mild bid four wide by the quarter pole, then battled for the place award in the lane and got that award
late. ROBBERY stalked the winner two wide early, made a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths and but flattened out in the lane, lost place award late.
CONTEMPTUOUS MISS was reserved early, shifted out and was six wide by the quarter pole and improved position late. LINOSSILVERGAL tracked the
pace on the inside and was empty in the final furlong. TOUGH AS NAILS chased the early pace on the inside, shifted out by the half mile marker, then was
between rivals on the turn and stopped in the drive.

headed and dueled for the lead on the inside by the quarter pole, gave way grudgingly in the furlong grounds and held on to the show award. SKIMBLE

WORST BEHAVIOUR was settled early on the inside, then shifted off the inside leaving the five sixteenths and begin to unwind, split rivals leaving the turn
and came three wide into the lane, angled out for aim and closed full of run to get up late to prove best, driving. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH stalked the early
pace and made a two wide bid in the lane, finished willingly but was out-kicked by the winner and grabbed the place award late. ORGANIZED CHAOS set
the early pace and was clear to the furlong marker, then dug in gamely but was caught late and then lost the place award on the wire. MELODIOUS
SINGER was in tight by the seven sixteenths two wide, then made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out the final furlong. MUNDLE OF JOY
tracked the pace along the inside, steadied slightly by the seven sixteenths and weakened. SALVAJE was bumped after the start, chased the pace on the
outside, then was three to four wide on the turn and weakened.
