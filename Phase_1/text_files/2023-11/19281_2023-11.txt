Footnotes
SUBTLE FAITH stalked from the rail, was roused through an opening along the inside midway around the turn, took the lead just before the quarter, and
kicked away down the stretch under a drive. CHERU tracked in the three path, ranged up in the six path approaching the quarter, swung from said position
into the stretch, and ran on for place. A J'S MEMORY trailed in the five path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning into the lane, and kept on
while on her left lead for show. TOODALOO Y'ALL rated in the two path, was nudged along from said position around the turn, tipped out to the three path
at the top of the lane, but flattened on her left lead. FOR THE THRILL laid up close in the five path, was coaxed into the turn, but faded turning into the
stretch. ZULLY BELLA pressed in the four path but yielded between foes rounding the turn. CORAZONA set the pace in the two path but gaveway at the top
of the lane.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING TONES lagged far back inside, advanced two wide the latter half of the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, surged while drifting out under
left-handed urging and was up on the wire. MISH was fractious in the gate, set the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, angled into the two path
entering the turn, dug in inside of SLIM SLOW SLIDER through the lane but was nailed on the wire. SLIM SLOW SLIDER pressed the pace in the three
path, battled on outside of the winner through the lane, edged closer but could not get past. EASTSIDE COOL had speed three and four wide, could not
keep pace nearing the quarter pole then was one-paced through the lane. BIG DADDY DAVE saved ground, lacked a rally and was vanned off. MORGAN
POINT chased the pace two wide and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
SABIAN prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch, reached even terms three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, dueled outside of VINSANITY
from there to deep stretch and edged ahead. VINSANITY set a pressured pace inside, vied inside of the winner from the five-sixteenths to deep stretch and
gave way grudgingly. COME DREAM WITH ME was bumped at the start, raced off the pace four wide and kept on to gain the show without threatening the
top two. OLD FLAG (IRE) raced off the pace five wide and passed tiring rivals. ARROW GHOST was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide
between foes and lacked the needed rally. PAPALOTE chased the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES pressed the
pace two wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole. TOUR GUIDE played no factor while racing two wide. MOLINERO broke slowly and was always outrun
while racing in the three path. TIZAFASTBULLET had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
CAPTURETHELAUGHTER broke out at the start, stalked in the six path, was roused from the five path into the turn, bid in the four path at the top of the
lane, took the lead just before the eighth pole, and was driven clear. TAPINTOYOURBEER pressed in the five path, bid going into the turn, led from the
three path turning into the lane, was caught by the winner before the eighth pole, but stayed on to secure place. SHA TIN chased in the four path, swung out
to the six path under a ride turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. RUNNIN' BLOCK broke slowly and trailed in the two path, was under right
handed encouragement along the rail rounding the turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the stretch, but flattened. LEGEND set the pace in the three
path, was challenged by an outer foe going into the turn, and yielded at the top of the stretch. DANLEY rated in the six path but was never a factor. IL
MALANDRINO raced off the pace from out in the eight path and never threatened. TRAVEL GUIDE tracked out in the seven path but backed up around the
turn.

DEMAR'S LEGACY stalked in the three path, bid going into the turn, took a short lead passing the quarter, opened up from the four path into the stretch,
and held on. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE tracked in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, shifted out to the five path turning into the stretch, and
ran on for place. MADNESS raced off the pace in the five path and finished evenly for show honors. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES trailed from the six path into
the stretch and made no impact. FAIRHOPECURLY set the pace in the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, but faded in the stretch. KAITIE KAIT

Footnotes
ATOMICALLY tracked the pace four wide, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU raced up
close two wide, took the lead near the eighth pole, led past the sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace along the rail,
yielded in midstretch and held well enough to preserve the show. SWEET TEMPTATION pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane.
TAMARINDO chased the pace four and five wide and lacked the needed rally. ANATOMY had early speed three wide, dropped back around the turn and
finished evenly. DEM A WONDER was up close between foes, checked entering the turn, saved ground and had no further bids. LYNX stumbled at the
start, saved ground and never threatened. THE MRS was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
CHAINA tracked in the two path, was ridden from the five path into the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, and stayed on to be up in the final
strides. SADIE BEAR stalked inside, was cued passing the quarter, bid from the five path entering the stretch, ran on to lead passing the sixteenth, but was
caught late by an outer foe to place. FLIRTINI set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, but evened out on her left lead for show.
PRINCESS BLAKELY bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid in midpack along the inside, was coaxed from the three path early into the turn, tipped
inside entering the lane, and finished evenly. DEFENDED bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path, angled out to the eight path turning
into the stretch, but made no impact. CHLOE'S TOY bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path but faded in the stretch.
SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL rated in the two path but was no factor. VINGATIVA chased in the four path but never threatened. LOVE RHAPSODY bumped with an
