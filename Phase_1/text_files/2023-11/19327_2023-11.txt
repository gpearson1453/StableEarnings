Footnotes
IMA SURE BET unhurried early to trail on the backside, split rivals while steadily advancing into the far turn, angled three wide at the head of the lane and
closed well to be going away at the wire. TRAMA QUEEN stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, rallied to assume command at the head of the lane, opened
a clear advantage but could not hold off the closing winner while clearly second best. RUNNETH OVER reserved off the leaders down the backside,
commenced a long rally in the final bend and kept grinding through the lane to take the show. LADY CAIRO sped to the lead in the first turn, opened a wide
advantage to the three-eighths pole and weakened coming home. HEART OF THE BEAST broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field early, rallied down
the backside and flattened out in the far turn. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL was never a factor. CRYSTAL M showed brief speed to contend for a half mile and
came up empty.

Footnotes
M EIGHTY prompted the pace through the turn, engaged the leader in upper stretch and out-finished that one in a determined drive from two wide down the
lane. SIR MASON took the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear lead into the turn, responded well when challenged in upper stretch and finished
willingly while out-kicked in deep stretch. XERXES was squeezed between rivals leaving the gate to be at the rear, settled into stride down the backside and
mounted a late bid in the stretch. MR. BLUTARSKY tracked the pace from three wide and lacked a response when called upon. THIRTYEIGHT WISHES
bumped rival at the start when breaking outward, raced up to stalk the pace for a half mile and weakened in the lane. STILL WICKED bumped at the start
when breaking inward, quickly angled out early, dropped to the back of the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
KAY BEE GEE reserved off the early pace, swept up three wide to take command midway on the bend, opened a clear advantage and held sway. LUCKY
ROAD prompted the early pacesetter, was overtaken by the winner in the turn and kept on gamely down the lane to surge up late and just miss. HIGH
CUPPER unhurried in the early going to trail, saved ground cutting the corner coming home and was gaining late. ROSY APPLE raced along the rail in
striking distance in to the turn, steadied on the bend when the pacesetter angled in, lost all momentum, was taken around stopping rival and never regained
closing response and lost crop inside the final sixteenth. ISLAND WINTER broke flat-footed to be at the rear of the field early, raced wide down the
backstretch and was never a threat. DE PURA SANGRE showed speed to take the early lead while racing in the three path, angled in on the turn causing
rival to steady along the fence and weakened nearing the quarter pole to drop from contention.

Footnotes
CHLOES ANGEL tracked the leaders to the turn, circled four wide to engage the leaders midway on the bend, took the lead turning for home, dueled with
the runner-up the length of the stretch and prevailed at the line. SHEZA POP STAR stalked the pace into the turn, rallied splitting horse on the turn to
challenge for the lead at the head of the stretch, battled with the winner down the lane and was denied at the wire. COWCHI prominently placed early on,
settled back off the pace in the bend, cut the corner to loom in upper stretch and kept on willingly through the lane. CHECK OUT LINE reserved off the pace
to the quarter pole and rallied willingly through the stretch. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE was never a threat. KISSTHECROSS showed speed to set the pace and
was through after a half. PSYCHOANALYST broke awkwardly to be at the back of the field, raced five wide down the backside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SCARLETT'S AWISH set the pace from the fence while pressed on the lead, dueled through the lane, shook clear of pressers in deep stretch and just held
the closer safe at the wire in a game effort. BAREFOOT BEACH reserved off the pace into the turn, gained ground while saving ground along the rail in the
bend, angled five wide in upper stretch and closed well late to just miss. SUSHI Q pressed the pace from three wide through the turn, briefly took the lead in
the lane, lugged-in through the lane causing rival to steady in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. NORTHERN JOURNEY slow early to trail the field,
commenced a steady advance in the turn and finished willingly. THE LAST APPLE well placed while tracking the leaders through the turn and lacked a
closing response when called upon. BEEBLEGEE failed to menace. SWEET EMPIRE dueled from between rivals to the top of the stretch, weakened in the
drive and was taken up late in the stretch when impeded. CONGRATS JENSEN contended early on and faded in the turn. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW DISQUALIFIED SUSHI Q AND PLACED HER SEVENTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH RUN.

Footnotes
BEACH FRONT stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled in the lane, took command in
deep stretch while drifting in late to prevail. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR set the pace to upper stretch, responded when challenged down the lane and was
outkicked late in the drive. LUCKY JUNIOR reserved off the leaders for a half mile, angled six wide turning for home and finished with good late energy.
LOCK ON unhurried in the early going, rallied with an early bid to threaten in upper stretch and finished evenly. BOSS BEAR chased the pacesetters from
three wide through the turn and made a mild rally in spite of rider losing his crop in upper stretch. CALL WEST trailed to the quarter pole and passed
weakening rivals in the lane. TUFF ATTACK prompted the pace for a half mile and faded. GAMBLER was never a threat. BLUE SKY'S ABOVE tracked the
leaders from a striking position through the turn and flattened out in the stretch. THE RIDER OF EXPLOSIVE HUMOR CLAIMED FOUL FOR
INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER IN THE STRETCH, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

OFFICIALLY YOURS set the pace from two wide into the turn under pressure, lost the lead briefly from an inside challenge nearing the quarter pole,
re-rallied turning for home and drew off in the lane clearly the best. MISS SPRINGSTEEN bumped at the start, tracked the leaders from three wide in the
turn and rallied down the lane to gain the place. COMPUTE THIS stalked the pace to the turn, rallied up the fence to take the lead at the quarter pole and
weakened through the stretch. CURLIN PEARLS raced wide down the backstretch, angled in to the rail on the turn, rallied mildly up the fence to upper
stretch and finished evenly. PARLAY CHARLIE was never a threat. SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL bumped rival leaving the gate, raced prominently to press the
early pace and was through early.

Footnotes
CUGINE tracked the leaders from the rail down the backside, rallied angling out four wide at the head of the lane and closed well with a late surge to be up
in time. COME SEE ABOUT IT prompted the pace to the far turn, took command from two wide on the bend, held the lead through the stretch until the final
strides and was caught in the shadow of the wire. THRU THE VINE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, responded to the challenge but could not keep
pace late in the lane. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT reserved off the pace to the far turn and was set down to a long drive and gained ground in grinding fashion.
FRANCO trailed for the first half, mounted a rail rally through the final bend and flattened out coming home. GLOBAL EMPIRE contended early to be with
the pacesetters for a half mile and faded. MY BROTHER CAM was caught six wide in the first turn, dropped to the rear of the field down the backside and
was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIER ONE broke wide leaving the gate, was taken in hand to be rated off the pace down the backside, rallied into the final bend splitting rivals while gaining
on the leaders, tipped three wide to the clear in upper stretch and wore the leader down late in a determined drive. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE pressed the
pace for the first three-eighths, took the lead from two wide while under constant pressure, repelled the pressers in upper stretch, responded to the late
closer in deep stretch but could not hold on. JEBIP tracked the leaders down the backside, made an early three wide bid on the turn to challenge for the
lead at the quarter pole and flattened out down the lane. ANIMO ROBERTO slow early to trail to the far turn, rallied through the bend and finished evenly.
RED COMET pressed the pace to the far turn and weakened. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER went evenly failing to menace. SMOOCHER was never a threat.
LITTLE TOY GUNS stalked the pace and tired. DANES HEART dueled on the lead from the fence through the final bend and gave way in the lane.
