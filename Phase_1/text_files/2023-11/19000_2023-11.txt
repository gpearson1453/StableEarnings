Footnotes
RUNNINGFORJOY stalked along the inside under snug restraint around the first turn, pursued behind the leaders and from the three path around the far
turn, brushed an outer rival while tipping to the five path to take aim between horses in upper stretch, sustained a bid passing the furlong grounds, gained an
advantage while being corrected from leaning into an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and inched clear. HERO'S MEDAL stalked outside of the top pair,
pressed in the four path under urging around the far turn, took mild contact from an inner rival while being brushed to the six path in upper stretch, ran on to
attempt a bid as that one inched an advantage in the final furlong and was second best. SURFACE TO AIR prompted two wide, vied in the three path and
between horses around the far turn, gained an advantage turning for home, led narrowly in the four path in upper stretch, met a pair of outer challenges in
the final furlong and was bested with a sixteenth to go. WE WILL CONQUER set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one while inside of a
pair of rivals around the far turn, fought on through midstretch but yielded in the late stages. TEXAS PRIDE broke a step slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FIRE BRYAN laid off of the pace three wide, improved between horses passing the three furlong pole, gained to take aim inside of the drifting leaders
entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong and inched ahead. PLATINUM GHOST was a bit reluctant to load, showed the way two wide,
dueled with an inner rival while being floated to the three path around the turn, continued to be herded to the five path entering the lane, battled on his left
lead in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, dueled for place through the late stages and prevailed. TROPIC STORM
vied along the inside, dueled with an outer rival while drifting out subtly around the turn, but lugged to the four path entering the lane, sparred between
horses as an inner bidder challenged in upper stretch, got headed by that one at the furlong grounds, then was bested for place by his outer counterpart in
the late stages. REWIRE pressed outside of the top pair, required urging to sustain pressure in the four path around the turn, shifted to the six path to
remain outside of his drifting inner counterparts and gave way. PUNCTUALITY tracked two wide and between horses, put an inner rival to tight quarters at
the three furlong pole and failed to menace. INVASIVE got a bit antsy just before the off, chased along the inside, but steadied hard when put to tight
quarters by an outer rival at the three furlong pole, trailed in the aftermath and surpassed a tiring foe in the final furlong. P K WOOD broke a step slow,
raced forwardly four wide and outside of rivals, but faded in the five path around the turn.

BEST OF GREELEY tracked the top pair from the four path, ranged up under his own power to confidently bid in the six path entering the lane, kicked away
once let out a notch in midstretch and widened handily. IMPROBABLE STORY trailed along the inside, then ran on to improve position and edged place
from an outer rival late. STEINBECK vied inside of a rival while a path off of the rail around the turn, offered little resistance to an outer bidder while drifting
to the four path in upper stretch and lost place to an inner bidder late. HILLBILLY LOGIC vied with an inner rival while taking the turning the three path, then
yielded in the four path and between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TALKIN IN CURSIVE pressed three wide, bid turning for home and drew off under a drive. WRECK IT RUBY tracked behind the leaders and from the two
path, tipped to the four path entering the lane, ran on to bid for place along with an inner rival in the final sixteenth and prevailed. LADLE bumped an outer
rival at the start, prompted inside of the winner, yielded to the top two entering the lane, yet regained stride between horses in midstretch, bid for place along
with an outer rival in the final sixteenth and missed. PRIX contacted with an inner rival before exchanging a pair of bumps with an outer rival at the start, set
the pace two wide, but proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane, gave way and was surpassed by an outer pair in the late stages. COLLIER
brushed the gate before bumping with an inner rival while off a step slow at the start, saved ground well back, shifted outwardly in upper stretch and moved
up between horses. RUN RUN RABBIT leaned outwardly and broke a step slow, then failed to menace two wide. GRACE AND FREEDOM chased from
midpack in the five to six path and lacked a bid. SPITE LITE raced at the rear four wide and improved between horses. MISS CLAUDETTE bobbled slightly
and bumped with an inner rival multiple times as an outer rival brushed her hind quarters at the start, tracked two wide, chased in the three to four path
around the turn and faded. FLATTERING HEART broke slowly and was outrun in the three path and between horses. BROWN AS A BISCUIT raced
forwardly four wide through the early stages, but wilted in the five path approaching the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
KICK A RHYME (IRE) broke a step slow, quickly recovered to stalk two wide, took aim outside of the top pair entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, drew
clear at the furlong grounds and held sway. MO LANTERN settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out four wide and between horses entering the lane
and rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth. MY LILY MAE laid off of the pace three wide, floated five wide into upper stretch, then rallied willingly while
chasing an inner foe's gain and edged show late. GOING THE DISTANCE vied along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and
weakened through the final sixteenth. CLASSIC CLAIRE stalked along the inside, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch, but only offered a mild chase
and was outkicked for minor rewards by an outer pair in the final furlong. THEROANRUNNER pursued from midpack two wide, tipped to the three path
entering the lane but lacked a rally between horses. LIPOCHROME leaned in and was steadied via a strong right handed rein to avoid from hitting the inner
railing at the start, saved ground well back but to no avail. SOUL HEIR pursued from midpack along the inside, then faded while shifting off the rail turning
for home. VIOLET FLAME broke slowly and was outrun two wide. DREAM ON STORMY vied two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BARNSTORMING pressed two wide, bid at the three furlong pole sparking a duel, forged a narrow advantage nearing the lane, fought neck-and-neck with
his inner counterpart as the long battle persisted well into deep stretch and inched ahead in the closing stages. PINELAND set the pace along the inside,
dueled with an outer bidder around the turn, was narrowly headed nearing the lane, yet fought on tenaciously and sustained the battle into deep stretch but
was bested in the final sixteenth. VIGANO laid off of the pace in the three to four path into the turn, improved position to reach show at the three sixteenths
pole, but failed to threaten the top pair. BEAUMONT RED pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, attempted a mild show bid inside of that
new place-holder in upper stretch, but was turned away and failed to factor. SPEED INSTITUTE stalked outside of the top pair, chased them while failing to
keep pace around the turn, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. ENOUGH ALREADY broke slowly, tracked along the inside and faded around
the turn. CHADRON trailed in the three to five path and got outrun.

PILLBOX pursued from the inside early on, shifted outwardly and steadily gained ground in the four to five path around the turn, sustained progress to bid
while fanning to the seven path entering the lane, took over in upper stretch and shifted ground inwardly while drawing away. FILLY CRYSTAL was off
awkwardly before keenly tossing her head at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the turn, shifted inwardly
and across a pair of rivals' paths at the three sixteenths pole to offer a rail bid for place nearing midstretch, edged that position in the final furlong and held.
SUMMER OF MISCHIEF bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied three wide, but was headed by an outer bidder while entering the lane in the four path,
chased between rivals while vying for minor rewards in the final furlong, but was denied place. IN COLOR was bumped by rivals on both sides while put to
crowded quarters at the start, stalked along the inside while close up, pursued from the two path around the turn, tipped out to take aim in the five path and
between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the process and chased while one paced through the final furlong. MEAN SUE
was briefly fractious in the starting gate, tracked four wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival while floated to the six path and between horses entering the
lane and lacked a rally. ROYAL BLOOD lacked speed along the inside into the turn, improved around the bend, shifted two wide and between horses
entering the lane, but encountered traffic before being shut off by her outer counterpart in upper stretch and lacked a bid. BELPERRON bumped with an
outer rival at the start, sparred two wide and between horses, got headed by an outer bidder while entering the lane in the three path and faded between
horses in midstretch. MAZOKU made little impact from the fie path. WEATHER MAP vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, gave way turning for home,
steadied slightly when an outer rival shifted into his path in upper stretch and weakened. JACKIE'S SPIRIT chased three wide and between horses early on
but steadily faded. MOTOWN MIKA was outrun in the six path. ARGUMENTAL was pulled up down the backstretch and got vanned off.

Footnotes
WATCH THIS BIRDIE settled well back three wide, gained ground in the three to four path around the far turn to offer a bid for the lead entering the lane,
forged an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. STRIKINGLY SPUN tracked the run-away leaders two wide, closed in on them around the far turn,
bid in the three path along with an outer rival entering the lane, but was outkicked shortly after, failed to keep pace in the final furlong, met an outer
challenge for place nearing the wire but lasted. NOM DE PLUME tracked along the inside, closed in on the tiring leading pair around the far turn, but was
outmoved by an outer bidder while tipping two wide entering the lane, shifted further out in upper stretch, ran on in the final furlong to bid for place nearing
the wire but missed. MO BILLS prompted two wide through a quick early pace, vied into the far turn, led turning for home, but was headed by a pair of outer
bidders entering the lane and tired. BOLIVIE (IRE) trailed along the inside, then in the two to three path around the far turn and made little impact.
ESSAOUIRA set a fast early pace inside of a stern presser as they separated themselves from the rest of the group around the first turn, got headed while
coming back to the field around the far turn and weakened inside of a trio of rivals nearing the lane.

SECRET STATEMENT stalked outside of the leader into the turn, bid turning for home, led in the four path entering the lane, drove clear soon after and held
sway. AMBER CASCADE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, was roused to the five path entering the lane to take aim on
the new leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase that one home to prove second best. CALL AGAIN pursued the main group three wide into the
turn, inched closer four wide turning for home before being floated to the seven path entering the lane and ran on willingly. SULTRY LASS bumped an outer
rival at the start, tracked four to three wide, but got floated to the six path while chasing between horses entering the lane, then lasted for fourth. HER
LADYSHIP was bumped and squeezed between horses at the start, trailed early on, gained in the five to four path around the turn before shifting back to
the seven path in upper stretch, but leveled off and missed reaching fourth. SHOPLIFTER bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside,
met an outer challenge turning for home, got headed entering the lane in the two path and weakened. VOTARY bumped an inner rival at the start, then

Footnotes
I'M YOUR MAN was slow early on, lagged behind into the turn, picked up stride inside of rivals turning for home, swung seven wide in upper stretch and
rallied outside of foes to drive past the leader in the final sixteenth. WALDRIP bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked outside of the top trio around
the turn, closed in five wide in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, changed to his correct lead soon
after but was bested by an outer bidder late. QUEBRANCHO bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased six wide, grinded away outside of the leaders in
upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds and ran on to edge show. PRETTY FAST set the pace two wide, vied with rivals on
both sides around the turn, led in the three path entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded. HONEST
OPINION was urged along off of the pace in the three path into the turn, shifted to the two path turning for home, took aim between horses in hopes of
splitting rivals in midstretch, but lacked a bid. QUIET RUSH vied three wide, but gave way four wide and between horses in upper stretch. QUENCIO
prompted along the inside, vied with a pair of outer rivals around the turn but weakened in midstretch. PERFORMANCE PLUS lacked speed in the four to
three path around the turn and failed to factor. MASTER SWITCH chased in the two path and faded. THIS TIME BLUE broke outwardly, lacked speed in the
seven to four path into the turn and made little impact. THEZELENSKYYFACTOR raced forwardly five wide but weakened between horses at the three
furlong pole.
