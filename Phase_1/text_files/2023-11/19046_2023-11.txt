Footnotes
SKIPPA unhurried in the beginning, entered the home stretch four wide, rallied down the lane and drove clear. DIAL UNCLE JOEY raced within striking
distance, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was best of others. ROBUST dueled on the front end, raced close
throughout and proved no match for the top two down the stretch. MARKETBOOK raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and finished
evenly. FLASH FREDDIE raced in the middle of the field, entered the stretch wide and put forth an even effort. ROLL ON OUT lacked early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. THA ILLEST DEAL vied for the early lead and made a steady retreat. JESUIT void of early speed and was never close.
COTTONCLUB SOLDIER raced in the middle of the pack, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
VETERANS DAY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN went to the
front, drove clear around the final turn, dueled deep in the stretch, was outfinished by VETERANS DAY for the win, but held on for second. DREWMAZING
had a tight start, getting bumped, raced within contention, dueled late, racing between rivals, was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. RISKY
PRIORITY broke in, raced near the middle of the pack, made a mild bid, but was no factor. HOOSIER lacked early speed, improved position, but was no
factor. SALUTE NOW vied for the early lead and faded. MY LIL DUDE raced evenly near the back and showed little. THEO D'OR raced in the middle of the
field and dropped back. WOOD RIVER broke out, bumped, trailed the field and showed nothing.

PRADO'S PRIORITY went to the front, drove clear around the turn and was kept to the task. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD brushed at the start, racing within
contention, came in around the turn, made a rail bid and got up for second. RITHM NIC pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and was
outfinished for second. BETTABE BOURBON vied for the early advantage, checked around the turn, getting in tight quarters and finished evenly. COPTER
raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. OCEAN OF STORMS lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. ALLEVA raced evenly
near the back and was never a threat. TAPIT'S SPIRIT brushed at the start, racing in the back, came around the turn wide and was never close. MISTER K
brushed at the start, raced in the rear and showed little. STURGILL always raced in the back and trailed throughout. THE JOCKEY OF #1 BETTABE

of early speed and passed tired ones. LEGENDARY GIFT raced near the back, came around the first turn six wide, moved up, before fading. MISS BILLIE
