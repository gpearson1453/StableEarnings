Footnotes
WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY stalked in mid-pack down the backstretch, waited patiently watching the trio contest the pace midway through the turn, swung out
to the four path gaining momentum at the top of the lane and wore down the leaders through the stretch to draw off nearing the wire. WILDFIRE travelled in
midfield between foes along the backside, took closer order shadowing the leaders three wide through the turn, bid for the lead two wide outside at the
quarter pole, determinedly fought on through the lane not switching leads and gave way to the winner late who had an ideal tracking trip. ANOTHER PINKY
pressed the pace on the rail in the beginning, had a narrow advantage inside at the half, set the pace while hounded outside by two rivals around the turn,
was collared at the quarter pole and ran on gamely to the finish line, just faded late at the sixteenth pole to be a clear third. TACHYON SPEED stalked near
the rear having one runner beaten down the backside, saved ground making little impact throughout the turn and mildly ran to the wire winning the battle for
a minor role. MAGIC MODIE bobbled soon after the start trailing down the backside, caught up to rivals splitting horses two wide with five sixteenths from
home. angled outside in the four path for the drive to the wire and finished with intent battling for the minor share in the end. SPEEDY ROSE assumed the
lead after the start, hounded the frontrunner outside at the half, was in the mix between rivals up front in midturn, could not match strides with the leading
pair in upper stretch and faltered on the fence the final sixteenth. DADDY'S DAISY settled on the the outside three deep in mid-pack down the backside,
could not quicken running outside of other horses around the bend and came up empty in the stretch drive.

MUSICAL STRIDE settled off the pace inside saving ground through the turn, bid along the rail near the furlong grounds, dueled, dug in and edged away.
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES tracked from inside just off the rail, shifted out four deep turning for home, bid in mid-stretch taking a narrow brief lead but was
outfinished. MR NARCISSISTIC stalked from outside three deep into the turn, moved out five wide turning for home, kept on but needed more. VENTI broke
just a half-step slowly, raced inside a foe at the back but off the fence, moved out from three to five wide on the turn coming to the top of the stretch six wide
and having made up ground, ran on. MR. MARSHALL quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, weakened in the stretch. I'M A BOURBON GIRL
chased from between runners two to three wide, failed to rally. HEAT MERCHANT was ridden along from the start racing outside foes three to four deep,
came out further in upper stretch, was not a threat. STAR SCHOLAR broke a half-step slowly, was outside at the rear mostly four to six wide, was never
near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
GREYSTONE stalked four wide when floated on the first turn, was allowed to settle co-trailing on the inside down the backstretch, had no room to go behind
a wall of runners at the three furlong marker, patiently waited for a seam on the far turn, rallied up a clear rail in upper stretch and burst between horses just
inside the furlong marker for the lead and was kept to the task to the wire holding rivals at bay in the end. PATROLMAN travelled in midfield on the fence in
the early stages, tracked three wide with runners on either side at the half, loomed in the five path straightening out for the drive and tried valiantly to the
wire but was just second best on this day. SO CALLED VACATION tracked the engaged duo on the rail through the first turn, nestled smartly on the inside
just behind the leader down the backstretch, was coaxed taking closer order on the fence through the far turn, angled outside to be in the hunt four wide
turning for home and showed a game effort through the stretch but was outfinished nearing the wire. ROCK BULLET stalked outside in the early going,
settled in midfield four deep outside horses at the half, bid outside the pacesetter at the quarter pole, was clinging to lead at the furlong marker and could
not find more late to fend off the closers in deep stretch. INDIANA ROAD bobbed heads for the lead outside on the first turn, shook loose to set the pace
alone down the back straight, was headed outside at the quarter pole and faded on the fence in the final sixteenth. HYGGE co-led on the rail in the first turn,
was reined back to track the loose frontrunner down the backside, was roused two wide between runners at the three eighths pole, made little headway
around the final bend and could not get involved through the stretch. PHANTOM JEWEL was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed four wide outside foes at the
half, was scrubbed on four wide through the far turn making little impression and had nothing to give in the stretch to be a factor at the wire. CELENTANO
tracked the front duo on the first turn, pulled the rider improving steadily down the backstretch, was nudged midway on the far turn, could not find more to go
on with the front pair and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COHERENCE settled off the pace, swung five wide, quickened and gained steadily while on the wrong lead, continued to gain and got up late. HAPPY
QUAD got away well, stalked the pace, bid outside at the top of the stretch, took the lead, was clear in mid-stretch but outfinished. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS
was urged to the lead soon after the start, set the pace inside, kept on after being overtaken. CADFAEL pursued from near the rail, came out a bit in late
stretch, ran on evenly. MODEL S lacked early speed, was not a threat but showed mild late interest. SUGARTAP chased from outside a foe mid-pack, came
out five wide in mid-stretch, failed to menace. DADDY SEND MONEY tossed the head at the start, was in a bit tight just after, fell near the three-eighths
losing the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FIFTY B M G took command from the onset, dictated the pace uncontested around the bend, had rivals closing in on each side by mid-stretch, stubbornly
dug in and held off the inside challenger to the finish line. LAKEFIELD travelled in mid-pack on the rail in the second flight, edged closer on the fence
throughout the turn, pounced inside straightening out for home and determinedly was gaining late but just missed reeling in the winner at the wire. FRAC
RIGHT tracked the front pair early on, made a sharp move three wide in midturn, loomed boldly in the four path outside rivals at the top of the lane but
stalled in the last furlong to be a clear third crossing the line. MONDAY MORNING stalked near the rear on the fence in the early going, began to pick up
horses at the three eighths marker, saved all the ground through the turn and willingly finished up to settle on the fringes in the end. CALLYOUBACKINFIVE
trailed three deep at the half mile pole, was asked three wide with three furlongs to go putting in a mild run, angled outside in the four path driving the finish
and showed some late interest batting for the minors down the stretch. FOREST FLASH prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, chased in vain
throughout the turn, could not go on with others making a move at the quarter pole and yielded in the final furlong. RY PIE hopped slightly at the break,
stalked with horses on each side at the half, was hard ridden through the turn but could not keep up with others and was not involved driving to the finish
line.

Footnotes
GRAND JOURNEY quickly moved clear to set the pace while shadowed by an outside foe and well in front of the remainder of the field, shook clear of the
nearest pursuer leaving the backstretch, held in the stretch under steady handling. BE LIKE CLINT settled well back of the leading pair in the early going
racing inside, advanced willingly on the far turn coming to the quarter pole three wide and nearly within range, floated out four to five wide for the drive now
under stout urging, surged late but missed. CUPID'S CLAWS settled off the pace, saved ground and improved inside in the stretch. SPRING MOUNTAIN
pressed the eventual winner from outside, was given some encouragement past the seven-sixteenths losing ground on the leader, had no extra for the
drive. CANADIAN PHAROAH raced off the pace mostly three wide through both turns, was ridden by the seven-sixteenths, shifted five wide for the drive,
ran on. SUNRISE DRIVE broke inwardly a bit, was caught four wide outside foes into the first turn, shifted in up the backstretch, went two to three deep on
the far turn, failed to menace. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was forced in a bit at the start, settled at the back off the inside, was not a threat. SIR SAHIB was in a
bit tight at the start, shifted in, saved ground, was not a threat. GRACEFUL FIGHTER raced mostly three to four wide mid-division, tired.

Footnotes
MOON LANDING was tucked in on the rail behind the dueling pair down the backstretch, slowly shifted outside getting ready to move at the quarter pole,
pounced four wide in mid-stretch and was comfortably going away when crossing the finish line. POSTURING tracked with runners on either side in the
second flight down the backstretch, kept pace throughout the turn while being urged by the rider, angled outside off the tiring early leaders four wide at the
furlong marker and rallied in deep stretch for the place share. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI stalked in the third flight on the inside at the half, was checked briefly
inside around the three eighths marker, started to offer a run swinging out five wide at the top of the stretch and was closing in late for second money but
just missed getting there in time. HUNGRY WOLF was off a touch slow in the beginning, trailed down the backside, saved ground seeing the field on the
turn, started to rally on the fence turning for home and surged late inside to settle on the fringes in the end. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was away alertly to lead in
the beginning, pressed the issue outside the pacesetter down the back straight, shadowed the frontrunner around the oval, continued to battle up top in the
three path straightening out for home between runners and gave way in the final sixteenth. SILENT MIRACLE was hustled on the fence to seize command
entering the backstretch, maintained a slim advantage inside on the turn, fought on up front at the top of the lane, could not find another gear late and tired
in deep stretch. UNCAPTURED MOMENT stalked in mid-pack outside horses in the beginning, made little progress near the back of the pack through the
turn, swung outside to be in the five path for the drive but lacked a rally down the stretch. PALACE VIEW (IRE) had a good position on the outside three
wide tracking the engaged front pair down the backside, came under a vigorous ride three wide at the three furlong marker, could not match strides with
others around the turn and wilted between foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP tracked from inside, was in just a bit tight about the three-eighths, moved out three wide turning into upper stretch, took the lead past the
three-sixteenths, met the bid of a challenger a sixteenth out and dug in to hold that foe. RELOAD'S RASCAL steadied just after the break when in tight
between foes, put under a tight hold early while shifting in, moved up inside tracking mid-pack fighting restraint in behind and inside, steadied about the
five-sixteenths and was again kept under a tight hold till past the quarter pole, was guided out four to five wide at the top of the stretch for room, accelerated
once clear, bid at the sixteenth pole but couldn't get past. FRANK'S ART settled inside, moved out a bit late on the turn seeking room, bided time briefly at
the top of the stretch, found room four deep soon after and kicked on well but too late. MAAKWA bumped a rival at the start, sped clear to set the pace near
the rail, weakened. HALLIE'S HERO was off the leaders moving out from four to six wide turning into upper stretch, drifted in a bit and evened out. HAI
BOBBI was lightly bumped at the start, raced last but one while outpaced early, saved ground, passed tired rivals inside. FOUR ACES HIGH was
forwardly-placed chasing the leader from outside the eventual winner, went three wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch. GALVASTON moved out
from three to five wide on the turn in range at the top of the stretch but faltered and faded. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE lacked early speed, was outpaced.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL had one horse beaten down the back straight, crept closer running on the rail with three furlongs remaining, rallied up the fence
straightening out for home, took control inside at the sixteenth pole and was pulling away at the wire. MY SUNNY VALENTINE was content to track the
pacesetter on the outside down the backstretch, was nudged vying for the lead between foes at the quarter pole, poked her head in front briefly in upper
stretch but was no match for the winner late and just saved the place share in a three way photo crossing the line. DEVIL'S BIT was void of speed trailing
down the backside, began to lengthen her stride midway on the turn, looked for a path behind rivals at the quarter pole, was aching for room inside at the
top of the stretch, finally angled out to the five path at the eighth pole getting clear run and was full of run late closing in quickly in deep stretch. VERDEJO
was tucked in on the rail just a little behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited for her cue on the fence around the turn, looked for a seam while in the
mix three wide behind the leaders at the top of the stretch and finished with intent gaining on the winner late to be involved in the middle in a three horse
photo for the place award at the wire. LUZ DE LA LUNA was under a snug hold three wide on the outside watching the front duo, inched closer to the lead
three wide through the turn, loomed in the four path straightening out for home, could not find more late and flattened out in the final eighth. TAQUANYAH
travelled between rivals in midfield down the backside, was urged with runners on each side making little gain at the three furlong marker, angled out five
wide for a stretch rally, was steadied at the furlong marker losing her path and could not regroup in time to pose a threat. HELLO FRIENDS stalked near the
rear on the outside, closed the gap on the leaders three wide outside horses around the oval, was in range widest on the outside of rivals in the six path
turning foe home but levelled off in the final furlong. BIZYMALINE was alone on the lead down the backstretch, continued setting the fractions up front
around the bend and was overwhelmed by runners on both sides in mid-stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 TAQUANYAH AGAINST #5 DEVILS BIT AT
THE FURLONG POLE RESULTED IN #5 DEVILS BIT BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED 6TH FOR INTERFERENCE

Footnotes
VALYRIAN SKY showed good early speed to clear from the outside to have the lead on the rail by the half mile marker, opened up at will through the turn
and cruised home for the convincing score. NIGHT STRIKER improved position down the backstretch on the fence, continued on gaining on the fence on
horses throughout the turn, chased the long gone winner in vain down the stretch and just held on saving the place share at the wire. SUGAR IT'S ELI was
situated in midfield two wide between foes at the half, began to pick up horses three wide at the quarter pole and closed belatedly down the lane just
missing second place in a tight photo at the wire. ASHUKA travelled in the third flight down the backstretch, was roused on the rail through the turn, edged
closer to the chasing pack at the quarter pole, was in the mix for the runners up share in upper stretch, was one paced late and settled for a minor role in the
end. NOTACHANCEBRO settled in mid-pack on the rail down the backstretch, offered a mild rally passing runners inside around the bend, continued gain
on rivals through the stretch, lacked room at the sixteenth pole and evened out in deep stretch. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE settled three wide outside foes in
midfield at the half, kept pace with runners three wide outside horse on the turn and finished up willingly to the wire passing runners. GLORIOUS REVENGE
was brushed inside at the break, chased the winner down the backside and through the turn, dueled between foes in the four path for the minors in upper
stretch and tired with a furlong left to run. BLONDINA'S BOY had a poor start to trail down the backside, could still see the field running around the bend and
showed good late energy passing some weary runners down the stretch. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN broke out at the start, tracked the front two at the half,
closed in to battle four wide at the top of the lane for the runners up share, could not go on and yielded in the five path in mid-stretch. WETIKO had one
runner beaten in the early going, made a brief rally three wide at the three furlong marker outside rivals and could not get involved running on the wrong
lead through the stretch. QURBAAN'S KINGDOM was shuffled back soon after the start to stalk near the rear down the backside, made little impression
running around the oval and was no menace in the stretch drive. DRILLHALL veered in sharply at the start, stalked near the rear down the backside, offered
little run throughout the turn and emptied out turning for home.
