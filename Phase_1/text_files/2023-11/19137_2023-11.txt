Footnotes
ST JAMES THE GREAT stalked the pace between horses down the backstretch and into the far turn, advanced in the three path leaving the turn, secured
command in upper stretch, was put to a drive and readily drew off. MODICA , rated outside horses down the backstretch, rushed up five deep around the far
turn, bumped with DRILLING FOR GOLD to reach a striking position, flattened out and lugged in near the eighth pole. MORTAL SIN lacked speed, raced
near the inner rail to the stretch, moved to the two path for the drive, raced between horses and passed tired ones. AMEN MCLAREN , forced out
approaching the first turn, angled in entering the turn, was patiently handled to the stretch, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. SASSE'S
CLASS stalked the pace while saving ground, was eased off the rail for the drive and weakened between horses. IZZY D'ORO sprinted to the early lead, set
the pace along the rail and tired in upper stretch. CITY LEADER , eager to run approaching the first turn, chased the pace outside horses and was steadied
in close quarters leaving the far turn. SHADOW MAN , outrun, was very wide turning for home. DRILLING FOR GOLD stalked the pace down the
backstretch, was four wide on the far and steadied when bumping with MODICA approaching the stretch. DATS MY PHARAOH , two wide chasing the pace
to the stretch, gave way. IN THE AIR was no factor. BURROUGHS CAY retreated.

Footnotes
HITTHEROADJAK , away in good order, vied in hand outside a rival through the backstretch run, moved clear leaving the far turn and shifted closer to the
rail, turned away challenges after being roused past the five sixteenths, opened up under a drive and on her left lead in mid stretch, remained on her left
lead while under pressure and held firm. CHICA CHUCK , fought restraint when edging up outside rivals early on, settled better past the five eighths then
advanced four wide in hand around the turn, ranged up to threaten the winner approaching the stretch, saw that one kick away soon after, dug back in
through the final furlong and gamely bridged the gap. SURFBOARD broke inward then steadied when in tight soon after, lagged back, circled four wide into
the lane and offered a mild run. WILD ALEX , off the pace, raced between rivals mid turn, came four wide for the drive, shifted in soon after but lacked a
serious run. DANCING MISCHIEF tracked the leaders three wide, was put to a hustling ride mid turn, challenged between foes nearing the lane, could not
match strides past the quarter pole, dropped in and gave way. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE disputed the pace to the inside of the winner through the opening
half mile, failed to keep up under asking past the three eighths and weakened. PRINCE FRED edged up between rivals early and chased the pace, lacked a
punch mid turn and tired. VICTORIA'S DEVINE , used early inside rivals, stayed on to about the five eighths and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROWSIE EXPRESS stalked three wide, was put to a strong ride mid turn, shifted out about five wide past the three sixteenths, sustained under grinding run
outside rivals, took command past the sixteenth marker and edged clear. DEEDS OF LOVE settled in mid pack and off the inside, advanced two wide
between rivals approaching the stretch, was guided out to the four path soon after, closed in under a drive to draw on near even terms between runners a
sixteenth out, kept on gamely and saved the place. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA broke a bit slow, lagged off the early pace while saving ground and under
coaxing, continued inside while gathering some steam into the lane, came out for room in mid stretch, worked between runners late and kept on with good
energy. WHATSYOURBIGIDEA broke a tad slow, was taken wide early and urged along, lost ground three to four wide mid turn, drifted in briefly near mid
stretch, was corrected and angled out then churned on. GAMESTONKS , off the pace, lost ground four to five wide, was under pressure mid turn then
offered a belated response. BONDIVA grabbed command to the inside of a rival heading to the five eighths, set a rated pace while being shadowed, shook
clear when asked entering the lane, came off the inside, could not resist threats leaving the sixteenth pole and weakened late. BAD TEMPER saved ground
under rating, was pushed along past the five sixteenths, edged up slightly near the three sixteenths but failed to sustain. NINETEENAMENDMENT
prompted the pace outside BONDIVA, stayed on to mid stretch then faded.

Footnotes
INCHON stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, gained command approaching the eighth pole then drew away.
STARLIFTER bore in leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace, waited in hand entering the far turn and rallied between rivals. GOODBYE NOTE hopped
at break, circled horses and was four deep entering the stretch, switched to his left lead inside the sixteenth pole and flattened out. EDDIE FELSON , wide
the first turn, worked between rivals the far turn, swung very wide in upper stretch and rallied gamely. NEIL TO THE KING bore out leaving the starting gate,
chased the early pace, gained the lead outside LOST POST mid way down the backstretch and gave way the final furlong. FOURONEOHSMOKESHOW ,
pinched back leaving the starting gate, was no factor and swung five wide leaving the far turn. MONEY IN MOTION saved ground on the turns, remained
along the rail in the stretch and failed to rally. GRAND KINGDOM lacked speed and showed some late interest. NOBLE WAVE , angled in approaching the
first turn, was outrun. CHEVY MAN , wide both turns, weakened. LAST POST showed speed along the inner rail, was done after six furlongs and faltered.
CESNOLA broke in the air and trailed.

CAP CLASSIQUE drafted back off the early pace while saving ground, edged up along the rail then was patiently handled past the five sixteenths, took
advantage of an inside path soon into the stretch, closed in under right handed encouragement, took command to the inside of DEBOISBLANC with about a
sixteenth remaining then kicked clear heading to the wire. DEBOISBLANC bobbled at the break, recovered and went up to attend the pace outside MISS
HARRIETT, was confidently handled around the turn, responded when given her cue and took over leaving the three sixteenths, edged away a bit past mid
stretch, could not resist the winner's charge but kept on valiantly to remain clear of the rest. MISS JUSTIFY stalked outside rivals, took closer order under a
ride past the five sixteenths, shifted out a path and gave hard chase leaving the furlong grounds, continued willingly and held down the show. CARESS ,
brushed at the break, was tucked up inside just off the leaders, eased out into the lane, failed to seriously quicken past the three sixteenths but continued on
with effort. MISS HARRIETT sped to the early advantage, set the pace towards the rail while being hounded by DEBOISBLANC, came off the inside battling
into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then weakened late. ROANAN GODDESS stumbled at the break and was away last, regrouped and was taken well

Footnotes
HYBRID ECLIPSE lagged well back for a half mile while saving ground, came under a solid ride leaving the far turn, slipped through along the rail to gain
into the stretch, came out for a clear run past the three sixteenths, leveled off under right handed asks, surged past OPUS FORTY TWO heading to the
sixteenth marker, eagerly widened and was taken in hand for the final yards. OPUS FORTY TWO , four wide to contention, was carried out to about the
eight path soon into the backstretch, tapered in and pulled her way outside rivals to take command past the five eighths, moved towards the rail when clear
around the far turn, came under a ride near the quarter pole, kept on under pressure past mid stretch, could not fend off the winner but continued with effort
to the line. SWEET WILLEMINA , off the pace and between rivals into the far turn, angled out leaving the five sixteenths, circled five wide into the stretch
and kept on with interest to nab the show. MALIBU BEAUTY , away alertly and tracked off the rail around the first turn, was floated out seven wide by
HASHTAG LUCKY entering the backstretch, dropped in some while between rivals then had to steady out of a tight spot past the five eighths, came back on
to chase the leader near the five sixteenths, continued willing pursuit past mid stretch then faded. CHAMPAGNE TOAST , off last after breaking inward,
recovered and raced three deep off the pace, came four wide into the lane, moved up between rivals near mid stretch, angled in but lacked a serious finish.
HASHTAG LUCKY had speed to lead early, wandered out to about the six path floating out rivals into the backstretch, was guided back towards the inside
and prompted past the half, failed to kick on nearing the lane and weakened. I'M GITTIN THERE , well placed early, dropped back leaving the far turn,
shifted in and failed to make real headway in the drive. MILAGROSA SURENA (ARG) moved up to the inside of a drifting rival and poked a head in front
after a quarter mile, remained a forward presence to the far turn, was under pressure chasing three wide past the five sixteenths then tired.
