Footnotes
JOHNNY PAYCHECK steadied after the break when bumped and impeded by PLENTY COUPS, shifted out to the four path when clear, moved up three
wide to challenge for the lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, was outside of a three horse battle turning into the stretch, kept to task and got the upper
hand in the final yards. JAIME'S COMMITMENT came away well from the gate but was outrun to the turn by PLENTY COUPS, moved up to challenge that
one passing the seven-sixteenths pole then raced between horses to the turn, battled gamely down the stretch but was unable to match strides with the
winner in the late stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was bothered at the break from the action to the immediate outside, made some forward progress racing
up the rail to the turn then tried to go through a hole near the three furlong pole that closed, had to take up sharply, lost momentum then re-rallied down the
stretch under steady handling to gain third. PLENTY COUPS ducked in after the break and took the path of JOHNNY PAYCHECK, forcing that one to have
to take up, sped to a clear early lead, was challenged, then overtaken by a pair to the outside, then battled back to regain the lead at the top of the stretch
but gave way passing the furlong marker. SKY EDDIE was off slowly, chased three wide to the stretch then tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ITS THIEVERY assumed command away from the start, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run while well handled, showed the way into the far
turn and was pressed to the quarter pole by DUPLICATION, was set down in upper stretch and held foes at bay to the furlong marker, was confronted by
DUPLICATION inside of the furlong marker, battled with that rival into the final sixteenth, drifted out under firm urging in deep stretch and made contact
twice with DUPLICATION, dug in in the final strides and gamely lasted for the win at the wire. DUPLICATION was forwardly placed in the early stages and
stalked the pace into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and attended to the moderate pace while two wide approaching the half-mile marker,
pressed ITS THIEVERY to the quarter marker and ran in pursuit of that rival into the stretch, closed on ITS THIEVERY inside of the furlong marker, battled
with that rival into deep stretch, was bumped twice by ITS THIEVERY inside of the sixteenth-marker and was denied for the win on the wire, while holding
safely for second. PORT O' CALL was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground while not far back
through the backstretch run, chased heading to the quarter marker, angled three wide into the stretch, rallied outside of the leading pair in the final furlong,
could not reel in the top two in deep stretch and was clear at the finish for third. FANTASTIC DREAM stalked the early pace from the inside, saved ground
while well positioned through the backstretch run, chased two wide to the quarter marker, was asked for run three wide into the stretch and lacked a late
rally. SHERM never far back in the early going, tracked outside of runners into the backstretch run, maintained a three wide path heading into the far turn,
chased to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and gave way. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP
STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ITS THIEVERY DRIFTED OUT IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, MADE CONTACT
TWICE WITH DUPLICATION AND COST DUPLICATION THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. ITS THIEVERY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED SECOND. THERE WAS ALSO AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DUPLICATION AGAINST THE RIDER OF ITS
THIEVERY FOR THE SAME INCIDENT.

Footnotes
DICK BEST broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and set a decent pace into the backstretch run, was
confronted by CHIEF JACKSON and contested the pace with that rival to the half-mile pole, dueled into the far turn, shook free into upper stretch and was
set down approaching the furlong marker, drifted out a bit inside of the furlong marker and lost the lead to IMPLICITLY approaching the sixteenth-pole,
battled with that foe into the final stages, gamely came again and was up in the final strides to prevail. IMPLICITLY tracked the decent early pace from the
inside, was well placed through the backstretch run while saving ground, chased from the rail heading to the quarter marker, responded to urging and
mounted an inside rally in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker and took a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, was all out while battling
DICK BEST into deep stretch, was bested in the final strides by the winner and held clearly at the finish for second. CHIEF JACKSON was prominent

MOB BOSS broke alertly, was sent to establish the early lead and set a fast pace into the turn, drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter marker while in
hand, was kept to task to mid-stretch, extended the lead into the final sixteenth and held clearly for the win at the finish. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS settled off
of the fast early pace and tracked from the inside, advanced while along the rail heading to the quarter marker, angled to the three path into upper stretch,
continued to improve position at the furlong grounds, was not able to impact the winner in the late stages but was gaining in deep stretch and ran on to be
second best. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW chased the fast pace while outside of an inner rival, raced two wide into the stretch, offered a mild bid at the furlong
marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. SKY DINSKI lacked early speed, raced three to four wide along the turn and
did not threaten in the stretch. EL BERRINCHES was asked for early speed and raced close up to the fast early pace, lost position into the turn and chased

Footnotes
WAR AT SEA settled just off of the early pace, raced two then three wide through the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile
marker, chased the leaders two wide to the quarter pole, was steered to the four path into upper stretch then shifted six wide approaching the furlong
marker, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, closed fast in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to nail SILENT POET for the win.
SILENT POET broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, cleared to the rail into the first turn and set a pressured pace into the backstretch
run, was well rated while carving out moderate fractions approaching the half-mile pole, continued to be pressured by I'MGONNABESOMEBODY into the
far turn, shook free into the stretch and was set down at the furlong pole, dug in and held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, was all out in the final strides
and was nailed on the wire for the win, while besting the rest. TRIPOLI was away in good order, took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the
first turn, was well placed while along the rail through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground while chasing along the far turn, re-rallied into the stretch and
vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. LAMMAS (GB) was
unhurried in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run and made a mild advance at the half-mile pole, was steered outside of runners and
loomed four wide approaching the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, battled to the furlong grounds, could not find the needed response in
deep stretch and was outfinished. IL BELLATOR tracked the early pace from the outside, maintained that outside path into the backstretch run and was well
placed heading to the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid along the far turn, swung to the four path into upper stretch and lost position approaching
the furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and weakened. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was hustled leaving the start and was prominent into
the first turn, prompted the moderate pace into the backstretch run and kept close attendance to SILENT POET heading to the half-mile marker, came under
pressure while two wide and between runners at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a late response
and gave way. SUPERMAZEL was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run while not far back, came in a bit tight at the
half-mile marker and was shuffled back heading into the far turn, lost contact approaching the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SON OF SHANGHAI broke outward at the break, causing a chain reaction of bumps involving UPRIGHT and HOLY SMOKES, quickly recovered and
showed good speed, angled towards the rail going into the clubhouse turn but right in front of LAURA'S KIDOUGH forcing that one to take action to avoid
clipping heels, pulled the rider quickly to the lead before the six furlong pole, then repelled an early bid from EXCESS ENGLISH with the rider trying to
temper the pace, pulled clear when asked to go on near the quarter pole, responded to strong handling down the stretch, drifted out a bit late but held.
O'BANION (IRE) sent hard from the break, was successful in gaining the rail and the lead early, backed off the pace when SON OF SHANGHAI and
EXCESS ENGLISH quickened in front, saved ground then angled out to the five path for the stretch run, was set down and produced a nice late run but
came up short. THE SLAP took up sharply going into the first turn, then steadied again near the just past the thirteen-sixteenths pole, bided time along the
rail then started to move forward through the far turn, got a clean run three wide into the stretch, ran on well and was making up ground until having to shift
to the inside when SON OF SHANGHAI drifted in front then was out-nodded for second. AMERICAN EMPIRE got the rail position behind the early
pacesetters, ran up into the traffic and steadied slightly near the three-quarter pole, dropped back to a mid-pack position down the early part of the
backstretch run before making a forward move heading into the far turn, bided time on the inside then tipped out to the two path, had trouble changing leads
through the stretch and was out finished. COUNTRY BOY hustled to contest the early pace then backed off through the clubhouse turn, got bounced around
a bit between horses near the seven-sixteenths marker, launched a bid through the turn, came into the stretch up the rail and responded when called upon
but was not enough. LAURA'S KIDOUGH was very keen going into the first turn, steadied off heels then veered out sharply in a move for self-preservation,
but in turn forced UPRIGHT and HOLY SMOKES very wide, pulled the to the front ranks, was hard to place between horses down the backstretch with the
rider desperately looking for a way out near the seven-sixteenths pole, found a path near the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and kept to task
while never posing a serious threat. EXCESS ENGLISH came away well and raced forwardly through the first turn, entered the backstretch run contesting
the early pace with SON OF SHANGHAI but backed off a bit, content to stalk that one through the far turn, got in tight quarters at the top of the stretch,
steadied off heels and could not recover. WOLF'S LIFE was last away from the gate and slow into stride, fell far behind early, chased the field without
making up much ground despite being under a drive for the last half mile, did manage to pass a couple of stragglers before the finish. UPRIGHT took a
bump from SON OF SHANGHAI after the break then in turn bumped into HOLY SMOKES, then got sandwiched between those two a few strides later, got
going then took another bump from LAURA'S KIDOUGH entering the first the first turn then got carried wide when that rival shifted out sharply, avoided any
further incidents while racing four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn but had nothing to offer in the stretch and was not persevered with
late. HOLY SMOKES got carried very wide into the first turn, was content to race four to five wide down the backstretch and near the rear of the pack,
moved in a couple of paths for the run through the turn, came under pressure near the five-sixteenths marker but did not respond.
