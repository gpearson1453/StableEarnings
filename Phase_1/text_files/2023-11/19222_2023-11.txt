Footnotes
CAPTAIN CREED stalked off the rail the opening turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms two deep toward the top of the
stretch, dug in for the nod passing the sixteenth pole and gradually inched clear. SUSTENANCE took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the
inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met toward the head of
the lane and dug in at even terms, but relented inside the sixteenth pole. KASIMBA drifted out leaving the gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. MY HANDSOME MAN saved
ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and finished
evenly. YO VINNIE was shuffled back at the start then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the
lane. MOSLEY NATURAL raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn.

into the far turn, took the nod midway through the turn and was steadily handled in the lane. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE angled in nearing the three quarter pole
and rated the pace, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms two deep into the far turn, was met midway through the turn,
dropped back past the eighth pole, flattened stride and held on for second. UNICORN SALLY raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase from the

through the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran
evenly in the lane. TIZBIT rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn and could
only improve her position. AMERICA'S PRIDE raced with the pace inside but dropped back toward the half mile pole, gave chase approaching the three

the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. CALYPSO GHOST rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch

Footnotes
REY O REYES rated a slim lead inside, was met at the three quarter pole and settled close from that point, recovered the advantage approaching the seven
sixteenths, came under pressure toward the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off LIEUTENANT BROWN the
final sixteenth. The latter steadied early then settled inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and remained a close
factor to late stretch before relenting. AIR MEDAL saved ground well off the early pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch and took third in the final yards. ESPRESSO rounded the opening turn in the four path then stalked from the
seven eighths pole, took a brief lead at the three quarter but was met toward the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn off
the rail and flattened in the stretch duel for third. SUMMONING DENIS raced in the five path the opening turn, came though the second turn about the three
path and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished evenly to close the gap. LEG UP
stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened.
KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE was never a factor. O'RIGSBY settled in the three path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
NO CHANGE made light contact with Noballstwostrikes leaving the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the three path
and took the lead midway on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. SOCIAL CHIC raced off the pace in the three and four paths,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path, dug in to take second late stretch and finished well at the
outside flank of the winner. MUAD'DIB stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the four path on the far
turn, though, flattened stride in late yards. JUNGLE BEAST saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn
and flattened stride the final sixteenth. C R'S MANDATE made light contact with Noballstwostrikes leaving the gate, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CANDY INVASION raced in the five path the first turn, settled well back and
could only improve his position. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES was jostled leaving the gate then rated close inside, challenged at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled
at even terms leaving the half mile pole but dropped back and gave chase from the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. NO LOVE
FOR JUBA raced in the six path the opening turn, the three path the second turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LORD OF CORK
raced clear into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the nine sixteenths pole and contested mostly even terms from that point, but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. MACHEN'S RIDGE raced in the seven path the opening turn, left the second turn outside and never factored.

Footnotes
MAKINLIMMARGARITAS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and
was steadily handled in the lane. KATALIMA steadied early then saved ground racing well off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and
steadily improved, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in to take second under the wire. MISS LAUREN stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase
past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was nipped from second under the wire.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. BAYS
CASTLE raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path
and showed little more. BOCA BIRDIE was reluctant to load and raced well back saving ground, gave chase approaching the five sixteenths pole, angled to
the seven path through the far turn and passed rivals outside. LOOKING FOR FLARE showed little response through the backstretch. HOLY HIP broke a bit
rank then saved ground. PUSH was reluctant to load and became fractious in the gate, rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, faded into the far turn and appeared to hit the rail midway through the turn. MAY MAYS CASTLE raced in the four path the first turn, picked
up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
