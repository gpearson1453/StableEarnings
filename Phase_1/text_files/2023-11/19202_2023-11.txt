Footnotes
YOU KIDDING ME was away in good order then rated nicely off of the early pace, was well placed through backstretch run while two wide and was roused
three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch and rallied approaching the furlong grounds, vied for the lead at mid-stretch,
overtook ANTHONY'S BEST inside of the furlong pole, drove clear into the final sixteenth and won going away. ANTHONY'S BEST was sent to establish
the early lead and dictated terms into the first turn, was engaged by LOVE OF THE SPORT into the backstretch run and set a prompted pace to the
half-mile marker while carving out decent fractions, was pressured by LOVE OF THE SPORT into the far turn and shook free into the stretch, was
confronted by YOU KIDDING ME at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while besting the
rest. LOVE OF THE SPORT was prominent leaving the break and raced four wide into the first turn, slipped to the two path approaching the backstretch run
and prompted the decent pace to the half-mile marker, pressured ANTHONY'S BEST along the far turn, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the
furlong pole, lacked a response in the final sixteenth, weakened and held for third at the finish. WINTER SOLDIER was bumped at the start and was away
slowly, was allowed to settle in the early going and raced two wide into the first turn, raced outside of rivals into the far turn and mounted a three wide bid at
the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch, could not sustain his run in the final furlong and flattened out. MAJOR TOM was forwardly placed in the
early running and raced three wide into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace two wide through the backstretch run, maintained that two wide path
chasing to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. ONE LITTLE INDIAN settled off of the early pace and saved
ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and raced two wide into the far turn, slipped back to the rail nearing the top of the lane
and did not factor in the stretch. THEMAINPROTAGONIST (IRE) was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the pace from the inside, gained ground
into the backstretch run and maintained an inside path heading to the far turn, lost position nearing the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MO TOWN GAL broke out and bothered FEISTY ELLA at the break, then was content to sit back behind the pace to the turn while working out to the three
path for clear run, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, got even with CRY ME A RUNNER near the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, gained a slight
advantage inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed. CRY ME A RUNNER got pinballed at the break but still broke sharply and seized the lead, led the field
through solid but reasonable fractions, had something left when challenged by MO TOWN GAL at the quarter pole, battled gamely to deep stretch then gave
inside the final sixteenth. BOBBY'S GENIE bumped and bothered a bit by CRY ME A RUNNER at the break, raced close up through the first half-mile racing
in the two path, loomed a danger between horse turning for home but was outrun in the final furlong. FIVE O COCKTAIL veered out sharply at the start and
bumped with CRY ME A RUNNER, angled over towards the rail when clear, saved ground through the turn but did not produce rally when needed. FEISTY
ELLA bothered by MO TOWN GAL at the start, then was outrun in the initial furlong, was put into a drive passing the half-mile pole but still lost some ground
on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and chased the field home.

Footnotes
LITTLE LADY LOU asked for speed away from the start, was engaged soon after the break by SILVER MATY and contested the fast early pace outside of
that rival, raced two wide into the turn, shook free from SILVER MATY approaching the quarter marker and drew away into the stretch, was kept to task into
the final sixteenth and was much the best. SEATTLE FOG took back off of the fast early pace and was unhurried into the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but closed willingly in the late stages and was up in time to secure
second. STEPHANIE'S CANDY tracked the fast early pace outside of runners, improved position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole,
swung three wide into the stretch and ran in pursuit of LITTLE LADY LOU heading to the furlong grounds, could not muster the needed late response and
was just edged for second in the final strides, while just holding for third. IMA KEEN ICE was allowed to settle away from the start, was unhurried in the early
stages and trailed into the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker and swung six wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong grounds, found her best
stride late while widest in deep stretch and just missed for third at the finish. SEEYAMIA chased the dueling pacesetters in the early running, ran in pursuit
three wide into the turn and came four wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and lacked a rally in deep stretch. TREE HUGGER was crowded
at the start by a neighboring rival and was away a bit slowly, chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost ground along the turn and did not factor in the
stretch. SILVER MATY was away in good order and vied for the lead away from the start, was engaged by LITTLE LADY LOU soon after the break and
disputed a fast early pace inside of that rival, was trying to get out a bit while dueling along the turn and lost position to LITTLE LADY LOU heading to the
quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
THE LITTLE H MAN was always prominent through the early going, stayed to the inside through the turn, awaited room and lost some ground to the leaders
nearing the quarter pole then found a seam near the three-sixteenths pole, responded willingly to a stiff ride, fended off a bid from JACK SIXPACK to the
outside kept to task and prevailed. JACK SIXPACK broke well but was allowed to settle behind the pace, was let loose through the turn and made up some
ground on the leaders, swung four wide into the stretch but was matched on the inside by THE LITTLE H MAN, dueled that foe the length of the stretch and
came up just short. WINDRIBBON threw his head at the start then was a little slow into stride, raced three wide, made some forward progress down the
backstretch, launched a bid passing the three furlong pole while still on the outside, hooked in with SMUGGLER'S RUN passing the quarter pole, gained a
slight advantage passing the furlong marker but could not hold off the top pair in the late stages. SMUGGLER'S RUN broke well, allowed the pace scenario
to develop then went to put pressure on RUNKERRY passing the half-mile pole, overtook that one before the quarter pole, had to deal with a challenge from
WINDRIBBON to the outside, battled to deep stretch then weakened some inside the last sixteenth. LARRY'S LEGEND was outrun from the break, but
moved into contention before the turn, became boxed in and fell back to last through the turn, then swung five wide into the stretch and tried to rally but
could not make an impact. RUNKERRY was hustled from the gate and was able to secure the lead and the rail before passing the five furlong pole, went
unchallenged until SMUGGLER'S RUN made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, came under a ride and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
VANISKY settled three wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace from a three wide path through the backstretch run, was roused into the far turn and
came four wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, responded to firm urging into the final
sixteenth, rallied in deep stretch, drew to even terms with LYING GHOST in the final strides and was up at the wire to prevail in a blanket finish. LYING
GHOST broke alertly and established the lead away from the start, conceded the lead to BRANNIGAN along the first turn and stalked that rival into the
backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, was roused two wide into the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled
with GORDY'S BOY into the stretch and took command approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task while holding foes at bay into the final sixteenth,
was all out in deep stretch, met the bid of VANISKY in the final strides, was tagged on the wire for the win and just held for second. GORDY'S BOY was
forwardly placed in the early going and tracked the pace into the first turn, raced two then three wide into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to
the half-mile marker, was given his cue and loomed three wide at the quarter pole, vied for the lead with LYING GHOST into upper stretch, lost ground to
that rival at the furlong pole but stayed on and battled into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch, just missed for second at the wire and held
safely in the end for third. CANELITO settled just off of the early pace, tracked two then three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside at the
half-mile marker and improved position heading to the far turn, bid two wide at the quarter pole, chased two wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong grounds, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was blocked into deep stretch and lacked a late response. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was allowed to settle
leaving the start and raced two wide and between runners into the first turn, came under a snug hold into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to
the half-mile marker, was roused approaching the far turn and mounted a four wide bid at the quarter pole, maintained that four wide path into the stretch,
lost ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and finished evenly. TAM'S TIME was allowed to settle in the early going and
saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while not far back through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, chased three wide
into the stretch, offered a mild late bid but was unable to threaten. BRANNIGAN was hustled leaving the start and was prominent in the early going,
assumed command along the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the half-mile marker and set decent fractions
heading to the far turn, was overtaken by LYING GHOST nearing the quarter pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY took back off of the fast early pace and tracked from the inside, improved position into the turn and was guided three wide to the
quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, chased BOSS OF THEMOSS to the furlong marker, closed
determinedly into the final sixteenth, confronted BOSS OF THEMOSS in deep stretch and kept to task to prevail at the finish. BOSS OF THEMOSS showed
speed away from the start and contested the fast early pace, took command heading to the half-mile marker and was pressed into the turn by DECIMATE,
set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead heading to the furlong marker, was confronted by GRIT AND
CURIOSITY approaching the sixteenth-marker, met that bid to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. REFI
NOW was away in good order and raced close to the fast early pace, came three wide into the turn and chased the leading pair to the quarter marker, came
in tight in upper stretch and altered course behind a drifting rival, offered a mild rally in the final furlong and outfinished RESPOND to secure the show
honors. RESPOND raced close up leaving the start and contested the fast early pace, chased the quick pace two wide to the quarter marker, maintained
that two wide path into the stretch, could not muster a late rally in the drive and was just edged for third at the finish. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR was
forwardly placed leaving the break, took back and tracked the fast early pace while outside of runners, chased three wide into the turn, swung five wide for
the stretch drive and did not threaten. DECIMATE broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, contested the fast pace while outside of runners and
pressed BOSS OF THEMOSS into the turn, kept pressure on BOSS OF THEMOSS to the quarter marker, drifted to the three path into upper stretch, could
not keep pace heading to the furlong grounds and faded. STRETCH RUN was fractious prior to the start, bobbled at the break and was away a step slowly,
showed speed and rushed to contest the fast early pace from the inside, lost position along the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KINGMEISTER bobbled slightly coming out of the gate then raced in the three path through the first half mile, was content with a position near the back of
the field, improved through the far turn then swung out to the five path for the stretch and produced a strong late run under brisk handling to get up in time.
MOOGIE SON was not asked for speed and was content to lag near the back of the field, deftly navigated a clear run through the far turn, came into the
stretch with plenty of run but behind horses, squeezed between horses just past the eighth pole, finished willingly and was able to grab the second spot.
COUSIN RICHIE took a light bump from the inside then got over to the rail before the first turn, raced under some restraint to the half while pulling to an
improved position, was let loose and moved out a path through the far turn, had to idle behind horses until a big hole opened the rail turning for home,
surged through to take a short lead in mid-stretch then was outfinished in the shadow of the wire. ANITANEWMERCEDES broke well and was able to get
inside position and a share of the lead through the initial bend, held sway to the far turn, responded in the stretch when surround by challengers, hung in to
deep stretch then was outfinished. ROCKTILLYOUDROP broke well and raced mid-pack two paths off the rail through the early stages, settled into a
tracking position just behind the leaders down the backstretch, made a forward move into contention through the far turn, turned into the stretch with every
chance then weakened under pressure at the furlong pole. MOGOLLON RIM broke out and made light contact with COUSIN RICHIE after the break, got
caught four wide early and continued to race wide throughout, launched a bid from the rear of the field through the far turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch and was gaining some ground in the late stages. DUAL THREAT raced mid-pack and in the three path through the first half mile then struggled to
keep up on the far turn, came under a stiff drive near the three furlong pole and chased the field home. SUPERMAZEL got away well but was three wide
contesting the early pace through the first turn, raced forwardly through the far turn, loomed a threat passing the five-sixteenths pole then tired and had
nothing to offer in the stretch. ECOLOGIST got squeezed and had to steady a few strides out of the gate, then took an inside path through the clubhouse
turn and was right up with the leaders turning on to the backstretch, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, came under pressure but was not a factor from
that point.

Footnotes
YOU ENJOY MYSELF was hustled to be forwardly placed away from the start, took back at the half-mile pole and tracked the solid pace into the turn,
tracked from the rail heading to the quarter pole then angled out nearing the top of the lane, was floated out by a drifting rival in upper stretch and mounted a
five wide rally for the drive, gained ground at the furlong marker, continued his advance into the final sixteenth and vied for the lead into deep stretch, took
command in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. O'BANION (IRE) tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, chased three wide
along the turn, was floated out six wide into the lane, rallied inside of the furlong marker, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding
safely for second. HE'S INIT TO WINIT showed good early speed and vied for the lead away from the start, pulled on the rider and disputed the solid pace
into the turn, pressed the pace from the inside heading to the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead approaching the
furlong marker, raced on the left lead into the final sixteenth and was confronted by YOU ENJOY MYSELF at that station, battled into deep stretch, was
outfinished in the final stages and just held for third at the wire. LAURA'S KIDOUGH tracked the solid early pace from the inside, improved position into the
turn and ran in pursuit two wide to the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, needed more
in deep stretch but was gaining in the late stages and just missed for third. GALLO DEL CIELO was away in good order and was prominent leaving the start,
contested the solid early pace outside of runners and dueled with HE'S INIT TO WINIT into the turn, set a decent pace while pressed to the quarter pole,
drifted to the four path into upper stretch and floated out YOU ENJOY MYSELF, lost position approaching the furlong marker and weakened in the final
sixteenth. HOLY SMOKES chased the decent early pace outside of runners, raced three wide to the quarter marker, chased five wide into the stretch and
did not threaten. EXCESS ENGLISH was hustled away from the start and contested the early lead, took back at the half-mile marker and tracked two wide
into the turn, chased the leading pair to the quarter pole, swung four wide for the stretch drive, was outrun to the furlong grounds and weakened in deep
stretch. OUR NORTH STAR was hard to place while racing along the rail in the early going, was guided outside of rivals heading to the turn and chased four
wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked a late response.
