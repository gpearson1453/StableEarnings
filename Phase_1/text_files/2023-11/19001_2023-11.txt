Footnotes
SHAYMYNAME moved straight to the front setting the pace off the rail, faced mild pressure up the backstretch, regained a clear advantage again on the far
turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lugged out near the sixteenth pole but held while being kept to the task. PEACE PACT settled off the pace in the two
path, raced inside foes up the backstretch into the far turn, was encouraged along three furlongs out, kept on inside to get the nod for second.
EXAGERADORA broke a step slowly, settled at the rear off the rail, advanced outside foes three to four wide up the backstretch, moved between runners at
the quarter pole, drifted out through the stretch and was outfinished for second. PAUL'S TRICKY TALE chased briefly two to three wide, steadily dropped
back between runners up the backstretch, tired. MEMORIES ETERNAL switched out and moved forward pressing briefly up the backstretch from outside,
began to drop back three to four wide on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD broke on top, settled off the leader parked outside, advanced willingly three to four wide taking the lead past the three-sixteenths
and drawing clear by the five-sixteenths, was given just a shake of the reins in upper stretch and was taken in hand through the final furlong while being
ridden out. CHASING ARTEMIS bumped with a rival at the start then was urged forward, raced off the pace outside foes, went three to five wide, gained the
place. LADY LANCER bobbled just slightly at the start but recovered to move clear, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was overtaken by the winner
early on the turn, kept on but was outkicked for second. LONDON LADY chased two to three wide, was ridden along by the five-sixteenths, needed more.
COMODA bumped with a foe at the start, tracked in behind the leaders off the rail, moved out four wide later on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. BALI
MOON chased from inside, came out, was never a threat.

Footnotes
WAR MASTER attended the pace just outside the leader, eased back off that one and an outside foe, switched outside and advanced three wide on the turn
with aim, took the lead in upper stretch, forged clear. FINICKY stalked early then moved to challenge for the lead leaving the backstretch taking a narrow
lead about the seven-sixteenths, was in command turning for home but soon overtaken, proved no match but second best, was vanned off. TAPORICAL
lacked early speed, advanced outside the trailing pair three to four wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. BATI KING was two to three wide at the rear,
shifted six wide turning for home, kicked on mildly. ZAVA tracked from inside, shifted out five wide past the quarter pole, was not a late threat. YAHOO
OMAR quickly moved to the lead, set a pressured pace, was challenged into the turn, weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
CHIEF RON settled off the leading pair, moved three wide early on the turn to challenge, was floated six wide turning for home, vied outside runners in
upper stretch under urging, put to further encouragement in the furlong grounds and responded by edging away through the final sixteenth. WHERE
PARADISE LAY exchanged a very light bump at the start then moved quickly to take the early lead, set the early pace inside but off the rail, was soon
overtaken by an outside foe relegated to pressing from inside, re-bid drawing even past the five-sixteenths, drifted out several paths leaving the turn, kept on
gamely in the stretch but was only second best. CARBONITE tossed the head at the start, moved forward outside keenly despite the rider's hold to take the
lead and force the pace, was challenged by inside and outside rivals midway on the turn, kept on till late stretch then yielded. YO NESSROUNDONKERN
exchanged a minor bump at the start, was under a hold in behind the leaders early, dropped back, failed to rally.

Footnotes
NICK'S LITTLE BOY exchanged a light brush at the start, settled into stride off the leaders stalking early, advanced three to five wide on the turn floating out
a bit for the drive, bid outside in mid-stretch, got the nod. MY HANDSOME MAN settled off the leaders racing three wide on the turn, came out a bit turning
into upper stretch, altered inside the tiring leader in mid-stretch, bid inside but just missed. SIMPSON BAY attended the pace from outside in hand, moved
to the lead past the seven-sixteenths going clear by the late part of the turn, was challenged in mid-stretch and lugged out at that juncture, was outfinished
but best of the rest. THE GREAT GAZOO bobbled just slightly and brushed with a foe at the start, dropped back outside runners, moved nearer the leaders
from outside while tipping out from four to six wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MAKOTO saved ground along the rail through the turn, came out
in upper stretch, was not a threat. VENTILATOR was quick to the lead, set the pace inside but off the fence facing outside pressure, was overtaken past the
seven-sixteenths, weakened. CAPE COD SUMMER broke just a bit awkwardly, lacked early speed, was never a threat.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY JACK settled off the pace, advanced two to three wide on the turn, bid inside the leader near the eighth pole and edged clear. NO SABE NADA
was reluctant to load, lacked early speed, moved forward inside foes under some coaxing, tipped out and made a swift advance three then four wide on the
turn taking the lead five deep at the top of the stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch and outkicked but held second. SIR WELLINGTON switched out in the
early going, went five wide on the turn, kept on evenly. SPUN AND WON shifted in saving ground inside early on the turn racing mid-pack, came out four
wide leaving the turn and ran on. THREES OVER DEUCES settled outside at the rear racing three to four wide into the turn, waited briefly in behind foes at
the quarter pole, shifted five to six deep past that point and ran on. HOLLYWOOD JET pressed the early pace then drew even forcing the issue dueling
inside into the turn, ridden for more three furlongs out, tired. PIRATE RICK had the early lead, contested the pace two to three wide, came up empty.
CHICKS DIG SCARS chased from outside four to five wide, tired.
