Footnotes
COOL SPIRIT was bumped slightly by outside rival then pressed the pace from the two path, engaged the leader and took the lead near the three
sixteenths pole, drew clear. ARKANSAS ZONG raced off the pace from the inside, skimmed the rail going into the stretch to prove second best. ADMIRAL
RISTY chased the leaders from three wide and was along for show. INGLIS broke in slightly and bumped with inside rival, raced in the middle of the pack
through the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to improve his position. QUICK ZONG show good early speed to the turn then was headed at
the quarter pole and matched strides with outside rival to the top of the stretch but tired. CLASSIC WARRIOR lacked room on the inside in the early stages
of the race, saved ground but failed to menace. UNCLE CHAN had no early speed and went three wide on the turn but was not a factor. TOAST TO THE
GIRLS raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. YO PLAY was off the pace to the seven sixteenths pole then dropped back. HOLIDAY
FOREVER raced at near the back, fell and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE RUNNING NEAR THE THREE FURLONG
MARKER, AFTER A REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
TWO JET hustled away to a clear lead to the top of the stretch, fended off the challenge from GYPSYROSELEE at the top of the stretch and drew off.
GYPSYROSELEE prompted the pace from the two path to the top of the stretch, gained slightly on the leader in upper stretch but couldn't catch and proved
second best. R T'S GEM raced five wide into the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the final turn for
the late run to be up for the show. CHERRY STAR unhurried down the backstretch then made a looming three wide bid on the final turn and showed late
interest in the stretch. K V SQUARED was within striking distance down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn but failed to sustain that
bid. TENSAS BERTIE was forwardly placed to the top of the stretch and weakened. COURTLY DOC was allowed to settle at the back, went five wide on the
final turn but was not a threat. DEAL ME A PENNY stalked the pace from three wide around the first turn then fell back and finished evenly. ADDI BUG was
always back. VALTESSE was off the pace on the inside down the backstretch and gave way.

WHISKEY'S GONE prompted the pace from the two path, wore down the leader in the stretch and cleared late. STEPHEN'S ANSWER went to a challenged
lead to set all the pace and gave way grudgingly. BIRTHDAY PARTY was off the pace around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the backstretch
but was empty in the in the stretch. MR B QUIET raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, moved between horses at the quarter pole then
moved out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run. BIG ROJO raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid going into the
final turn and flattened out. APPLEWOOD saved ground but failed to menace. FAST VERDICT was unhurried down the backstretch then made a four wide
bid on the final turn to improve his position. SMOKY TOPAZ was through after a half. TAKEN BACK trailed the field and was never a factor. PINCH
ASSAULT raced near the back down the backstretch then made a four wide mild bid going into the final turn but had no response.

and was up in the final jumps. FINISHWHATUSTARTED sprinted to the lead to set the pace, edged away on the turn but tired in the stretch and held on for
the place. ZERO POINT ZERO pressed the pace from the two path then fell pack on the turn but came again to be up for the place. CHEER UP tracked the

Footnotes
DRAFT CHOICE was off the pace while going between horses at the three furlong marker then pressed the pace around the turn and gave a determined
late push to be up in the final jumps. SHARP CHARLIE hustled to the lead to set the pace but was ran down in the final jumps to be denied. SADIE'S LIGHT
trailed the field then moved between horses at the top of the stretch to be the best of the rest. LION HEART LEGEND showed no early speed and passed
tiring rivals. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE rushed up to be off the pace on the inside but gave way. THE BOYZ PRIORITY pressed the early pace while racing
wide and retreated.

Footnotes
TOTAL SURPRISE was allowed to settle around the first turn then advanced from three wide and engaged the leader in mid stretch to draw clear late.
PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER was off the pace while racing three wide and took over nearing the quarter pole and fought gamely in the stretch to be second
best. BAYOU CHROME steadied into the first turn then was allowed to settle on the inside, moved between horses at the seven sixteenths and gave a late
run to just miss the place. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT was unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn, angled in at the top of
the stretch to make a late rally. TREASURE COAST raced near the back then floated out on the first turn, was allowed to settle into the backstretch and
made a mild three wide bid on the final turn but was empty in the stretch. MOSH PIT was forwardly placed on the inside to the final turn then faded and
finished evenly. LOST GOLD stalked the pace from between horses to the first turn but was through early. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER went to the lead into
the first turn then edged away on the backstretch but was done after a half. AMBASSADOR HOUSE raced in the middle of the pack through the first turn
then dropped back and was not a threat.
