Footnotes
CAPIAT was a bit hard to load prior to the start, was off slowly and spotted the field to begin, tracked the early pace from the inside, improved position along
the backstretch run, ran in pursuit of the pacesetter two wide into the far turn, made a steady advance on SHAUN'S JAZZ into the stretch, wore down that
rival in the final sixteenth and held in a drive for the win. SHAUN'S JAZZ assumed command away from the start, set decent fractions while controlling the
pace into the backstretch run, was well handled while setting all of the pace to the far turn, extended the lead at the quarter marker, set down for the drive
and was confronted by CAPIAT inside of the furlong pole, battled with CAPIAT into the final sixteenth, was bested in deep stretch and was clear in the end
for second. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was unhurried away from the start, slipped to the inside and saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail
to the half-mile marker, improved position two wide into the far turn, swung to the four path into upper stretch, was not able to impact the top pair but offered
a late bid and was up in the final strides to secure third. BLUEGRASS RYDER was asked to rate off of the early leaders, became rank and hard to place into
the first turn, was steered to the three path nearing the backstretch run and carried out VINNIEBOB at that station, settled into the backstretch and tracked
the decent pace between runners to the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide path into the far turn, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane,
mounted an inside bid at mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth, weakened and was outfinished for third. VINNIEBOB settled in the
second flight to begin, tracked the early pace three wide then was carried four wide into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace three to four wide
approaching the half-mile marker, lost position into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and gave way. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was forwardly
placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from a two wide position along the first turn, prompted the pace to the half-mile pole, raced three
wide into the far turn and lost position at the quarter marker, chased three wide into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT POINT was content to let the pace scenario play out in front a lagged a few lengths behind the field through the early going, was put into a drive
from the seven-sixteenths pole, lengthened stride, swung five wide into the stretch with a lot of ground to make up, produced a bold rally and reeled in KO
SAMUI (IRE) in the final yards. KO SAMUI (IRE) settled from the break then moved forwardly tipping out to the three path through clubhouse turn, remained
three to four wide through the backstretch run rating well as the rider dictated, moved challenge for the lead with a forward move through the far turn,
responded when set down at the quarter pole, took a short lead passing the three-sixteenths pole then was unable fend off LOOKOUT POINT in sight of the
wire. MY DAD IS THIRSTY broke well, was pushed to go for the lead two deep going into the first turn, opened up a short lead passing the seven-eighths
pole then had some pressure applied by EFFECTIVE GIG within a furlong, went on with it when that foe was content to drop back to a stalking position, held
sway into the far turn, was challenged by that rival passing the five-sixteenths but battled back, then had to deal with an additional bid from KO SAMUI (IRE)
continued on with good courage but was outfinished in the final furlong. EFFECTIVE GIG broke well then ceded the early lead to MY DAD IS THIRSTY,
decided to press the pace with six furlongs to run when KO SAMUI (IRE) also decided to press the issue, then eased back a bit down the backstretch
allowing MY DAD IS THIRSTY to dictate the pace to the far turn, was set down and sent to challenge for the lead near the three furlong pole, had that bid
rebuffed then had to battle between horses turning for home could not sustain the bid and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
CLEVER CLOVER broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered and showed speed in the early going, contested the fast pace inside of a pair of
rivals into the turn, carved out quick fractions while pressed to the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, felt
pressure from the runner-up inside of the sixteenth-marker, dug in in the final strides and just lasted for the win at the finish. HERMELINDA'S FANCY
tracked the fast early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground into the turn and was well placed approaching the top of the lane, chased CLEVER
CLOVER to mid-stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong pole, tipped to the two path into deep stretch, rallied and just missed for the win, while besting
the rest. ELEGANT BOY took back leaving the start and was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the turn, was floated out by BIG BET
nearing the quarter marker and swung five wide for the drive, closed in the final furlong, could not impact the top two in deep stretch and was clear in the
end for third. BIG BET chased the fast early pace from a two wide path, gained ground into the turn, shifted four wide nearing the quarter marker and floated
out ELEGANT BOY, maintained a four wide path into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and weakened in
deep stretch. REGAL REDWOOD showed speed and disputed the fast early pace, was engaged by CLEVER CLOVER and contested the fast pace
between runners into the turn, pressed CLEVER CLOVER two wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way. RAMATHORN broke
alertly and contested the quick early pace, pressed the pace three wide into the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path
into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

COUNCILWOMAN JILLY was away in good order and was forwardly placed into the first turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter into the backstretch
run and prompted the decent pace to the half-mile marker, pressured PROOF OF JAZZ into the far turn and battled with that rival into the stretch, took a
narrow lead at the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and dug in into the final sixteenth, held foes at bay into deep stretch and determinedly prevailed
at the finish. RIVETING SPIRIT settled just off of the early pace and raced a bit in tight into the first turn, tracked the decent pace two wide and between
runners to the half-mile pole, chased between and two wide to the quarter marker, advanced into upper stretch and raced within aim nearing the furlong
grounds, tipped four wide into the final sixteenth, rallied in traffic and missed for the win at the finish, while earning the nod for second on the wire. PROOF
OF JAZZ broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and set solid fractions while prompted through the
backstretch run, was pressured into the far turn by COUNCILWOMAN JILLY and battled with that rival into the stretch, lost ground to COUNCILWOMAN
JILLY inside of the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was gamely bested in the final strides and was just edged for second on the wire.
REBEL GIRL bobbled leaving the start and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the
pace while not far back heading to the quarter marker, chased from the two path along the far turn and swung four wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at
the furlong pole, shifted six wide into the final sixteenth, closed willingly and just missed for third on the wire. BUYBACK tracked the early pace from the
inside, improved position along the backstretch run and stalked from the inside heading to the far turn, chased the leaders to the quarter marker, raced in
tight into upper stretch and lacked room nearing the furlong grounds, found a seam into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch.
TOPANTICIPATION (GB) settled just off of the early leaders and raced a bit in tight into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide into the backstretch run,
was well placed heading into the far turn, maintained a three wide path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, shifted to the five path into the final
sixteenth, was squeezed by oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was outkicked in the final strides.

along the backstretch run, was pressured into the far turn and carved out the pace to the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and was kept to task into
the final sixteenth, determinedly dug in in the late stages and held in a drive at the finish. HEAT N REHEAT tracked the early pace from the inside, raced

at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, raced in a bit of late traffic in deep stretch, was outkicked and just missed for third at the finish.

Footnotes
CHIC SAMARAI came away well, ceded the pacesetting duties to GENTLE JULIA then stalked that one while being well-handled, responded when asked to
quicken passing the three furlong marker then was set down in earnest at the top of the stretch, quickly put some distance on the field and finished strong
despite racing on the wrong lead. DUST MAKER was always prominent from the inside, tracked the early leaders from a couple of lengths behind, moved
up a bit closer during the backstretch run, looked to make a run near the quarter pole but had to wait, found a seam at the head of the stretch, responded
when asked to go and was gaining in deep stretch. FINNLEY'S KITTEN raced mid-pack without being asked for much in the early going, stayed close on
the run to the far turn, moved three wide in tandem with J AND M EXPRESS at the top of the stretch and ran on well, out-finishing that rival to grab third. J
AND M EXPRESS was held up heading in to the first turn but was still floated three wide, remained out in the clear and launched a sweeping bid with three
furlongs to run, came into the stretch five or six wide, ran on well but came up short of a minor award. RAUCOUS TIZZY got squeezed a bit at the start
when GENTLE JULIA came in then lagged behind the field in the early going, moved up into contention approaching the far turn, did not have a response
when called up on and never made an impact. GENTLE JULIA broke out some at the start but was able to seize the rail position going into the first turn,
then was allowed set a moderate pace alone on the lead to the far turn, offered little resistance when challenged passing the quarter pole and hand nothing
to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPICE was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, lost ground along the turn and chased from the inside
heading to the quarter pole, saved all of the ground into the stretch, ran evenly while within aim approaching the furlong marker, responded to urging into the
final sixteenth and tipped two wide into deep stretch, surged in the final strides and got up at the finish to prevail. BROADWAY TIGER bobbled slightly at the
start but was away in good order, assumed command and showed speed in the early stages, carved out solid fractions and showed the way to the quarter
pole, was set down into upper stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task while holding a safe lead into the final sixteenth, felt late
pressure from SPICE, was all out to hold off that rival in the final strides, was tagged on the wire for the win and held for second. OOPS (GB) settled off of
the early pace while not far back, saved ground into the turn and advanced two wide heading to the quarter pole, tipped three wide into upper stretch and
ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top two in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. YO
BABY tracked the solid early pace three wide and between runners, lost ground three wide along the turn, chased three wide into the stretch and could not
muster a late rally. VELOCIOUS paused at the start and was away a bit slowly, rushed up in the early going and tracked the quick pace between rivals,
advanced two wide into the turn and pressed the pace to the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch, lacked a response in the late stages and tired in the
final sixteenth. AGUILA DEL RIO chased the solid early pace from the rear, saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, did not offer a
response in the stretch and did not factor. LADY GOOD TROUBLE tracked the quick early pace four wide, maintained that four wide path into the turn and
lost ground at the quarter marker, chased four wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO broke well and got a clear run to the lead into the first turn, set a solid pace while always traveling well in hand, repelled a bit from stablemate
LIL MIRACLE MAN at the top of the stretch, and plenty in reserve and sprinted away under intermittent urging. HOUSE OF LORDS lagged well behind the
field for the first half mile, hugged the rail through the far turn, waited patiently for room, slipped through an opening along the rail turning into the stretch,
was not able to impact the winner in the late stages and got up for second. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was outrun into the first turn but held the rail while
tracking the pace through the first half mile, bided time through the far turn while holding position waiting for clear running, got clear in mid stretch, was
outfinished in deep stretch and was just edged for second in the final strides. LIL MIRACLE MAN broke well then ceded the lead to stablemate IL
CAPITANO, was always prominent to the far turn, mounted a challenge at the top of the stretch but was repelled in that effort, weakened in the final
sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE broke a step slow then allowed to settle near the rear of the pack, came
under a ride down the backstretch and was able to improve position a bit, attempted to mount a late rally but was one-paced and needed more in the final
stages. BEL RAGAZZO was not asked for speed but pulled to a forward position under some restraint through the early going, made steady gains towards
the lead down the backstretch, bid three wide through the far turn, raced within aim at the top of the stretch then gave way in the late stages. BABY
FRANKIE was forwardly placed leaving the start and raced three wide into the first turn, stalked the solid pace while outside of runners along the
backstretch, made a four wide bid through the second turn, swung widest into the stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong grounds and tired in the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
SHARONA'S WILD BOY had to be pushed a bit to keep up with the early pace, chased the two pacesetters through the turn, tipped out to the four to five
path for the stretch run and ran on well under strong handling to get up in time. GOLDENSUNRISE bobbled slightly at the break but recovered quickly and
was set off for the lead, took over the pacesetting duties under a stout hold with GOLDENCENTS pressing the issue to the outside, disposed of that one at
the top of the stretch while still in hand, opened up passing the three sixteenths marker, kept on with good courage and just failed to last while drifting out in
deep stretch. HARBOR OUTLAW lost his path at the start and was away slowly, improved position heading into the turn then was held up behind horses,
waited through the turn, angled five wide passing the three-sixteenths pole, responded to urging into the final furlong, found his best stride late and was
clear in the end for third. SUMMANUS broke in after the break causing a chain reaction to the inside, then raced mid-pack to the turn, got a clean trip
through the turn in the two path, responded when set down for the stretch run, had every chance approaching mid-stretch but was outfinished in the late
stages. RESERVE PROOF got away in good order, raced up close with the tracking group, stayed in the clear racing in the five path down the backstretch,
angled in to the two path for the run through the turn, followed the eventual winner into the stretch but could not generate a late bid. ELCONDOR broke well,
moved over towards the inside once clear, pressed GOLDENSUNRISE to the turn, bid for the lead from the three-furlong pole but had that bid repelled,
came into the stretch under heavy pressure but weakened passing the furlong pole. ALMOST SNOW sat behind the early pace while saving ground
throughout, dropped back a few lengths passing the half mile pole then came back on with a run through the turn, was running on well up the rail in the
stretch then weakened in the final furlong. LAUGHING LEGACY had to steady briefly a few strides out of the gate, lost some momentum then rushed up to
join the body of the field, made a mild run four wide through the turn, came six wide into lane then had nothing to offer in the stretch.
