Footnotes
PRESSLEY RIDGE broke awkwardly to be a step slow from the gate, moved up the fence to stalk the pace down the backside, waited midway on the turn
to angle five wide around the pacesetters and drew off down the lane when called upon as much the best. MY TICKET pressed the pace from two wide into
the far turn, engaged the leader nearing the quarter pole with his rally, was no match for the winner and finished willingly as second best. WHY KENNY
WHY set a well rate pace to the head of the lane and had no response when engaged turning for home. MY BUDDY MICAH was slow early to trail down the
backside, made a mild rally through the turn and finished evenly without having been a threat. BALU dropped back entering the far turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
SERENDIPITOUS set the pace for a half mile from the rail, was taken in hand off the lead into the turn to switch to the outside, rallied in the turn to take the
lead, responded when challenged in upper stretch, briefly surrendered the lead in the lane and came again gamely to prevail. DEER CREEK ROAD
unhurried for the first half mile to trail, circled four wide in the turn to engage the leader in upper stretch, briefly took the lead and was outkicked coming
home while clearly second best. KARAMEL CORN prompted the early pace, dropped back in the field in the run down the backside and made a steady
advance coming home to gain the show. ATTACK ANGLE pressed the pace for the first half, assumed command into the final bend, lacked a response
when challenged turning for home and gave way through the stretch. HONOR THE D well placed to stalk the leaders to the far turn and faded. YOU'RE MY
BOY BLUE slow early into the first turn, raced up the rail into contention on the first bend, dropped back down the backside and finished evenly as a
non-threat.

Footnotes
CRYO pressed the early pace from two wide, assumed command down the backside, opened a clear advantage through the turn and held sway in the lane
while geared down. ONE MORE RING unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, commenced a rally in the turn, circled six wide turning for home and
finished willingly with a steady advance. STRIKE A BEAT settled well off the pace to midway on the turn, rallied angling seven wide at the head of the lane
and closed well to just miss the place. LUCKY SMILE bumped at the start, taken in hand to be reserved off the pace and made a late mild bid in the lane
passing weakened rivals. NICHOLAS JAMES stalked the pace into the turn, made a three wide bid in the bend and flattened out turning for home. MY TWO
AUNT JOANS tracked the pace from the fence in mid-pack and lacked a response when called upon. HINK'S PALADIN bumped rival leaving the gate,
made an early bid from between horses in the turn and faded in the stretch. SMUDGE THE CAT well placed early and gave way coming home. MASTER
rushed up the fence to take a brief lead early, pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.

JONES FALLS prompted the pace to midway on the far turn, dueled with the pacesetter through the lane and pulled clear late in the drive. MR LAOBAN set
the pace to the head of the lane, responded when challenged to deep stretch and was outkicked tp the wire while a clear second best. ALTAIR hopped at
the start to trail early giving the field a couple lengths, rallied up the fence to a stalking position down the backside and flattened out nearing the quarter pole.
DESERT HIGHWAY went one-paced throughout lacking a closing bid. GOOD SOUL reserved off the pace and lacked a response when called upon.
FOGGY ALBION was never a threat. RAPA NUI was a non-factor.

MAYBE FRANKY set a well rated pace, responded when challenged on the final bend, shook clear turning for home, denied a stretch bid from the runner-up
and finished convincingly. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ bobbled at the start, raced up to stalk the pace from between horses down the backside, rallied to loom in
mid-stretch, failed to pass the winner and finished well to be best of rest. WAR MOON prompted the pace to the far turn, engaged the leader on the bend to
threaten at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. STATE OF GRACE unhurried early on to be well off the leaders and mounted a belated rally in the
stretch. RUNAWAY BELLE slow early to be at the rear of the main body, circled wide when rallying in the turn and finished evenly. CARLY'S FLIGHT was
the distant trailer down the backstretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. I'M JAC'D tracked the leaders from four wide to the far turn and lacked a
response when called upon. NANA ROZE was through early.

Footnotes
PRIMITIVO prompted the pace down the backside, ranged up on the turn from between horses to challenge for the lead and pulled clear in the drive
determinedly. STARS N SPACE set the pace through the turn, was engaged in a three-way battle at the head of the lane, was the first to be passed inside
the eighth pole and re-rallied to gain the place in deep stretch in a game effort. TEQUILA FLATS stalked the pace down the backside, rallied three wide to
loom boldly turning for home and was out-kicked in deep stretch. OVERLOAD well placed in the run down the backstretch, lost position through the turn and
rallied belatedly in the lane. PECKS NOT BAD reserved off the pace to the top of the lane and showed late energy in the stretch. RED COMET rated off the
leaders to the turn, rallied wide turning for home and made a mild bid in the drive. RED HOT POWER showed early foot to contend down the backstretch,
was taken in hand into the turn to drop off the leaders and faded coming home. ROLLIN SO PERFECT was never a factor.

LINE DANCER prompted the pace to the far turn, rallied two wide to engage the pacesetter turning for home, opened a clear lead in the lane and held the
closer safe. MOBIL CHIC unhurried early to be at the rear of the main body to the far turn, rallied four wide in the final bend and made a steady advance to
be second best. I'M LEGIT squeezed back at the start to be the trailer, continued to be the distant trailer to the final bend and rallied belatedly to close
ground well through the stretch. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS set a well rated pace through the far turn and failed to respond when challenged at the head of
the lane. EARLY BLOOMER tracked the leaders from the rail down the backside, was set to an early drive on the turn and faded coming home. ABIGAIL
LEE stalked the pace for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
WATCHOUTFORWEAVER prompted the pace for a half mile from three wide, took command in the far turn and drew off in the lane as much best. INDY
CARR pressed the pace from between horses down the backstretch, made a bid with the winner in the turn, could not go with that one in the lane and kept
on well to be second best. LITTLE RONS ROCKET tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, lost position in the turn and closed well late to be
gaining in deep stretch. ORLEANS STORM moved up down the backside to contention with an early bid and finished evenly. KETTLE KING reserved off
the early pace to be mid-field throughout and made a mild rally in the lane. JIM'S RIVER RUNNER unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, rallied in
the turn to be prominent in upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. THE GOSPEL OF MARK was never a threat. AGNELLO CITY moved up in the first
turn to be well placed , steadied entering the backstretch to drop back and faded entering the far turn. PEDAL TO DA KETTLE squeezed back leaving the
gate and was never a factor. CHILTEPIN set a pressured pace from the fence for a half mile and was through early.
