Footnotes
CREME CARAMEL reserved early, bid on the turn then wore down the pacesetter and was just up following a long drive. FAIRY DREAMS vied in the
opening quarter, shook loose on the turn, was collared in midstretch, resisted but was nailed at the wire. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO angled inside on the
turn then finished well to gain the show. LUNA T lacked speed, moved wide on the turn then flattened out. SIRENETTA broke a bit awkwardly then trailed,
with some late energy. CINNAMON DREAM saved ground, eased back into the far turn and faded. LULI'S DANCER prompted the pace outside then was
finished before half a mile. FRANKLY MY DEAR flashed speed for quarter mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
YULETIDE GALLOP set a pressured early pace on the inside, dueled inside on the turn, responded when asked, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run
and prevailed determinedly after a long drive. WHISKEYROMEOSIERRA stalked close up between rivals, bid two wide on the turn, dueled with YULETIDE
GALLOP, dug in gamely outside of that rival in the final furlong and battled on willingly to the finish. CHICA CHUCK steadied at the start, raced off the pace
inside, moved up inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside for third. PALLINO pressed the pace in the early stages, then
chased three wide and was outfinished for the show spot. JESUS' DREAM chased three wide, continued three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. HIS
RIGHTS trailed the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. KINGDOM FORCE raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the turn and failed
to threaten. NUEDORF tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and tired. SHAKE THE GOLD chased between rivals and gave way.
