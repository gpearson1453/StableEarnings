PAULA'S SURPRISE was away alertly to set the pace while in the two path, drew clear on the turn and then drew off in the lane to prove much the best,
driving. CLOUD IN THE WIND stalked the winner three wide early, then chased that rival three wide on the turn, proved to be no match for that rival while
clearly second best. PHABULOUS PHOEBE chased the early pace on the inside, eased off the inside and was three wide by the quarter pole, angled out off
the turn and failed to gain, bested rest. ZIFFY BUG chased the pace three wide and had no rally. TIME OF OUR LIVES was settled early, four wide by the
quarter pole, came six wide into the lane and was not a threat. PRINCESS STREET was well placed early on the inside and stopped.

BOH'S N O'S was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn and came four wide off the turn and took over leaving the three sixteenths and then
drew away in the final furlong to prove best under a mild drive. BYRD OF EDEN was settled early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the drive and had
some late kick to gain the place award late. SWEET MISCHIEF was a bit fractious in the gate, then stumbled at the start, recovered and went up to duel for
command, then made a two to three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then was headed off the turn by the winner and faded the final furlong, lost place
award late, bested rest. WILD CREATION dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. BERNIE'S DREAMING stalked the early pace three wide, two
wide on the turn and stopped.

CLASSIC UNION pressed the pace and made a three wide bid when ready on the turn to take over and quickly draw clear, then drew off in the lane to prove
much the best while being ridden out. REBEL RULER set the pressured pace to the inside of the winner while racing off the rail, then was headed by the
five sixteenths and had no resistance to that bid, however stayed on to be second best. UNCLE YUDI was four wide into the first turn, settled three to four
wide and came four wide into the lane and was along for the show award, bested rest. SANTO chased the pace on the inside and weakened. CERTAIN
JUSTICE hit gate at the start, angled out on the first turn tp stalk the pace four wide and tired. RIVERBOAT BANDIT failed to respond.
