Footnotes
BONDIVA brushed with RECKLESS KELLY soon after the break, outran that one to take the lead leaving the backstretch, opened up mid way on the turn
and held sway under steady handling. TRITONE GAL , along the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, moved to the two path entering the turn then
gamely chased the winner through the stretch. DIVINE ROMANCE , steadied when shuffled back entering the turn, raced along the inner rail entering the
stretch and failed to menace. RECKLESS KELLY brushed with the winner soon after the start, showed speed along the inner rail, lightly steadied in narrow
quarters entering the turn, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. GRACEFUL ROSE , in the four path between horses
entering the turn, steadily retreated. FREE TO ROAM , five deep on the turn, dropped back. An objection by the rider of DIVINE ROMANCE against
TRITONE GAL for alleged interference entering the turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
COACH RUBE had speed between foes then was nicely rated back off the leaders near the half mile marker, was patiently handled inside rivals mid turn,
came out for room approaching the quarter pole, moved up between rivals soon into the lane then shifted out, closed in under right handed asks, took a
short lead past mid stretch, kept on gamely and got the bob. BREEZY CONNECTION broke a step slow, raced at the back while well off the inside into the
turn, commenced a run outside rivals past the five sixteenths, fanned six wide into the lane, straightened away and closed in outside runners past mid
stretch, lugged in late despite efforts with the left handed crop, drew alongside the winner in the final yards and missed the bob. SPICY MARGARITA drifted
in at the break and was off a beat slow, corrected and moved up outside to prompt the pace, bid to engage the leader past the five sixteenths, moved clear
soon into the lane, dug in when collared in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final strides. MY LOVELY GIRL , off the pace under some
rating and saving ground, eased out past the three eighths then knifed her way between rivals to gain nearing the stretch, shifted four to five wide pursuing
past the three sixteenths then flattened out late. SPEAK YOUR MIND sped up inside to contest the pace, rated back off the leader leaving the half, stalked
mid turn, eased out and moved up two wide into the lane, dropped in to try and loomed in mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on late. GOLDEN CAN was
steadied off foes leaving the five eighths, dropped off the pace, came two to three wide for the drive and lacked a bid. ALAS AND ALACK , in range while off
the rail, was fanned five wide and between runners into the lane, straightened away, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and weakened. BEN'S
SUNNY ISLAND saved ground leaving the five sixteenths, angled out soon into the stretch but failed to respond. LADY IN HEELS was hard sent from the
gate, moved up and took command outside SPEAK YOUR MIND heading to the half, cleared leaving the far turn, was taken on approaching the stretch then
faltered leaving the three sixteenths.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE set the pace in the two path around the turn, remained well off the rail through the stretch and lasted. SHADY MUNNI dropped back
along the inner rail on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. MOSE PERFECT , four deep chasing the pace around the turn,
lacked the necessary late response. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY showed speed, saved ground around the turn, bumped BIG ROWDY DAN when drifting out
near the eighth pole then bothered that one when drifting out in deep stretch. LOOSE GOOSE lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and came up empty. BIG ROWDY DAN , a forward factor in the three path on the turn, was bumped in mid stretch then steadied when
put in tight quarters approaching the finish. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of BIG ROWDY DAN, RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY was
disqualified and placed sixth.

Footnotes
CONTINENTALCONGRES broke a bit slow, quickly recovered and eagerly moved up to the inside of MONEY'S WORTH to take the advantage, set a rated
pace towards the rail, moved well clear mid turn, kept on under left handed asks leaving mid stretch then held firm while hand ridden late. MAVILUS lagged
off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch, made a grinding run and nabbed the place in the final jumps. BOURBON WILDCAT , under a firm hold while
saving ground, edged up to the inside of a rival mid turn, eased out as the closest pursuer entering the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch and kept on
trying between rivals. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO , off the pace and in the clear into the turn, dropped in around the turn, cut the corner under a hustling ride
into the stretch, moved up a bit in mid stretch then flattened out very late. MONEY'S WORTH sped to the early lead, was headed from her inside after a
furlong then stalked, was under pressure chasing the winner three wide into the lane and weakened. MAMA G'S WISH stalked outside a rival, came under
pressure leaving the far turn, had no response to the inside of a foe entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
JOYA DEL SUR set the pace slightly off the inner rail, was challenged on her outside by JACKSON'S DIXIE near the eighth pole then drew off. JACKSON'S
DIXIE chased the winner, bid for the lead near the eighth pole, weakened in the drive and lugged in late. COCKTAIL DREAMING , rated inside horses down
the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and weakened. MISQUILLO , swung to the five path leaving the backstretch,
remained very wide on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and faded. EARLEY ROSE , inside horses leaving the turn, gave way. SHE SO COOL , in
the four path leaving the turn, was never a factor. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , three wide on the backstretch, chased the pace and gave way. WATER WITCH
, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
ONE WAY TRAFFIC quickly went clear, dropped in towards the rail and set a rated pace, responded when asked soon into the lane, kept on under solid
encouragement past the sixteenth pole and held firm. EL DIVINO NINO edged up along the rail nearing the half mile marker, tracked inside foes while in
hand past the five sixteenths, eased out to take aim in upper stretch, gave hard pursuit past the sixteenth marker, flattened out late but was able to save the
place. ENZO broke slowly and hit the gate, regrouped and was taken to rate, steadied behind rivals near the half, advanced to the inside of a runner leaving
the five sixteenths, altered out for the drive and closed gamely. RESERVE JUDGEMENT , urged along off the pace, saved ground into the lane, was
maneuvered outward for the final furlong and finished with interest. BRUDER , four wide early, stalked three deep past the five sixteenths, stayed in touch
pursuing to mid stretch then faded. IMAGINIZED , urged along in the clear leaving the half mile marker, angled out then circled five wide into the stretch,
remained under pressure but failed to generate a solid run. MEDAGOOCH flashed speed then drafted back between runners, dropped to the rail for the run
around the turn, edged up a bit near mid stretch then faded. MANTUA MAN , three wide to contention, tracked between foes nearing the quarter pole,
lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and weakened in the final seventy yards. GET LIKE MIKE , sluggish from the gate, came five wide for the drive and
offered a mild kick. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD , off the pace, saved ground into and through the lane but failed to make an impact. HAD TO HAVE HIM
stalked outside a rival, was under pressure four wide into the stretch and gave way. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN broke slowly and also brushed the gate, raced
greenly at the back into the turn, failed to muster up a response and was eased late.

Footnotes
SEVEN'S ELEVEN came out a bit at the break and brushed with DOUBLE CROWN, quickly corrected and edged up in hand and to the inside of rivals to
poke a head in front with five furlongs remaining, handled outside pressure into the turn, moved clear under confident handling around the turn while about
two wide, responded when shaken up approaching the stretch, opened up a solid lead under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert to the wire.
DOUBLE CROWN , off a bit slow after brushing with the winner, regrouped and rated towards the inside, gained inside foes leaving the far turn, tracked
heading to the lane, eased out and continued on willingly to be second best. SUPER ACCELERATE , three wide between runners into the turn, steadied
and dropped back past the three eighths, angled five wide under a ride into the lane, moved up past mid stretch, drifted in late and churned on. HOLY
SYNCHRONICITY , four deep in range heading to the turn, moved closer three wide past the three eighths, chased into the stretchy, stayed willingly to mid
stretch but flattened out late. JOE , between rivals into the turn, angled in and made a mild run nearing mid stretch, failed to continue on and faded through
the final seventy yards. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF had speed between rivals then rated back to stalk, was under coaxing pursuing between runners past the
five sixteenths, lacked a punch in upper stretch then faded through the final furlong. COFFEEWITHCHRIS , off a bit slow, race off the pace while saving
ground into the turn, swung out for the drive but came up empty. TENAX bobbled at the break, recovered and sped to a brief lead, was headed from his
inside nearing the five eighths, forced the issue outside the winner into the turn, failed to quicken past the five sixteenths and tired. HELLO HOT ROD , four
wide nearing the half, was outrun.
