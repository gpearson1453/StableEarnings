stretch and finished clear for second. MORE MUCHO pressed the pace two wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then faded. POLISHED GEM
away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the three path and weakened late. EGG NOG failed to menace. LA REINA DEL NORTE

gained a narrow advantage late inside the winner but was denied. MALIBU CLASSIC unhurried early, finished with good courage along the rail to be clear
for third. FRONTLINER failed to menace. CHIC N WILBUR with the second flight inside, drifted out on the turn then faded late. SKIDSTREAM well placed,
failed to respond. RHYTHMIC RULER pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half. LONG RAP SHEET stalked the pace three wide

Footnotes
DANZANITEAWAY chased the pace into the turn, engaged the front runner midway on the bend, matched strides two wide the balance of the trip and
proved best in a stiff drive under right handed urging. OH GLORIOUS DAY sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch,
dug in gamely but couldn't handle the winner. HISTORYINTHEMAKING well placed, went evenly in the five path through the stretch. PITY PURCHASE
failed to menace. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK was no factor. LUCKY STUFF stumbled badly at the start and failed to reach contention. SOMETHING LUCKY
raced a wide trip and was never involved. THIRTY SOMETHING stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then gave way readily. COWGIRLS
HUMOR was outrun. LATE BLOOMBOPPER was no threat.
