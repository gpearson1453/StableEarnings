Footnotes
ALOTTACENTS , patiently handled down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted in approaching the
sixteenth pole and dug in. LAST SECOND LOUIE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was hooked at the head of the stretch, battled gamely
and switched to his left lead late. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the far turn, swung outside in upper stretch
and passed tired horses. SWAY'SINMYDNA , four wide the first turn, advanced between horses to take a short lead inside the quarter pole, remained in
contention to mid stretch then tired. SPIRITUAL GHOST , never a factor, passed tired horses late. LONG LIVE NOW , outrun, was three wide around the far
turn. OBOY hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to mid way on the far turn and gave way. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE chased the pace, steadied in traffic
near the three eighths pole and dropped back. CALIFORNIA GHOST was outrun.

Footnotes
BAY STREET , four then three wide to contention into the first turn, dropped in another path and disputed the pace outside TEA ROSE while in hand,
moved clear without much asking leaving the three eighths, responded to encouragement soon into the lane, turned away KRONE to widen past mid stretch
then held firm while kept alert. MAGIC IN THE PARK , coaxed along in the clear and off the contested pace, edged up into the far turn, gave hard chase four
wide into the lane and kept on willingly to nab the place in the final yards. KRONE stalked the leaders three wide, edged up to take closer order nearing the
three eighths, was under a solid ride pursuing into the lane, loomed in mid stretch, was turned away then gave way grudgingly. INTEL AGENT , in a bit tight
soon after the break, rated back off foes then settled about two wide, gained leaving the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, drifted in to be right off the
heels of MAGIC IN THE PARK nearing mid stretch, corrected and shifted out a bit then failed to seriously sustain. EXOTIC CAT lagged back while saving
ground, moved around a tired rival nearing the stretch and offered a belated kick. TEA ROSE , keen early, pulled her way forward and got engaged in a
battle to the inside of the winner, failed to keep pace while under pressure past the five sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. THENDARA'S LOST
had speed to briefly contest the pace, rated off foes into the first turn, stalked while saving ground, failed to kick on mid way through the final turn and tired.
COOKIE BANK , getting out through the backstretch run, was pulled up around the final turn and walked off.

Footnotes
VICTORY BADGE had speed but was content to be rated back off the leaders while saving ground into the first turn, tracked patiently to the inside of a rival
as the top two sparred through the backstretch run and second turn, was deftly maneuvered outward past the three sixteenths to gain a clear run,
responded to left handed asks, forged to command inside the sixteenth pole, edged clear very late then held firm. LORRAINE (FR) broke a beat slow then
settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up to the inside of a foe leaving the three eighths, came out for room in upper stretch, worked between
runners leaving the furlong grounds then kept on gamely to the inside of CARINA NEBULA to nab the place. CARINA NEBULA shadowed the leader while
well in hand through the backstretch run, was asked for run when dueling past the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead inside the three sixteenths pole, fought
on past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. BOLD LOOK settled off the pace and outside a runner, gained some under urging past the five
sixteenths, swung four to five wide for the drive, straightened and churned on. MISS ELLARY , bumped at the break, moved up in hand and went clear into
the first turn, secured the rail to set a pressured pace, battled under a ride from the five sixteenths to mid stretch then weakened late. WILMA FLINTSHIRE
drifted in at the break and bumped with MISS ELLARY, corrected and stalked outside a foe, chased the embattled leaders into the lane then weakened
through the final furlong. CUNDI failed to menace.

MISS GEORGIE hugged the inner rail, set a pressured pace, responded to brisk urging in the drive and drew away. WINKED stalked the pace slightly off
the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and weakened. GENIEINABRIDLE raced in the two path
between horses around the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied late. RIBBONSINHERHAIR , in close quarters at the start, angled six wide in
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TURN ON THE CHARM bumped with BOUND BY DESTINY at the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn and
failed to rally. TOUISSET prompted the pace outside the winner to upper stretch then gave way. SIX THE HARD WAY , four deep on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
QUICK POWER NAP broke slowly, was nudged up between rivals early on then dropped in to rate off the pace, was guided outward leaving the quarter
pole and straightened away to be about six wide, responded to one left handed ask, closed determinedly outside rivals while under a steady hand ride,
forged to command in deep stretch and was edging away at the wire. GIFT OF GAB , bumped at the break, stalked two wide, eased out a bit and was put to
pressure soon into the lane, closed in to engage the leader nearing the eighth pole, took over and spurted away briefly heading to the sixteenth pole, kept
on gamely but could not withstand the winner's charge. GATITA SUAVE rated back from between runners nearing the turn, stalked behind foes mid turn,
swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with effort. TAK E LADY prompted the pace while saving ground, moved through along the rail leaving
mid stretch, loomed but was out kicked late. MEMENTO MI , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, angled to about the seven path nearing mid
stretch, drifted in under right handed asking leaving the sixteenth marker, straightened and finished up willingly between runners. LADY SERENITY drifted
in at the break and bumped GIFT OF GAB, corrected and edged up four wide into the turn to stalk, chased four wide past the quarter pole, remained
prominent past the sixteenth marker then faded late. SASSY BABE was sent to the front, set the pace two wide into the lane, held a tenuous advantage
past the furlong grounds then weakened. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK was outrun. BACKSTREET GAL saved ground without threatening.

FACTOR IT IN , bumped by BACKNTHEWOODS when that one was forced out soon after the break, stalked the pace outside horses, circled the turn three
wide, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way
grudgingly. KARAN'S NOTION patiently handled down the backstretch, raced in the two path mid way on the turn and into the stretch, swung four wide in
mid stretch and rallied gamely. BACKNTHEWOODS , bumped and forced out by SUNRISE JOURNEY soon after the start, prompted the pace outside
JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY and faded in the drive. CYNERGY'S STAR lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and failed to menace. GREELEY
AND BEN , outrun, circled foes on the turn, drifted five wide into the stretch. SUNRISE JOURNEY bumped BACKNTHEWOODS when drifting out soon after
the break, raced along the inner rail on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ANOINT rated kindly while saving ground and in the clear past the five eighths, was guided outward near the five sixteenths, circled four wide with her
advance into the lane, surged past the leader inside the eighth pole then kicked away under a drive. RED PIXIE broke a bit slow, settled off the pace and
outside a rival, came three wide for the drive, advanced past mid stretch then split rivals late to gain the place. UNA LUNA settled off the pace, circled five
wide into the lane and closed steadily. SING SCAT set a pressured pace towards the inside, moved clear around the final turn, was threatened nearing the
lane, kicked back clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, maintained the advantage past the furlong grounds, ceded to the winner soon after then
gradually gave way. SUMMER AT THE SPA , three wide early, edged closer leaving the far turn, gained four deep past the five sixteenths, challenged into
the lane, could not seriously kick on heading to the sixteenth pole and faded. INANNA'S QUEST pulled her way forward between runners early then
emerged in a tracking spot three wide through the backstretch run, was caught between foes nearing the lane and came up empty. COLOR CRUSH lagged
back while saving ground, came out in the drive but failed to menace. GENNIE HIGHWAY rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out near the three
sixteenths but failed to muster up a solid run. TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL saved ground stalking the leaders, was under pressure in upper stretch and gave way.
FEATHERS (IRE) prompted the pace outside SING SCAT, failed to kick on between runners nearing the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SENATOR KELLY broke slowly, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, rallied between rivals in mid stretch, closed outside MOONSET and was
up at the wire. MOONSET , a bit rank at the break, rushed up outside horses leaving the backstretch, sprinted clear mid way on the turn and gave way
grudgingly. WEST STAR , never far back, raced in the three path between horses entering the stretch and finished willingly. THE LAST JUMPSTART , kept
wide on the turn, was five deep into the stretch and passed tired rivals. DOWSING ROD hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. RUN
ROCKY RUN , checked on a rival's heels leaving the backstretch, swung seven deep in upper stretch and showed late interest. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS ,
steadied when shuffled back along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. GREAT KOSTAS , a
forward factor in the three path on the turn, weakened. I KNOW , four deep chasing the pace leaving the turn, weakened. GREAT CALL showed speed near
the inner rail, angled out in upper stretch and gave way.
