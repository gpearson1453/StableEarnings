Footnotes
IM A SOUPERMAN pressed between rivals down the backside, cruised to the lead on the outside at the quarter pole, opened up convincingly in mid-stretch
and comfortably came home for the victory. MATICULANT stalked outside in the two path down the back straight, shifted inwards to the rail commencing a
run with three eighths remaining, was full of run three wide at the quarter pole and easily bested the rest at the finish for the solid runner up finish.
SQUEEZETHESHARMAN had a good position down the backside all alone watching the engaging trio early on, was roused three furlongs from the wire,
closed in late with a good stretch kick and finished up to be a non threatening third at the line. BLUE TANGO prompted three wide on the outside down the
back straight, could not match strides with the top two up front three furlongs from home and willingly finished up in the lane to capture a minor share in the
end. GLORIOUS REVENGE assumed command down the backstretch, offered no resistance to the winner making a move at the quarter pole and faltered
on the rail at the furlong marker. DRILLHALL was away slowly on the break to trail by many, showed some energy picking up rivals on the rail running
around the bend, could not overcome that poor start and made little impression through the stretch. DELIRIO stalked on the rail in the beginning, could not
quicken with others through the turn and was not a presence in the run down the lane. PERSEVERE was void of speed down the backside having one beat
which was the slow starter, offered little response when scrubbed on in midturn and could not get involved in the stretch drive. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE settled
in midfield on the outside in the early going, was bearing out through the turn, basically was eased with five sixteenths to run and galloped down the stretch
crossing the finish.

Footnotes
REINS OF PURPLE was unhurried trailing in the early stages, improved smartly four deep finding a good rhythm down the backside, loomed four wide
around runners on the final turn and wore down the leaders through the lane to get up right at the wire in a well timed stretch run. MOON POOL tracked the
frontrunner on the rail on the first turn, took closer order to press the pacesetter outside at the half, dueled with rivals on each side with five sixteenths to run,
determinedly surged to the lead with a sixteenth left and just missed in a gutsy effort losing the nod at the wire. SERENADING HALL was content to track
three wide on the outside on the first turn, prompted the pace three wide outside rivals at the half, poked her head in front between rivals at the quarter pole,
battled stubbornly down the stretch but was outgamed in the final sixteenth. KEY STROKE stalked three wide on the outside having one beat on the first
turn, stalked in the third flight in the three path between horses down the backstretch, was hard ridden three wide midpoint around the final bend, had a
chance for a piece of the prize four wide straightening out for the drive and showed some late interest to settle on the fringes in the end. TOTAL BETTY
travelled between foes in mid-pack, was tucked in on the rail behind the front trio with a half left to run, angled outside when urged for more with five
sixteenths left to go, was in range in the three path in upper stretch and evened out down the lane. TURF AND SURF was unchallenged taking this field into
the first turn, maintained the lead with a narrow advantage four furlongs from the wire, was headed outside midway on the far turn, gave way when steadied
mildly inside the quarter pole and yielded in mid stretch. MIZZ GEMMA stalked close the back with runners on each side, closed the gap down the back
straight to be in the thick of things in midfield at the half, was asked for more run three eighths from home and had little run to offer in the stretch drive.
MENAGERIE stalked near the rear on the rail, was shuffled back to trail on the fence in a tightly packed bunch at the half, made no headway running on the
final turn and could not get into contention driving to the finish line.

AMBER LIGHT took control from the onset, was uncontested while opening up in hand throughout the turn and was much the best dominating down the
stretch easily extending the advantage crossing the finish line. SERENADE AT SEA tracked the frontrunner down the backside, was urged to go after the
winner on the turn, but could not close the gap and chased the winner in vain running to the wire and comfortably was the second best on this day. CANDY
STREET was allowed to settle trailing inside in the early going, progressed well on the fence through the backstretch, rallied on the rail passing foes on the
turn and finished up mildly down the lane to hold for third in a strung out field at the finish. GLENHOLME hopped slightly on the break, stalked five deep
near the back of the pack outside rivals down the backside, circled four wide outside foes three eighths from the wire, swung out widest in the six path at the
top of the lane, levelled out some in mid-stretch but held on for a small piece of the prize in the end. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS settled near the rear three wide
between foes at the half, began to pick up the pace three wide in midturn, was in range for a share in the five path turning for home and lost the duel for the
minor award in the stretch. MIGHTY PELE stalked inside in the third flight down the back straight, was scrubbed on three furlongs left to run, could not
maintain position running around the bend and showed little effort driving to the finish line. WILD CONVERSATION travelled near the rear in the two path
with foes on each side, could not match strides with others commencing a run three eighths from the wire and had little to show on the fence in the stretch
run. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS stalked on the third flight three wide outside runners down the backside, offered a brief run from the three furlong marker
through the the top of the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NIKKI NOOTS was unhurried early on to race off the early pace, asked to move up three to four wide around the far turn and finished strongly to edge clear
late while racing from the outside of rivals. LANGSTAFF ROAD rated along under a hold early, moved up to challenge from the inside nearing the five
sixteenth pole, dug in between three deep in the drive and kept on gamely to the wire. MO TOURIST settled off the early pace, moved up from the inside
around far turn through the stretch and finished willilngly to the wire. INFAMOUS COVERT dropped back off the early pace, ridden along three wide near
the three eighths pole, took aim four to five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. MUSKOKA GIANT raced mid pack early on, was three deep
around the far turn through the upper lane, angled near the quarter pole to race from the outside and lacked a rally. BE LIKE CLINT set a pressured pace
two deep from the outside of rival, kicked well clear midway on the far turn and faded the final eighth of a mile. OCTOBER FROST settled off the early
going, hard ridden near the three eighths pole four deep and lacked a rally. JMR PURE SENSATION raced four to five wide around both turns and had no
response. EXULT stalked the pace from the outside of foes and faded in the drive. CONFUSING prompt the early leader from the inside, was done early
and eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANSELMO stalked in the third flight three wide outside runners down the back straight, was ridden to go on between horses midway on the far turn, swung
out with momentum in the six path at the top of the stretch, drifted in slightly under right handed encouragement nearing the sixteenth pole and got up for
the measured win. ROBITAILLE was on the rail part of the tracking trio down the backstretch, waited patiently on the fence around the final bend, was in the
mix in the two path straightening out for the stretch drive, drifted out some under left handed urging in mid-stretch, ran on well in deep stretch but could not
match strides with the winner late. GROOM LAKE trailed the field down the backstretch, began to pick up rivals running inside at the quarter pole, swung
outside six wide for the drive to the wire and closed in gamely late to capture third money at the finish line. STRONGER TOGETHER prompted the issue
outside early, was content to shadow the pacesetter down the backside, came under a hard ride between horses midway on the far turn, continued to battle
on being in the hunt in three path at the top of the lane, was steadied in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth pole and recovered late to get up for a minor role
at the end. AIR FORCE RESERVE was under a snug hold dictating terms comfortably up front down the backside, continued going easily up top rounding
the final turn, was clinging to the lead on the fence with a furlong to go, weakened late and was swallowed up by runners outside in the final seventy yards.
BARTICA travelled on the inside stalking in the third flight down the backstretch, tried to start a rally shifted just off the fence with five sixteenths to go, could
not quicken with the eventual winner who was rallying with him outside at the quarter pole and showed some interest down the lane to offering a mild finish
in deep stretch. BILL NEEDLE travelled in the second flight between foes watching the front two down the back straight, began to inch closer to the leaders
when coaxed three wide at the three eighths marker, loomed in the four path with runners on either side turning for home, could not find another gear late
and wilted at the furlong marker. C R HOT SHOT tracked three wide on the outside in the second flight down the backstretch, was nudged four wide three
furlongs from the line, could not offer a run on the final turn and was empty for the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 STRONGER TOGETHER
AGAINST #6 ANSELMO IN THE STRETCH NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
FLAWLESS RULER was content to be alone watching the front end speedster set the quick fractions down the backside, patiently began to reel in the
pacesetter around the bend in the final turn, pounced to the lead in mid-stretch outside and drew off comfortably for the win. VICTORIA'S CHIEF was
brushed outside at the start, settled in mid-pack two wide on the outside down the backstretch, waited behind a trio of runner on the far turn, angled four
wide for the drive, burst between horses nearing the sixteenth pole and closed belatedly to be a non threatening second. LESLIE CHOW stalked near the
rear having two beat down the backside, made an early move at the half picking up horses, rallied four wide circling foes on the far turn to be in the hunt in
the for path turning for home, could not sustain the run and was outkicked for second money in deep stretch. COLONEL MUSTARD settled in third place in
a strung out field down the backstretch, came under a vigorous ride between foes in midturn, continued to battle in the two path with runners on each side
for a share of the prize turning for home and was one paced in deep stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. SILVER SMOKE was sent to the lead into the
first turn, opened up to a commanding advantage under brisk fractions down the back straight, was asking for the wire shortening stride on the fence in
upper stretch and emptied out at the sixteenth pole. ARAMOS brushed inside rival on the break, co-trailed inside with four furlongs to run, made little impact
when roused three furlongs from the finish and passed tired runners in the stretch. MIDWAY MISCHIEF travelled in midfield on the rail down the backside,
edged closer inside to be part of the tracking pack at the half, was urged on the fence keeping pace with others outside in the final turn, found little in the
drive and retreated on the rail at the furlong pole. KILLARY co-trailed on the outside at the half, was asked but offered little response throughout the far turn
making no gain and could not get interested in the drive down the stretch.

Footnotes
HICKSY prompted the pace inside in the beginning, switched outside at the half mile marker, took over control midway around the bend, was getting out
even under right handed encouragement at the quarter pole, shortened stride while on the wrong lead through the stretch but stubbornly prevailed at the
wire. MONSTRODAMOUS had a good position watching the front pair down the backside, was hard ridden chasing the winner at the quarter pole, angled in
to the two path not giving up at the top of the lane and stubbornly battled to the finish, just missing in the end with a solid effort. UPSTART GENTLEMAN
was allowed to settle trailing down the backside, could see the field starting to lengthen stride through the turn, opted for the overland route when coming up
to fading runners at the quarter pole, swung outside widest in the eight path driving to the wire, was laying in not switching leads at the furlong pole, finally
straightened out late under left handed urging and closed strongly in deep stretch for third money. WENJACK was five deep on the outside near the back of
the pack at the half, rallied four wide picking up horses with three eighths to go, swung outside in the eight path to be in the mix for share at the top of the
stretch and gamely finished up just losing the battle for third nearing the wire. CARMENOOTZ stalked near the back on the inside, improved position at the
half, crept closer on the turn in the third flight inside, shifted out in the five path with a chance for a share driving to the finish and ran on willingly to the wire.
TRANQUILITY BASE was unhurried down the backstretch having one beat with a half remaining, put in a mild fence run through the turn when roused, had
a chance for a minor share in the two path at the furlong marker but stalled inside in the final seventy yards. BOCELLI stalked near the rear on the outside
down the back straight, offered a mild run between horses in the three path around the turn and showed some late interest in the final furlong but could not
get involved at the wire. BIG INVESTMENT stumbled badly on the break, had one beat in the early going, was urged down the backside improving on the
fence for better inside position, continued to rally on the rail through the turn, shifted outside to the four path to be in the mix for a share turning for home,
could not find more late and faltered between rivals at the furlong marker. BEYOND BORDERS stalked between runners in mid-pack, was roused outside in
the third flight around the bend making little progress, shifted out to the six path for the stretch run and yielded at the furlong marker. COMMANDER TOM
assumed command on the outside in the beginning, was collared outside three furlongs out, offer no resistance to the winner and backed away through the
field on the fence in mid-stretch.
