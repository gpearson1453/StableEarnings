the stretch to win as much the best while taken in hand late. HEART OF THE BEAST unhurried early, rallied in the six path into the stretch then was no
match for the winner while well clear for second. HOLY SKULL pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead briefly, kept on along the rail into
the stretch and weakened late. DUDE'S MIST DATE failed to menace. RUNNETH OVER well placed, was through after a half. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL bore
in at the start bumping the winner, set a pressured pace along the inside to the seven sixteenths pole then stopped.

HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS sped to the lead three wide midway on the clubhouse turn, set all the pace while getting slow fractions, turned back a strong bid
from the runner up at the top of the stretch and drew clear late under right handed urging. STORMIN MELLY never far back, loomed boldly two wide at the
top of the stretch, matched strides past the furlong marker and was denied by the winner while well clear for second. PEARLINTHEROUGH chased the
winner early, dropped back before a half then lacked the needed response. CONTESSINA had a brief lead soon after the start, remained within striking
distance for six furlongs then flattened out.

proved best under mild left handed urging. SPEEDY MOBILE away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, dug in gamely along the rail then
couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. OHIO EAGLE chased the pace three then two wide and finished best of the rest in the four path. GOLD N
SILVER stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE well placed, failed to respond. RUMBLE STRIP RON was
no factor. SERVE REVENGE COLD failed to menace. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

MOBIL MEMORY broke in full stride to set all the pace off the rail in the four then five paths, turned back a bid from the runner up on the turn then drew off
through deep stretch under right handed urging and won as much the best. CANELA FINA away alertly, stalked the early pace three wide, offered a strong
bid outside the winner nearing the quarter pole then was no match while second best. MOST ADORABLE pressed the early pace along the inside and went
evenly. CABARET FLEUR saved ground and lacked the needed response. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN failed to menace. SHE'S A BIG GIRL was no threat.
MI CANCION steadied along the rail near the five eighths pole and was no factor.
