Footnotes
HEDWIG brushed with outer rival at the start, stalked from inside, tipped out into the lane, challenged from outside, took over at the sixteenth pole and held
late. DARK VINTAGE (IRE) stalked between rivals to the turn, lacked room behind LAWLESS WORLD and angled in past the quarter pole, rallied along the
fence but ran out of time. ALWAYS ON CAY lagged behind early, trailed on the inside through the turn, angled out and rallied for a fast closing third.
INVINCIBLE brushed with inner rival at the start, dueled from inside to the turn, put away outer rival past the five-sixteenths pole, confronted by a winner in
upper stretch, resisted to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. LAWLESS WORLD dueled outside INVINCIBLE up the backstretch, could not match strides
with that rival midway around the turn, chased two then three wide into the lane and weakened. DES DOIGTS stalked three deep into the turn, chased two
wide into the lane and also weakened.

Footnotes
PILOT COMMANDER away quickest to take the front, dueled from outside with E J WON THE CUP, inched ahead on the turn then cleared late on the
bend, put to right handed urging in the lane and inched away in deep stretch. IMAGINATION broke a step slow and bothered by outer rival shortly after the
start, stalked the top pair into and around the turn, asked three wide into the lane, loomed from outside but was turned away by the winner. E J WON THE
CUP dueled for the lead from inside, fought with the winner to the quarter pole, chased along the rail into the lane, flattened in the furlong grounds but
churned on for a clear third. BRITISH ISLES broke in to bother rivals, chased outside a rival four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the
bend and faded. DEAL EM broke a bit slow and lost his path at the start, chased five deep up the backstretch, remained wide to the stretch and had little left
for the drive. CLASSIC ALPHIE was off a bit slow to begin, climbed a bit and dropped back, trailed two then three wide on the turn and failed to make an
impact.

three path on the far turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole, dueled with MOCHA GRANDE and got outkicked. PINK WHITNEY
broke a bit slow, traveled two wide near the back, spun three wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. FLIGHT TO QUALITY (FR) off
a bit slow as well, moved inside racing towards the rear, came two wide into the lane and offered a mild response to round out the superfecta. TIANMA
fractious and popped the gate open prior to the start, went up to duel from outside, fought between at the eight pole and weakened. BRAND NEW DREAM
settled in the two path then moved inside, coaxed along into the far turn, moved into range around that bend while continuing to save ground but flattened
out in the stretch. ELLIE MOORE (IRE) showed early speed then started to pull and became rank early, dueled inside TIANMA for the lead, battled around
the far turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the late stages. ENNEREILLY (IRE) broke a bit slow, rank early while lugging out, went three deep into
the clubhouse turn, continued to fight the rider around the bend, lugged out and was eased on the far turn, pulled up in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FLATTERWITHJEWELS stalked five deep early, four deep around the turn, collared the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and dug in to drive past late.
EQUILOVE (IRE) brushed leaving the gate, dueled briefly then cleared up the backstretch, showed the way a bit off the rail through the turn, led clear in the
final furlong, challenged by FLATTERWITHJEWELS in deep stretch and yielded late. NEVER SWAY brushed with outer rival then bumped with inner rival
shortly after in the early going, stalked three deep between rivals into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend still between foes, lost a bit of
ground then steered out and finished willingly to gain the show honors. SPOILED ROTTEN dueled briefly for command then chased the leader past the
half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn and failed to produce a bid. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL chased four deep early, three deep around the bend and
also lacked a bid. FLAT OUT JOY was off a bit slow to begin, moved into range up the backstretch, chased five wide around the bend and weakened.
TROPICANA GIRL chased along the rail, got shuffled and steadied at the three-eighths pole, angled out and came seven wide into the stretch and could not
rally. DRIZELLA stalked between rivals then got put in tight and checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and could not
rally. TAPIT DOUX bumped with outside rival early, chased two wide into the turn, steered out steadily to the six path on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
KISSED BY FIRE brushed rival leaving the gate, set the pace off the rail under pressure from QUEEN MOLOTOV early, cleared early on the turn and
angled to the inside, lightly coaxed into the stretch, drifted out while still clear through the lane and proved best. QUEEN MOLOTOV prompted the pace from
outside, went four wide into the turn, chased the winner three then two wide around the bend, finished willingly to secure the place.
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ tracked five wide into the turn, moved down to the three path around the bend, then finished evenly in the final furlong for the
show. SHE'S GOT A WAY brushed by the winner at the start, stalked outside a rival in the two path and could not rally. ALTERNATE ROCK saved ground
off the pace, tipped out in the lane and failed to menace. NEW COLLECTION (GB) broke a bit slow, trailed two wide into the turn, moved out in the lane and
was not a factor. SECRETS TOLD stalked along the rail into and around the bend, then weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
HABEAS broke in then shifted out in the beginning, sped clear and set the tone early, remained clear into the stretch and held safely under urging. MEMES
bumped leaving the gate, drifted in and bumped rival early, chased three deep up the backstretch, closest in aim two wide into the lane, chased to no avail
through the final furlong but was clearly second best. BOLTS DESTINY bumped in the beginning with MEMES then bumped again in the early going,
forwardly placed two wide leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, flattened in the final furlong but managed
to save the show. DONTTESTYOURLUCK chased between early, rounded the bend two then three wide, churned on through the lane but failed to threaten.
MY BROTHER MIKE chased outside a trio of rivals early on, remained wide through the bend, spun four wide into the drive and weakened. DIAMONDS
PREFERRED bumped outer rival at the start, steered out wide while trailing the field, navigated the turn in the five path and was not a factor. NON TOXIC
chased from inside and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
DOLCE ZEL (FR) broke through the gate and was reloaded, stalked in the two path, bid three deep on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held
safely. YERWANTHERE (IRE) traveled two wide then between rivals on the first turn, pushed on around the second bend, spun three wide into the lane, put
in a mild late bid but could not reach the winner. NADETTE (FR) broke a bit slow, steered to the inside settling at the back, saved ground into the lane,
moved out in the drive, came with a late run and gained the show. LINDA'S GIFT chased along the inside then started to pull and became rank early, settled
in a stalking position in the middle stages, waited for room on the far turn, lacked room entering the stretch, found room between rivals and split foes
approaching the eighth pole, finished willingly but needed to find more late. TURNERLOOSE sat off the pace in the two path, raced between foes on the
backstretch, angled four wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. GANADORA broke through the gate, was caught by the outrider and reloaded, showed
speed with a rival to the outside into the first turn then took control around the bend, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged into the far turn, dueled
to the stretch and weakened down the lane. LUCKY FOR YOU raced up close from outside early, bid outside GANADORA into the far turn, dueled and led
two wide into the stretch, overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. FREE AND HUMBLE fractious in the gate, broke a
step slow, traveled two then three wide at the back early, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and weakened. VERY SCARY
stumbled leaving the gate, keen early along the inside, remained along the rail on the second bend then entered the stretch two wide and had little left for
the drive.

vied three deep through both turns, took over midstretch but was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. COWBOY MIKE stalked on the inside, two
wide into the lane, finished willingly and gained the show. HARD TO FIGURE chased four then three wide, moved out in the lane still chasing within striking
distance but could not summon the needed late kick. DEVIL BE ME vied between rivals for command, battled through the far turn, inched ahead in upper
stretch, overtaken in midstretch and weakened late. WILL BE vied for the lead along the inside, fought back through the far turn and into the stretch, then
weakened in the late stages. COOL PAPA G raced up close five then four deep on the first turn, chased four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MUCINO
hopped at the start, chased five then six wide on the first turn near the back, remained wide through the second bend, came six wide into the lane and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
MASTERMIND sprinted to the front and moved inside, patiently ridden through the far turn, asked in upper stretch and moved off the inside and held gamely
in the end. HEIR (FR) traveled outside a rival near the back, angled out past the quarter pole and came five wide into the lane, closed well and won the bob
for second. EGOMANIA sat off the pace in three path, raced outside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, came with a late run but got outnodded for second.
RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) got put in tight between rivals at the start, tucked inside near the back, angled out into the lane and summoned a mild response to
earn a minor award. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) settled inside, roused in upper stretch, remained on the inside in the lane and lacked a rally. BIRTH OF
COOL trailed on the inside, tipped two wide and steadied behind rivals into the lane, angled in then back out only to lack room midstretch and was ridden
out once in the clear. BRUTTO stalked three deep then outside a rival, driven three wide into the lane but lacked the needed response. COMRADERY (IRE)
stalked from inside and became rank early, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch and weakened. WARRENS CANDY MAN chased in the two
path then between rivals and came up empty in the lane. PARK CITY was closest in pursuit through both turns in the two path and retreated in the stretch
run.
