held sway late to prove best under a drive. U U STAR was well placed on the inside, shuffled back on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and
closed well to just miss. BEYOND THE BEND stalked the early pace three wide, then got out a tad and was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide
into the lane and ran on but needed more. FEDERAL CASE was settled back early, advanced two wide on the turn, then had a mild late rally. HASHTAG
WINNING was bumped at the start, reserved early, saved ground on the turn, then finished willingly on the inside. CHAMPION BY DESIGN tracked the

LAUGHING BOY stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid by the quarter pole to duel for command, then gained command by the furlong
marker and kept a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. EGOT A POKER FACE rushed up the inside to set the pace, then dueled for command
with the winner by the quarter pole, dug in gamely but could not keep up with the winner while clearly second best. STRAWBERRY TREAT was reserved
early, advanced two wide on the turn and angled out off the turn and finished well. WISH FOR PEACE was settled back early, came five wide into the lane
and had a belated rally. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH stalked the pace four wide and was ridden along on the far turn and weakened. TRA LAD was unruly in the
gate, stumbled at the start, chased the pace on the inside and tired. WILL E SUTTON was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and
stopped.

MAJESTIC CREED pressed the early pacesetter two wide, made a bid when ready leaving the quarter pole and drew off in the drive to prove much the
best, ridden out. KNICKERSINATWIST set a pressured pace on the inside, then proved no match for the winner in the lane, while staying on to be second
best. DOCTOR ABBIE chased the pace on the inside, then came two wide into the lane and finished willingly to hold on to the show award. SWAN POINT
was settled back early, advanced on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the final spot in the superfecta. FOXY JUNIOR
was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. SOFIA'S SECRET passed the tiring rivals. KILIMANJARA was four wide into the first turn, chased the
pace on the outside, made a mild bid three wide on the far turn but tired. BELLA PRIMA was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace three wide, then
was two wide on the far turn and tired. WILL OR WON'T was settled early and stopped. CHARM ALARM checked into the first turn while four wide, then
was not a factor.

then was hand ridden to the wire to crush foes and win much the best. BACK FORTY was settled early, advanced two wide on the turn, came four wide into
the lane and finished well to be second best. CHUBLIN stalked the early pace, then dropped to the inside on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn

Footnotes
QUEEN'S DREAM was reserved early on the outside, advanced three wide on the turn, angled out and closed well on the outside and got up in time to
prove best, driving. MOONSAFE was well rated early, saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn, led by the sixteenth marker but was
denied late to just miss. POSITIVE FORCE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear and racing off the rail, then came three wide into the lane and
drifted about and was outfinished. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT stalked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out. EARLY
FROST was reserved early between rivals, then lacked the needed stretch winning bid. WILL TAKE ROSES was reserved early, four wide by the quarter
pole and came wide into the lane and had no rally. BILLIEANNE was off slowly, saved ground and was not a factor.
