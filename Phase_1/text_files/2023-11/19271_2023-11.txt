Footnotes
BONDED tracked three wide, made an initial run at the leader nearing the lane, stayed on after being repelled while shifted four wide, came back under left
handed asks through the final furlong, took command in deep stretch then narrowly prevailed. SPONSORED , four deep early, edged up leaving the half
and dropped in a path to pursue, was put to an all out drive mid turn, angled out to about the five path inside the quarter pole, sustained a steady run to
engage the winner from his outside in deep stretch and just missed. KBCYA LATER grabbed command early and set the pace two wide while handling
some inside pressure, moved clear leaving the far turn and was rated along, turned away the first bid from BONDED approaching the stretch, was roused
clear soon after, kept on leaving mid stretch, switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. SWEET ASTA , bumped at the
break, drafted in and was taken to rate, raced inside rivals heading to the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, advanced between runners in mid stretch,
had his rider stand up leaving the sixteenth marker then closed the gap while on his own courage. TOUCH CODE prompted the pace to the inside of the
leader, saw that one clear after a half, stayed on to chase while saving ground the rest of the way but faded in the final furlong. BOCA GUY lagged back,
swung seven wide for the drive and offered a belated response. FOOD FOODIE , four wide between foes, made a mild run into the lane but failed to
sustain. COCO SHELL , three wide between rivals early, dropped back some around the turn, swung six wide for the drive but lacked a rally. SURF CITY
GOLD , bumped at the break, raced two wide between rivals and failed to respond. HONOR MY WORLD lost ground five wide and faded.

Footnotes
IRISH WARLOCK , nudged from the gate, advanced to the inside of WIN NO JOKE and poked a head in front heading to the five eighths, set a rated pace
while handling outside pressure, moved clear leaving the three eighths, responded and opened up under a drive past the three sixteenths then cruised
home through the final yards. ICE COLD FROSTY prompted the pace while saving ground, saw the leaders get away leaving the far turn and dropped back
a few lengths, came under a serious ride past the five sixteenths, remained towards the rail through the lane and came back on to gain the place. BOLD
HONOR , four to five wide, churned on and was along for the show. LIGHTNING LAD , three deep in range nearing the turn, gave chase three wide around
the turn and into the lane then faded some in the final furlong. FEDERAL OFFENSE , between rivals stalking the early pace, shifted in when outpaced
around the turn, remained inside through the lane and offered a mild kick. WIN NO JOKE led early then was headed with five and a half furlongs to go,
prompted the pace outside the winner into and around the turn, gave willing chase to mid stretch then faded. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE , off the pace
while saving ground, swung six wide for the drive but lacked a rally. STORMY FIRE came in at the break and bumped with a rival, lagged back inside,
angled out in upper stretch but failed to menace. CRAZY ODDS , bumped and pinched back at the break, saved ground and was outrun. MY BIG DRAMA ,
bumped at the break, raced off the pace into the turn then faded through the drive.

Footnotes
FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL raced in the two path on the turn, rallied between horses, gained a short lead near the sixteenth pole then bumped ALOTTACENTS
about sixty yards from the finish when drifting out. ALOTTACENTS lacked speed, circled the turn four deep, challenged for the lead outside horses near the
eighth pole and was bothered in the drive. CAVALRY COMMAND chased the early pace, took a two wide lead on the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole
and weakened. APPENDAGE saved ground around tehe turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and faded. SUPERSTITIEUX , three wide chasing the
pace to the stretch, gave way. DREAM OF BLESSINGS , four wide on the turn, was never a factor. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , a forward factor in the three
path on the turn, gave way. BODE LYNX was outrun. OILER showed speed along the inner rail, tired leaving the turn and drifted very wide in upper stretch.
VOTETHEMALLOUT faltered on the turn and was eased. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of ALOTTACENTS, FUN LOVIIN
CRIMINAL was disqualified and placed second.

a sixteenth remaining, switched over to her left lead and prevailed. GO SHERRY GO broke a step slow, regrouped and advanced towards the rail, chased
while saving ground mid turn, came out leaving mid stretch and closed steadily to gain. K KAKE POP broke a step slow, then was bumped and pinched
back, recovered and settled well back while saving ground, angled four wide gathering some momentum into the stretch, worked between runners leaving
the three sixteenths, shifted out while a bit green then closed willingly to bridge the gap. SIX PACK SENORITA sped clear early, set the pace two wide into
the lane, dug in when collared in mid stretch, battled past the sixteenth marker then faded vey late. SUSAN'S MULE , a bit unruly behind the gate, broke
outward and bumped with K KAKE POP, corrected and edged up three deep, made a mild run into the lane to have aim, pursued past mid stretch but came
up empty in the final seventy yards. NEXT GIRL , off the pace while four wide outside rivals, came five wide for the drive and churned on with some effort.
KATIE'S BRAT drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, raced three wide between runners leaving the far turn, moved up some past mid stretch then
flattened out. BREAKING RULES , between rivals chasing the early pace, raced two wide mid turn and gave way. PEACH TEA lagged back, angled five
wide into the stretch but failed to muster up a rally. MISSY BOSS , bumped at the break, rated off the pace, dropped in to saved ground, cut the corner into
the lane and weakened.

MONDAY MORNING QB , up close in the two path around the turn, gained the lead outside GOING TO THE LEAD near the sixteenth pole and was edging
clear under urging. GOING TO THE LEAD gained the lead along the inner rail entering the far turn, remained in front in mid stretch and gave way
grudgingly. NORTH HIGHLAND , not an early factor, raced in the two path around the turn, angled to the four path in mid stretch and rallied. SUPREME
LAW saved ground around the turn, was taken to the three path in mid stretch and flattened out between horses. JOHN THE BEAR showed speed outside
GOING TO THE LEAD, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. SUMO gave way on the turn and floated five wide turning for home. MAGIC MULE ,
four wide on the turn, was no factor. ZATIP faltered on the turn.

BROTHER CONWAY disputed the pace outside TOP BOSS, moved to a slim lead under asking approaching the stretch, continued to battle past mid
stretch, went clear under left handed asks with a sixteenth to go and held firm. TOP BOSS bumped with an outer rival at the break, was sent inside to the
lead, set a pressured pace under coaxing, dueled around the turn and into the lane, could not quite match strides leaving mid stretch, shifted out late and
stayed on well. BACKNTHEWOODS , four wide outside rivals, gave hard chase into the lane and continued with effort while narrowly saving the show. OUR
PRIDE N JOY , off the pace while saving ground, edged up to the inside of rivals leaving the eighth pole and churned on. KADRI broke a step slow,
recovered and moved up to chase, angled three wide nearing the lane and gave way grudgingly. CHILDERS , bumped at the break, steadied soon after,
angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked a solid run. BLESSED ARION , three wide between rivals into the turn, came up empty.
GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) , off the pace and climbing a bit nearing the turn, raced five wide in upper stretch, shifted in through the final furlong and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
THENCOMEMORNING made the early lead, was well clear near the inner rail on the turn, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and was kept to her business
in the drive. GILDA'S GIRL , outside the winner around the turn, chased that one and flattened out. LOOKING FOR WATER hugged the inner rail around
the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. HONOR THE TRUTH lacked speed, was four wide on the turn, drifted out
entering the stretch and passed tired foes. STAGE CALL advanced three deep leaving the turn then tired. DESTINED TO DANCE , four deep on the turn,
was no factor. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT , outrun, raced five wide leaving the turn and was floated wider. CUSH EFFECT stumbled at the break and hugged the
inner rail on the turn. JUDGEMENT TIME raced along the inner rail on the turn and gave way. SHAYMYNAME faltered and was eased.
