and finished gamely to the wire. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK was off slowly, raced off the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened
out while racing from the outside. I AM THAT I AM stalked the pace from the outside, hard ridden four deep nearing the three eighths pole and raced even
with no late bid. OFFSHORE AFFAIR set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened in the drive. AHSAD was pulling early near the rail,

NOTION TO TAPIT stalked the pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. TOUCH CODE vied for
the early lead from the outside of two deep, dug in and held the place position late. SUMMER ASH was off a step slow, raced off the early going, swung
wide into the upper stretch and rallied willingly to the wire. CALL ME MAESTRO raced off the early going, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and
had not enough while racing from the far outside. THE BEARRISH ONE settled off the early pace setters, was seven deep near the three sixteenths pole,
shifted in through the stretch drive and raced even late with no closing run. AWKWARD PAUSE void of early speed, hard ridden through the far turn, fanned
wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. STARSTREET was off slowly, sent along after the poor start, raced mid pack down the backstretch, was
five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. EDWARD MADDEN pressed the early leader near the rail and gave way. PAPA JIMMY was
coaxed along from the outside of foes and faded.

STEELE MONEY tracked the early pace from the inside, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, surged from the outside and just got up under strong
handling. O T C WIZ showed good early speed along the inside, overtaken early down the backstretch, dug in deep stretch and just missed in a game effort.
CARICO stalked the pace racing between down the backstretch, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. TUCKER
ROAD broke awkwardly, raced off the early going, raced five wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. KERANOS rated four deep down the
backstretch, ridden along nearing the three eighths pole and weakened in the drive. TAPATERM was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack after the
poor start, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. SIDNEY'S BID stalked the pace between rivals and faded. MEAN TWEETS bobbled at
the start, unhurried early on, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. CASEY'S LAW was off slowly, hustled early to take
command from the outside and tired readily.

SKY VICTORY set a pressured early pace along the inside and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. WISE MISS dropped back to race mid pack
early, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and rallied for the place position narrowly. SHINING SPIRIT pressed two deep from the outside of rival
and weakened a bit in the drive. CHA CHA CHUKKA dropped back off the early pace, raced four to five wide around the far turn and was outkicked in the
drive. NAMORA raced five to six wide outside of rivals around the far turn and had no late rally while racing from the far outside. ARCH STREET was off
slowly, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. MISS AMAZING coaxed along two deep and faded.
