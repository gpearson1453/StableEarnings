Footnotes
CATHERINE WHEEL prompted the pace three then two wide advancing to take command near the quarter pole when placed to coaxing, swung three then
two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. HELCIA chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. BACKSTRETCH ROSE three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. PARADISE LANE
showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside under some pressure from CATHERINE WHEEL to the outside, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. WAKE UP LAUREN coaxed from the gate, chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. PHILANTHROPY chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINTRACK was hustled hard from the start, showed speed between horses, was taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths then dropped off the pace,
chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then bumped with a foe while taking over into upper stretch and drew away under steady
urging. BRONX BOMBER dropped back while urged along, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then angled further
out and safely secured the place. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) showed speed then dropped off the pace near the nine-sixteenths, moved out late on the
backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, bumped with rivals into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened while able to get the show. KING JAMES settled off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the five path through the turn
and tired. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the outside of two foes, moved clear while dropping in around the nine-sixteenths,
vied in the two path on the turn, came under heavy threat late on that bend, bumped with an opponent while losing the advantage into upper stretch and
gave way. HANDSOME CAT broke a bit slow then dropped back, moved in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with TIZZY IN THE SKY to her inside widening away as a pair from the rest of
the field down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and continued the head to head fracas through
to the finish in game fashion to prevail at the end. TIZZY IN THE SKY coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path to the inside of the aforementioned
foe clinging to command while shaking away as a pair from the rest of the rivals, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was headed for command near the eighth pole, battled on gamely to the wire but was ultimately staved off.
MORNING MATCHA chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while running on clear for the show honors. BELLAMORE stumbled at the start pecking the ground for a
stride or two before recovering, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then five then four wide thereafter, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home and angled out six wide into upper stretch, then offered no response. FIRELINE three wide through the opening bend, chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped six wide into upper stretch, tired.

command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish to preserve the place
honors. DUCKPHAT chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven to eight wide at the top of the stretch,

prior to loading last of the field, got coaxed from the gate and showed the way in hand two to three wide, came under coaxing when under challenge for the
initial time with five-sixteenths to go, yielded the front swinging three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

THE PADDOCK PASTOR broke a bit slow and was last to commence, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved near the back, went three wide on the
far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, rallied outside while remaining on his left-lead, closed fast to get the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole
then moved clear under a strong hand-ride in a good debut. INSTAMATIC was taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the
pace on the outside without the benefit of cover, was given his cue in the three path on the final turn, made a bid in the four path into the stretch then took a
short lead, led under a drive until just before the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. CHARGING FAST went three wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. FROZEN
FOUR was reserved in the two then three path, came between foes late on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position. HARD PAR
raced in the three path on the first turn, attended the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, bumped with a foe into the stretch, battled
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. SWEET TONE settled on the inside, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back to the
inside near the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. ROB THE BANK was well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted three wide into upper stretch,
chased into the final furlong and came up empty. BROWN DON'T STOP traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused
four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. DILLON was well placed just off the pace in the two path, raced between
horses under urging on the far turn and capitulated. DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set a joint pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the final turn, bumped with an opponent into the stretch and gave way. SOLO RYE'D dropped well behind while racing
in the two path, came out into the stretch and was eased then walked off.

ALLABOUTTHEMONEY chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was caught in the final strides to the finish. POGI broke in at the start,
chased three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, got displaced from the front just inside that station and ran on to preserve the show honors. BUSTIN SHOUT coaxed from the gate and crossed
directly to the inside, chased along the rail coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
CHARGING AERO broke out at the start and came under coaxing to chase two to three wide, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid, then
weakened in the late stages. F F ROCKET chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late going. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the gate, crossed to the two path soon after the start and cut the pace patiently handled,

MAIN EVENT was sent hard to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far
turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop inside
that marker and held gamely under strong urging. CALL ME HARRY was coaxed from the gate, went three the two wide on the first turn, tracked the pace
on the outside, made a bid in the two path late on the far turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and was denied while clear for the place. DREAMS
OF TOMORROW was last to commence, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) went three then two wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while moving from the two path to the four path
on the far turn and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) dropped from the the two path to near the rail on the first
turn, settled at the back, was roused while inside on the far turn and also lacked the needed response. SAFE CONDUCT went four then three wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CRUPI along the inside through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch in behind the leader, got given a notch and advanced
quickly at the nine-sixteenths taking over command half a mile from home narrowly, vied inside a pair through to the five-sixteenths and then knocked heads
with ARMY TIMES coaxed along, swung four wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive kept to task. WINTERS LION just off the inside through the
first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to chase
the winner home while well clear of the rest for the place honors. ARMY TIMES broke out at the start, showed the way just off the inside through the first
turn under rating and then four paths off the inside own the backstretch, had a pair of rivals suddenly advance offering flanking challenges to either side into
the turn and remained patiently handled now vying between them, swung five wide into upper stretch roused straightened away and weakened through to
the finish. TABEGUACHE just off the inside through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before advancing just after CRUPI
did to issue a challenge to the front from the outside, vied four wide outside a pair through the turn until shaken off inside the five-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and weakened. DATS MR. MO got steadied off the heels of TABEGUACHE into the turn with a mile to run, raced two to three wide
through that bend and then six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the far turn backing away and losing contact,
went four wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
EZ ROLL saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to get the
lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. DIXIE PHARAOH moved in early, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn,
was well placed just off the pace, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, fought with the winner into the final furlong and
proved no match while able to get the place. KING FREUD moved in while showing speed, prompted the pace on the inside, dropped back early on the far
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and missed the place while able to get the show. ENGLISH CASTLE was off slow while having his path taken,
spotted the front a few lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came three wide
into the stretch and improved position. ERIC FROM MIAMI broke in then was corrected by the rider, settled in the two path, was asked on the far turn, came
four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. UNAUDITED went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace, made a bid between
horses with three furlongs to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. JHIRSCH was taken back early then reserved
while saving ground, moved out under urging in the stretch and failed to threaten. RABAJA traveled three wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the
field, was asked three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, jostled with a foe near the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. VIN SANTO
broke in at the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused late on the backstretch, went three wide under urging on
the final turn and failed to threaten. OFFICER DERICK showed early speed, raced in the three path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch,
was headed while inside on the far turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faded. ALBEDO was taken up when RABAJA crossed in front early, went
three to four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, saved ground on the far turn, came out in upper stretch then jostled with a foe and was no
factor. SCOOP THE POT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, went four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no
factor.
