Footnotes
WHISKEY JUSTICE set the pace while off the inside, remained clear into the lane, was asked for more nearing the sixteenth pole and remained clear.
REFLEX chased the pace from the two path through the turn, continued nearest the winner into the lane, was asked for more when straightening, could not
gain on the top one and stayed on to be clear for the place spot. PRINCE SHUKO saved ground through the turn and into the lane, shifted to the three path
nearing the eighth pole and never was a serious threat. PUNK was along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. CINCO DE OROS chased the
pace from the three or four path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

RED FIVE set the pace on a clear lead into the first turn, continued clear when in the two path into the far turn then held through the lane while under
intermittent urging. AMERICAN RAIDER was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the four path through the far turn when gaining some
momentum, swung into the lane from the five path and rallied from mid-track. NORBERT was unhurried while off the inside, bid five wide through late turn
and into the lane and was gaining to the end. CONRAD THE RED saved ground through the far turn when near the back, angled into the four path after
entering the lane and was gaining belatedly. MISTER MOSCATO chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, was still closest to the winner with
an eighth to go then faded along the rail. LEFT POCKET MONEY chased the pace from the three path into and through the far turn then weakened in the
lane. CENTAURO was well back through the turn when off the inside, came into the lane from the seven path and moved up while not a menace.
TOTALITARIAN saved ground throughout and lacked a bid. BIG ANCHOR raced in the two path through the turns and into the lane and tired. COSMIC
STARDUST outrun while into the three path. BIG STORMY outrun while off the inside. SPEEDBAYOU was four wide through the turn when moving into

saved ground and lacked a late bid. COLUMN saved ground and improved position late. TIZ ABBY raced in the three path and had no closing bid. MOON

Footnotes
WEST COASTER was bumped at the start and settled in the back to trail the field into the first turn, raced in the three or four path down the backstretch and
into the far turn, gained momentum in late turn, came into the lane from the four path and rallied from mid-track to be clear at the wire. GRACIE'S KITTEN
set the pace on a clear lead from the outset, continued clear into the lane, repelled several chasers near the eighth pole, appeared a winner late then could
not hold off the winner while finishing clear for the place spot. SPLIT DECISION was near the rail while in mid-pack, came into the lane from near the inside,
shifted to the four path and was gaining belatedly. AMERICANA ANNA settled to near the back into the backstretch, moved up down the backstretch while
along the inside, continued along the inside into the lane and needed more. ULTIMATE MISSION raced in the three path through the turn when no far back,
bid into the lane from the three or four path, stepped in near the eighth pole, was steadied and weakened. A STAR FOR CORA was in the two or three path
through the far turn and weakened in the lane. DALTON'S LOVE was never a factor while off the inside. SWEET BABY RAY angled to the rail into the first
turn, moved up to chase the pacesetter from the two path into the far turn then faded through the lane. HAPPY SAILS chased the pacesetter while in the
two path down the backstretch and was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
WARTIME HERO was four wide and between rivals through the first turn, stalked the dueling leaders down the backstretch and into the turn, bid in late turn
and into the lane then edged clear through the final sixteenth. BIG PAPER vied for the lead two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, continued on
near even terms into the lane then gave ground grudgingly. RAISON KARTER steadied off the pace along the inside after mid-turn through the first,
continued along the inside into the far turn and into the lane, came off the rail just inside the eighth pole and was all out to get up for the show spot. RIVER
BOY vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn then faded. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) was in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from
the four path and moved up while not a threat. BUZZER never a factor while in the two or three path throughout. NORDIC LIGHT was five wide and
between rivals through the first turn, moved to chase the pace while in the two path, was three wide into the lane and empty through the final eighth. CIELO
AZUL raced seven wide through the first turn, continued well off the inside into the far turn, was still four wide into the lane and had nothing. ICE BLAST
broke close to the field, dropped back into the backstretch and continued to lose ground into the lane and was under a drive through the lane. GOLDEN
TEXT was six wide through the first turn, continued in mid-pack while in the three path and was suddenly done approaching the half-mile pole.

Footnotes
FOREVER PINK vied inside, bid on the far turn to be clear and drew off, holding sway under mild urging. SECOND EXCHANGE was unrushed early, bid
between rivals on the far turn, angled four wide at the quarter pole, bid but was no threat to the winner. HERE KITTY KITTY stalked the pace in the four
path, bid at the quarter pole, then couldn't gain late. MOON DAZE pressed the pace to the three path, then gave way on the far turn. SHEZA NUT saved
ground, then passed tired foes. CIERRA EMPIRE vied between rivals and gave way on the turn. ANTE ANGEL was not a factor. NIGHT LIVIN bore out
going into the first turn, bid five wide at the three-quarter pole, then faltered.
