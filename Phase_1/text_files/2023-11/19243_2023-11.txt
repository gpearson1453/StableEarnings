tight, had her heels clipped then finished full of run through the stretch to win going away. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD pressured the winner between
horses two wide, was in tight entering the turn as that one drifted in, kept pressured into the stretch then was no match while well clear for second. MO

DANCIN' ROSIE set the lead along the inside into the turn, gave up the advantage before mid turn, fought back gamely under right handed urging to regain
command near mid stretch and proved best in a game effort. APPEALING SENORITA had speed from the start, loomed boldly along the rail midway on the
turn, battled with the winner until deep stretch and finished second best. TALE OF THE LYON pressed the early pace three wide, made the lead two wide
nearing mid turn, battled into the stretch then was outfinished. LADY ABRIL pressed the pace two wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then
weakened. COWCHI settled inside and went evenly. NOT A WILD BRAT was antsy in the gate then no factor. I'M JAC'D had brief speed. J J'S FANCY was

LIMIT UP away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch under right handed urging and won in hand. FLIPPING FISH was in tight, steadied near the
half mild pole, chased the winner two wide then along the inside into the stretch, shifted to the four path and was no match while well clear for second.
OVER THE HILLS offered a mild bid four wide into the turn then failed to sustain that bid. TIME HEIST chased the winner three then two wide through the
turn then weakened. VENETIAN DREAM had brief speed inside. THE DRAKE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MOODY WOMAN always within striking distance, rallied two then three wide into the stretch engaging the leaders before the furlong marker, dug in under
right handed urging while being carried out to the eight path through the final stages and proved best under strong handling. MY DESTINY away alertly, set
a pressured pace three wide then inside rivals into the stretch, drifted out under left handed urging through deep stretch to the seven path then couldn't
handle the winner. ROSEBUG had good early speed along the inside, dropped back on the turn, altered course outside the top trio before the furlong
marker and finished with good courage in the middle of the racetrack. LIBERTY BELLE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, was in tight while
beginning to fade between rivals past the furlong marker and weakened. DECO STRONG had brief speed. THINK IT THRU had speed along the inside into
the turn then wilted. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF LIBERTY BELLLE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF MY DESTINY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
JERSEY PEARL stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved closer three wide nearing the quarter pole, dug in determinedly under left handed urging in
the seven path through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. WHITE CHOCOLATE was hustled to the lead gaining a narrow advantage soon after the
start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted out repeatedly to the five path under left handed urging then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages.
CONDENSATION unhurried early, had a mild late rally three wide. SIMPLY STATED had good early speed three then two wide and lacked the needed
response. LATE FROST pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch and gave way late. ZAPPLE had brief speed six wide. POETICA brushed the
gate at the start, was guided outside soon thereafter, inched closer on the turn then came up empty.
