Footnotes
ELYSIAN MEADOWS was urged along towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, was driven five wide into the stretch,
rallied in the final furlong and closed with good courage to get up late. BIG PRANKSTER pressed the pace on the outside, drew even in the two to three
path on the turn, took the advantage inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the five path into the stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final
sixteenth but was overtaken while well clear for the place. AZ U CHASE ME was ridden along near the back, climbed some late on the backstretch, dropped
from the two path to the rail on the turn and lacked the needed response while up for the show. ALLIED ATTACK was hustled to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and weakened then lost
the show. NANO MAN dropped off the pace under urging, fell further back in the three path on the turn, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong
marker then swapped to the proper lead and came up empty. SIX FORTYFIVE tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back three to four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and retreated. BALI AMOUR was urged along on the outside, traveled four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. V LO climbed at the rear early, was urged at the back, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. IN A MINUTE
was urged along just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, moved to the two path near the quarter-pole and capitulated. ROB THE BANK was urged along
towards the back, angled from the two path to the four path midway through the turn and showed little. HEAD-ON REPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE

Footnotes
BOURBON CHASE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased four wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in tussling with the runner up, then inched away under a drive to prevail in the late
going. BOYS CODE brushed at the start by SUPREME BEING, who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong fighting on to the finish to secure the place honors on the line. LEO
AND ROYAL five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
advanced to take command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared a furlong out, ran on to secure the show
honors. SUPREME BEING broke out at the start brushing with BOYS CODE and was corrected, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. QUICK TO ACCUSE coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding command,
weakened in the final furlong. KID BILLY got away to an awkward beginning conceding three lengths to the front, chased four then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, gave way, and was eased through the final eighth. ENGINEER EMPIRE chased three
wide in closest aim of the leader early on, tucked inside into the turn coming under brief coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and faded, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home through the stretch to the wire.

DOT'S DOLLAR bumped with a rival at the start, angled out early then was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained in upper stretch,
took the lead inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. POGI was urged along on the outside, angled in outside the half-mile pole, saved
ground on the turn, gained in the two path into upper stretch, made a bid near the furlong marker, vied between horses into the final sixteenth and missed.
CHARGING AERO was urged along at the rear, dropped further behind late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, came
out four wide into upper stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy to just miss the place. CHATEAU broke very fast and went
immediately clear, angled in while showing the way, raced inside on the turn, shortened stride under the crop while remaining on his inside lead in upper
stretch, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and weakened. CAJUN CASANOVA bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside,
went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MR PHIL moved out while urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, gained on the
leader in upper stretch, moved out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response.

WORKS FOR ME bobbled at the break, recovered to chase three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to get on near even terms a sixteenth out and was up gamely
in the final jumps to prevail. DETECTIVE TOM established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat coming out slightly and then came in just inside the sixteenth marker putting
AGGELOS THE GREAT in tight along the rail and was bumped in the hindquarters by that rival seventy yards from home, then got nailed at the end and
was forced to settle for the place honors. AGGELOS THE GREAT chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch was in behind DETECTIVE TOM, then got an open rail just inside the eighth pole, moved into that lane
under a drive, had it close in and tighten when DETECTIVE TOM came inwards a sixteenth out, got forced to pause and bumped the hind end of the
aforementioned foe and was along for the show honors while in hand to the finish. PERLIANO four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. ALWAYS A WARRIOR chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. WINE RESPONSIBLY chased four then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, offered no rally. BONNE CHANCE got bumped at the start by ICE THE KICKER and was forced to steady briefly conceding
four lengths to the front, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ICE THE KICKER
broke out at the start bumping BONNE CHANCE and forcing that rival to steady when taking over his lane, chased along the inside coaxed along for the
opening furlong before dropping back suddenly and losing ground into the turn, got placed to a protective hold midway and was guided outside to swing five
to six wide into upper stretch while well behind and was eased home to the end.

Footnotes
INTEGRATION went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in the five path into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop while kicking clear outside the furlong marker and
powered home an impressive winner while outside the middle of the course. I'M VERY BUSY was well placed on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far
turn, came out while roused into the stretch then moved out behind the drifting leader while asked for his best and finished with good courage while no
match for the winner. TOOFAREASTISWEST was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far
turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch then came further out and finished willingly for the show then was vanned off after the race.
FREEDOM TRAIL hit the inside of the gate at the start and was off a step slow, saved ground towards the rear, came off the rail on the far turn, swung six
wide into the stretch and improved position. FARADAY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was
roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LAUREL VALLEY went to the front, showed the way on
the inside through solid fractions, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. EQUITIZE (GB) bumped soundly with an opponent at the start, showed
good early speed on the outside of a foe, became keen when taken back off the pace before the first turn, tracked outside on the backstretch, was given his
cue in the two path on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. CLASSIC CATCH went around the first turn in the two
path, settled on the outside without cover, was given cover nearing the half-mile pole, came under encouragement in the two then three path on the far turn,
was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. QUALITY CHIC was a bit keen under restraint near the back into the first turn, went three to four
wide on the bends, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TRICKY TEMPER tracked the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the pacesetter into the final furlong,
gained coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging to prevail. CARA'S TIME quickly went clear, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole but was caught while well clear for second. UNICORN CAKE was hustled
from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, went four wide for most of the turn then dropped to the three path and weakened. MY SHEA D LADY was
well placed just off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. SOLOSHOT bobbled slightly at the start then was hustled, chased the pace on the inside of a rival, raced between foes in the three path early on
the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and capitulated. ALLEY'S SONG bobbled at the start and was off a bit slow, raced at the rear under urging,
went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
NOTHING BETTER went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then
came under a drive in upper stretch and held under steady urging. BOAT'S A ROCKIN was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole then came off the rail into upper stretch, pursued the winner while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and was second best.
ALOGON settled under some restraint, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, moved out while asked for his best outside the furlong
marker and finished willingly for the show. OUR SHOT dropped back then was coaxed along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came four
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. WITTY brushed with a foe after the start, settled near the back, saved ground
on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DANCING BUCK stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid with three
furlongs to run, vied in the two path on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. FORE HARP brushed with a foe after the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and came up empty. THIN WHITE DUKE settled towards the rear, was roused four wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. VACATION DANCE settled in the middle of the field, went around the turn in the two path and
failed to respond. RUN CURTIS RUN hit the outside of the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, went five wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. GRATEFUL BRED settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten.
