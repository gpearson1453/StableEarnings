HOUGHTON SHUFFLE was off a step slow but quickly moved up to stalk the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by
the quarter pole, then drew away in the final furlong under left handed crop urging. BOOK RUNNER was reserved early, came four wide into the lane and
finished well late to gain the place award. BROKENHEARTED pressed the early pace on the inside, then fell off the pace and shifted out nearing the quarter
pole to make a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out, lost place late, bested rest. GOTTA HAVE HEART broke outwardly at the start, chased the pace
four wide and weakened. NECCO set a pressured pace early two wide, then dueled for the lead on the inside by the quarter pole and then weakened in the
