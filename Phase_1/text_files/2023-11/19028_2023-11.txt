Footnotes
FERRYBOAT leaned outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, recovered to set the pace in the two path into the first turn, led from chasers around
the far turn, inched clear entering the lane and held sway. ELI laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued in the three path around the far turn, launched
an advance by splitting foes in the four path entering the lane, forged place entering midstretch and narrowly fended off an inner bidder for that position late.
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS hopped slightly before taking contact from an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four to two path around the first turn,
chase under urging in the four path around the far turn, yielded while getting floated to the five path entering the lane, yet shifted in and re-rallied between
horses in the final furlong but missed reaching place. RANDELLO stalked the top pair from the two to three path, moved in at the five furlong pole, brushed
an outer rival while attempting to shift outside of the leader around the far turn, failed to achieve that goal and re-committed to a rail charge entering the
lane, chased and vied for place with outer rivals through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. DEVOTED TO YOU prompted along the inside into the
first turn, eased back under snug restraint to tip outside of her counterpart approaching the backstretch, stalked from the three path soon after, took light
contact from an inner rival while maintaining her path pursuing the leader around the far turn, but faded between horses in upper stretch. SILVESTRE laid
off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, retreated to trail passing the three quarter pole and was outrun thereafter.

changed over and drifted inwardly leaving them, then held sway. GABBYSONHOLIDAY bounced off an inner rival before bumping an outer foe at the start,
raced at the rear in the three path around the turn, picked up stride while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over while shifting out nearing
the final sixteenth, then offered a late kick to gain place in the final thirty yards. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF took contact from an inner rival at the start, raced off
of the pace while hung in the five path, got outmoved by an inner rival while floated to th six path entering the lane, ran on to bid for place passing the
furlong grounds, sparred with an inner rival into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer bidder late and narrowly prevailed for show. BATTLE

place with an outer foe in the final furlong, but was outkicked late and missed show. PACIFIC STATES stalked behind the pace setter, pressed in the three
path along with an outer foe into the turn, but gave way entering the lane. TAMASHI bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, felt
pressure from an outer pair around the turn, embraced a bid entering the lane, but was headed by a wider challenger in upper stretch and faded entering the
final furlong. GUADALAJARA was a bit restless awaiting the start, then got outrun along the inside. RATE CONFIRMATION saved ground in midpack and

Footnotes
WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) prompted outside of the leader and in the three path, bid turning for home, sparred with an inner pair through upper stretch,
sustained the battle with only a single inner rival into the final sixteenth, inched a narrow advantage late and prevailed. SOARING BIRD brushed an outer
rival soon after the start, stalked along the inside, offered a rail bid entering the lane, dueled with an outer pair through upper stretch, shifted out entering the
final sixteenth as a single counterpart persisted, but was bested in the late stages. TIGER DAD set the pace inside of a prompting rival while in the two path,
sparred between horses in upper stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder in the process, yielded to the top pair in the final furlong and lasted for show.
TIZ OF THEE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but only offered a slow grinding charge to miss reaching show.
LEADER OF MEN settled in the three path, shifted out at the three furlong pole, ranged up in the five to six path turning for home, but leveled off without
reaching contention. SENOR JOBIM was fractious in the starting gate, then saved ground towards the rear to no avail. MINE OWN STAR took light contact
from an inner rival soon after the off, tracked in the five path, pressed the top pair from the four path while under urging around the turn, but weakened
between horses while drifting to the five path entering the lane. TREASURY raced forwardly in the four path, but gave way between horses entering the
turn, faded thereafter and was eased up through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SKRATCH KAT trailed in the two to three path, inched closer while getting floated four to five wide nearing the lane, sustained a rally in pursuit of the clear
leader in the final furlong, closed in late and reeled in that rival in the closing stages. ICE ORCHID tracked along the inside, rated a bit further back into the
far turn to tip off the inside, picked up stride shifting out turning for home to take aim four wide and between horses entering the lane, drifted inwardly while
hanging on her left lead yet also sustaining a bid in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, but continued to hang on her left lead as an outer
bidder menacing the closing stages and was worn down nearing the wire. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) bobbled yet broke on top at the start, set the pace along
the inside, resisted an outer challenge entering the lane, but was bested by a wider bidder nearing the furlong grounds and kept on to maintain show. SOUL
OF AN ANGEL tracked two to three wide and between horses, inched closer turning for home while keeping an inner rival hemmed in behind the leader, bid
two wide entering the lane, vied while getting outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, then gave way between foes leaving the furlong grounds.
DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE broke half a step slow, laid off of the pace three to four wide, inched closer turning for home, but yielded between horses in upper
stretch. FANNIE AND FREDDIE stalked two wide while inside of rivals down backstretch, failed to maintain a path outside of the leader while inching closer,
had to tap the brakes behind that one while getting outmoved by outer rivals turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
DEVIL BLUE DRESS set the pace along the inside, kicked away entering the lane and lasted safely. RITA'S ONTHE BEACH raced at the rear in the two
path, encountered traffic entering the lane in the three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole, flopped
back to her left lead and sustained progress on the clear leader but ran out of ground. LEAFLET laid off of the pace in the three path, floated to the five path
while between horses at the three furlong pole, got put to tight quarters approaching the five sixteenths marker, fanned out to the six path while recovering
nearing the lane, ran on while hanging on her left lead to challenge for place along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked and edged
show. UPSWELL stuttered a step upon leaving the gates, raced at the rear in the three to four path, gained in the six path into the turn, sustained progress
shifting down to the four path turning for home, gained place passing the three sixteenths pole, but tired in the final furlong and was surpassed by a pair of
outer rivals at the sixteenth pole. LIFFEY broke inwardly and bumped the gate, raced off of the pace along the inside, moved two wide and between horses
turning for home, shifted four wide in midstretch and ran on mildly. GATHER pursued two wide and between horses, then chase along the fence in upper
stretch and tired. CAUSE I'M WILD stalked in the three path, pressed the leader around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and weakened
between horses in the final furlong. TAKE TIME TO DREAM tracked four wide, chased three wide around the turn, pursued between horses nearing the
lane and faded. SMASHING took contact from an inner rival at the start, laid close up between horses, chased into the turn but faded around the bend.
HAPPY CHARGER leaned outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack three wide and among foes, but gave way while fanning to the
five path entering the lane.

REDIFINED stalked behind the top pair and from the three path into the turn, loomed a danger while taking aim outside of them and from the four path
entering the lane, assumed command approaching midstretch, drew off and was ridden out under hand urging. JILL JITTERBUG tracked in the four path,
lacked progress while shifting ground a touch outwardly in upper stretch, then rallied in the seven path in the final furlong to gain place in the final sixteenth.
STONE SILENT vied outside of a rival while taking the turn in the three path, forged an advantage turning for home, but offered little resistance to an outer
foe's challenge coming to midstretch, gave way along with an inner rival in the final sixteenth and prevailed over that one for show. SASSY NATURE vied
for the lead inside of a rival while remaining a path off of the inner rival around the turn, proved no match for a wider bidder in upper stretch, faded and
narrowly lost show. ERNA saved ground while trailing and failed to factor.

Footnotes
WEST OMAHA set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, kicked away from him in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. PUN INTENDED
pressed the eventual winner from the outside, inched forward to vie turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, drifted outwardly
approaching midstretch, straightened course inside the final furlong and secured place to prove second best. PULA stalked three wide, pressed the top pair
while under urging around the turn, chased entering the lane, but was floated outwardly by an inner foe leaving upper stretch, yet ran on and narrowly held
show from an inner rival late. BANG BANG FURY stalked along the inside while racing well in the bit leaving the chute, steadied very subtly while taking a
bit of an awkward stride behind the leader at the eleven sixteenths pole, tracked into the turn, backed up turning for home to tip outside of rivals entering the
lane, then stayed on between horses in the final furlong and missed claiming show from an outer foe at the wire. HEY OLIVIA tracked two wide and between
horses, cut the corner entering the lane, chased along the rail through midstretch but flattened out late. VIABLE broke a step slow and failed to menace from
the two path. FUN LOVING bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, pursued outside of the top flight in the five to four path into the turn, chased around
the bend before leaning back to the five path nearing the lane, but faded. CHURNING BERNI lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. LITE IT
UP LOUIE bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. SOCIAL AFFAIR bumped with an inner rival at the start,
drifted wide leaving the chute, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
NATURAL HARBOR pressed three wide, bid in the four path entering the lane, led in upper stretch and drove clear. TIM TAL set the pace along the inside,
resisted outer challenges while entering the lane in the two path, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, kept on to vie for place through
the final furlong and gamely held. A LA CARTE tracked three to four wide and between horses, was roused for gain turning for home, bid in the five path
entering the lane, but chased the clearing leader into the final furlong, vied for place with an inner rival into deep stretch but missed. SEAS OF NORMANDY
lacked speed in the four path, entered the lane in the six path, tipped out to the eight path and outside of rivals in upper stretch, then rallied to gain fourth
late. AUTO GLIDE tracked two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but checked briefly behind a foe in upper stretch, then
ran on evenly between horses. SEEKING UNITY stalked along the inside, chased two wide into the final furlong and flattened out. FOREVER COOL broke
slowly, was urged along off the pace along the inside, took the turn in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. FUNNY
UNCLE lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. NIGHT EFFECT broke a step slow, lacked speed five to six wide, leaned to the eight path in
upper stretch and made little impact. LUPO'S LEGACY pursued four to five wide, then faded between horses in the seven path in upper stretch. IGNITIS
prompted two wide and between horses, bid turning for home but weakened between horses in upper stretch. WORK ORDER saw the rider lose his right
iron at the start, dropped the other leaving the chute and lagged well behind throughout.

Footnotes
FANCY MARTINI raced forwardly three to two wide around the first turn, stalked around the far turn, drifted to the four path entering the lane as an outer
rival ranged up alongside, rallied with that one to close in on the clear leader in the final furlong and reeled her in nearing the wire. EXCELERINA (IRE) ran
off and pulled to an open margin approaching the first turn, steadied while rank under restraint around that bend, settled into stride down the backstretch,
maintained a wide margin through midstretch, but tired as a pair of outer rivals closed in inside the final sixteenth and got caught late. ZAWISH pursued from
midpack in the four to five path around the first turn, inched closer three wide around the far turn before being floated back to the five path entering the lane,
yet sustained a rally outside of the eventual winner in the final furlong, but needed more to offer a bid nearing the wire. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES tracked
along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, chased along the fence through upper stretch, tipped outwardly in the final furlong and ran on
while one-paced. I'M SO SORRY pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path entering upper stretch but failed to menace between
rivals. PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging to the six path entering the lane and moved up.
NAVY GOAT laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane but gave way between horses. LADY HIDEAWAY stalked along the
inside, entered the lane in the two path, but only managed to chase before weakening between horses at the furlong grounds. AALIYAH EZRI failed to
factor from the two path. SWEETS MAKER never got involved.

Footnotes
INEXORABLE tracked along the inside, gained ground in the three to four path around the turn, took aim on the new leader while floated to the six path
entering the lane, took contact from that one in upper stretch, bid while receiving another bump at the furlong grounds, then drove clear leaving the sixteenth
pole. MUCHO MOJO stalked in the four to three path into the turn, bid and assumed command passing the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the five path as an
outer rival took aim entering the lane, leaned into and bumped that one in upper stretch, did so again while battling into the final furlong but was bested with
a sixteenth to go. MASTER GAME laid off of the pace in the five to six path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and ran on to gain show late. TRIGGER
HAPPY brushed with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin down the backstretch, but proved no match for an outer
bidder at the five sixteenths pole, kept on but lost show late. JEDREK lagged behind, cut the gap in upper stretch, altered out in midstretch and moved up.
SANT' ANTIMO tracked two wide, urged along in the four path around the turn and tired between horses. SKATE TO HEAVEN brushed with an inner rival at
the start, chased in the two path and weakened.
