Footnotes
RB MALEXIS chased the pace down the backstretch while two wide, was advancing on the far turn then edge clear in the upper stretch and drew off to
prevail in the end. WMA BIG BABY moved up on the first turn to duel briefly for the lead while two wide, took command heading into the far turn then was
outkicked by RB MALEXIS in the early stretch and was best for place in the end. PEARLS SPIRIT AA raced in the middle of the field while two wide down
the backstretch, was under a hard drive leaving the far turn to get up to third position but lacked the winning bid and held on for show in the end. AA SWEET
VICTORY lunged at the start, then saved ground in the early furlongs, rallied from the four path leaving the far turn but came up empty in the end. TM
PURNCESS raced while three wide towards the back of the pack, was urging on the turn to rally in the upper stretch but did not make a difference in the
end. AL M raced in the middle of the field from the inside, then made a mild bid in the home stretch and had no impact in the end. UPTOWN LADY
ARABELLA stalked the pace from the inside, settled back in the late backstretch then lacked rally in the home stretch. RB MUNCHIE set the pace into the
first turn while two wide, then gave way for the lead into the turn then continued to flatten out in the stretch. RB MAMA WINGATE settled inside and was no
threat. WMA TORCH LIGHT was unhurried early and no factor. KD DERBY GIRL chased the pace early from the three path then was done after the half.

Footnotes
RB MARY LYLAH pressed the pace down the backstretch while four wide and outside of rivals, then dug in to edge clear on the far turn and held on well
down the home stretch to prove best. HONEY PROOF pressed the pace while two wide, then moved up to duel with an inner rival in late backstretch, then
was outkicked on the far turn and was best for place in the end. KISSOUUR saved ground early then rallied from the four path leaving the far turn and was
able to hold onto the show prize in the end. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE chased the pace from the inside, then angled out five wide while leaving the far turn to
bid in the upper stretch and missed the show prize in the end. AA TAKE A CHANCE raced from the inside at a moderate pace throughout the first half, bid
on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. RB TEXAS HOLD EM pressed the pace while three wide in the early furlongs then dropped back heading
into the far turn and lacked rallying in the home stretch. RB RATHOWAYNE was unhurried early and no threat. WMA GRAND FINALE led the way into the
first turn, then dueled in late backstretch to keep the lead but was used up and flattened after the far turn. UPTOWN RINGOFFIRE waited in the gate after
the break and was no threat. BLAZING STAR AA chased the pace while three wide in the early furlong then was thru after the half. FOUR HUNDRED
PROOF AA was no factor.
