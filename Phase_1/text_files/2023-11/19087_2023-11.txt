GIVE N RECEIVE took the lead early on in the race then started to draw off from the rest of the pack, much the best. REALLY A STORM shuffled back
slightly early on in the race then coming down the stretch on the outside, made a strong rally for place, was second best. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW ran with
an even pace throughout the race at the front of the pack. COWGIRLLOVER ran in the middle of the pack then coming down the turn in the middle of the
track had a strong kick to pass foes. MS JAZZ ran in the front of the main pack but hung late stretch getting passed by multiple foes. SHAME ON YOU ran
at the back of the pack with no means of advancing, then coming down the stretch with the same pace passed tired foes. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE ran in the
middle of the pack then shuffled back as the race progressed. ROCKETT'S RED CITY started off at the front of the pack then as the race went on slowly fell
back then faded hard early stretch. ANDREABANANAS ran in the middle of the pack then coming into the turn started to fade back and eventually ended up
at the back. DASH OF CHROME walked off, lost rider at start. THERE WAS AN STEWARDS INQUIRY AT THE START OF THE RACE WHERE DASH OF
CHROME LOST THEIR RIDER, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A STUMBLE CAUSED BY ITSELF AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE.
