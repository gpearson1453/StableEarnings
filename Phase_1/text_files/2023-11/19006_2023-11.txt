Footnotes
KATERINA PETROVA was unhurried while in the three path, made first run at the dueling leaders into the turn, gained the lead in late turn but was joined by
the runner-up soon after, lost the lead to that one near the eighth pole then battled back to get the maiden win. PINK ROBE was unhurried while off the
inside, made second run through the turn while in the four path, was four wide near the quarter pole, gained the lead while in mid-track then could not hold
the top one safe. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART broke slowly and spotted the field some six lengths, steadily gained on the field into the far turn, came into the
lane from the three path with aim on the top two but could not sustain the effort while finishing best of the rest. WILL VIRGINIA DARE rolled four wide
through the turn while making her way to vie for the lead, continued on near even terms for the lead while two wide into the turn then gave way. GRANNY
ANN chased the duelers into the far turn when in the two path then tired. MAGGIE E vied for the lead while along the inside, was still dueling into mid-turn
then retreated through the lane. LA FURIA was done after a half along the inside.

and held sway under mild urging. WHOSFORJUSTICE stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the eighth pole, shifted out slightly late but couldn't close.
D'ORO'S WISH raced inside, bid at the quarter pole, then couldn't close late. ZAPPINIT pressed the pace outside of the winner but yielded in the stretch.

the stretch.

Footnotes
SNERDLEY trailed into the turn while in the three path, continued into the lane from the two path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole and edged up
late. PHILIP SNOW cleared early while in the two path, shook off challengers in late turn and into the lane, cleared and had his largest advantage with an
eighth to go, began to get weary late and could not hold while clear for the show spot. TURBONATOR chased the pace from the three path through the turn,
bid in late turn and into the lane, had aim on the leader after straightening but could not gain until very late. LITTLE RUSTY raced in the two path while in
mid-pack through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. GRAY MIKE was in the four path through the turn while trailing, came into the lane from the
seven path and moved up while not a menace. GLORIFIED WINNER never a factor while in the two path. WE MISS OTIS chased the pace from the three
or four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired. AMERIGOROUND saved ground into the lane and tired. SLACKER chased
the pace from the three or four path into the lane and was empty after straightening.

Footnotes
CAUMSETT bore out at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, came in slightly at the eighth pole, dueled and was clear late
under steady handling. ALBERTA SUN raced inside, rallied at the quarter pole, waited at the eighth pole when the rail tightened up, shifted outside of the
leaders and closed well. PICANA (CHI) led inside in the two path, dueled through the stretch, moved in slightly at the eighth pole to tighten up the rail, then
yielded late. FIRST KITTEN was squeezed back at the start, saved ground, shifted three wide at the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. ROCK STAR
PARKING took back early, raced in the four path and rallied late. PROMISES TO DANCE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace between runners, then
yielded in the stretch. FOR THE BISCUIT pressed the pace between rivals, then gave way in the stretch.The Stewards disallowed an objection lodged by
the rider of ALBERTA SUN against the winner, alleging interference near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
INTERSTELLAR set the pace while in the two path and under pressure, shook clear into the lane, widened to the eighth pole and was geared down late
while well clear. SPUNS SON was unhurried while off the inside, advanced from the four path through the far turn, came into the lane with momentum and
was up for the place spot while never a threat to the top one. EL CERRITO tracked the pace while along the inside, moved to be closest the winner into the
turn, could not gain on that one and lost the place spot late. CANBOULAY raced in two path through the turns, split rivals nearing the eighth pole and moved
up. JOINT VENTURE saved ground into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, was a threat into the lane then weakened. MO ANGELL pressed the
winner two wide into the turn, continued as a contender into the lane then faded. LOLAS BEAU trailed for half while off the inside, raced in the three or four
path through the turn, swung into the lane from the seven path and moved up while never a threat. CADE'S GOAL never a factor while saving ground.
HEZMORETHANREADY never factored while in the two path through the turns and into the lane. Z FORCE MAJURE chased the pace from the two path
into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane. FEELINGOODBILLYRAY raced in the three path through the far turn and tired. AMEREASE was three
wide through the firs turn, continued to chase the winner down the backstretch and was done soon after going a half.

Footnotes
TALKTOMEJUSTICE set the pace from the outset, cleared into the backstretch, continued with a clear lead into the lane then widened to the wire.
GRACIE'S KITTEN chased the winner down the backstretch from the three path, continued to chased that one through the turn and into the lane, could not
gain and settled for second best. MORNING ANGEL was unhurried while racing in the three or four path, moved closer into the turn while still well off the
inside, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the minor share while not a threat to the top two. DEE DEE B was near the rail into the far
turn, angled into the four or five path through the turn, swung into the lane from the seven path and gained belatedly. A STAR FOR CORA saved ground
through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, shifted from the three to the six path late and was gaining momentum. ATHENAIS well back while
in the four path, continued into the six path into the lane and passed a couple while not a threat. TWO WORDS pressed the early pace while two wide
through the turn, chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and tired. DARTIGA saved ground through the far turn and tired. PRETTY HEART
raced near the rail while in mid-pack through the turn and tired. IN OPEN COURT in the two path through the turns and when in position then was empty
turning into the lane. KATIE GOT LUCKY was outrun while saving ground. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE took a bad step when passing the sixteenth pole the
first time, stayed on into the turn then dropped back thereafter.
