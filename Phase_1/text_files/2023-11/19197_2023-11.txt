Footnotes
INSIGHTFUL MISS trailed early on, quickly made up ground in the five path around the turn, sustained a bid while shifting inwardly in upper stretch, drove
past the leader nearing the final furlong and drew clear. MAHOMEBRED set the pace in the two path while well in hand around the turn, shook free of
chasing foes entering the lane, but was no match for an outer bidder entering midstretch and proved second best. LONG BLACK VEIL pressed outside of
the leader early on, required urging while chasing in the three path around the turn, got outmoved by an outer bidder entering the lane, yet kept on to hold
show late. MARKSWOMAN broke inwardly, lacked speed along the inside, trailed turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch, ran on willingly outside of
rivals in the final furlong and missed reaching show. ZERO CLICK stalked along the inside and faded. WIKI LIO broke outwardly many paths at the start,
recovered to track two wide approaching the turn, came under urging in the three path around the bend, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, but
tired while hanging on her left lead.

TOO FAST FOR YOU bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked three to two wide, bid turning for home and drew off under a drive in upper stretch.
APRIL CLOVER set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer foe around the turn, proved no match for that one entering the lane and held place
thereafter. WISCO DISCO tracked two wide, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, offered a mild bid for place in the final furlong but was kept at bay.
LUCKY LESSON bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged behind despite heavy urging from the rider into the turn and made little impact. FESSY
stalked along the inside and weakened.

CATHEDRAL BEACH brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, then rallied to reel in the clear leader passing the sixteenth
pole. POPULIST brushed with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of a rival, got narrowly headed by that foe around the turn, but inherited
an advantage once more as that foe drifted entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch but was caught with a sixteenth to go. SENOR JOBIM broke a
step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped in entering the lane and gained show from outer rivals in the final furlong. THAT KHENNY dueled for
the lead two wide, led narrowly turning for home, but drifted out to the six path entering the lane and faded. BOISE chased two wide around the turn and
yielded between horses. MONKEY ZONE brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, lagged behind and never got involved. COMMANDER CARL chased
along the inside and weakened.

FURIOUS ANGER dueled for the lead outside of a rival, forged a narrow advantage from that one entering the lane, then gamely clung to that margin
through a long battle. DAZZLEMESILVER broke outwardly, dueled for the lead inside of a rival, got slightly headed entering the lane, fought on gamely to
prolong the war through the lane, but missed via a photo. ACCIDENT tracked in the three path and was best of the rest. PERFECT UPSTART broke a step
slow, lagged behind despite heavy urging down the backstretch, then improved inside of foes in the final furlong. ADDED MISCHIEF broke a step slow while
last away, laid off of the pace in the two path and made little impact. NAUGHTYSON broke inwardly, chased along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
PRAY FOR CHAMPAGNE broke outwardly, prompted three wide, stalked into the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led in the five path entering the lane
and drew clear. ISA LEI vied for the lead two wide, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge nearing the lane, yielded yet just lasted for place late.
QUEEN LEXI was slow early and lagged behind, fanned to the seven path entering upper stretch and rallied outside of foes to miss reaching place.
MIWOMAN brushed an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, gained show from outer rivals in the final furlong but was caught late.
LINDSEY lacked speed in the two path, fanned to the six path entering the lane but lacked a rally between horses. QUEEN'S NOTICE broke a step slow
and took light contact from an inner rival at the start, chased the top trio from the four path and gave way. SHE'S SPLENDID vied along the inside and
weakened in upper stretch.

to five path in upper stretch and ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth. YOU AIN'T POPPN set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer rival
around the turn, sparred through upper stretch but was outkicked by a wider bidder at the furlong grounds and maintained show late. GHAZAALY bumped
with an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled through upper stretch but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong

Footnotes
EXCESS MAGIC popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, set the pace in the two path, built a clear margin into the turn, then drew away under a
drive. WILLTORUN brushed an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, ran on to gain place at the furlong grounds and was second best. GO
WEST laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path entering the turn and moved up. BOHEMIAN BO pressed outside of the leader early on,
chased that one from the three path around the turn, then lost place to an inner rival in midstretch and tired. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS brushed an inner rival
at the start, tracked in the four path and weakened. VOODOO ZIP brushed with rivals on both sides at the start and was outrun. VULCAN tracked along the
inside, but bore out into the turn causing the rider to take a firm hold in correction, steadied due to restraint and faltered soon after.

HIGHLAND FALLS tracked in the three path, moved forward to press outside of the top pair into the far turn, led entering the lane, repelled an outer
challenge in midstretch and drew clear. TEN DAYS LATER laid off the pace along the inside, took closer order before tracking behind the leading trio
around the far turn, took aim outside of them entering the lane, bid in upper stretch but was repelled at the furlong grounds. SMILE MON set a clear pace
early on, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, then gave way through the final furlong. EMIRATES ROAD saved ground at the rear and
moved up in upper stretcch. JUST BATTLE laid off of the pace two to three wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to menace.
BASELINE BEATER tugged along the inside to a stalking position outside of the leader with five furlongs to go, stalked before bidding into the far turn, vied
between horses turning for home but weakened in upper stretch. J J'S JOKER stalked in the three path, chased two wide and between horses around the
far turn and faded.
