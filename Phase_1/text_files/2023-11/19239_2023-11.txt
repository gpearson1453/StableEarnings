Footnotes
OCTOBER FROST had an ideal trip nestled on the fence behind the front threesome down the back straight, waited patiently in hand on the far turn behind
the contesting trio, angled out for clear run in the three path at the furlong marker and got up in the last few strides for the victory. INFAMOUS COVERT
prompted three wide on the first turn, kept a close eye tracking the frontrunner down the backstretch, pounced to bid for the lead three wide at the quarter
pole and was determinedly battling to the finish, could no match the winner late but gamely held for the place share at the wire. GENDRAGON took
command from the start, opened up mildly on the fence down the backside, was headed outside at the quarter pole, stubbornly dueled on the fence through
the stretch, rider lost his crop inside the eighth pole driving to the wire and just missed in the photo for place at the finish line. ROCKLAND EXPRESS trailed
on the fence in the early going, stalked between foes near the rear at the half, rallied three wide mid-turn picking up horses, swung outside in the five path
straightening for home and had an even pace to the wire to settle on the fringes. JMR PURE SENSATION stalked near the back of the pack down the
backstretch inside, made little progress on the fence through the final bend, shifted outside in the three path for the drive, angled inwards to the rail at the
furlong pole and showed some late interest on the rail in deep stretch. GIANT ONE broke outwards on the start, settled in midfield four wide on the first turn,
made little impact three wide with runners on each side on the final turn and passed a couple of weary foes in the stretch. MO TOURIST pressed the pace
between rivals into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter down the back straight, was ridden trying to keep pace with the leaders at the three furlong marker,
could find no more around the bend and gave way in upper stretch. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was brushed inside at the start, stalked near the rear down the
backside, made an early move going around horses four wide at the three eighths marker, could not sustain the run turning for home and tired in
mid-stretch.

Footnotes
STEAK AND CHEESE took control on the rail from the start, relaxed smartly down the backstretch, was pressed briefly outside at the half, was let out a
notch to open up into the turn, extended the advantage smartly around the final turn and cruised home down the stretch. COLEYVILLE co-trailed on the
inside at the half, weaved between foes making his run midway on the far turn, rallied up the fence turning for home, stubbornly chased the winner to the
finish line and bested the rest easily with another solid effort. DERZKII travelled four wide in midfield on the first turn, tracked in the second flight two wide
outside down the back straight, urged three wide on the turn and ran on mildly down the stretch to capture third money in the end. SUNSPEAR had a good
spot watching the front duo rating kindly on the fence down the backside, edged closer inside at the half, chased the winner in vain around the far turn and
faded late in the final sixteenth for a minor role. KIDDIE HOLIDAY stalked close to the back of the pack in the early going, was scrubbed on but could not
close the gap on the leader through the final oval and was one paced down the lane. SOLAR co-trailed on the outside down the back straight, put in a mild
run three wide in midturn but could not get involved in the late stages of the race. NATIVE PRINCE stalked near the rear on the fence down the backside,
was asked to go on three furlongs out, made little impression running around the far bend and showed little in the stretch run. BET settled in midfield
between runners down the backstretch, could not offer a rally throughout the far turn and was not a factor in the drive to the finish line. HULLABALOO
tracked the leader in the first turn, turned up the pressure at the half to press the frontrunner outside, quickly was repelled, was roused between foes
chasing on the far turn and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROSCAR missed the break at the start, stalked near the back having one foe beat down the backstretch, kept pace three wide on the turn, made a smart
move saving ground shifting inside at the quarter pole lengthening stride, angled back out with momentum in the five path making his run and drew off in
deep stretch. PET SOUNDS assumed command at the start, dictated the pace down the backside, battled up front on the fence around the turn, was
determinedly cling to the lead inside in upper stretch, was no match for the surging winner late but held for second money. FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN pressed
the pace between foes two wide at the half, dueled outside for the lead throughout the bend, bid for the lead with runners on either side at the top of the
stretch, was checked briefly in tight quarters with a furlong to go and regrouped late to save third money narrowly at the finish line. SWIFT DELIVERY
hounded the pacesetter three deep on the outside at the half, was coaxed to go after the engaging pair midway on the turn, could not offer a rally five wide
at the top of the lane and stalled in mid-stretch. MYRA'S BOY was void of early speed trailing down the backside, continued to see the field around the turn
and passed a weary rival nearing the wire inside. BEYOND ADVERSITY tracked inside down the backstretch, came under a ride in the second flight behind
the contesting pair around the turn, angled outside to be in the mix of things in the four path turning for home, could not find another gear in the stretch and
yielded in the final sixteenth. RCOF #3 FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN AGAINST #4 ROSCAR AT THE EIGHTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
JIMMIES BIG DAY was in a bit tight along the inside in the early going, advanced inside foes on the turn while moving out late on that bend, came to the top
of the stretch three wide, took over past the three-sixteenths, drew clear while drifting out just a bit late. CLASSIC DANCER was strongly urged at the start,
set the pace inside, was no match but held place. SOUPER SUNSHINE was urged forward from the start but rank and hard to control in the early going,
veered out avoiding a tiring rival in front and brushing a rival at the seven-sixteenths then veered again but more dramatically at the three-eighths, kept on in
the stretch and fought for place over DIAMOND HEIST, who settled toward the back, saved ground near the rail through the turn, came out just a bit for the
drive, improved inside but couldn't get show. LOBBY BAR settled toward the back outside a runners going three to four wide on the turn, moved out six to
seven deep for the drive, ran on. HEAT MERCHANT unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the inside, shifted nine wide in upper stretch, showed some
mild late effort. MR NARCISSISTIC stalked early then moved outside about three deep to draw nearly even coming to the three-eighths, faded in the lane.
ADELAIDE COURT raced outside mid-pack, was bumped outwardly seven deep about the three-eighths, dropped back but passed tired rivals in the lane.
DISSECTOLOGIST was between foes mid-pack, bumped into the outer rival six wide coming the three-eighths, floated out ten wide into upper stretch, failed
to menace. SILENT FORTUNE was brushed at the seven-sixteenths then bumped outward into a rival floating five wide at the three-eighths, fanned out
seven wide for the drive, was not a late threat. SILENT TRIBUTE got away well and under coaxing had the early lead briefly, continued to chase two to
three wide, was done about the five-sixteenths and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY SOUPER SUNSHINE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THIRD AND PLACED TENTH BEHIND SILENT FORTUNE FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
SMART ALMASTY had one rival beaten down the backside, made a bold move accelerating between rivals in hand at the half to get good position inside
entering the far turn, patiently waited with horse behind the leaders with five sixteenths to go, split foes with authority in the two path to gain control in upper
stretch and was kept to the task to the finish to just hold for the victory under a savvy ride. AWESOME ENTRY was allowed to settled trailing the field early
on, galloped along down the backstretch seeing the field, was nudged for more starting to pick up runners entering the far turn, swung outside for clear run
in the six path straightening out for home and was full of run to the wire to just miss getting up for the win. SPEEDY BULLEIT assumed the lead on the rail in
the first turn, continued to set the pace down the backside, was collared outside by runners turning for home and stayed on gamely on the fence through the
stretch to hold for third. AMERICAN DECISION tracked on the outside in the second flight keeping close tabs on the front pair down the backstretch, inched
closer three wide on the far turn, was in the hunt in the five path at the top of the stretch and willingly ran to the wire for a minor role in the end. BUCK'S
FIZZ stalked near the rear three wide outside horses down the back straight, offered a mild rally three wide around foes three eighths from home, swung out
to the five path at the top of the lane and finished evenly down the stretch. MOTION GRANTED stalked near the rear down the backside on the rail, made
little headway saving ground on the final bend and showed some late interest on the fence closing the gap on others in the final furlong. COUNTRY LIVING
pressed the issue in the early stages outside, chased the pacesetter on the final bend, bid for the lead in the four path at the top of the lane but faltered in
deep stretch losing many positions late. RYO AMAZING settled on the rail watching the front duo along the backstretch, had no run to give when asked at
the three furlong marker and retreated through the final turn. GOLD BONANZA was erractic in the two path entering the first turn, travelled on the outside in
mid-pack down the back straight, could not quicken with others starting a rally three furlongs out and lost touch with the field at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LOOSE WIRE set the pace facing pressure from an outside rival, dispatched that one and moved clear by the five-sixteenths, was challenged at the top of
the stretch and briefly headed near the three-sixteenths, dug in and turned back that rival and edged away late under steady urging. HALL OF DREAMS
rated in behind the leading pair inside a foe tracking while saving ground, advanced late on the far turn while being guided out three wide, bid at the top of
the stretch taking a narrow brief lead but was turned back in the lane. STOWAWAY broke a step slowly and was in a bit tight after the break while under a
strong hold and reserved at the rear, raced near the inside, came out in upper stretch and continued to drift under left-handed urging, gained mildly late.
EXUDE tracked from inside about mid-pack, came out in mid-stretch, ran on evenly. GUNS N' ROJAS moved forward outside then settled mid-pack about
three wide, dropped back a bit on the far turn biding time then moved out from four to five wide on that bend, kept on in the stretch. ANITA MARGARITA
settled outside at the back three to four wide early, advanced some four then five wide on the far turn, evened out in the stretch. FANORE (IRE) was
forwardly-placed stalking outside two to three deep, fanned out a bit three to four wide on the far turn while dropping back despite urging, failed to rally.
HANK OLLIE pressed the eventual winner from outside two to three wide, dropped back and faded. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE raced at the back off the
inside in about the two to three path, failed to menace.

Footnotes
TIDAL FORCES was content to track to loose frontrunner down the backside, began to reel in the speedy pacesetter on the final turn, pounced to the lead in
upper stretch and just held on at the wire under a well timed move. STOLEN MONEY travelled on the rail in the third flight down the backstretch, crept
closer on the fence running on the final bend, loomed the main threat in the three path straightening out for the drive to the finish line and just missed with
the late rally at the wire. WINSTON BLUE stalked on the rail near the rear at the half, advanced smartly on the fence throughout the far turn, had clear path
at the top of the lane and found his best stride late to be involved for the win photo in the end. GRANDSON had one beat down the backside, started to
reach for ground four wide passing runners midway on the final bend, swooped around horses eight wide turning for home and closed in with each stride but
ran out of ground. RAPPER ZAPPER was unhurried trailing down the backside, could still see the field on the far turn, started to rally catching up to runners
on the fence in upper stretch and finished with intent to the wire. PROVEN STRATEGIES stalked with runners on each side in the third flight at the half,
improved on the fence running around the final bend, was in range four wide at the top of the stretch but stalled at the furlong marker. NIKKI NOOTS
travelled in midfield down the backstretch, was shuffled back running on the fence through the far turn and could not get interested driving to the finish line.
RED LINE OVERDRIVE took this field into the first turn on the fence, opened up considerably setting a brisk pace down the backside, was collared outside
by the winner turning for home and stopped on the fence in the last sixteenth. TWOWAYCROSSING stalked three wide in the early stages, was asked for
more run at the three furlong marker, had no response and could not get involved in the stretch drive. FLAWLESS RULER was close up four wide on the
first turn, tracked the loose frontrunners outside down the back straight, was scrubbed on for more three eighths out, offered no rally and gave way seven
wide in upper stretch. CONCEALED CARRY settled three deep on the outside in the third flight along the backside, kept pace between rivals on the far turn
but faltered in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
CRUDEN BAY settled off the pace inside on or just off the rail, edged closer racing off the rail in behind runners seeking room two to three deep coming
past the quarter pole, was guided inside a rival at the top of the stretch, rallied inside that one then outside the leader in deep stretch to get up late. TWIN
CITY was intent on the lead and moved forward while shifting in to about the two path, dictated terms hounded by a foe, edged away from rivals coming into
upper stretch, was outfinished. J P HELLISH was taken back off the leading pair despite breaking near the front, stalked those from inside and in behind,
came out four wide at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. RON'S GIZMO bumped a rival lightly at the start, settled outside at the back about four wide,
advanced some on the far turn fanning eight wide into upper stretch, finished well but missed show honors. DANCIN IN DA'NILE settled off the pace,
advanced on the far turn tracking in behind and inside, angled out six to seven deep in mid-stretch, kicked on evenly. HUNT MASTER pressed the pace
from outside about three wide, weakened in the stretch. LAC MACAZA was bumped lightly at the start, rated off the pace three deep, advanced four wide
from the three-eighths pole, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. TARANTO TITAN was in just a bit tight after the start, settled at the back off the
inside, swung out seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. PALIO stalked from outside two to three wide mid-pack, came up empty. KEROUAC switched
outside a foe into the first turn, stalked the leading pair from outside three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
WICKED DJANGO had one rival beaten settling in the two path between foes down the back straight, started to weave through the field navigating a good
trip progressing smartly in the final turn, pounced to bid for the lead five wide at the top of the stretch, took command at the sixteenth pole and held on in a
photo at the finish. JUNIPERO SERRA stumbled mildly behind rivals into the first turn, trailed the field down the backside, moved four wide circling around
horses three furlongs from home, swung outside in the six path straightening out for the wire and closed in strongly to almost get there in the final jump.
LEGAL CATCH was under a snug hold nestled on the fence behind the leaders at the half, was crying out for room on the rail at the quarter pole, had no
path stuck inside behind the tiring leaders in mid-stretch, finally shook clear three wide late and closed in to capture third. PAINTED GLORY pressed outside
in the first turn, continued to hound the pacesetter outside throughout the far turn, dueled up front bobbing heads for the lead down the stretch and gave
way late just being caught for third money at the wire. GOOD NEWS MONEY set the pace on the rail in the first turn, dictated terms with a slim advantage
down the backside, dueled gamely inside in upper stretch, but needed more late and faded on the fence nearing the wire. DARE TO BE KING was off slow
breaking inwards at the start, travelled near the back having one rival beat at the half mile marker, had to wait behind runners on the fence throughout the
final turn and finished with interest having clear run inside in deep stretch. THIS DUDE A BREEZE was squeezed on the break, settled three wide outside in
mid-pack, rallied around foes three wide on the final turn loomed in the four path at the top of the lane but had no more run to give at the furlong pole and
weakened in deep stretch. WAR IN CHARGE prompted five wide outside on the first turn, forced the issue three deep down the back straight, was scrubbed
on for more three wide at the three furlong marker, could not offer a rally and backed away through the field at the quarter pole. GIOVANNINO pressed the
pace four wide between in the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside through the backside, edged closer to the leaders in traffic on the far turn, was in
the thick of things up front three wide turning for home, had to check losing her path at the sixteenth pole and could not regroup in time. BIG SHOOTER
stalked on the outside three deep near the rear, was steadied three wide between horses at the three furlong marker and and had little to show afterwards.
ITS JUST MONEY stalked four deep close to the back of the pack with a half mile to run, offered a brief rally four wide around at the three eighths pole but
came up empty turning for home five wide.
