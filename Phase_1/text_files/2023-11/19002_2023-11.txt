Footnotes
GRAND PRADO dueled on the front end, drove clear around the turn, was all out and held on well for the win. OVERDELIVER pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, made a late bid and finished willingly. WONDER RUN unhurried in the beginning, racing inside entering the turn, angled out around the
turn, made a wide bid and gained ground. WAR RON bobbled at the start, racing from the back, showed late interest, but was no factor. SCRUTINIZER
raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. DIABLO CAT challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and faded. BUNKIE'S
SONG raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. WAR SONG showed early speed and was finished early. EXPECT ROYAL always raced near
the back and showed little. MIDNIGHT BAYOU lacked early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
GOLDENLUTE vied on the front end, took the advantage around the final turn, drove clear, racing four wide down the lane and proved the best. ZIPPY
TOGA void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, angled in down the stretch, split rivals and was a clear second. MY PAL
SWEET pressed the pace, raced outside around the second turn and proved no match for the top two. NINEJUANJUAN CALL lacked early speed, showed
late interest, but was no rear factor. KIT KAT KIDD dueled on the front end, saved ground around the second turn and faded. SASSI ASPEN raced in the
middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and weakened. DEAL WITH HIM raced evenly near the back and showed little. HAIL THE CAT
lacked early speed and was never a threat. YOU YOUR DADDY SON raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun.

MY FRIEND AMY unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear. ALLIACEOUS raced
near the back in the early going, moved up on the outside, followed the winner to the wire and finished willingly. FABS vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. KELA'S TURN dueled on the front end, saved ground and weakened.
TWO MINUTE DRILL pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn, faded and finished evenly. MO CLASSY raced within contention and
faded. TAYLORS TAP raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. SHE A HOT MESS always raced near the back and showed little. BAR TAP
briefly raced near the back, saved ground and dropped back.
