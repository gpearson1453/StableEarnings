Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER dueled for the lead on the rail down the backside, opened up handily on the other early speed rival with five sixteenths to go, had
no challengers down the stretch and coasted in the the wire. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS had a good position tracking the contesting pair down the backside,
took up the running midway on the turn, continued to chase in vain through the stretch, could not gain on the long gone winner down the lane but easily
bested the rest at the finish line. DAWSON SILVER stalked on the rail in the early going, advanced mildly on the rail around the bend and rallied on the
fence driving to the wire to be a distant third in the end. TENPENNY NAIL trailed the field down the backside, began to pick up horses outside in the two
path at the quarter pole, split foes at the furlong marker and finished up on the fringes crossing the wire. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS stalked three deep down
the back straight in mid-pack, offered a brief run two wide outside from the three furlong marker until the top of the lane, could not go on in upper stretch and
stalled in the last furlong. C R HOT SHOT dueled outside down the backstretch, gave way battling with the winner up front by midturn and retreated outside
in upper stretch. MIGHTY PELE bobbled on the break, stalked between foes having one beat down the backside, could not get interested through the turn
and was not a factor driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
TIMESKIP was very lightly brushed at the start, moved forward stalking from outside a foe two to three wide early, moved out gaining four then five wide on
the far turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear and held safe. MUSKOKA GIANT settled off the rail and toward the back, still had much to do
fanning nine wide out of the second turn, couldn't reach the winner but was second best. SILENT LUCIDITY settled mid-pack two to three wide, moved out
six wide in the stretch seeking room, kept on evenly. PHIL IN ECHO advanced inside late up the backstretch and on the far turn moving out late on that
bend, made a brief bid at the top of the stretch but evened out thereafter. CHELSEA DAGGER settled off the pace outside three to four deep, began to
advance some four then five wide on the far turn floating out seven to eight deep for the drive, evened out. QUIET REBEL was unhurried early in hand at
the back, switched out racing well off the inside up the backstretch, advanced outside foes four wide moving out six deep on the far turn, came into upper
stretch about eight wide and was in tight quarters, ran on. FIRST SPRING pressed from inside a foe but off the fence early, contested the pace up the
backstretch edging away past the half-mile marker, was clear into the far turn, challenged turning for home and came up empty. BAYTOWN ELVIS was
urged from the break and very briefly had the early lead then continued to pursue from inside, retreated. SAME AGAIN DOC contested the pace from
outside three wide, was done by the three-eighths and came up empty.

STRONGER TOGETHER was crowded on the start, co-trailed on the outside on the first turn, began to extend his stride at the three furlong marker,
swooped four wide around horses at the quarter pole to take over the lead in the five path with a furlong remaining and was kept to the task to hold safe
outside at the finish line. ROBITAILLE broke inwards at the start, had a good position shadowing the engaged pair three wide outside at the half, kept pace
with rivals around the final bend, angled four wide to be in the hunt straightening out for home, tried stubbornly to reel in the winner late but had to settle for
second best on this day. PERFECT PLAY co-trailed on the rail into the first turn, could see the field running down the backside, began to pick up runners
showing good late energy and closed in the capture third money crossing the wire. CANDY STREET settled in mid-pack four deep on the outside down the
backstretch, made an early move circling rivals three wide at the three eighths marker, briefly had the lead turning for home but stalled at the sixteenth pole.
AIR FORCE RESERVE took this field on the rail into the first turn, was reined back entering the backstretch to switch outside, hounding the pacesetter at
the half, assumed command with five sixteenths to go, was collared outside at the top of the stretch and weakened on the rail in the last sixteenth.
COLLABORATIVE travelled in midfield on the rail, closed the gap on the leaders running inside along the back straight, made little headway on the final turn
and flattened out in the drive to the finish line. SHAMROCK AMBASADOR prompted the pace outside through the first turn,, took control on the fence down
the backstretch, could not maintain forward position on the rail midpoint on the final turn and yielded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ITS A BIRDIE quickly moved forward outside, attended the pace two to three wide, moved to the lead and clear midway up the backstretch, was challenged
through the lane but fought on under steady handling to hold sway. SPEEDY JOHNY settled off the pace three wide into the first turn, moved out four to five
deep later on that bend, advanced mildly on the far turn while tipped out a bit further turning for home, was six deep in upper stretch with aim and moderate
momentum, gained steadily but needed more. MOON POOL stalked in behind two to three wide early then three to four deep on the far turn, kept on a bit
wider in the stretch. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE moved forward inside the eventual winner but off the rail setting a pressured pace from just off the inside, lost
ground early up the backstretch, switched out at the quarter pole coming four deep to the three-sixteenths and regaining momentum, kept on but needed
more late. BRIEF exchanged repeated light bumps at the start, settled off the pace three deep, moved out five wide out of the first turn for the run up the
backstretch, advanced four wide from the three-eighths moving out six wide by the quarter pole and in range, evened out. KEY STROKE broke outwardly
lightly bumping a rival but recovered well and moved forward stalking from mid-division three then four wide around the first turn and up the backstretch,
advanced on the leader past the half drawing just to that one's flank from the outside and put to urging at the five-sixteenths, flattened out thereafter. TOTAL
BETTY switched out off the rail late on the first turn racing in the back part of the field, advanced in behind foes from off the inside three to four deep coming
to the quarter pole, ran on. MANITOULIN ISLAND exchanged repeated light bumps at the start, rated inside mid-division early, moved out entering the far
turn, floated eight wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. SERENADING HALL broke well but was outsprinted to the lead, tracked in behind near the
inside, dropped back and failed to rally. BETKA was squeezed back at the start, altered outside foes erratically entering the first turn racing at the back, was
not a threat.

Footnotes
ALWAYS A WAY was pinballed at the start, tracked with runners on each side down the backstretch, began to inch closer to the leaders under a ride at the
quarter pole to be in range four wide straightening out for the drive, continued to persevere through the lane, seized control at the sixteenth pole and was
edging away at the line for the hard fought win. BAR TALK was unhurried to trail down the back straight, continued at the rear seeing the field but closing
the gap around the bend, swung outside in the five path with momentum turning for home and was gaining steadily down the stretch but could not get there
in time. NATURAL STAR veered inwards on the break, regrouped to press the pace outside down the backstretch, poked his head in front on the outside at
the three furlong marker, fought on stubbornly between rivals to the wire and faded just a few jumps before the wire to settle for third money in the end. RED
SNEAKERS rated kindly on the rail in hand down the backside, waited patiently for room nestled on the fence behind the contesting front pair around the
turn, could not find a clear path to go through multiple times down the stretch and never had a chance to fully lengthen his stride running to the wire.
CANDID CANDACE was bumped outside on the break, recovered to have a slim advantage inside down the back straight, was relegated to forcing the
issue on the rail through the turn, battled gamely inside down the stretch and gave way in deep stretch not beaten all that much at the finish line. SAMURAI
CHALLENGE travelled in midfield tracking three deep down the backside, kept pace with the leaders three wide outside horses throughout the turn, could
not quicken with others turning for home and faltered on the outside in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MAMBOINTHEFOREST settled off the pace outside a runner about three wide, bided time still three deep into the far turn, began to gain momentum turning
for home while fanning seven deep, took aim, drove past seventy yards out. SOCIETY JOE moved forward heading to the first turn, stalked in behind from
off the rail two to three deep, advanced three to four wide on the far turn taking the lead by the top of the stretch, led till inside the final sixteenth and was
outfinished. NATIVE PRINCE settled tracking inside saving ground, advanced two wide to pass a tiring rival leaving the far turn, improved in the stretch but
needed more. ROCKET JOE COPPER was well-placed stalking three deep from outside a rival and in range, swung five wide turning for home, ran on
evenly. HULLABALOO broke a half-step slowly, made a swift middle move outside foes four deep to take the lead by the seven-sixteenths, moved clear into
the turn, was overtaken by the top of the stretch, faltered and faded. A I INITIATIVE settled off the pace shifting in saving ground near the rail through the
turns, came out for the drive, was not a threat. HALF LIT sped clear into the first turn shifting in to set the pace inside, faltered at the top of the stretch and
faded. FLAT OUT VIXEN raced just off the rail last but one early, failed to menace. UNILATERAL broke a step slowly, was devoid of speed and never near
enough to threaten. CARMENOOTZ chased from mid-pack off the inside, tired.

Footnotes
FABLED PRINCE was brushed outside on the break, tracked with runners on either side down the backstretch, bid for the lead two wide just outside at the
quarter pole, led by a narrow margin at the furlong marker and outdueled his stablemate winning by a nod at the wire. PAT'S GAMBLE stalked in the third
flight inside of a rival, closed in running three wide between horses at the quarter marker, bid up front five wide straightening out for the drive and stubbornly
fought to the finish just losing in a tight photo in the end. JAGGERSGOTAGUN settled on the rail behind the frontrunner down the backside, watched
contently on the fence the front threesome midway on the turn, found another gear at the furlong marker and surged late to win the battle for the show
award. THE THUNDERER stalked on the outside in the third flight down the back straight, rallied four wide making a run outside at the quarter pole, had to
angle outside off a tiring runner to be in the seven path at the top of the lane and ran on to the wire just losing the duel for third money. ASK IN MY NAME
stalked near the rear between foes, made little progress running around the bend and showed late energy to finish up with intent in deep stretch. CLIVE
CROSS brushed rival at the start, trailed in the beginning, began to reach for ground passing runners at the three eighths marker and willingly finished to the
wire between horses. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA cleared from the outside to take this field on the rail down the backside, was clinging to the lead on the fence
at the quarter pole, battled inside at the top of the stretch, could not match strides late and emptied out seventy yards from the finish line. MR NOBILITY
tracked three deep on the outside down the back straight, edged closer on the turn to be in the mix three wide up front outside foes at the quarter pole,
could not go on with others starting to rally five wide turning for home and wilted in upper stretch. JUST FOR MADDIE trailed the field on the rail at the half,
could not keep up with rivals through the turn and made no impact in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
ROMEO YANKEE was off just a step slow to start, pulled the rider to the lead outside leaving the chute, was content then, to shadow the frontrunner down
the backside, began to inch closer to the leader at the quarter pole, pounced at the furlong marker seizing the lead outside and drew off impressively when
asked for more in deep stretch. WHADDYA MEAN tracked on the rail at the start, picked up the bit on the fence travelling comfortably to take the lead at the
half, continued to set a reasonable pace up front around the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the furlong pole, offered no resistance and dug in
late to save second place at the wire. JUST THE MAX settled in midfield two wide between horses at the half mile marker, was shuffled back having only
one foe beaten midpoint through the turn, started to rally on the fence turning for home and found more late at the eighth pole and closed in strongly
between rivals to capture third money nearing the finish line. TREBUCHET travelled in midfield inside foes down the backstretch, while in hand improved
steadily on the rail around the turn, was in range behind the front pair in upper stretch and was one paced to the finish line to settle on the fringes in the end.
AMAZON FORESTER travelled in mid-pack four deep at the half, made a good move taking closer order circling foes three wide midturn, was in the mix in
the five path for a piece of the prize straightening out for home, could not sustain the rally and stalled at the sixteenth pole. WICKEDBLACKBULLET stalked
on the rail close to the back of the pack in the early stages, made a brief run two wide between runners with three eighths remaining, angled outside for
clear run to be in range for a small share six wide at the top of the lane and finished up mildly to the wire not posing a threat in the final furlong. HEY LUIGI
had a good position watching outside the front pair down the back straight, edged closer to the leaders in the three path with runners on each side at the
quarter pole, had a chance for a share four wide turning for home, could not go on with others and levelled off in the final sixteenth of a mile. JACK trailed
the field down the backstretch, was roused five wide outside foes at the three furlong marker, offered little response, shifted outside widest in the seven path
at the top of the lane and had little to give driving to the finish line. FIGHTING IRISH had one rival beat down the backside, tried to commence a rally four
wide between horses at the three furlong marker, offered little run around the oval and faltered in the six path turning for home. OSTRACISM pressed the
pace on the inside at the beginning, was throttled back to track the front duo at the half, continued to lose position with three furlongs to go between rivals,
lost touch with the field around the bend and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.
