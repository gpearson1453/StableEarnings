Footnotes
PRACTICALLY BROKE set the pace under pressure from EJ WON THE CUP from outside, maintained a short advantage through the turn along the rail,
edged clear with a furlong left to run, grew a bit weary late but held under strong handling. E J WON THE CUP prompted the pace from outside up the
backstretch and around the turn, lost touch with the winner with a furlong left to run, came back on willingly late and held the place. MONEY MAKES
MONEY off slow to begin, made progress two wide on the turn but had to check behind rivals near the quarter pole, shifted to the inside leaving the bend,
tipped back out in the drive, put in a late run and missed second. SKETCHY chased off the inside then between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two
wide, moved out in the drive and put in mild late bid. EIGHT CLAP settled inside, angled out into stretch, kept on through the drive but failed to threaten.
SHARP LORENZO broke a step slow, stalked from inside to the stretch and faded down the lane. NED tracked outside a pair of rivals leaving the
backstretch, remained three wide to the stretch and lacked a response when called upon. DADDY JUSTIFY broke a step slow, dropped back while racing
greenly, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BIG NOVEL stalked along the three path on the first turn, went four wide into the second bend, drew alongside the leader past the three-eighths marker,
took over late on that bend, kicked clear at the top of the lane and drew off under a drive. CORNELIA FORT antsy in the gate, bobbled a bit at the dispatch,
moved into the three path on the first turn, chased four wide on the second bend, five wide into the lane and bested the rest. TIZZY TWISTER settled in the
two path outside a rival, angled over to the rail once clear of inner rival on the far turn, showed a mild response to urging along the fence and got up for third.
SWEET HELLO sped to the front from inside then set the pace in the two path, moved out on the backstretch, showed the way three wide into the second
bend, tested from outside with three furlongs remaining, moved into the two path while fighting with BIG NOVEL, lost command past the quarter pole and
weakened in the stretch run. I HAD THAT ONE TOO sat off the pace and tucked inside, trailed along the rail into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
NOKIE settled off the pace, moved into range three wide around the bend, put to right then left handed urging, reeled in HOUSE OF MAGIC in the final
sixteenth and drove past. HOUSE OF MAGIC sped clear to set the tone, showed the way along the inside through the bend, roused into the stretch,
remained unchallenged into the final furlong, confronted by NOKIE past the sixteenth pole and yielded late. AVENTAPP was closest in pursuit in the early
going, took aim two wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response when asked and weakened in the late stages. JORDAN stumbled badly leaving the
gate, became a bit rank when reserved early, raced wide up the backstretch then angled into the two path for the turn, traveled three wide leaving the bend
and passed a tired rival. ONE SMOKIN MOON chased along the inside, coaxed into the bend, started to weaken around the turn and tired in the stretch run.
PER RULING EMC2023-241 FROM HIWU, HOUSE OF MAGIC WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSTIVE TEST.

Footnotes
STANDING O stalked from inside, waited for room entering lane and upper stretch, rallied through a tight spot past the eighth pole and edged away under
hand urging. MAS RAPIDO (GB) dueled for command from outside, inched ahead with a furlong left to run but got outkicked by the winner in the final
sixteenth. MOR TEQUILA brushed inner rival leaving the gate, pressed the pace three deep to the stretch, finished willingly in the final furlong and secured
the show. DON'T SWEAR DAVE brushed leaving the gate, chased two then three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and put in a late run but
missed the show. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) settled along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, put in a mild bid but lacked the needed late punch. LOVESICK
BLUES broke well then dropped back early, saved ground through the turn, lacked room in traffic in the stretch, angled in late and kept on willingly to the
wire. RADICAL RIGHT stalked two then three wide on the turn, steered out in upper stretch and lacked further response. HELLADIC dueled for command
from inside, battled to the eighth pole, bothered a bit by the winner shortly after but was already starting to fade.

Footnotes
STAY IN LINE chased three deep or four wide into the turn, bid five wide into the lane, brushed with ROSIE ANN RULES at the top of the stretch, kicked
clear from inner rivals and was kept busy to the wire. ROSIE ANN RULES stalked between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two wide, took aim three
wide into the lane, bid between while brushing on both sides at the top of the stretch and could not match the winner in the furlong grounds.
ELTONSINGSANOTHER set the pace while pressure by rivals on both sides up the backstretch, headed on the turn then inched away from inner rival,
challenged by a pair of rivals entering the lane, brushed at the top of the stretch and weakened. JUST IS pressed the pace from inside up the backstretch,
headed the leader around the bend, could not sustain the challenge into the lane and flattened to fourth. BOUGIE LIKE chased along the rail to the stretch
and faded. STYLISH DRESS prompted the pace three deep to the turn, chased the leaders three to four wide past the five-sixteenths pole and also faded.
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR lacked early speed, trailed two wide into the turn, steered out around the bend and came six wide into the stretch and could not
make an impact. BETSY IS THE CODE sat off the pace early, traveled three to four wide on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LINDA'S GIFT gained command early and controlled the pace on the inside, remained clear to the final bend, tested by outer rival at the five-sixteenths
pole, cleared under coaxing leaving the bend, put to left handed urging past the eighth pole, switch to the right hand in deep stretch and stayed strong to the
wire. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) closest in pursuit through the early going, launched a bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch with LINDA'S
GIFT approaching the stretch, continued to give chase willingly through the final furlong but never found the needed late response. SISTER OTOOLE
unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out with a quarter mile left to run and produced a mild rally to earn the
show honors. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) reserved in the beginning and steered to the inside, saved ground through the turns, came under a ride on the final
bend, steered out in the lane and got outkicked for third. SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE) came away slow from outside, settled in the two path off the pace,
moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. OAKHURST rated along the rail, went two wide into the clubhouse turn then shifted back inside, entered the lane
two to three wide and weakened. WITH LOVE (GB) moved into two path tracking the leader, rounded the clubhouse turn three then two wide, chased three
to four wide into the stretch and faded.

convincingly. PROFESSORS' PRIDE bobbled slightly at the start, raced up close in the two path, drew alongside the leader on the backstretch, dueled into
the far turn, inched ahead past the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for CLIQUISH in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place. HENNYS CRAZY
TRAIN stalked in the two path, chased between foes into the far turn, asked three wide into the lane and summoned a mild response to get up for third.
GILA took control early from the rail position, pressured from outside in the middle stages, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leader
into the lane, churned on from the fence and was edged for the show at the wire. KEEN LADY stalked along the inside then moved into the two path on
clubhouse turn, followed that same course on the second bend and weakened in the drive. ZEYARAAT broke a step slow, went four to five wide on the first
turn, lagged behind up the backstretch, remained five wide on the second bend and was not a factor. LIBERAL LADY broke a step slow, chased four deep
into the first turn, stayed wide up the backstretch, chased along the four path on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ASADA FRIES brushed the gate and inner rival at the start, stalked in the two path, tipped three wide on the far turn, challenged three deep into the stretch,
took over outside the eighth pole and drew away. LAMPORGHINI dueled from outside into the first turn then ceded command, remained close up and
applied pressure in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, took over at the quarter pole and inched ahead, relinquished the lead to ASADA FRIES
approaching the eighth pole and stayed on to hold the place. O K ROSE steered to the inside racing at the back, ridden along two then three wide on the far
turn, chased within striking distance entering the final furlong but could not find more in deep stretch. BIG RAINBOW chased from inside, lost positions
around the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. BEAUTIFUL JANET brushed with outer rival at the start, dueled into the first turn
then took control, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
LADY MONCLAIRE pulled early and moved into the two path racing outside a rival, moved into range and chased three then four wide on the far turn but
flattened out in the lane.
