Footnotes
RAINBOW ANGEL stalked the pace while racing two-wide, moved up strongly to take the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. SHORT
STRETCH was unhurried early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole splitting rivals and finished full of run. POSSE CAT saved ground setting the
pace into the stretch, was no match for the top two but held on fairly well for third. KEEN INTENTION was reserved off the early pace, moved up six-wide
nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. RED ROSE CAFE was off a step slow, then saved ground and improved her position. SARAH
EXPRESS Y G saved ground while racing close up early but lacked a rally when asked. HOLY AMA was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the
stretch but lacked a late response. ASTERN MAID was prominently placed early while four-wide and weakened. PAULA M prompted the early pace while
racing three-wide and tired. MAMIE D saved ground while racing in the middle of the field but failed to seriously threaten. DA LAST TEQUILA hopped at the
start, then raced three-wide and failed to menace. GOSPEL EXTRA was off a step slow, then dropped back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ANNA UP saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through to take the lead entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. OVER BLINGED prompted the
early pace set by Amber's Diamond while racing two-wide, was three-wide entering the stretch but was unable to stay with the winner but held on well for
the place. FULL MOON BEACH was unhurried early, angled out to be four-wide nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. KONA KINLEY was
bumped at the start by UNBRIDLED KISSES, then steadied in tight nearing the half mile pole, dropped back, swung out nearing the eighth pole and was
gaining slightly late. UNBRIDLED KISSES broke in to bump KONA KINLEY then was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and weakened.
AMBER'S DIAMOND saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INCA EMPIRE prompted SHAMAYIM from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear nearing nearing the
eighth pole and maintained his advantage. SHAMAYIM saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed and held on well for the place in a game
try. THUNDERSHOOK stalked the pace while saving ground, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a late response. CALIFORNIA SWING was
reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch to offer a mild bid and then flattened out during the drive. GOSPEL MUSKETEER was
three-wide while being unhurried early, angled in on the back stretch and failed to seriously threaten. UNRESTRICTED was allowed to settle early, came
three-wide into the stretch then drifted further out during the drive and was not a factor.

during the drive and held on fairly well for third. SPIN WHEEL was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, angled out slightly nearing the stretch
but lacked a rally. GLENDALE was forwardly placed while racing four-wide and tired during the drive. RONIC was allowed to settle early while racing

Footnotes
COMMANDER REX came in slightly at the start carrying PROMISE CODE in then saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by
FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER nearing the quarter pole and proved best under strong handling. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER saved ground while racing close up
early, angled out two-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained a slight lead between calls in the stretch but wasn't quite good enough.
KENTUCKY ICE was bumped by PROMISE CODE and pinched back when COMMANDER REX came in, then was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the
final quarter and finished fast. EL SMOOCH was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide and went evenly. PROMISE CODE was carried in by the
winner at the start bumping with KENTUCKY ICE, then settled in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. XKUZ prompted
the early pace from along the outside and tired. ABES DAY dropped back early then came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NATIVE
MOONSHINE was off a step slow, then rushed up to show brief speed, gave way badly after a quarter mile and was eased in the stretch and walked off
following the race. THE RIDER OF KENTUCKY ICE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST COMMANDER REX FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START
BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THAT KENTUCKY ICE WOULD NOT OF BEATEN COMMANDER REX WITHOUT THE
INTERFERENCE SO MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
THIRD STREET was reserved off the early pace, came two-wide into the stretch splitting rivals and was up in the final sixteenth. WISH MAN was allowed to
settle early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. BELL DOZER was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly and had to
steady nearing the eighth pole then angled further out and closed strongly. UNBRIDLED BLING saved ground setting the early pace and weakened slightly
late. TRUE AND READY prompted the pace while racing three-wide and tired during the drive. STORM CATCHER saved ground while being forwardly
placed but lacked a rally. TIGERS 'N BEARS was off slow, dropped back then came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover the lost ground.
OZZIES WINGS Y G saved ground and was not a serious factor.

Footnotes
SOUL SACRIFICE prompted QUALITY BLASTOFF early from along the outside, took the lead from that one entering the stretch and quickly drew clear.
QUALITY BLASTOFF saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when headed by SOUL SACRIFICE entering the stretch but was no match for
that one while hold on well for the place. CANONIZE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well for third in a good effort. OUR MOON
PIE was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. FORTY STRANGERS settled in the middle for the field, came
four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. LA BATALLA bobbled at the start to get away behind his field then saved ground and failed to
menace. YOU'REOBADBOY showed brief speed while racing four-wide and gave way.
