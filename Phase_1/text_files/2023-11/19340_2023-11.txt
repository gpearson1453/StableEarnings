Footnotes
RIVERS OF DENIRO tracked the leaders into the turn while three wide, angled five wide to the clear in a long drive turning for home and closed well finding
his best stride late. REIGNING DREAM stalked the pace through the turn, made a four wide bid from between horses in upper stretch, wore the pacesetter
down in deep stretch and was caught by the winner in the final hundred yards. JUSTA LITTLE MOORE set a pressured pace from the fence to the quarter
pole, shook off the presser in upper stretch but failed to hold off the closers in the final sixteenth. SHAKE THE FROST well placed in the early going to be
just off the leaders, dropped back through the turn and rallied mildly along the fence in the lane. VERNON'S BEST brushed at the start, trailed to the turn
while racing wide, closed ground to upper stretch and failed to sustain his bid. C V DYNAMIC was in tight quarters leaving the gate, trailed most of the way
and was never a threat. TAHLEQUAH JOE dueled on the lead to the head of the lane and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
SORORITY SISTER set a pressured pace from the fence for the first half mile, easily drew clear into the far turn, was kept to task through the lane while
never threatened. STATE OF GRACE unhurried for the first half mile, rallied into the turn and made a steady advance to be second best. BIRDIE'S
CHANTZ stalked the pace to the far turn and failed to respond when called upon while drifting out coming home. SAVESOMEFORME went evenly without
ever posing a threat. WAR MOON pressed the pace in the first turn racing three wide between rivals and steadily faded. SPUN PRETTY raced four wide in
the first turn bumping rival, rushed up to duel on the pace, gave way into the turn, was pulled up on the final turn having bled, and walked off.

Footnotes
MAKING ME CRAZY tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, saved ground through the turn while passing rivals, tipped out in upper stretch
and closed well to wear the pacesetter down in deep stretch. WOODLAND WALK set a pressured early pace, pulled clear through the turn, widened in
upper stretch but could not hold off the closing winner late. MALIBU CLASSIC reserved off the leaders down the backstretch, circled five wide in the turn
and ground out the show placing. UNCLE EARL pressed the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. VENETIAN DREAM was unhurried to
race mid-pack from four wide and failed to mount a rally. ROCK ON KITTEN failed to menace. AMIGO'S AFFAIR stalked the pace from three wide into the
turn and faded. LORD OF LEGENDS broke a step slow while awkward and raced at the rear of the field as a non-factor.

Footnotes
HEZA PISTOL unhurried in the early going, rallied three wide in the turn under an early drive, drifted out to the five path in upper stretch and kept coming,
wearing his rivals down through the lane. SEEKING FREEDOM stalked the pace down the backside, circled four wide to engage the leaders midway in the
stretch and was out-finished late by the winner. LUCKY VICTOR set the pace on a clear lead to the head of the lane, responded when challenged in upper
stretch and weakened inside the final sixteenth. LIVING THE DREAM reserved off the pace to the turn, cut the corner rallying turning for home, threatened
in mid-stretch and flattened out. OLLIE'S FOLLY was unprepared at the start to break awkwardly, rushed up down the backside, raced rank to the turn, and
came up empty in the lane. ONE STEP ASIDE contended early, dropped back entering the turn and posed no threat. KOZWHAT was outrun.

RIVOLI pressed the pace through the turn from two wide, dueled with the pacesetter through the lane and pulled clear in the final hundred yards.
QUARANTINO set a pressured pace from the fence to the head of the lane, dueled through the stretch, was out-finished late to be second best. LAST
COOKIE reserved off the early pace, rallied two wide in the turn and kept on in the stretch to be up for the show from the inside. HITSVILLE tracked the
leaders from three wide to the quarter pole and failed to gain ground down the stretch. MSHINDI well placed along the rail in striking distance in the turn and
failed to respond when called upon. MAS ORO stalked the leaders through the turn and faded in the lane. NAPA DUDE was never a threat. CREATIVE
BEAT was not a factor.

TWISTED JUSTICE sped up the fence to take command entering the main track, set a pressured early pace, opened a clear advantage at the head of the
lane when called upon and drew off as much best without being threatened. DANZANITEAWAY bumped from the inside at the break, dropped to the rear of
the field to be well back early, made up ground to the turn, circled five wide in the turn and steadily advanced down the lane to gain the place. FEELING
EASY tracked the pacesetters down the backside, ranged up at the quarter pole and failed to sustain her bid in the lane finishing evenly. TIERNEY pressed
the pace through the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. MAYBETHEONE broke outward bumping rival away from the gate, moved to a stalking
position down the backside and flattened out in the stretch. LUCKY STUFF chased the early pace, pulled up at the three-eighths pole with an injury and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
OKLAHOMA JOE sped to the front from the gate, took a clear lead down the backside, widened his advantage through the turn and held on gamely late.
CASUAL ATTIRE reserved off the pace to be mid-pack along the fence, rallied through traffic on the turn from three wide, emerged in the clear at the head
of the lane to be closing inside rivals, and drifted out down the stretch while steadily gaining on the winner. RELISH THE RIDE slow early to be well off the
lead to the far turn, rallied wide circling the field around the bend and finished with a good belated rally in the middle of the track. CONTROLLER settled in
hand while racing two wide into the far turn, worked through rivals on the bend, angled inward in upper stretch and closed willingly through the lane. RED
HEAD KID stalked the leaders from four wide down the backside, chased through the turn and failed to gain ground in the stretch drive. BIG TRUCK rated
along the rail in the run down the backside, closed ground on the turn splitting rivals and made a mild bid in the lane. ROMANTIC COWBOY prompted the
pace to the head of the lane and weakened down the stretch. THAT'S THE WAY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and picked up positions in
the stretch. PRESSLEY RIDGE trailed to the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE well placed just off the leader down the
backside, made a three wide bid in the turn and gave way coming home. FIRST SONG was parked six wide in the first turn, continued in that path down the
backstretch while prominently placed and flattened out. DR. ZARNETT raced five wide through the first turn, settled near the rear of the main body down the
backside and lacked a rally posing no threat.
