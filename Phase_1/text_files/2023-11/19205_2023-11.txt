Footnotes
HAPPY HELEN was unhurried while in the three path down the backstretch, raced through the turn from the two path, gained momentum in late turn and
into the lane while near the inside, angled into the four path approaching the eighth pole, split the two leaders soon after and drew clear. CRICKENBERGER
chased the pace from the three path and two wide into the turn, bid in late turn and into the lane, was in the four path when straightened in the lane, gained
a short and short-lived lead near the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. WHISKEY LULLABY raced
on a clear lead through the far turn, came into the lane with a short lead, briefly dueled with the runner-up into the lane then yielded to the top two. MISS
GOODBAR was unhurried while near the inside, continued to trail into the turn then offered a belated rally along the rail. MIZZEN ASH raced in the three
path through the far turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the six or seven path showed interest to the wire. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE saved ground
through the far turn, came off the inside into the lane and needed more. JENNY LIND chased the pace from the three path into the far turn and was empty
through the lane.

Footnotes
SECRET GLENDA was bumped at the start from outside rival, hustled up to vie for the lead into the turn, continued on near even terms into the lane,
cleared outside the eighth pole then was all out to the wire to last. MIDNIGHT ANGEL raced near the inside through the turn, guided to the four or five path
for the drive, was gaining while drifting out two paths for each left-handed urging, continued to gain through the final sixteenth while continuing to drift out
late under right-handed urging and just missed, finishing in at least the twelve path. QUERENDONA pressed the early pace three wide, taken off the duel to
chase the rivals through the turn and into the lane, bid from the five path into the lane, drifted in toward the leader nearing the eighth pole, was steadied
slightly and continued on to save third while eased up on late. PICCANTE chased the pace from the two path into the turn, was in a bit tight and steadied
near mid-turn when rival moved through along the rail, continued in the three path into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat. ONDA BRAVA vied
for the lead from the two path through the turn then faded through the lane. SUCRE CECILE in the three path through the turn when between rivals,
continued in the five path into the lane and tired. SCOOT ALONG was four wide through the turn and never factored. CADEY'S COUGAR raced three wide
and between rivals through the turn, swung into the lane from the eight path and tired. FROLICKING LADY was pinched back entering the far turn, dropped
back to trail and was never in it from the three path. LIONS LAW raced four wide and in the five path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
FOR MAMA chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, was under a drive through the final eighth and just
prevailed. BRENTSPENCE was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, angled to the rail inside the eighth
pole and rallied to just miss. COG set the pace while under pressure and racing near the inside, continued with a short lead into the lane while in the three
or four path then yielded to the top two while staying on for the show spot. EPIC THE LEGEND raced in the three or four path through the turn, came into
the lane from the five path, had aim on the top ones into the lane then weakened late. SUNSIGN chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid
along the inside into the lane and finished evenly. MYSTERY IMPACT saved ground through the turn and never was a factor. MISTER MACHO pressed the
pace two wide into the far turn, continued a contender into late turn and was done entering the lane. PABLO'S SUN trailed throughout. AN OBJECTION BY
THE TRAINER OF #7EPIC OF LEGEND AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3 FOR MAMA FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ARDIS cleared early while in the two path, continued in the two path down the backstretch and into the turn while slowly widening the advantage, came into
the lane well clear and had her largest advantage at the wire. DASH OF SIMPLICITY chased the winner while along the inside, bid into the lane while along
the rail, briefly looked like a threat approaching the eighth pole then was no match for the winner while saving the place spot. AMAZINGNESS trailed for half
while near the inside, remained on the inside through the turn when gaining momentum, came off the inside for the drive and slowly gained through the lane
while closing in on the place spot. CLASSY DREAM was in the three path through the turn and tired. SPOTTY SHOWERS raced in the three path through
the turn, came into the lane three wide and in the four path and gave ground. TIZ ABBY raced in the two path into the far turn and steadily faded.
LIEUTENANT KITTY raced in the five path through the first turn, continued in the four path on the far turn and was never in it.
