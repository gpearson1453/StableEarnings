AUNTIE BEV broke midpack, sent and cleared rivals in the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, lugged out five to six paths heading into the stretch,
rider let her keep her momentum and kept to task to the wire to prove best. PRINCESS AMANDA chased leader in between rivals, stayed in between rivals
on the turn, had dream run along the inside when rival lugged out, dueled in the final sixteenth and outgamed by lugging out rival. AROUSING LOVER
chased pace along the inside on the turn, had to steady briefly on the turn, re-engaged and stayed on well to hold third. STARSHIP SKY away cleanly,
lacked needed speed to keep up early, settled well off the place on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn, and showed run late to improve. ABBEY
OOPS chased pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three to four wide on the turn, in range in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. AM
YISRAEL CHAI stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn and came up empty when roused in the lane. PLEASE
