TRACK SMART vied for the lead, raced in between foes in the five path, took control after the half separating herself from the rest of the field, drew off down
the stretch showing to be the best of this group tonight. SERAPE raced from mid pack, quickly advanced while racing in the four path, split rivals and raced
in between while gaining ground, on the back side, was kept to task, could not catch the winner but out grinded the rest of the filed. FOR REAL ALICE raced
from off of the pace, raced in the two path and saved ground, settled in hands, bid after the half mile pole and improved position, shifted into the four path
down the stretch but had to much ground to make up and did not have enough today. MYFRIENDSAWINNER raced mid pack, saved ground and raced in
the two path, had no impact tonight. HARRIET'S DREAM vied for the lead, raced two wide, set the pace from the inside of a large group, then was done
early. DOLLY'S GUITAR was off in mid pack, raced in the five and six paths, and ran an even race. SUMMERTIME BANDIT was sent to the lead and
stopped early on. DEBBIES PASSAGE vied for the lead, raced three wide, settled a bit and stalked the pace, then maintained that position through out.

racing on the rail, rallied after the half, pacing with the eventual winner into the stretch, battled, but was second best today. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY
settled off of the pace, raced along the rail, saved ground through out, started moving up after the half mile pole, gained ground and improved position,
shifted into the three path in the upper stretch but had no late kick. REBECCA'S DREAM raced in the four path, was off mid pack and quickly advanced into
a stalking position, rallied through the turn improving position then faded. MY IDEA stalked the leaders from the three path but could not get involved tonight.

Footnotes
MORO MAFIA stalked the blistering pace from the two path, launched a bid while racing through the turn, cleared the tired leaders in the upper stretch, was
kept to task, drew off for the win. MAJESTIC MANDATE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and raced on the rail, launched a bid at the half mile
pole, improved position, passed rivals from the rail and was in contention in the upper stretch, could not get past the winner but was second best today.
OXXON was off mid pack and raced in the two path, shifted into the five path, launched a bid, circled the field through the turn, chased the leaders into the
upper stretch but to no avail. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN raced from off of the pace, raced in the five path, raced in company with another rival, improved
position and gained ground along the back side and in the upper stretch but it was not enough today. VALIANT DEFENDER was off of the pace, settled for
the first half of the race, found his stride and launched a bid after the half mild pole, improved position and gained ground while matching strides with
another rival, but had too much to do and not enough late kick. MAJOR DEAL was off slow, trailed in the four path, passed tired rivals late. JANET'S DEVIL
vied for the lead, raced on the rail while setting a hot pace battling with another front runner, dueled, then stopped. KURT'S CHOICE vied for the lead, raced
two wide while setting a fast pace, dueled with another rival for the first half of the race then both pace setters tired out. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY raced off of
the pace and was never involved.
