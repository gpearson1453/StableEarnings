SECRET POCKET broke inwardly at the start, tracked along the inside, pursued with run just off the rail behind the leaders nearing the lane, chased inside
of rivals in upper stretch, shifted outside of the clear leader while inching closer at the furlong grounds, bid soon after and edged past. MAN ON THE MOON

place. INDIAN GULCH trailed in the three path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch then ran on well outside of foes to gain show nearing the final
sixteenth. BEST OF GREELEY stalked three wide, ranged up to offer a bid nearing the turn, but was turned away by the leader in upper stretch and yielded
between horses leaving the furlong grounds. P H FACTOR vied two wide and faded between horses entering the lane.

ALTERED SHOT set the pace in the two path, leaned to the three path entering the lane, inched clear of pursuers while drifting a bit outwardly at the furlong
grounds, straightened course and held sway. DEALING JUSTICE pressed in the three path and between horses, failed to the keep pace with the leader
while getting floated to the four path entering the lane, yet sustained a chase outside of foes to regain place at the wire. FASHION RAGE bumped with an
inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, brushed with an inner rival and subtly backed out between horses at the half mile pole, trailed the short field around
the turn, took aim between foes in upper stretch, ran on to gain place passing the furlong pole, but was caught by an outer counterpart late. BACKYARD
MONEY bumped the outer part of the starting gate upon leaving it and came out a step slow, stalked close up along the inside, bid inside of the drifting
leader entering the lane, but was turned away nearing midstretch and flattened out. MEGAN'S CLARA bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked
forwardly in the four path and outside of rivals around the turn, but was floated to the five path entering the lane and faded.

Footnotes
ALEXANDER HELIOS set the pace in the two path, built a clear margin into the far turn, showed the way unencumbered and well in hand around that bend,
was set down as an outer rival took aim entering the lane and held sway thereafter. BEN FRANKLIN stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear
leader and from the the three path entering the lane, but drifted out from being shown a left handed crop at the three sixteenths pole, straightened out and
sustained a chase into the final furlong, but drifted out once more while in pursuit at the sixteenth pole and was second best. GAME KEEPER tracked two
wide and between horses, inched place and stalked the clear leader from the three path around the far turn, but yielded to the top pair while entering the
lane in the four path, vied for show among rivals coming to midstretch, shifted inwardly and across a foe's path at the furlong grounds, then clung to show
between foes through the final furlong. TREBLE CLEF pressed the leader from the three path, but failed to sustain pressure approaching the far turn,
chased under urging from the four path around that bend, sustained stride after getting floated to the five path entering the lane, vied for show with inner
rivals thereafter but missed. TIZ WICKED STRONG laid off of the pace along the inside, tugged briefly behind foes at the seven furlong pole, then saved
ground around the far turn, bid for show in upper stretch, vied for that position through the final furlong but was denied. BEARINGS raced at the rear in the
three to four path around the first turn, then two wide around the far turn, but lacked a rally between horses in upper stretch, then steadied when an outer
foe shifted across his path at the furlong grounds. ICE TIME tracked three wide, came under urging further off of the pace in the four path around the far
turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor.

NEOM BEACH stalked three wide, bid and vied around the far turn, gained an advantage turning for home, shifted out as an outer rival inched closer
entering the final furlong, straightened out momentarily before drifting again in the final sixteenth, yet held sway. YES TO CHAMPAGNE prompted two wide,
vied between horses into the far turn, got outmoved by her outer counterpart nearing the lane, tipped out to retake aim outside of that one in upper stretch,
inched closer nearing the final furlong, but was floated outwardly at that juncture, kept on to sustain her bid through the final furlong but was kept at bay.
FANTASTICAL set the pace along the inside, vied with a pair of outer bidders around the far turn, got headed turning for home, sustained pursuit through
upper stretch, shifted off the inside nearing midstretch before shifting back inwardly as the leader drifted out at the furlong grounds, but lacked a rebid and
gave way. VOICE FROM ABOVE broke half a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. ADRASTEIA trailed in the four path and
was outrun.

ST. ELMO pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, drifted three wide at the three sixteenths pole before rivals took
aim from both sides entering midstretch, shifted out twice through the final furlong to meet an outer challenge and held sway. INEXORABLE took contact
from an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside into the first turn, but pulled forward entering the backstretch, chase from behind the
leaders around the far turn, entered the lane three wide before taking aim two wide and between horses in midstretch, attempted a bid inside of the leader in
the final furlong but was denied. HURRY HURRY settled off of the pace in the two to three path, was roused for gain in the four to five path and outside of
rivals around the far turn, progressed to be within striking range in upper stretch, but leveled off and was kept at bay through the final furlong. LUNA VIEJA
set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, got headed entering the lane, kept on through midstretch but yielded in the final
sixteenth. WHAT'S UP DOC broke out and bumped a rival at the start, stalked three wide, pursued under urging around the far turn, but yielded in the four
path and between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
ICICLES set the pace two wide, inherited a clear margin into the turn, showed the way well in hand while taking the turn in the two path, widened under a
drive in upper stretch and was put to wraps with a sixteenth to go. VICKI ROSE brushed the inner half of the starting gate and broke slowly, stalked inside of
rivals while a path off of the rail, moved forward between rivals into the turn, gained place while tipping to the three path at the three furlong pole, stalked the
clear leader turning for home, but quickly failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and safely maintained place. CRUSHED ICE broke outwardly,
tracked four wide, chased in the five path around the turn, yet sustained stride to edge show in midstretch. LADAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival at
the start, eased back and was allowed to settle at the rear in the two path, but was shuffled back behind a faltering foe leaving the three furlong pole,
steadied and lost action soon after, then regained stride in upper stretch and moved up inside of foes. ITSABLINGTHING tracked three wide, pursued in the
four path around the turn but tired between horses through the final furlong. ALWAYSGOTOTHEPARTY was bumped and bothered by an inner rival at the
start, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but leaned inwardly in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
MARKET PROFILE prompted inside of the eventual winner early on, but faltered into the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
LEXA settled off of the pace along the inside, moved out to the three path approaching the backstretch, crept closer in the four path into the far turn, bid
three wide turning for home, dueled with an inner game PIGALLE into the final furlong and edged past that one in the final sixteenth. PIGALLE set the pace
moving to the inside around the first turn, encountered a pair of outer challenges turning for home, dug in and dueled gamely with an outer LEXA through
the final furlong, but was bested in the late stages. LET'S DUET was slow into stride and lagged behind the rest around the first turn, swung from the four
path to the eight path entering the lane and rallied outside of foes to gain show late. DEAR LADY laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the six
path with three furlongs to go, ranged closer entering the lane, gained show in midstretch but was caught by an outer oncharging foe in the final sixteenth.
QUEEN OF MISSOULA laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six to seven path in upper stretch and moved up while shifting ground inwardly.
TOWER BRIDGE pressed three to two wide around the first turn, then faltered between rivals entering the far turn. POBLANO broke outwardly, tracked four
to three wide around the first turn, gained place into the far turn, bid two wide along with an outer foe turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch and
caved in hand through the final furlong. HER LADYSHIP pursued from midpack in the three to four path, chased the main group around the far turn and
faded. NEW BEAT stalked along the inside, slipped inside of a faltering foe before chasing the trio trio from the two path turning for home, fanned out to the
four to five path entering the lane and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
HIGH CLASS set the pace in the two path, inched away in upper stretch and held sway. CURRENT CLIMATE prompted the leader from the three path,
chased while failing to sustain pressure into the turn, spun for home in the four path and ran on well in pursuit to prove second bet. LADY GOLDSTART
tracked two wide and between horses, entered the lane in the three path and chased evenly. MINER'S QUEEN tracked four wide, yielded in upper stretch
and surpassed a tiring inner rival in the late stages. LAURA'S CHARM stalked along the inside and gave way. TALES OF HOME laid off of the pace in the
three to two path and lacked a bid between horses late. FRANGO ELECTRICO hopped and stumbled upon landing at the start, trailed along the inside and
was outrun.

Footnotes
SING A LITTLE SONG broke outwardly, raced at the rear into the turn, gained in the five path around the bend, fanned to the seven path entering the lane,
sustained a long rally to reel in the clear leader passing the sixteenth pole and drove past late. UP THE CREEK tracked in the five path, inched closer
tucking to the two path at the three furlong pole, tipped out and took aim outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid in the five path entering the lane,
drove clear approaching midstretch, but was collared by an outer on-charging foe at the sixteenth pole and was bested late. SWEET MIMI took light but
simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, split foes at the furlong grounds to
claim show and held that position late. CLASSIC MYSTERY broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, fanned to the four path nearing the lane, then
rallied to split foes in the late stages but missed reaching show. CONTROLLED TEMPER broke outwardly, gained in the five path from off of the pace into
the turn, but was floated back to the five path turning for home, flattened out while getting outkicked in midstretch, yet kept on to miss show. SISTER ELLA
vied three to two wide, entered the lane in the four path as an outer rival offered a bid, but was outkicked and tired between horses. IUKA MISS pursued off
of the pace two wide and between horses, then three wide around the turn and ran on evenly among foes. SPIRITUAL LADY bobbled slightly at the start,
set the pace inside of vying rivals, sparred with an outer foe around the turn, got headed by that one and a wider bidder entering the lane and weakened
through the final furlong. MYDIXIELANDDELIGHT lacked speed three wide and between horses, retreated to trail turning for home and made little impact.
WINDY WALK broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. MARCO SUNSET pressed four to three wide into the turn, but was
floated four wide turning for home and weakened between horses. CONTRABBANDA prompted the pace two wide and between horses for a quarter mile,
but failed to keep pace at the half mile pole and wilted around the turn.
