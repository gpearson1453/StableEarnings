Footnotes
SILVERWIND had good early speed then dueled going around the turn, as they were coming down the stretch they pulled away slightly giving them a three
quarters length victory. MOONLITE GRAHAM pressed the pace thru the turn then dueled IMA BLING CAT down the stretch and pushed them out and in a
result, got disqualified. IMA BLING CAT ran off pace not far back from the leaders then coming down the stretch made a late bid and got bullied by
MOONLITE GRAHAM late into the stretch. REVIVAL shuffled back before the turn then coming out of the turn rallied strong down the rail to make up
ground. THOUGHTS OF GOLD started in the middle of the pack but as the race progressed they fell back. VODKA TWIST trailed throughout the race.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY IN THE LATE STRETCH, ON THE MOONLITE GRAHAM IMPEDING IMA BLING CAT, AFTER REVIEW THE
STEWARDS DETERMINED TO DISQUALIFY MOONLITE GRAHAM TO THIRD BEHIND IMA BLING CAT.
