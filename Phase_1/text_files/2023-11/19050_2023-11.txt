MERIT prompted the leading duo in the six path, bid midway around the turn, swept to the lead while tipping into the two path entering the stretch, and
kicked clear under a drive. ALWAYS BE SMART broke in at the start, chased in the three path, shifted to the rail early into the turn, swung back out to the
seven path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. CACIQUE ABARRIO broke out at the start, set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two
path midway around the turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch for show. PARIS SURPRISE pressed in the five path but faded from the six
path in the stretch. REGULAR ARMY got pinched at the start, raced wellback in the five path, tipped into the four path under a drive turning into the lane, but
did not factor. REGGAE MAN stalked in the five path but faded turning into the stretch. MOHAY PLEASE dwelt at the start, trailed in the two path and never
threatened. MODERN LANE ducked in at the gap leaving the chute, raced off the pace inside but was done early.

was cued while floating out to the six path into the stretch, and drew further clear. APURO stalked in the four path, was ridden in the three path into the far
turn, got floated out to the seven path entering the lane, and chased on for place. AMAZING JETT broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced wellback along
the inside, shifted out under a ride midway around the far turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and was up for show. SABIAN tracked in the two path,
was driven along the inside into the far turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch. NOBLE STAR trailed in the three path early and did not factor
from the five path down the lane. KINSMAN REDEEMER steadied into the first turn, rated in the three path down the backstretch, but never threatened.

Footnotes
EL SOCIO led in the two path early, settled off an intent X Y TIME around the first turn, raced closest to the that foe in the three path from there to midway
around the far turn, swept to the front near the five-sixteenths pole, was confronted by GRANDE SOIREE near the quarter pole, dueled outside of that foe to
deep stretch and drew clear late. GRANDE SOIREE raced in range two wide, bid between foes leaving the five-sixteenths pole, reached near even terms
inside of the winner near the quarter pole, dueled to deep stretch and gave in late. GOOCH GO BRAGH saved ground in midpack, advanced three wide
around the far turn and ran on for the show. BURNING MAN raced off the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. POUND GREEN
saved ground off the pace, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. CUPID'S DUDE played no factor while racing three and four wide.
TIMMY M. was outrun while racing three and four wide. XY TIME sped off three wide around the first turn, set a clear pace inside down the backstretch but
faltered near the five-sixteenths marker.
