Footnotes
JOHN'S ROCK chased the leader in the four path into the stretch, responded under right handed urging to make the lead nearing the furlong marker and
drew off under brisk handling. BREEZY MONEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then was no
match for the winner. STAR HAWK allowed to settle, improved position in the five path entering the far turn and was clearly the best of the rest.
DISCLOSURE unhurried early, passed tiring rivals in the seven path through the stretch. SUMMERFEST stalked the early pace and was through after a
half. SO DIALED IN checked behind the winner at the seven eighths pole, was within striking range for a half then gave way. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR
raced wide and was outrun. REGULAR GUY was no factor.

Footnotes
MY GIRL KEW delayed the start while reluctant to load, rushed to contention three then two wide, made the lead after a quarter, set the balance of the pace
and widened at will through the stretch to win as much the best under a hand ride. OFFICIALLY YOURS pressed the pace three then two wide into the
stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. MISS SPRINGSTEEN well placed, improved position two wide into the stretch and was
clearly the best of the rest. DERBY DAY KISS away alertly, set the early pace along the inside and weakened on the turn. MAC'S CAILIN was no factor.
POINTOF ATTRACTION had brief speed inside. RIVERS RUN RED was outrun. SHAMANS IMAGE no never involved.
