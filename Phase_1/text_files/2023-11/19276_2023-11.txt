Footnotes
HIGHLANDS broke a step slow from outside, steered down to the rail trailing early, inched closer up the backstretch, had to pause briefly behind INTO
YELLOWSTONE and altered out to the three path midway around the far turn, challenged ACCLAIMED PREACHER into the stretch, took over with a
furlong left to run and drew off in deep stretch. ACCLAIMED PREACHER broke well then raced keenly under some restraint three deep into the first turn,
moved into the two path chasing the leaders around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep on the second bend, cleared past the quarter pole but was soon
challenged by HIGHLANDS entering the lane, dueled to the eighth pole and was no match for the winner in the furlongs grounds but stayed on to secure the
place. SAKURA BLOSSOM tracked in the two path, trailed on the inside into the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, moved to with striking distance with
a furlong left to run but finished evenly late. MISS PIXY STIX dueled for command from inside, fought inside rivals on the far turn, lost touch with
ACCLAIMED PREACHER past the quarter pole and weakened. INTO YELLOWSTONE off slow in the beginning, rushed up between rivals then dueled
outside MISS PIXY STICK, fought between on the far turn then started to weaken around the bend and retreated in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCIP forwardly placed early, bid three deep at the quarter pole, put away inner rivals approaching the eighth pole and was ridden out while drawing off.
VAGABOND SHOES bumped by inner rival at the start, took a bump from BRACE FOR IMPACT early, went up to press the pace from outside while
tugging in hand, raced on even terms around the bend, fought between rivals past the quarter pole, could not kick on with PRINCIP in the final furlong but
stayed on to secure second. COOL PAPA G off a bit slow to begin, chased outside a rival early, three then four wide on the turn, got to within striking
distance entering the furlong grounds but needed to find more late. SUPERMAX broke out and bumped VAGABOND SHOES and dropped back, went four
wide into the turn, trailed while angling down to the two path around the bend and churned on to improve position. STORM THE NIGHT sped clear then set
the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, dueled around the turn then vied inside rivals late on the bend, fought to upper stretch and weakened, pulled up
and unsaddled following the race and walked off. EAGLES LANDING chased along the rail into the turn, steered out and came five wide into the lane and
weakened. BRACE FOR IMPACT drifted in and bumped rival early losing his action for a couple jumps, chased four wide into the turn, six wide into the lane
and came up empty.

Footnotes
SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, swung out with a quarter mile remaining, rallied and drew alongside MEGA
MOON with a sixteenth remaining and drove past late. MEGA MOON tracked in the two path, between rivals on the far turn, chased three wide turning for
home, collared entering deep stretch and took over but got outkicked by the winner. SANGER stepped to the front and moved inside, coaxed along on the
far turn still clear of the field, put to right handed urging in upper stretch, remained unchallenged into the final furlong but was reeled in at the sixteenth pole
by outer rivals and saved the show. ST IGNACIO tucked inside at the back, angled out on the far turn and came six wide into the lane, showed a mild
response to urging but could not get by SANGER for the show. REMOTE stalked three deep early, remained off the rail and came four wide into the drive,
steadied past the eighth pole and was ridden out to the wire. GOLDENEYE closest in pursuit in the two path, came under a ride on the far turn, chased the
leader into the final furlong and weakened in deep stretch. DISCRETIONARY DAY stalked the pace from inside, ridden along the rail through the second
bend and faded. THE RIDER ABOARD REMOTE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THE
CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
GIOVINAZZO bobbled leaving the gate, went up duel two to three wide into the first turn then took control from outer rival, set the pace under pressure up
the backstretch, shook free on the far turn, came out into stretch and further out in the lane, then held safely to the wire. BIG BUZZ bobbled leaving the gate,
trailed on the inside early, moved out on the backstretch, rallied four wide on the far turn, got to within range of GIOVINAZZO in the stretch but lacked the
needed late punch to threaten the winner. GOOD JUJU chased four then three wide early, moved up alongside the leaders three deep in the middle stages,
lost touch with the leader approaching the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and weakened. SEATTLE BREAKOUT raced up close three to four
wide on the first turn, pressed between rivals to the far turn, could not keep pace with GIOVINAZZO past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive.
SETTECENTO tracked inside to two wide on the clubhouse turn, went three then four wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response. PARK
CITY stumbled leaving the gate, tracked three wide into the first turn then angled over to the inside, saved ground through the far turn and weakened.

MONTANA chased three then two wide on the first turn, inched closer three deep in the middle stages, came under a ride on the far turn, spun three wide
into the lane, chased after the leader into deep stretch and dug in late overtake the runner-up in the closing moments. CHAOS REIGNS cleared and steered
to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, put to the left hand with a furlong remaining, challenged by MONTANA late and could not hold that rival at bay.
MY PARTNER GLEN went four wide into the first turn then angled in a few paths, advanced between rivals on the backstretch and far turn, tipped four wide
into the lane but needed to find more to threaten the top pair. VENOM tracked four wide then three deep on the first turn, rounded the second bend in the
four path and weakened down the lane. REEF CITY tracked in the two path then got bumped from inside on the first turn, saved ground through far turn and
lacked a response when called upon. DONTTESTYOURLUCK sent from the gate and chased on the inside before lugging out and bumping rival while rank
on the first turn, ridden along three then four deep on the backstretch, traveled in the four path turning for home and failed to menace. RANGER JOE
forwardly placed on the inside early, started to weaken around the far turn and tired down the lane. LEN'S LUCK became fractious in the gate, broke a step
slow, traveled along the inside and tired. BIG GEORGE antsy in the gate, broke poorly, got forced out on the first turn then moved back inward, traveled
three deep into the second bend, spun three wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
PLANETARIO (BRZ) broke a step slow then tucked inside near the back, drew closer while moving off the rail to the two path on the far turn still patiently
handled, split foes in upper stretch and rallied to take over midstretch and held gamely over outer rivals in the final moments. FRANCESCO CLEMENTE
(IRE) was off slow to begin and trailed on the inside, continued at the back to the final bend, swung out into the stretch, rallied widest and missed. LUKKA
(CHI) settled along the inside, rounded the clubhouse turn in the two path, chased three deep into the lane, bid four deep with a furlong left to run and
finished gamely between late. BALLADEER sprinted clear and crossed to the inside, pressured a bit on the backstretch before moving clear past the
half-mile pole, ridden along on the final bend, put to right handed urging at the top of the stretch, showed the way to the eighth pole, challenged by several
rivals in the furlong grounds and weakened. SPEAKING SCOUT sat off the pace outside a rival in the two path, spun three wide into the lane, steered out in
upper stretch and lacked a rally. EASTERN OCEAN angled to the inside chasing out of range, inched closer on the clubhouse turn, waited for room with a
quarter mile left to run, tried to tip out in upper stretch but got hemmed in at the eighth pole, moved out into the clear midstretch but could not regain
momentum. ASTRONAUT stalked from inside then moved into the two path, applied some pressure early on the backstretch before chasing again past the
half-mile pole, , came under a ride midway on the final turn, took aim at the leader in the two path entering the lane, moved out in upper stretch and
weakened.

between into the far turn, came four wide into the lane, surged in deep stretch and missed. FULL SCREEN took control and moved inside, pressured in the

Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE bumped with inner rival early, dueled inside COCKTAIL PRINCESS then paused when that rival came over past the half-mile pole,
went up to challenge again from outside into the turn, dueled around the bend, shook free in upper stretch and lasted over the late run from SONG OF
SHADOWS in the final moments. SONG OF SHADOWS unhurried in the beginning, traveled along the inside then came out past the quarter pole, rallied
and from outside and drew alongside UNWRITTEN CODE with a sixteenth remaining, wore down that rival late but missed at the wire.
ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS got put in tight between rivals early, saved ground off the pace, moved out in the lane and kept on to best the rest. DON'T JU
FORGET raced three deep out of range into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, altered out in upper stretch and improved position. YO YO MAMA
bumped leaving the gate, raced in tight early then advanced between rivals, chased outside a rival into the turn, got carried wide leaving the bend and
weakened. SQUARE TOMATOES bumped with YO YO MAMA at the start, traveled off the rail then between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two then
three wide and lacked a rally. KEEP YOUR COIL took a bump from the winner early, trailed two wide then moved out in the lane and proved no menace.
COCKTAIL PRINCESS dueled for command from outside then cleared past the half-mile pole and crossed over to the inside, challenged again into the turn,
dueled around the bend and into the lane, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and gave way.
