Footnotes
ANTENNA angled in then moved up to race just off the pace, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted two path, came five wide into the stretch,
chased inside of two foes into the final sixteenth and got up late under strong handling. PROGENY stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure
in the two the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, responded well when roused into the stretch, led under a drive into the
final sixteenth, drifted out under a left-handed crop late and was caught. LOW SOCIETY chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven
seven wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner on the far outside and willingly earned the show. TAVIN turned her head at the start and was off slow,
was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, chased between foes in the drive and just missed the
show. LIKA ROLLING STONE was urged along on the outside, went four wide for most of the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend and capitulated.
CLASSIC DIVA broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, went to the front, showed the way down
the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and stopped.

Footnotes
DESERT DALLIANCE pressed the pace under coaxing, drew even with the leader in the two path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, shook
clear in the three path into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. MONGOLIAN PANTHER was well placed just off
the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was roused while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for
the place. KITTEN'S APPEAL went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the three-eighths
pole, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and tired while just able to hold the show. VIRTUAL REALITY was ridden along off the pace, went three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AWILLAWAY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn,
chased into the stretch and came up empty. CARAGATE dropped well behind while ridden along, went around the turn in the two path, came way out into
upper stretch and was no factor. WICKED SIGHT was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn and came up empty.

CONSTITUTIONLAWYER settled on the outside, gained to make a bid in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, dueled outside of the
runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. DAYDREAMING BOY broke out at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on
the backstretch, was urged in the three path on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and was
outfinished while clear for the place. SHERIFF BIANCO was well placed down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed kick while able
to get the show. ADERO bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn
and failed to rally. UNBRIDLED BOMBER went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. DIVINE ARMOR moved up while coaxed along, shifted from
the rail to the three path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BOLD ENDEAVOR bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the
pace, moved out late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. SWIFTSURE showed the way down the backstretch,
was asked while inside on the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenth and faded.

AIN'T BROKE chased two to three wide down the backstretch and into the turn, tucked inside near the three-eighths as IMPLOSION backed away,
advanced on the leader taking command near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a light drive and was ridden
out to the finish. COPPA GIRL chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, was no match for
the top one and ran on to the finish to be along clear of the rest and second best. SWEET MYSTERY hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide
coaxed along from the get go, advanced to take over command near the seven-sixteenths, came under threat along the inside and was collared near the
quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. HAZARDOUS HUMOR chased three
to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, weakened. GODDESS OF FIRE chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. VIENNA CODE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. DAME
CINCO chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, gave way.
IMPLOSION showed the way in hand just off the inside until overtaken with seven-sixteenths to go, retreated steadily through the turn and went two to three
wide into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.
