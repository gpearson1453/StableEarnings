Footnotes
KHOZZY VALINTINE had a slim advantage down the back straight on the inside, continued up front while hounded outside running around the turn, was
urged right handed in upper stretch and responded well to edge away from rivals in the final sixteenth under a patient ride up front. SUGAR IS GOLDEN
was under a tight rein, content to watch the contesting duo three wide outside down the backside, inched closer at the quarter pole, loomed outside in the
four path at the top of the stretch but could not match strides with the winner at the furlong pole and settled on a clear second at the wire. SOMEONE ELSE
pressed the pace outside down the backstretch and through the turn, was scrubbed on between horses vying for the lead in upper stretch, could not go on
with the top pair down the lane and stubbornly resurged late to save third money. OHEAVENS travelled in mid-pack between foes in the two path down the
backside, crept closer on the fence behind the leaders running around the bend, was in for a share of the prize on the rail straightening out for the drive but
was outfinished late for the show award. LIPLOCK tracked four deep on the outside down the backstretch, came under a ride making little headway four
wide outside horses through the turn, was in range in the five path turning for home but could not find more late and stalled at the furlong marker. WICKED
MIAH settled in midfield in the three path between runners in the early going, was roused with rivals on each side in midturn but made little impact and could
not be a presence running through the stretch. STORMY SUZIE was unhurried trailing down the back straight, caught up to the field passing a rival outside
with five sixteenths to go, swung out to the five path for the drive but could not get involved down the lane. PACENZA had a good position tucked in on the
rail just behind the engaging leaders down the backside, was checked mildly on the fence three furlongs from home, shuffled back trailing by the midpoint
on the turn and was not a factor in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
RACE FOR PINKS settled off the leaders stalking four to five wide, took the lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. DECIMATOR settled off the pace
inside, waited briefly in behind runners at the quarter pole, shifted five wide in upper stretch, gained steadily late once obtaining a clear path and got up for
place. MASTER SPY settled in to stalk the leading pair three to four wide into and on the turn, moved to the fore to take a narrow advantage outside the
furlong marker, was outkicked and lost place late. GUILDSMAN (FR) settled off the pace three wide between runners through the turn, gained mildly inside
foes but needed more. DRAGON'S BREW was unhurried at the back heading into the turn, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, gained mildly late. DIXIE
GIANT was lacking early speed racing between runners two to three wide into the turn and at the rear, shifted six wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly.
LENNY K chased up close just briefly then dropped back outside, went three to four wide on the turn, shifted seven deep into upper stretch then altered
outside a rival, was not a threat. COMMANDER JOE was forwardly-placed contending for the early lead outside a rival two to three deep, faded.
ROCKSTAR RO forced the pace from inside, established a narrow lead through the turn, was overtaken in upper strech and faded. HALF TO RELOAD
failed to threaten racing near the rail.

SPRING MOUNTAIN rated kindly all alone in the third flight down the backstretch, was smartly picking up runners three wide around the final turn, loomed
boldly in the four path straightening out for home and determinedly wore down the leader through the stretch to get up just before the wire. C C'S KINGDOM
prompted three wide on the first turn, shadowed the contesting pair three wide on the outside down the back straight, pounced to the lead at the top of the
lane, spurted away briefly in upper stretch and determinedly ran to the wire but just missed holding off the winner at the finish. NEWPORT AGENT stalked
near the rear down the backside, began to lengthen stride inside at the half, waited briefly behind a tiring runner midway around the final bend, slipped up
the fence at the quarter pole and finished gamely to just hold for third money in a tight photo. HELL BENT was nestled on the rail behind the trio of leaders
down the backside, was coaxed for more gaining inside throughout the far turn, appeared to have stalled a touch in upper stretch then gamely burst
between runners finding another gear at the sixteenth pole and just missed with the late surge losing the show photo. DESOLATOR settled nicely all alone
in midfield down the backstretch, commenced a rally three wide with three eighths to run, angled outside to be beside the eventual winner turning for home
but was outkicked by others in the final furlong. SUNRISE DRIVE stumbled on the break, trailed the field down the backside, offered a mild rally three wide
midpoint on the final turn, angled out to the six path for the stretch drive and willingly finished up running to the wire. SEVEN IS A BREEZE hopped then
bobbled at the start, stalked close to the rear having one beat down the backstretch, swung out with momentum seven wide for the drive but could not get
involved running to the wire. NATIVE PRINCE took this field into the first turn, set the pace up front on the rail while hounded outside down the back straight,
maintained a slim advantage on the fence at the quarter pole, could not quicken with others at the top of the lane and was engulfed by rivals outside in
mid-stretch. STRONG ENDING pressed the issue on the outside into the first turn, continued to badger the frontrunner between rivals down the backstretch,
was asked for more but had little to give dueling up front three furlongs from home and backed away through the field midway on the final turn.

Footnotes
STOLEN MONEY was coaxed forward from the start, set the early pace inside while hounded by an outside foe, was overtaken by that one and relegated to
pressing from the five-eighths, retook command outside the quarter pole saving ground on the far turn, was then headed by a new rival in upper stretch,
engaged with that one but still just shy of the lead, kept on determinedly and surged at the wire to prevail. CANADIAN PHAROAH broke outwardly, settled
mid-pack inside rivals mid-pack on or just off the rail, began to advance willingly late on the far turn and was guided out from the five-sixteenths, came to the
quarter pole four wide with a deal of momentum, took the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit and dueled with a narrow lead over a foe but was
outfinished. CUPID'S CLAWS unhurriedly raced last but one early near the inside, steadily advance on the far turn into upper stretch, tipped out just a bit,
gained on the lead pair moving up in behind and between those, appeared to shy from attempting to thread between and lacked room late as the gap
between the leading pair closed. A THREAD OF BLUE settled mid-pack between runners two to three wide on the first turn and up the backstretch, moved
out five then six wide late on the far turn to advance outside foes, kicked on mildly but was no threat to the top trio. H C HOLIDAY settled off the leading pair
stalking from off the rail, came out five wide in upper stretch, ran on. SIR SAHIB broke slowly and losing a path, was unhurried at the rear, saved ground,
passed tired foes. VANBRUGH attended from outside in hand two to three wide pressing the leader, took over a narrow advantage from the five-eighths,
was challenged and overtaken midway on the far turn, tired in the lane. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was well-placed outside mid-pack three to four wide, had no
rally.

DRESDEN ROW was reined back to have a nice tracking trip on the rail down the backside watching the front pair, patiently was on hold waiting to move
around the final turn, angled outside to the three path to pounce at the quarter pole, collared the leader at the furlong marker and drew away in deep stretch.
VITALITY tracked in the second flight on the outside having the eventual winner on his inside down the backstretch, was roused four wide at the quarter
pole, could not quicken with the winner at the top of the stretch, continued to fight on and closed smartly to the wire besting the rest at the finish. MAXIMUS
MAGIC took this field on the fence through the first turn, dictated the pace while pressed outside down the backstretch, stubbornly battled inside turning for
home, was collared by the winner at the furlong marker and faded late holding for third in the end. JOKESTAR prompted the pace on the outside in the first
turn, continued to force the issue outside down the back straight, came under a vigorous ride chasing the pacesetter at the quarter pole, was still in the hunt
between foes at the top of the lane, could not go on with the leaders in upper stretch and was one paced to the wire for a minor share. PET SOUNDS was
check briefly on the rail in tight quarters running around the first turn, settled in the third flight alone finding his stride down the backstretch, began to make a
run on the rail midway on the final turn and willingly chased the leaders on the rail through the stretch to the finish line. SOUPER ATTENTIVE bore out at
the start, had one beat settling near the rear down the backside, offered a brief run just outside at the three furlong marker, was in range for a small share
with runners on each side turning for home but could not find more, stalling in the last furlong. SILENT AND VIOLENT settled in midfield between foes on
the fits turn, made little progress travelling down the backside, was roused on the fence through the far turn and showed little in the drive to the wire. STUD
MUFFIN broke inwards hitting the gate on the break, trailed the field down the backstretch and could not reach contention running down the stretch.

SEGUIMI broke sharply and immediately shot clear, set the pace inside, shook clear of pursuers turning into upper stretch, held safe and was eased up late.
COLEYVILLE settled well back of the leaders two to three wide, continued to bid time but edging closer still two to three wide on the far turn, came out in
upper stretch, found room between rivals nearing the seventy-yard marker and surged between foes for the place. BET tracked in behind inside, switched
out and was within range on the far turn, angled six to seven wide at the top of the stretch, loomed a threat, lost place late. TIMESKIP was not too far off the
leaders three to four deep and about mid-pack, moved out from four to six deep on the far turn, was floated seven to eight wide coming out of that bend and
outkicked in the stretch. SYNCHROMESH broke slowly, saved ground near the rail throughout and ran evenly. DIAMONDBACK was forwardly-placed
stalking in behind up close two to three wide, moved nearer the rail and saved ground on the far turn while encouraged along, had no response and
weakened. STOP THE HUMBUG settled at the back lacking early speed, saved some ground near the rail, was off the rail into upper stretch, ran evenly and
made no bid. MAMBOINTHEFOREST settled mid-pack two to three wide into the first turn, shifted out about the six-and-one-half then three to four deep,
drew nearer the leaders coming to the three-eighths and put to encouragement, fanned seven deep into upper stretch, could not sustain the effort and
faded. SOCIETY JOE was coaxed forward three to four wide into the turn, chased the winner three deep up the backstretch, came up empty. FINALIST hit
the gate and was away slowly, raced at the rear off the rail, was not a threat. FLAT OUT VIXEN was off the leaders in the three to four path, tired.

Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP settled on the rail in midfield in the beginning, was shuffled back losing positioning on the fence at the three furlong marker, patiently
regrouped to gain smartly on rivals inside running around the bend and was full of run on the fence down the stretch to surge by the tiring frontrunner at the
sixteenth pole edging away at the finish. RAT PORTAGE was bumped inside at the start, travelled in mid-pack between foes down the backside, rallied
three wide with horses on each side at the quarter pole, loomed in the four path straightening out for the drive and ran on solidly to the wire but was
outfinished by the winner in deep stretch. GIANT TEDDY took command at the start, maintained the lead down the backstretch while pressured outside
setting a quick pace, repelled the early speed foe midway on the turn, opened up at the top of the lane, began to get leg weary at the furlong marker and
faded in the final seventy yards holding for a clear third in the end. MAAKWA stalked near the rear in the early stages, began to pick up runners four wide on
the outside through the turn, swung outside in the seven path with momentum driving to the wire and finished with intent to get up to be a fringe player in the
end. GALVASTON had a good spot tucked in on the rail down the back straight watch the speed duel up front, improved on the fence through the turn, was
in the hunt in the two path between runners turning for home and faded in the last sixteenth. BACHELOR PAD chased the pace five wide on the outside
down the backstretch, offered a mild run inching closer three wide midturn, angled outside in the five path for the drive and evened out at the furlong marker.
AIM FOR THE SKY pressured the front runner under quick fractions down the backside, could not go on with the leader with five sixteenths to go and
yielded between runners in mid-stretch. DETERMINED FURY was pinballed between horses at the start, trailed down the backside, could not improve
seeing the field around the turn and could not get involved passing one weary runner down the stretch. ASYOUBELIEVE broke inwards on the start, was
hustled in the four path between rivals down the back straight in the chasing pack, gave way trying to get closer to the front duo at the three furlong marker
and emptied out in upper stretch with little left to give.

Footnotes
WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST got away alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace inside, kicked clear in mid-stretch under urging while much the best.
WIN FOR THE MONEY was forwardly-placed outside three to four deep stalking off the leading pair, fought on outside a foe in the stretch to secure the
place while no match for the winner. LUCKMAN broke outwardly and a step slowly, settled at the back inside, advanced up the backstretch, waited briefly in
behind runners and inside at the three-eighths, allowed to run soon after, looked full of run turning for home but was outfinished for place. ARTIE'S STORM
was caught outside and forced five wide through both turns, was bumped by the inside rival near the five-eighths, asked for more leaving the far bend,
drifted in a bit in upper- to mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TYSON switched out off the inside entering the first turn racing in the three to four path
and off the leading trio, was guided out early up the backstretch bumping a rival nearing the five-eighths seeking clear room in front, encouraged along still
four deep on the far turn, put to stout urging by the quarter pole, came in a bit in upper stretch, tired. WAR BOMBER (IRE) was forwardly-positioned
pursuing the winner from outside two to three deep, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN travelled clear outside runners in the three path tracking the front group early on, pounced three wide at the three eighths marker bidding for
the lead, tenaciously battled outside holding the lead down the lane and prevailed in a photo at the finish. SPIRIT ANIMAL stalked between foes in the three
path in the beginning, was coaxed while keeping pace just behind the trio contesting up front on the turn, found a seam in the three path at the top of the
lane and finished up strongly just missing in a photo for the win with that solid effort. HAVE A SOUPER DAY tracked on the rail in the second tier, was
scrubbed on, going the wrong way on the fence through the turn, began to rally inside at the quarter pole and found his best stride late to close in to be a
non threatening third at the wire. TAPSASIONAL set the pace while shadowed outside down the backstretch, was headed outside by a couple of rivals three
furlongs from home, stubbornly fought on inside until the sixteenth pole and faded late holding for a minor role. SCOOT DADDY staked near the rear four
deep down the back straight, offered a brief run four wide around foes midpoint on the turn, was in the hunt for a share of the prize in the four path at the top
of the lane but stalled at the sixteenth pole. BODE'S TIPSY hopped slightly on the break to see the field down the backside, continued to trail the field
around the bend , swung outside to the seven path for the stretch run and could not make any impact driving to the finish line. MALIBU EDGE tracked in the
second flight between runners in the early going, was hard ridden losing ground and position through the turn and could not offer a rally down the stretch.
TOLD IT ALL chased the pacesetter down the backside, pressed for the lead with challengers on both side at the three furlong marker, could not find
another gear at the quarter pole and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHAIRMAN RAINBOW dueled briefly then took the advantage from outside two to three deep forcing the pace, moved clear by the three-eighths, was kept
to the task and held sway. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN settled in behind stalking the leading pair, went two wide between foes on the turn, kept on late to
close the gap but couldn't reach the winner. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA contended from inside the eventual winner, lost ground on that one into the turn,
switched out and drifted five wide turning for home, kept on in the lane but needed more. FABLED PRINCE settled mid-division off the rail, fanned seven to
eight wide into upper stretch, finished up strongly to gain late. ROAD TO VERSAILLES was bumped sideways at the start, raced at the back off the inside,
fanned four wide into upper stretch then shifted in once in mid-stretch for room and finished up willingly. ASK IN MY NAME bumped the outer rival at the
start, settled off the pace racing between foes on the turn three to four deep, moved out in upper stretch, kicked on well but too late. MODEL S moved
forward between foes into the turn in range of the leaders three to four wide, lacked the needed late kick. COHERENCE stalked from a forward position,
moved out from four to six wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SO CALLED VACATION broke outwardly, was caught five wide toward the rear on the
turn, moved out further in upper stretch, failed to menace. DEMBA failed to menace while racing off the inside four to five deep on the turn. JUST FOR
MADDIE broke a half-step slowly, moved forward inside under mild coaxing, tracked along the rail about mid-pack into the turn, steadied past the
three-eighths, failed to rally thereafter. HYGGE was forced out a bit and off slowly at the start, lacked any early speed despite encouragement, trailed inside
into the turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF JUST FOR MADDIE AGAINST ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
