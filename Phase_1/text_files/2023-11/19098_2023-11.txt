Footnotes
LEGACY ACCOUNT was hustled along to set the pace, drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task in the end while clear. POWER SLAM was rank and
hard headed while trying to lug out throughout the entire race, was attempting to bear out in the stretch and failed to gain on the winner while being second
best in the end. CIELO'S KNIGHT was carried out in the early going then angled inside off heels, was then taken outside to be three wide in upper stretch
but was no menace in late stretch. EVEN TERMS was unhurried early then made a mild rally and was no threat. C B'S FLAT OUT raced three wide in the
early going, was used up then gave way.
