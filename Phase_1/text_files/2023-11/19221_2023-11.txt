Footnotes
DR BAYTER bumped with foes on both sides at the start, tracked in the four path, was coaxed along in the five path around the turn, took aim from the six
path at the top of the lane, and drew past an inner trio in the final sixteenth. BEE A SKY BEAM rated along the inside, had to steady from the rail
approaching the quarter, cut the corner turning into the lane, and ran on for place. RING FUND laid up close in the five path, bid in the four path around the
turn, and kept on between foes for show. HAY HAY HARRY prompted the pace in the three path, bid going into the turn, held a narrow lead in the three path
entering the stretch, fought on between foes, but evened out late. SKYLANE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was roused in
the three path midway around the turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. THE HONEYMAN had an awkward start, was behind in the two path
early and made no impact from the six path down the lane. NEIGH NEIGH NOW was wellback in the five path early and never a factor. CROSS EXAM
bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened. DREAM BELIEVER broke out at the start, set the pace in
the two path but yielded turning into the stretch. KINGY chased in the six path but never menaced.

EMILY'S WISH led early, settled back into a stalking position nearing the half-mile pole, re-bid in the three path around the turn, took over near the
five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. INDESCRIPTABLE was bumped at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, was no match for the
winner but stayed on to be clear of the rest. CREATIVPERFORMANCE lacked early speed, raced three wide and was along for the show. DADDY'S
PIGEON raced in range inside, angled out nearing the eighth pole and lacked a closing bid. CAPISCI had her head turned at the start, raced four wide and
never threatened. R FIREBIRD set the pace in the two path and faltered nearing the five-sixteenths marker. SHE LOVES TO MOVE broke out and bumped
at the start, raced two wide and was through early.

Footnotes
GRAND ROCK hit the gate leaving, trailed in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the turn, tipped out to the four path going into the stretch, and
drew past an inner foe around the sixteenth. GOLDEN SKULL was hustled along from up close in the three path, bid from said position turning into the
stretch, ran on and held a clear lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe around the final sixteenth to place. TUWAIM raced off the pace
in the five path, floated out to the seven path under a drive turning into the lane, and kept on for show. TIK TOKABLE raced up close under a nudge along
the inside, was stymied and had to steady from the rail turning into the stretch, but was one paced. WILLIAM GUSTAVO tracked in the two path, was ridden
in the four path around the turn, but weakened from the five path in the stretch. TRULULU set the pace in the two path, was ridden along from said position
around the turn, but gaveway between foes entering the lane, pulled up just after the wire, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NO DELIBERATION stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch, spit rivals to take the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
under a drive. UNSOCIABLE pressed the pace three wide, reached near even terms nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. GEPARD set the pace
just off the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and held on for the show. UBIQUITOUS tracked the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane.
FLATTER ME hit the starting gate, trailed in the three path, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild gain. D COLDEST failed to menace while racing
four and five wide.

Footnotes
ARAK stalked in the four path, took aim while under a drive in the five path turning into the lane, stayed on his left lead, and drew past an inner foe around
the final sixteenth. SUPER SPREADER prompted the pace in the three path, was roused to bid going into the far turn, led from the three path going into the
stretch, but was caught around the final sixteenth to place. HOLIDAY FANTASY tracked in the five path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn,
tipped back out to the five path entering the stretch, and kept on while drifting in for show. GLOBES had his head turned and hopped at the start, trailed in
the four path, was driven outside of rivals while still in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, and made no impact.
ACAMAR set the pace inside, was roused into the far turn, but yielded in the three path at the top of the stretch. ANTHONY'S ROCKET raced wellback in
the two path and could never get involved from the six path down the lane. INSPIRED MISCHIEF settled in midpack in the four path, but was empty in the
two path entering the lane. BLUTO'S CANDY broke in a tangle and briefly lost the left iron, raced off the pace in the three path and never threatened.
ARTICO rated inside but was no menace.

Footnotes
MUGATU settled off the early pace while racing four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, took over leaving the eighth pole and drew off under a
drive. HALON stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in midstretch but as no match for the winner late. MYTHIC PERFORMANCE was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and was up for the show. THEMANUPFRONT set the pace in the two path and
weakened in the final furlong. TAPITORO stalked the pace four wide, lugged in in upper stretch, angled back out leaving the eighth pole and faded.

went three wide between rivals rounding the far turn and had no bids. RAPSCALLION was pinched back at the start, steadied repeatedly while racing three
and four wide between foes and lacked a closing bid. TIZ MARKS SPIRIT broke sharply and steadily faded inside. YAKOZUKI checked repeatedly through

Footnotes
TEMERITY tracked in the two path, was cued between foes in the three path midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole,
and surged between foes to be up in the final strides. AMOR Y CONTROL led in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, floated out to
the four path in upper stretch, and dug in, but was caught late by a surging outer foe to place. DRINKS ON ME chased in the three path, was ridden in the
four path around the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. DEMURELY hopped at the start, stalked from the rail, was roused
along the inside turning into the lane, and stayed on, but was outfinished by an outer trio. NOBLE DREAMER pressed in the four path, was cued to bid
turning into the stretch, but drifted out in the final furlong, and faded between late.

before the eighth pole, and was driven clear. QUEEN MACHA hopped at the start, rated in the six path, bid in the four path around the far turn, floated out to
the eight path in upper stretch, and kept on while on her left lead for place. STARSHIP AURORA set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside
around the far turn, stayed on from the rail into the stretch, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but held show. TAMARINDO was unhurried in the five path,
ranged up around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but was one paced. THELASTBULLETSMINE raced off the pace in the two path,
was driven along the rail around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and flattened. TAMARAMA (GB) trailed in the four path,
floated out to the six path around the turn, and did not factor. TOWSER tracked between foes in the three path, shifted outward around the turn, was in the
nine path at the top of the lane, but failed to threaten. DEMOGORGON stalked in the five path, bid from the two path going into the far turn, but weakened

Footnotes
TIZ ROMANTIC set the pace in the three path, was roused approaching the quarter, opened up from the five path into the stretch, and held sway under a
drive. POSSIBLEMENTE moved up around the first turn to stalk in the five path, was ridden from the four path around the far turn, and chased on from the
six path down the lane for place. SPACE RUNNER tracked in the four path, was coaxed from the five path into the far turn, floated out to the seven path into
the lane, and kept on for show. SIGRUN FAST BOY raced in midpack in the three path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the
nine path entering the lane, and finished evenly on his left lead. HAKKIMI (CHI) bumped at the start with an inner foe, was unhurried in the three path early,
roused entering the far turn, but did not factor. SAMBURU (GB) rated in the two path, but made no impact along the inside down the stretch. HARRINGTON
raced off the pace in the three path, tipped out under a drive around the far turn, but failed to menace from the eight path in the stretch. ONE TIME
WILLARD laid up close in the four path but faded at the top of the stretch. AL ATLASI bumped with an outer foe at the start, settled in range from the two
path but backed up around the far turn. STORM P always trailed around the two path.

Footnotes
BOSTON PRINCESS had early speed between foes, checked nearing the first turn, settled off the pace in the two path around that bend, cruised up two
wide around the far turn, waited for room around much of the bend, made an inside bid to seize command near the quarter pole and drew off while ridden
out. BLETCHLEY GIRL raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole, was no
match for the winner from there but stayed on well to be a clear second. HARLAN'S LEGACY was off a bit slowly, saved ground well back early, advanced
outside down the backstretch, bid three wide between foes around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole and was outfinished. SOCIAL
ENGAGEMENT raced off the pace two and three wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. MONEY FACTOR failed to menace while saving ground around
the first turn and going four wide around the far turn. RIGBY stalked the pace four wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, vied between rounding
the far turn and tired in the stretch. NANA FANNY was outrun inside. RADIANT GEM played no factor while racing two wide around the first turn and five
wide around the far turn. MORNING COLORS set the pace inside and retreated around the far turn. WICKLOW GAL pressed the pace two wide, dueled
down the backstretch and faltered around the far turn.
