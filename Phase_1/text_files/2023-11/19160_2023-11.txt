JOLENE JOLENE stalked the leaders racing close up off the inside, advanced on the far turn, bid outside of SHELL BELLE at the quarter pole, rallied to a
short lead in upper stretch and then drew clear under urging. SHELL BELLE stalked close up outside early on, then vied two wide on the backside, took
over entering the far turn, dueled inside of the winner turning for home, was no match for that rival and remained clear for second. TITANIC ROSE trailed
the field while saving ground, was asked on the far turn and closed belatedly. BOHEMIA BABE set the early pace on the inside, vied inside on the backside,
chased on the far turn and gave way.
