LIGHTNIN QUEEN veered out and made contact with Here's A Quarter leaving the gate then tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure
toward the quarter pole, was met entering the stretch but dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over MALIBU YEARS through the stretch. The latter stalked
off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and met the winner at even terms entering the stretch, but was outfinished in a game stretch
duel. ROMAN CANDLE rated close inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane.
FLAMME FATALE saved ground off the pace, showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn in the three path. MY LUCKY DEIA
stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path on the far turn. POUR ME A DRINK
was forced outward leaving the gate, raced in the four path the first turn and never factored. HERE'S A QUARTER was bumped leaving the gate, raced in
the five path the opening turn, eased leaving the seven sixteenths pole and walked off post race.

with the early pace but dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and weakened toward mid-stretch. THE ILLUSIONIST gave chase and rounded the turn
about the three path. SETTLEMENT DATE saved ground. PRIMAL DESTINY engaged in briefly close early chase but was pulled up leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and walked off sore.

Footnotes
WHAT SAY YOU quickly took over and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail
on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and just lasted. HOME SCHOOL stalked inside on the opening turn, raced in the four path the second
turn then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and finished well at the outside poll of the
winner. PERSONABLE raced in the five path on the first turn then saved ground on the second turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn about the four path, angled in at the top of the lane and dug in to take the nod for third. MARK DID IT raced in the six path the opening turn then
saved some ground into the second turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and was outfinished
in the stretch duel for third. ROYAL PAIN rounded the first turn in the five path and entered the front stretch outside, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SILIPO raced in the four path the first turn and stalked from the seven
eighths pole, gave chase approaching the three eighths but faded at the rail on the far turn. URBAN BANDIT stalked the early pace off the rail then faded
through the backstretch. THE HAPPY GIANT mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, angled to the four
path approaching the head of the lane, dug in for the lead past the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. EXTRA CRUNCHY took the lead toward the
three quarter pole and angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in
under steady encouragement, but was caught flattening stride inside the sixteenth pole. ULTIMATE BREEZE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, was forced out leaving the turn but came along to take third mid-stretch.
SULTRY SALLY H stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside the eighth
pole. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the five path on the far
turn. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY was roughed off the heels of Shes So Speightsy in the three path entering the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole but showed little response. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled in the three and four paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
KOBE'S GIRL was not a factor.
