sixteenths pole and flattened at the rail on the far turn. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase
past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and could only improve her position in the lane. BEST VIRGINIA raced two
deep the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane and

MAGGIE'S GIRL bore in and made contact with BARBERS POINT leaving the gate, took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was urged
away at the rail on the far turn then kept alert in the lane. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, gave chase approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled clear for second later yards. NO DENYING DENIS was forced out leaving the gate then settled off
the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and relented in the stretch duel for second. TIMETOGETUP
rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. AIM'S JUBILEE was jostled leaving
the gate, raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. WHATTA NOTION ducked out and
steadied leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and

DRY WELL saved ground off the early pace, eased out into the backstretch and started a bid toward the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep
approaching the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to edge clear of DULCIMER DAME in later yards. The latter saved ground close to the pace then
eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to a slim lead past the five sixteenths, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn but was met toward the head of the lane and reluctantly ceded. SIDESWIPED saved early ground racing well back, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the seven path and finished well to take third mid-stretch. KALENJIN
rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. LACE
REVOLUTION saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened.
BABA rated a slim lead inside, was met past the nine sixteenths pole but briefly recovered the edge approaching the three eighths, gave up the lead again
at the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. SMOOCHINWITHCINDY came away awkwardly then stalked two deep, took the nod past the
nine sixteenths pole but was met passing the half mile pole and gave way at the rail into the far turn. COMPLETE SURPRISE was shuffled back soon after
the start then stalked from the three path the opening turn, took the lead three wide passing the half mile pole but was met toward the three eighths and
faded past the five sixteenths.

show the way, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and
dueled close through the upper stretch, but dropped back toward the sixteenth pole and settled for second best. MAKANI settled in the three path the first
turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little more. GOLD CREATIONS steadied soon after the
