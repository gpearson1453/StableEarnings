Footnotes
HEEZESPEEDY hounded the pacesetter outside throughout the turn, took command on the outside in mid-stretch and was edging away for the win in deep
stretch. MY ASSISTANT set the pace while shadowed outside down the backstretch, continued to set the fractions inside under a slim advantage through
the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the furlong pole, could not go on but bested the rest at the finish. BUSTA GROOVE settled on the inside
stalking near the back, rallied three wide outside horses in midturn, loomed in the five path at the top of the lane and ran with intent to the finish to hold for
the show placing. POLA STAR stalked near the rear on the outside, began to lengthen stride three wide around foes at the quarter pole, angled inwards to
the fence at the furlong marker and finished up well just missing the nod for third money at the wire. MIAH SAID bobbled soon after the start trailing down
the backside, saved ground still seeing the field on the turn, swung out with momentum in the five path for the drive and showed some interest passing few
down the stretch. COMMANDER AT SEA kept a close eye on the engaged pair running outside rivals three wide down the back straight, took closer order to
the front two tracking three wide around the bend, was in the mix of things in the four path between foes turning for home but could not find more and wilted
in the final furlong. BELLASPINA tracked the front pair in the second flight with runners on each side at the half, was scrubbed on for more midturn, offered
little run and had nothing to give in the stretch drive. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN broke inwards at the start, had a good position tucked in on the rail watching the
front dup at the half, was hard ridden on the fence with five sixteenths to go, could not keep pace with others and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RAVELLO BEAUTY was off a step slow at the start, was unhurried trailing down the backside at the half, started to unwind three wide going around horses
at the quarter pole, burst to the lead between rivals at the eighth pole and was drawing away at the wire. SPEEDY JOHNY was allowed to settle co-trailing
on the outside into the backstretch, improved three deep along the backside, offered a bold move four wide circling foes at the quarter pole, posed a serious
threat outside of rivals in the five path at the top of the lane and ran on smartly but was just outfinished by the winner in deep stretch. BEQUIA emerged with
the lone lead into the backside, was urged for more when outside runners loomed outside in midturn, put away the early foes in upper stretch, braced the
new challengers closing down the lane, was stubbornly clinging to the lead at the furlong marker but faded in deep stretch to hold for third in the end.
MAKAYLA travelled in midfield inside runners on the first turn, made an early move forcing the pace three wide with three furlongs remaining, dueled up
front in the four path straightening out for the drive, could not go on with others and stalled at the furlong marker. P. S. RISING STAR co-led on the rail into
the first turn, was then throttled down to nestle on the fence just behind the pacesetter down the back straight, was ridden for more inside three furlongs to
go, made little headway around the final bend and could not make a presence in the stretch drive. CRASH THE CREASE had good position all alone
watching the front two down the backside, closed in to force the pace between runners running through the far turn, could not go on in upper stretch and
emptied out on the rail to the wire.

Footnotes
COOLER MAN was away slowly to trail at the start, smartly cruised around challengers three wide through the turn, loomed the main threat three wide
driving to the finish and wore down rivals in the stretch for the victory. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE was forced out on the break, recovered to track in the early
going, was nudged on the rail three furlongs from home but was going in the wrong direction on the turn, could see the field inside at the quarter pole and
figured things out on the fence turning for home, found his best stride late and closed strongly to make it a race at the wire. ROCK TO FAME broke
outwards on the start, took this field down the backstretch, was headed outside by horses at the top of the stretch, fought on stubbornly down the lane but
was no match for the top two in deep stretch, holding for third money at the wire. LAKEFIELD chased the pace in the early stages, closed in to bid between
rivals in the two path straightening out for the drive, battled until the eighth pole, needed more late to threaten and faded near the wire for a minor share in
the end. CRIMINAL INTENT was brushed inside at the start, stalked near the rear down the backside, put in a brief turn of foot with five sixteenths from the
finish but could not get involved in the drive to the wire. CANADIAN AVRO travelled in mid-pack down the backstretch, was roused for more run on the rail
three furlongs from the wire, could not quicken with others around the turn and gave way in mid-stretch. ASHUKA was away alertly to begin, appeared to
jump something down the backside losing momentum, was shuffled back on the rail at the three furlong marker, offered a mild run in midturn and tired in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
FOREST B settled in behind the leaders off the inside, advanced four to five wide between runners late on the turn moving out six wide into upper stretch,
drifted in a bit in upper stretch, took a narrow lead seventy yards out, fought to the wire and got the nod. SPEEDY RIVER was urged forward at the break
and soon made the lead, was then overtaken but continued to vie inside, retook command in upper stretch, led till late but was outfinished. MISS BOBBIT
broke a step slowly and lightly brushing a rival, unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung eight wide, rallied to get up for show. QUIET MADDELENA broke on
top, settled into stride in a good forward position pressing the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch, lost third late. GREEN GABLES
moved forward and to the lead to force the issue into the turn racing three to four wide through that bend, had no extra for the drive. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ
was forwardly-positioned between runners chasing the early pace, dropped back and ran on evenly late. DREAMING OF AUDREY chased close up three
wide, moved out a bit in the stretch, needed more. LOADED QUESTION broke a step slowly and was bumped lightly, settled off the pace near the inside,
shifted out six then seven wide in the stretch and ran on. FEDALIA failed to menace racing off the inside. SILENT GUROO was forwardly-placed chasing
from outside five to seven wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
LANTANA LADY trailed the field down the backside, was headstrong and eager sitting behind foes inside with a half remaining, had no room on the fence
through the bend, shifted just outside looking for a seam at the quarter pole, finally had clear running room when angled outside in the five path and
exploded on by under only a hand ride for a impressive score. OLYMPIC FENCER tracked four wide outside horses down the backside, made an early
move three wide taking over the lead three eighths from the finish, was surrounded by rivals straightening out for the drive in the hunt up front and
determinedly fought to the wire to be second best behind a convincing winner on this day. KNOW HOW (GB) had a narrow advantage on the rail down the
backstretch, relinquished the lead to chase on the fence throughout the turn, was in range of the leaders inside turning for home and gamely re-rallied on
the fence down the lane to get up and win the photo for third money at the wire. RETAIL THERAPIST rated kindly in hand seeing this tightly, compacted
field at the half, circled three wide making a strong move at the three eighths marker, pounced to the lead in the four path driving to the wire and was
outkicked by others late and settled for a minor share in the end. LIVIN ON LUV tracked in the three path between rivals at the half, settled in midfield three
wide outside foes watching the front pair, was roused at the quarter pole to bid for the front in the three path at the top of the lane and weakened in the final
sixteenth. REMEMBERING RHODA pressed the pace between runners down the back straight, was shuffled back not keeping pace with rivals through the
turn, was till in with a chance in the five path widest turning for home, could not find another gear and faltered down the stretch.

Footnotes
AMBASSADOR LUNA took control from the outside from the start, put away the early foe prompting the issue by the midway point on the turn, spurted clear
at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe by a diminishing margin at the wire. MRS. GREEN had a good position tracking the front pair
on the rail down the backstretch, was coaxed for more, creeping closer to the leader through the turn, shifted just outside extending her stride straightening
out for the drive, chased the winner in vain down the stretch, was closing in, but could not get there in time. PIONEER'S EDGE hopped slightly on the break,
rallied, taking closer order three wide with three eighths left to run, was in the hunt in the five path turning for home, could not accelerate with the top two
down the stretch and finished up for a non threatening third in the end. GLORIANNIA was unhurried trailing down the backside, continued to find her stride
seeing the field around the turn and finished up with good intent weaving between horses in the final furlong to settle on the fringes. JOKES UP stalked near
the rear having one foe bet down the backside, saved ground while making little impression through the turn and passed tired runners down the stretch.
ZANA tracked the contesting pair on the outside down the back straight, was ridden to keep pace between foes at the three furlong marker, offered little
response and gave way in upper stretch. BREATHING FIRE prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, could not quicken with the winner and was
turned back midway around the bend, was roused at the quarter pole between horses but could not go on and yielded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
RED SNEAKERS travelled on the outside in midfield down the backstretch, made a sharp move four wide around horses at the quarter pole, loomed five
wide at the top of the lane and wore down fellow rivals through the stretch to get up just before the wire for the win. DYNAMIC STRIKE settled in mid-pack
on the rail, slipped up the fence starting a rally at the quarter pole, shifted just outside in the two path dueling for the front at the top of the stretch, briefly
took the lead at the sixteenth pole but could not find more to hold the winner off at the wire. VALLEY VICTORY assumed the lead down the back straight,
continued upfront with little pressure around the turn, was collared outside at the furlong pole and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch to be a clear third in
the end. CANTUCCI chased the pacesetter down the backstretch, was roused keeping pace with rivals through the turn, was in the mix for a share in the
three path turning for home and faded in the stretch holding for a minor role. LADY BOO tracked three wide on the outside at the half, came under a ride
between foes trying to keep up with others at the quarter pole and faltered in upper stretch. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER broke with the pack but was void of
early speed trailing down the backside, lost touch with the field running through the turn and galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
TALKING WONDERS stalked at the back having one beat down the backstretch, started to commence a run three wide between horses at the quarter pole,
swung widest in the six path gaining on foes at the top of the lane and won the battle down the entire stretch to just prevail in photo at the wire from the
inside challenger. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY had a good spot nestled inside behind the contesting three at the half, edged closer to the leaders at the quarter
pole, angled outside with run in the five path straightening out for the drive and never quit to the wire just missing between horses in a gutsy stretch effort.
CRIMSON NIGHTS pressed the pace between foes in the early going, assumed command while hounded outside by runners throughout the turn, put away
the early speed rivals turning for home, braced for the closers in upper stretch, was still clinging to the lead on the fence at the sixteenth pole and faded very
late holding clearly for third in a hard fought front running try. DADDY'S DAISY tracked the front trio four wide down the back straight, prompted the issue
three wide running around the turn, was in the mix four wide driving to the finish line and evened out in the final furlong for a minor role in the end. WAR
VOW was allowed to settle trailing down the back straight, began to pick up runners outside with two furlongs remaining and showed late interest offering a
good closing kick to the finish line. SHAMELESS AFFAIR was brushed by the outside foe on the break, prompted three wide down the backside, pressed for
the lead with rivals on each side running around the bend, was still in the thick of things battling up front in the three path at the top of the stretch, could not
find more and faded at the furlong pole. TAPPING A RHYTHM seized command inside from the start, gave way up front with seven sixteenths from home,
kept pace with runners travelling on the inside through the turn, was checked in tight quarters on the fence at the furlong marker and could not regroup in
time time to be involved at the finish. STANDING STRONG broke inwards at the start, stalked near the rear on the inside, saved ground but made little
impact around the turn and could only pass a straggler turning for home. NEOLITHIC NATION travelled all alone in midfield down the backside, made a
brief run three wide from the three eighths pole to the quarter marker, emptied out turning for home and was eased up when crossing the finish line.
