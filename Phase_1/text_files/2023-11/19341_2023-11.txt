TUDOX OPPORTUNITY tracked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then drew out in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. WASABI
BOY prompted the pace three wide, then fell off the pace leaving the five sixteenths two wide, then ran on to gain the place award late. MAGIC SPIN
hustled up the inside to set the early pace, then was headed off the turn and faded the final furlong, lost place award late, bested rest. MEAN MACHINE was
reserved early, came three wide into the lane, angled in by the furlong marker and had a belated rally on the inside. ON THE RIM was settled, three wide on
the turn, came wide into the lane and had no rally. ACT OF VALOR was well placed early on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SKIMBLE SHANKS tracked the early pace, then split rivals by the five eighths marker and went up to stalk the pacesetter, made a three wide bid leaving the
quarter pole and then slowly edged clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was two wide into the first turn while vying for the
lead, then went on to set the pace, then was headed leaving the turn and dug in gamely but was out-kicked by the winner, second best. ORASHI was
settled back early, then made a two to three wide move on the turn to loom boldly off the turn, but flattened out, got show award late. RUNYONESQUE was
settled early on the inside, shifted out nearing the five sixteenths to make a four wide bid, loom boldly off the turn but flattened out, lost show award late. LA
PAZ stalked the early pace three wide and tired. HANFORD was reserved early and failed to menace. HOLY MOLY MOSES was well placed along the
inside, then was ridden along leaving the three eighths and then was empty the final quarter of a mile.

DISCO DAISY set a pressured pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and kicked clear, then remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving.
DIVINE PROMISE was settled early, four wide five wide on the turn and had a good late rally. CITY OF LONDON pressed the pace and made a three wide
bid on the turn but flattened out. GEMINI WARRIOR chased the pace and lacked the needed stretch bid. TRAJEC HOLIDAY was off slowly, then passed
the tiring rivals. WITHOUT A NET pressed the pace in between rivals and weakened. TEMPTRESS CALLING was settled two wide on the turn and
weakened. FANTASY FROST was not a factor. MADISON COUNTY was settled on the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE stalked the early pace three wide, then pressed the pacesetter two wide on the far turn, made a bid off the turn and slowly edged clear to
prove best, driving. DR. STEVE was five wide into the first turn, then vied for the lead three wide by the six furlong marker, then went on to set the pace on
the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole and dug in gamely but was outfinished late, second best. TRENDING UP was settled early, made a five
wide middle move down the backstretch, then made a three wide bid on the turn and came four wide into the lane, but flattened out, held show award.
EAGLES CRY was allowed to settle early, wide on the backstretch and lacked the needed winning bid late. P JS SILVER DUKE chased the pace four wide
and had no rally. JUMP FOR THE WIN was inside into the first turn, then shifted out to track the pace in between rivals, then dropped to the inside on the
turn and weakened. RADIEUX was reserved early, four wide on the turn and had no response. RUBY BLEU vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.
