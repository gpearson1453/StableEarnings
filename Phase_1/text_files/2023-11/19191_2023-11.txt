Footnotes
UPTOWN KEEPMEINMIND was well rated along the rail close behind the pace setter, then dug in in the early stretch to edge clear in the final furlong and
held on to prevail in the end. RB MAMA WINGATE chased the pace while two wide, was advancing on the turn to rally entering the early stretch but lacked
the winning bid and bested the rest in the end. PSC MADISON was quickly off to set the pace from the inside, was in long drive leaving the bend,
maintained the lead in the early stretch before faltering in the end. SWEET IVORY AA stalked the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn, then
flattened out in the stretch. ERIN MHF raced towards the back of the pack while four wide then rallied too little too late in the home stretch. WMA TORCH
LIGHT chased the pace while three wide then settled back on the turn, bid in late stretch but it wasn't enough to make a difference. WMA WILD ROSES
moved up down the backstretch to chase the pace from the three path, rallied at the quarter pole while four wide, then angled towards the rail in the stretch
and still came up empty in the end. COLOR ME GONE MHF settled inside and came up empty in the end. WMA DIAMOND GIRL was out run and no factor.
