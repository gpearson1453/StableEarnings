Footnotes
OSCAR WINNER went out to an early lead, settled behind rivals after the first half circuit, gained quickly on the inside approaching the final hurdle, entered
the stretch in contention and prevailed for the win. TEASE AND SEIZE (FR) kept pace with the leaders through 8 hurdles, assumed the lead after the 9th
hurdle, entered the stretch in the lead but was outrun to just miss. AGITARE (IRE) settled toward the back of the field early, ran evenly, bid before the final
hurdle to gain position going into the stretch, but was unable to gain further on the leaders. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER assumed the lead after the first half mile
to set the pace through the 8th hurdle, relinquished the lead at the second to last hurdle, and faded before the last hurdle. WICKED WEST (IRE) ran evenly
at the back of the field through 7 hurdles, passed tiring rivals 3/8 from home, and was no threat. MET IN MIAMI ran in the back of the field, showed no
speed, and was never a threat. ARROWHEART ran evenly in the middle of the pack, faded after the 7th hurdle, pulled up before the last hurdle and walked
off. VINCENT VAN GOGO maintained position in the middle of the pack, fell at the 2nd to last hurdle and walked off. UNION GEN. GEORGE rated early, fell
on the 4th hurdle, and walked off. The rider of WICKED WEST (IRE) lodged a claim of foul against the field. The field was waved around the 9th hurdle on
the second circuit due to the previous fall of UNION GEN. GEORGE, and the rider claiming foul alleged that the rest of the field had gone off course. The
stewards conducted an inquiry, and following the review, determined that all horses and riders made their best effort to safely return to the course. The claim
of foul was disallowed and there was no change to the order of finish.
