LEADER pressed the pace dueling on the turn extending down the lane surging three deep at the wire, took a bad step past the wire and was euthanized on
track. KAZTHAROS chased the pace angling inside in mid stretch surging gamely at the rail to be right there at the wire. RADCLIFFE pressed early then
weakened on the turn. MARSALA MONARCH slow early played no factor. LIGHTNING JACK was never involved. BEST CHOICE BABY pressed early then
tired to upper stretch.
