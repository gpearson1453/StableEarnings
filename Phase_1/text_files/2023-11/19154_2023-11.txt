Footnotes
SAMURAI CHALLENGE settled in mid-pack on the rail, began to pick up horses starting to rally in midturn, shifted outside gaining momentum at the quarter
pole and closed strongly outside foes in the five path to get up right at the wire for the well timed late surge. BE ON NOTICE was nestled on the fence
behind the engaging duo along the backside, patiently waited inside throughout the turn, pounced shifted outside in the three path at the top of the lane,
took command at the sixteenth pole and just missed holding for the win in a tight photo at the wire. QUANDALE watched the front pair contesting for the
lead three wide on the outside, kept pace with the leaders through the turn, angled outside in the four path straightening for home and determinedly finished
up to be a clear third at the finish. ISSANO stalked near the rear in the beginning, began to lengthen stride three furlongs from the wire, rallied in the two
path turning for home, burst between the tiring early leaders at the furlong pole and got up for a minor role in the end. COMPUTER HACKER had a slim
lead pressured outside down the back straight, continued up front having a narrow advantage inside throughout the turn, was clinging to the lead inside at
the furlong marker but faded in the final sixteenth. SCAT FACTOR travelled in midfield on the outside down the backside, made no progress running outside
in the third flight around the bend and could not get involved down the stretch. WETIKO pressed the pace outside in the beginning, hounded the frontrunner
around the bend, dueled for the lead with rivals on each side turning for home, could not find more late and retreated at the furlong marker. UNDER
BUDGET co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, was roused on the turn making little impression and showed some interest to the wire closing the
gap on rivals at the finish. HURRICANE DESHAMBO was away slowly on the break, co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, could not keep up
through the turn and was a non factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
JULIE'S MIST assumed command setting a soft early pace down the backside, continued comfortably up front unchallenged on the turn, was headed
outside straightening out for home, battled inside down the lane, drifted out driving to the wire at the sixteenth pole and prevailed in a photo at the finish.
HOLIDAY WITH AMY was tucked in nicely on the rail watching the front two down the backside, sat on the fence waiting for her que running around the
turn, pounced four wide at the top of the stretch, was bumped inside dueling for the lead at the sixteenth pole and just missed at the wire. CRUMLIN BEAST
shadowed the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, was nudged making little gain on the leader three furlongs out and chased the front two through the
entire stretch, holding for a non threatening third crossing the line. I'M A BOURBON GIRL veered in sharply at the start, trailed in the beginning, saved all
the ground improving on the fence around the bend and showed late energy to get up to be a fringe player in the end. DREAMS AND SCHEMES travelled
three deep outside foes in midfield at the half mile marker, was hard ridden four wide on the outside midway on the turn, was fanned out widest in the seven
path turning for home and passed tired rivals down the stretch. ROCKET RILEY could see the field outside runners at the half, offered a mild run two wide
between horses with five sixteenths remaining and had nothing to give in the stretch drive. FOREST VIXEN settled in mid-pack with runners on each side
tracking the front duo down the back straight, was urged three wide between horses in midturn, maintained position through to the top of the lane and
yielded in the six path between foes at the sixteenth pole. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RCOF #4 HOLIDAY WITH AMY AGAINST #2 JULIES MIST AT THE

Footnotes
TOMCAT BLACK bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the inside and off the pace, shifted five wide turning for home advancing willingly, struck the lead
outside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. MASTER SPY switched out off the inside racing toward the rear, swung six wide into the stretch, kicked on and
got up for place. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) moved to a narrow lead soon after the start, dueled outside two to three deep through the turn, kept on in the stretch
but lost place late. ALICIA'S KID had the early lead inside, was overtaken but continued to contend, dueled through the turn into the stretch retaking a
narrow advantage but was outkicked. GHOUL (BRZ) pursued from in behind the dueling leaders racing just off the fence, went evenly. KING ALFREDO
exchanged a very light bump at the start, raced outside at the back, passed tired rivals. CHANCEL exchanged a light bump at the start, chased the dueling
leaders about three wide, weakened. WOOD BE WILD exchanged a very light bump at the start, chased from outside, drifted from four to eight wide leaving
the turn, faded. HALF LIT failed to menace while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE TOUCH took control from the onset, comfortably opened up on the chasing rivals through the turn and cruised home comfortably for an
impressive frontrunning score. FRIENDLY GHOST was off a step slow on the start, trailed outside down the backstretch, began to extend his stride picking
up horses three furlongs from the line and was full of run in the six path down the lane to best the rest at the wire. FASCINATION STREET travelled on the
outside in mid-pack, was shuffled back losing ground to the front pack through the turn, figured things out in the four path at the top of the stretch, found his
best stride late and closed smartly to capture the show award crossing the finish line. FAST AND READY hopped and broke inwards at the break, tracked
between runners at the half, rallied three wide battling for the runners up share turning for home but faded in deep stretch to settle for a minor share.
SNIPER JACK chased the winner down the backside, continued in vain to try to reel in the frontrunning winner around the bend, dueled between runners in
mid stretch for the runners up share but faded in the last sixteenth losing positions late. SAINT TEMPLAR was slow to start, regrouped to track three wide
outside foes at the half, came under a ride three furlongs out but was losing ground to the leaders and was empty for the drive to the finish line. FIFTY B M
G settled just behind the front two on the rail down the backside, kept pace on the turn saving ground on the fence, was in the mix inside turning for home
and could not find another gear down the lane and gave way in the final sixteenth. AWMIK SIDE OF TOWN was slow into stride at the break having one
other poor starter beaten down the backside, could not keep up with others three furlongs out and lost contact with the field around the turn.

GUN COURT set the pace from between runners, edged clear by the seven-sixteenths, widened in through upper- to mid-stretch and held safe. FOREST
FLASH broke inwardly, pressed the early pace from inside then continued to chase the eventual winner, was no match but held second. MYRA'S BOY was
forced in at the start, settled well back of the leaders, shifted five wide turning for home, had good late effort but missed place. CATHOLIC JACKIE bumped
the outer rival hard at the start, saved ground on the turn racing off the pace inside, came out a bit in the stretch and kicked on. SMART ALMASTY bumped
inside and out at the start, was outsprinted early, brought up the rear into the turn, moved out nine wide in upper stretch, ran on with late interest. MISTER
HOLDEN stalked up close three wide, weakened. LONHRO'S GAMBLE stalked from outside four deep, weakened. BEARING DOWN had strong bumps
inside and out at the start while sandwiched, raced outside four then five wide on the turn, needed more. KOCKTAIL KID settled off the pace, failed to rally.
SCREEN LEGEND broke inwardly bumping a rival, chased the leaders, faded.

Footnotes
STAYHONOR GOODSIDE tracked the top two on the fence, shifted off the rail rating comfortably between runners at the half, stared a rail run gaining on
the leaders turning for home and drew away smartly when encouraged right handed at the eighth pole for a convincing victory. QUIET SUNDAY was
allowed to settle near the back in the early going, was let loose three wide midpoint on the far turn, quickly circled runners around the bend, loomed the
threat in the five path driving to the wire but was no match for the winner the last furlong. CALUSA DONNIE settled in mid-pack three wide on the outside,
improved outside horses down the back straight, made a bold move three wide midway on the final turn to lead the field in upper stretch but could not hold
off the closers in the last furlong. HUNGRY WOLF assumed command on the first turn under a snug hold, dictated a mild pace down the backstretch, was
collared outside at the quarter pole and stubbornly fought to the wire holding for a minor role at the finish. UNDER SURVEILLANCE tracked outside at the
half mile marker, was roused for more with runners on either side with five sixteenths left to run, travelled in the four path in the mix for a share at the top of
the lane and faltered at the furlong marker. VICTORIA'S CHIEF stalked on the rail near the rear down the backside, took closer order in a tightly bunched
chasing field at the half, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize on the rail turning for home and ran on willingly through the stretch just missing out for
a small share in the end. GOODLUCKMATE trailed the field down the backside, made little progress running around the final bend and passed weary foes
down the stretch. SHAMATEUR chased the frontrunner down the backstretch inside, continued to be urged on the far turn inside keeping pace with others,
was in range three wide turning for home and weakened in mid-stretch. GUARD OF HONOUR travelled in midfield between foes down the backside, was
hard ridden three furlongs out but was losing ground to others through the far turn and lacked a rally down the stretch.

Footnotes
BLAST IN THE SNOW was quite rambunctious behind the gate, settled nicely, advanced in behind and inside on the turn, waited briefly at the quarter pole
racing just off the rail, found room between foes in mid-stretch and rallied to prevail. ARTIE bumped a rival lightly after the start, stalked the pace, went four
wide on the turn coming out five wide for the drive, kept on to gain the place. HILARIOUS AFFAIR was lightly bumped at the start, moved forward late up
the backstretch to prompt the pace, dueled into the turn, took the lead past the quarter pole, was outkicked. GRAN SPIRITED settled at the back, moved
past foes outside four to five wide on the turn swinging seven wide into upper stretch, lugged in a bit in late stretch and ran on mildly. GATLING GUN
tracked up close from inside, was three wide past the quarter pole, ran on. ARMS raced toward the rear going four wide on the turn, came in a bit in the
stretch and ran on evenly. RELOAD'S REBEL soon led, set the pace, vied inside on the turn, weakened. MAD MOCHA bumped a rival at the start then was
bumped by another foe, advanced inside rivals on the turn, moved out six wide turning for home, evened out. MIGHTY SEA chased briefly, retreated.
SOONER LUNAR pressed the pace briefly, came up empty. POSTURING reared at the start then veered in dramatically once out of the gate, was not a
factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ARMSTRONG broke outwards at the start, tracked the front duo three wide on the outside down the backstretch, began to edge closer three eighths from
the line, was in the hunt in the four path driving to the wire and wore down the leader in deep stretch to just get up at the finish. LA BELLEZA NEGRA had a
slim lead while hounded outside down the backstretch, dueled upfront on the fence around the turn, put away the early pace foe to open up mildly in upper
stretch and just could not hold off the stablemate in a tight photo at the wire. RED RIVER REBEL travelled two wide on the outside in midfield in the early
going, was nudged on between runners keeping position through the turn, was looking for a clear path in upper stretch, angled inside driving to the wire at
the furlong pole and finished with intent to capture third at the line. FORESTER'S FORTUNE co-trailed on the inside at the half, could see the field running
around the bend, lacked running room stuck behind a wall of runners in upper stretch, weaved through traffic late and got up for a minor role at the wire.
SLIPSTREAM co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, was urged right handed midway on the turn, rallied at the quarter pole to loom in the five path
at the top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. THERE'S NO JOE pressed the pace on the outside down the back straight, dueled for the lead
outside running around the bend, could not continue up front turning for home and wilted in the three path in mid-stretch. BOSTON TEA PARTY travelled on
the fence in mid-pack down the backside, had an inside trip keeping pace with the leaders throughout the turn and could not go on with others in the final
furlong.

CITY MISCHIEF was bumped at the start, advanced inside on the turn, came out four wide in upper stretch, rallied between runners to prevail. HALLIE'S
HERO stalked from outside three to four wide, had a narrow lead in upper stretch, was outfinished but held place. FOUR ACES HIGH tracked from inside,
shifted out coming to the quarter pole four wide, was five wide in the stretch, ran on but missed second. SIR SEAMUS quickly moved clear, set the pace
inside on or just off the rail, weakened. SALVATOR MUNDI settled early dropping back to the rear, went four then five wide outside runners on the turn
coming into upper stretch six deep, kicked on mildly. SILENT RUNNER bumped the inside rival at the start, raced between foes two to three wide at the
back, failed to menace. STAR SIGN chased three to four deep, was ridden along from the three-eighths, moved out seven wide at the top of the stretch,
failed to threaten. FORESTER HUMOR stalked about three wide, shifted in past the quarter pole, faded.

Footnotes
VENTI settled patiently under a good hold rating kindly down the backside, pulled the rider to the lead three wide circling horses around the turn, took
control turning for home and cruised to the finish for the victory. SMOKIN HOLIDAY tracked three deep at the half, was hard ridden but could no go on with
the winner circling horses at the five sixteenth marker, chased in vain through the stretch under a vigorous ride and just held at the wire for place. STREET
SERENADE broke inwards brushing the gate at the start, trailed down the backside, uncorked his run on the fence in midturn, split foes closing in down the
lane at the eighth pole and finished up well to be a clear third in the end. IT'S ME MARIO tracked the pacesetter on the rail, kept pace through the turn,
angled outside in the four path straightening out for the drive and finished up mildly to the wire to hold on battling for the minors. HARPER CITY tracked on
the rail early on, was shuffled in tight quarters on the fence entering the turn and showed some late interest in the stretch to battle for the minors at the wire.
BROTHER BELEN broke sharp to ne near the lead early on, was throttled back on the fence to travel in mid-pack at the half, midway on the bend was
asked for run but made little headway through the turn and could not get involved through the stretch on the wrong lead to the finish line. OPEECHEE had
one beat down the backside, was roused to go after the leaders three wide at the quarter pole, offered little response and passed a straggler down the
stretch. SING DIXIE emerged from the pack with the lead running in hand at the half, continued up front around the bend, was collared outside by runners at
the quarter pole and backed away through the field on the fence down the stretch.
