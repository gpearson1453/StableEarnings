raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn, couldn't catch the leader, but was best of others. DIRECTIONAL unhurried in the
beginning, racing in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two. HULLINAHURRY
raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no real factor. NINETEEN HUNDRED showed early
speed, weakened and was no threat late. PINCH HITTER lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. MOSH PIT

Footnotes
STOVALL pressed the early pace, came around the turn on the outside and drove clear before the wire. MAGICAL MARK vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, came in down the home stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second. FROSTY VIEW raced within
striking distance, saved ground around the turn, steadied on the inside down the home stretch, getting in tight quarters, angled to the outside and went to
the wire evenly. LOUDERMILK pressed the pace, came around the turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide and finished evenly. C D'S WILD FIRE void
of early speed and passed tired ones. WESTERN AFLEET dueled on the front end in the early part, saved ground and faded. GHOSTLY TIME always
raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
SABER STORM stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside around the second turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear before the
wire. DOUBLE PRIORITY pressed the pace, took the advantage at the 1/2 pole, drove clear, but couldn't match strides with the winner late. JOEY'S
LIGHTENING void of early speed, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and finished willingly. PAYOFF CYCLE raced in the middle of the
pack, made a mild bid and finished evenly. MR ELVIN lacked early speed, improved position, racing inside down the stretch, but was no real factor.
XANTHUS WRATH raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. SILVER CHALICE went to the front, drove clear and was finished early.
KINLEE'S SONG raced evenly near the back and was never close. SMART ANALYSIS raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the
outside and dropped back. SHADY GRADY raced near the back, came around the first turn on the out side and showed little.

Footnotes
PLAY MO dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and won under steady urging. CLASSIC BET
challenged for the early lead, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. KNIGHT COMMANDER raced near the back
in the beginning, came around the first turn on the outside, made a late bid, was no match for the top two, but got up for third. UP N GONE lacked early
speed, raced outside around the second turn, entered the stretch wide and was outfinished for third. BURNING LEAVES raced within contention, saved
ground around the final turn and weakened on the inside. GOD'S GOLD lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back. BAY BE GONE always raced
near the back and was outrun. MONGOLIAN BEE raced within striking distance and dropped back. HEIR TO GREATNESS raced in the middle of the field,
retreated to the rear and was eased to the wire.
