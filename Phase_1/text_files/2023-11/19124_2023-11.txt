Footnotes
NICK PAPAGIORGIO was away alertly and got over towards the inside into the first turn, then was well rated along the inside, shifted off the rail leaving the
five sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane and shifted out to make an outside bid on the lane and edged away late to prove best under a drive.
ROMP was off a bit slowly, then shifted out and tracked the pace three wide on the first turn, made a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths and gained a
short advantage heading to the quarter pole, then was clear by the furlong marker but collared by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and could not go
with that rival late, second best. SOUPER ROYAL MOON set a pressured pace along the inside and was headed by the five sixteenths and gave way
grudgingly, bested rest. YOUNGEST OF FIVE was three wide into the first turn, pressed the pace two wide and made a bid between rivals on the far turn
but flattened out the final furlong. SUPER DUDE was in tight on the inside into the first turn, then shifted out leaving the five eighths marker and had a four
wide pursuit leaving the half mile marker and had no rally.

OVER AND THUNDER set a pressured pace early on the inside, shook clear on the backstretch, then widened the margin on the turn, then drew off in the
lane to prove much the best while being ridden out. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was rated early three to four wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn but
proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HIBACHI pressed the winner two wide early, then dropped to the inside and chased that
rival on the far turn and weakened, bested rest. ADY'S MUNNY was three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and tired. RECONVENE was
settled back on the inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
COOL IN BLUE was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew out off the turn and remained clear
with speed to spare to prove best. SOCIALLY AWKWARD dueled for the early lead on the inside, won that battle but could not go with the winner despite
fighting on willingly to be clearly second best. BELLS RUN was settled back early to trail the field, swung out wide for the drive and had a belated rally to
gain the show award. EAST AURORA raced wide towards the back and was bumped by the five eighths marker, then continued four to five wide on the turn
and showed some late interest to gain the last spot in the superfecta. MISSILEER was away alertly to duel for the lead two wide and weakened. THAT'S
JUST GREAT was bumped around the five furlong marker while three wide and had no rally. PENTATONIC chased the pace on the inside and weakened.
HOLD MY BEER BRO showed brief speed and weakened. WELL TIMED was bumped at the start and saved ground while being no threat. AURORA
KUMA was settled early, made a mild four wide advance by the quarter pole but then stopped in the final furlong.

JUMP FOR THE WIN set the pace on the inside, then was pressured on the backstretch, dueled by the quarter pole with THUNDERLAN, then had a long
drive with that rival, came out slightly under left hand crop and exchanged bumps but held on determinedly to prove best. THUNDERIAN stalked the early
pace three wide, then made a bid to duel with the winner two wide on the far turn, then exchanged bumps through the stretch drive but hung late. STEADY
JOHN had an awkward break, settled early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, then made a inside bid in the lane but needed more late. GOOSE
HUNTER chased the early pace four wide, shifted in to the inside at the nine sixteenths, then dropped back on the inside, then made a inside move nearing
the quarter pole and had some late kick. CAJUN OCCASION tracked the pace three to four wide and weakened in the lane. The rider on number two
THUNDERLAN filed an OBJECTION against the winner for interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the video replays the OBJECTION
was not allowed and the race was left as is.
