Footnotes
MOONTAP chased the pace for five furlongs, made the lead, opened a clear advantage before the quarter pole, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch
and just lasted under brisk handling. DONNARUMMA well placed in a stalking position outside, swung wide entering the stretch, surged in the middle of the
racetrack late and just missed. STORMIN MELLY allowed to settle, loomed boldly inside the winner nearing the furlong marker then was outfinished.
PEARLINTHEROUGH failed to menace. MAGESTAL BASTIDA was no factor. FABIOLA PRINCESS broke in front, set the pace along the inside for five
furlongs then was used up. SOULSTONE was no threat. PER HISA RULING DATED 11/28/2023, STORMIN MELLY WAS DQ'D DUE TO A WHIP
INFRACTION.

MAGIC PALACE was bumped hard at the start, unhurried early, closed willingly along the rail under a hand ride to make the lead at the top of the stretch,
drew clear before the furlong marker and just lasted. LIAM'S LASS bore at the start bumping hard with the winner, rallied in the five path through the stretch
while three wide and and just missed getting up in time. BIG JAVA chased the pace from the four path and finished determinedly between horses two wide.
SPRING MAGIC away alertly, set the pace off the rail into the stretch then weakened. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN was bumped at the start, trailed for five
furlongs then passed tiring rivals in the five path. REACHING STRIDE was no factor. WILDCAT DREAM had brief speed. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER stalked
the early pace two wide and was through after a half. BIG BANG BLUE was through early.

Footnotes
MISS BUMBUM vied for the lead along the rail for a half, responded under right handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and proved best in
a stiff drive while fully extended. MOBIL MEMORY stalked the pace into the stretch dug in late four wide and got up for second. QUEENIE ROSE never far
back, found her best stride late six wide. MANDOLIN BREEZE never far back, improved position four wide through the stretch. DANCE DRAMA battled for
the lead three wide until deep stretch then faded. GHOSTLY REVIVAL trailed early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals mid track. DOLCE MARIE
contested the lead two wide into the stretch and gave way late. FANTOOSH had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half. TOTAL
SMOKESHOW had speed for a half then wilted. SHAKA'S LYRIC was outrun. HERE COMES DOLLY was no threat.
