Footnotes
SHANE'S JEWEL vied for the early lead two wide into the first turn, then dropped to the inside to set the pace, was pressured on the backstretch and shook
clear by the quarter pole, then widened the margin off the turn and was kept to a mild drive to prove best while being clear. CAERUS tracked the early pace
between rivals on the first turn, then was three wide down the backstretch, dropped to the inside leaving the half mile marker and saved ground on the far
turn, then was inside into the lane and finished willingly to gain the place award late. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA vied for the early lead on the inside, then was
in tight nearing the thirteen sixteenths, steadied slightly and moved to the outside and then went up to press the winner three wide by the five eighths marker
to the five sixteenths, then could not match strides with the winner, between rivals off the turn and fought on grudgingly to the wire to just miss the place
award. PATTY'S BOY tracked the pace on the outside, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole but flattened out the final furlong. PRATT was allowed
to settle on the inside and had no rally. LAKE NAKURU chased the pace three wide and weakened.

SEAMIALAUGH was well rated early, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best, was
flagged with the crop while being hand ridden to the wire. RISQUE'S JEWEL was reserved early on the inside, advanced three wide on the turn, came five
wide off the turn and rallied well for the place award, no match for the winner. FIELD LETTERS was settled early two wide, advanced on the turn on the
inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn but was out-kicked for the place award while besting the rest. MISS ALEX was allowed to settle early on the
inside, advanced two wide on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole and passed the tiring rivals. ZIPPY JO was away alertly to set the early pace
while clear, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and gave way in the drive. HELLO GRACIE stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the
turn to vie for command by the quarter pole but weakened the final furlong. WICKED T dull effort.

place award. TIZ SPEEDY pressed the pace two wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but hung in the lane, bested rest. SPENDOLINI tracked
the early pace from between rivals, then saved ground on the turn, angled off the inside leaving the furlong marker and faded. SPOOKY ONE was a bit
fractious in the gate, tracked the pace on the inside and fell back on the turn, then was eased in the lane, walked off.
