Footnotes
EARLY DAWN raced within contention, waited on the inside around the turn, got through on the inside entering the home stretch and drove clear. JANIS
pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was second best. STOLEN ART
raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid and got up for third. HIDDEN LOVE lacked early speed, showed late
interest and was outfinished for show. MY NEW PALACE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. SWEETHEART VISION void of early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. HOPESHECANRUN showed early speed and made a steady retreat. MOVE FORWARD ESSIE raced evenly
near the back, finished wide and was never a threat. NATURALBORNSENDER raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and dropped back. EZ'S
KOOL BREEZE broke a step slow, trailed the field and was distanced. PER RULING #25248 FROM THE LOUISIANA HORSE RACING COMMISSION
EARLY DAWN WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
BILOXI unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a late bid, racing four wide and proved the best late. MIDNIGHT
ESCAPE raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, came around the final turn on the outside, took the lead, but could't hold off the winner deep
in the stretch. VIETNAM VICTORY raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung, while racing on the rail. VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) dueled on the
front end, saved ground around the final turn and faded. LIFE IS A BANQUET challenged for the early lead and was finished early. UNCLE FRANK raced in
the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. SILENT POWER lacked early speed and was outrun. WISE VERDICT raced within striking distance and
dropped back. DOUBLE STAR always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
A WISH FOR MADELYN unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the final turn, rallied down the lane, pulled away and won handily. BE
A BANDIT vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HARLANS WARRIOR pressed the
pace, eased back, saved ground around the final turn, made a late bid and got up for the show position. SHE'S MY PRIORITY dueled on the front end,
saved ground around the final turn and weakened. STORM BREACH raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside and faded. L G
GIRL void of early speed and showed little. BATTY lacked early speed and was never close.

PURE MALICE unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied down the lane, four wide and proved
the best late. FUNNYFLAME pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid, took the lead and was outfinished by PURE MALICE for the win.
MINOR DISCREPANCY vied for the early lead, saved ground and proved no match for the top two. IRISH MOON showed early speed, raced close
throughout and just missed for third. FREE DROP ROB raced within striking distance, weakened and was no real factor. DYNAMIC SUN raced in the back
of the pack, improved position, but was no threat. CLEARING CUSTOMS raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. PAPA
FLEW BOMBERS raced in the middle of the pack and faded. LATE NIGHT CRUISER had a tight start, racing in the back and was never a threat.
MYTURNTODEAL lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn and showed little.
