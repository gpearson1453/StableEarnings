ICING pressured the pace through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch finishing with plenty left. RED GUN chased the pace laying close through the turn,
no match for the winner down the lane stayed after it saving place. O ROMEO pressed then chased on the turn racing inside to upper stretch proving no
match for the winner there. DASH OF FIRE slow early was never in contention outbidding the others down the lane. AWESOME ENOUGH pressed hard on
the turn then faded in upper stretch. PALACE TEMPTATION offered little. ALTMEISTER chased through the turn then wilted abruptly in upper stretch. EL
PIQUIN was steadied from the gate to the five eighths pole dropping far back.
