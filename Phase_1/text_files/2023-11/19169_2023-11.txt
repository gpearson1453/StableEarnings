Footnotes
AMALFI LADY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over at the eighth pole and pulled away in the final furlong. HOLY BERRIES hustled to the
front inside, moved clear before half a mile, was collared by the winner and yielded. CASH ON FIRST settled off the pace inside, moved out on the final turn
then flattened out. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS lacked speed, bid briefly closer on the final turn then faded. CAPE NEDDICK trailed for half a mile then passed
tiring rivals. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN fractious in the gate, raced close up inside then stopped in the stretch. LA LA LUCY dropped back early and weakened
steadily. KEFALIANI raced wide trying to bear out and lost contact with her field.

Footnotes
ALL HAIL MO stalked the leaders, chased on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied steadily outside in the lane, then surged in deep stretch to get
up for the win. WICKED LADY vied outside for the early lead, dueled three wide on the turn, held a short lead entering the stretch, then dueled with AUNT
BERRA, continued gamely to the end for place honors. AUNT BERRA set the early pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled between rivals on the turn, dug in
gamely inside of WICKED LADY in the final furlong and battled on to the finish. LORD JOAN was off slowly, raced off the pace and closed belatedly outside.
LOUELLA STREET raced close up early on the inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled and weakened. INCOMPARABLE was off slowly and steadied,
then outrun. ANGELIC GAL was off slowly and steadied, raced off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and had no rally. SAY NO MORE raced off the
pace, chased inside on the turn and faded.

WE BE THERE advanced to the front into the far turn and eagerly pulled away while kept to his business. COLONEL JUAN raced wide throughout, went
after the winner on the final turn, proved no match but held the place. CARTIER CAT broke slowest then hustled to the front, lost the lead but continued
willingly. MORE THAN A DANCE prompted the leader outside for half a mile and faltered. HE'SSOSUBTLE lagged far behind then caught a fading rival. JO
JO KATZ saved ground well off the leaders and stopped.

HORNBEAM settled off the pace outside, bid four wide on the final turn and edged away late. ET'S MAGIC MAN prompted the pace three wide, took over
midway on the final turn and was no match for the winner. KODAPENDENT dropped far behind then offered some late energy. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM
chased inside, bid briefly closer on the final turn then faltered. CAPE HEDGE broke slowest and trailed long way then was no factor. LET IT FLOW JOE set
a pressured pace inside for three quarters and faded. SOVEREIGN CHANGE vied between rivals, led narrowly before the half then stopped.

LE VIN dueled between rivals, shook loose into the stretch then held gamely held rival safe through the final furlong. LONESOME BOY steadied along from
half mile pole to three eighths pole, angled out into the lane but could not get by the winner. DEPOSITION saved ground close up, was blocked near the
quarter pole and flattened out. SHEER DOMINANCE lagged far behind then showed some late energy. PARTY AT SAM'S broke alertly and set pressured
inside then proved empty in the stretch. POPS HARPER forced the pace three wide to the stretch and gave way. DRY DOCK lagged far behind and was
always outrun.
