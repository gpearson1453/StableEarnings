BETWEEN DREAMS tracked the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn, then was roused left handed and drew clear to prove best. SHATTER ME
was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then was headed by the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best.
PHANCY PHILLY chased the pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out, bested rest. SEAMIALAUGH chased the pace two wide
and had no rally. TERPEYE was off slowly and far back early, three wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. KATY THE CAT was settled early on the
inside and failed to respond. JACK'S LILLY tracked the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
PERFECT HIDEAWAY tracked the loose pacesetter throughout, was ridden along on the far turn and came two wide into the lane, continued to chase that
rival to the furlong marker and then continued on and wore down that rival late to get up to prove best, driving. GOLDEN MOONLIGHT set a fast pace while
clear, three wide into the lane and then shifted in by the furlong marker, got tired late and was caught. SWAN POINT was reserved early, made a three wide
move on the turn and then finished willingly but needed more. FOXY JUNIOR was settled on the inside, saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed
winning bid. CUENCA was off a step slow, then was motivated early and four wide into the first turn, had a three wide pursuit and tired. EIGHT DANZAS
failed to menace.

Footnotes
CATALENA stalked the early pace, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over by the five sixteenths, then shook clear nearing the furlong marker and
held well to prove best under a drive. IRISH SAMURAI was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the inside and eased off the inside and made
a four wide bid off the turn, ran on to the wire but could not get to the winner, second best. NADIABIZNIZ was four wide into the first turn, angled in and was
reserved early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out late. DANCE STEP tracked the pace early, made a three wide bid on the turn to press
the winner but weakened the final furlong. SHEA D SECRET was settled three wide and lacked a rally. ESTA CHUCK was four wide into the first turn,
settled back and was not a factor. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY set the pace on the inside and gave way after five furlongs.

INDIAN BUZZ was well rated early, ranged up five wide leaving the quarter pole, then closed on the outside and got up late to prove best under left handed
crop. FED CHAIR was three wide into the first turn, pressed the pace two wide, made a bid on the turn to gain a short lead, dug in gamely in the lane but
was caught late to just miss. WARRIOR IN CHIEF was away alertly to cross over and set a pressured pace along the inside, then gave way grudgingly while
saving the show award. SECRETARY AT WAR was well placed along the inside, eased out by the quarter pole and came three wide into the lane and
between rivals buy hung in the lane, missed show award. C C'S WARRIOR tracked the early pace, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and was
between rivals off the turn but flattened out. POCOPSON STATION was taken back to trail on the inside and had no response.
