Footnotes
MONGOLIAN KINGDOM started in the middle of the pack then had a steady gain throughout both turns then took the lead early in the stretch and drew off
from the pack winning with over thirteen lengths. GREENBRIER started out in the front of the pack then shuffled back to mid pack but once they reached the
three eights pole they had a steady increase in pace to make up the lost ground previously had at the start of the race then late stretch just edged over to
get second over another charging foe. SOULONG ran at the back of the pack with a even pace then around the quarter pole they started their closing rally
to cover lots of ground and end up in third just missing second by a neck. REIGN OVER ME started in the middle of the pack but quickly made their way to
the front and held the lead for majority of the race then hung slightly at the start of the home stretch then finished out the race in fourth. LOOPY DUDE
started in the front of the pack then shuffled back slightly as they went down the back stretch but evened out their pace to maintain their spot in the middle of
the pack. LITTLE RED RIFLE ran at the front of the pack off pace from the leader then in the middle of the second turn faded back losing ground. START
THEM UP had a reared break then trailed for most of the race, ended up passing tired foes late into the home stretch. TIGER HUNTER had a mild bid in the
middle of the race then by the three eights pole started to fade and slow the rest of the race. BIGG LIMO started off in the front of the pack but was
outclassed and ended up slowing throughout the race. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AT THE START REGARDING START THEM UP THEY
DETERMINED THEY HE CAUSED HIS OWN SLOW BREAK AND THERE WAS NO FOUL PLAY.
