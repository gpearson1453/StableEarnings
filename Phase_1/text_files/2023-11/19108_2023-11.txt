Footnotes
STREET MAX stalked the leaders down the backside, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetters at the quarter pole, opened a clear advantage in upper
stretch and was never threatened down the lane. WILDERZAR unhurried in the early going to be near the back of the field, swept up four wide on the turn to
loom and finished willingly while unable to match the winner. EL BANDIDO trailed into the turn, commenced a steady advance in the turn and finished well
to be gaining late. FROSTY PAWS sped up to duel on the lead from the fence to the head of the lane and weakened through the stretch. PAPA D L broke a
step tardy to be at the rear of the field, rallied down the backside and through the turn to be in striking distance and flattened out turning for home.
LEFTLANEOUTLAW pressed the pace dueling to the quarter pole from two wide and gave way in the lane.

ALWAYS LAUGHING tracked the pace from the rail down the backside, made a steady advance up the rail through the turn, tipped two wide nearing the
quarter pole to engage the pacesetter and drew clear in the lane. DUNVEGAN DOLL well positioned between rivals entering the backstretch, lost position to
be at the back of the field while patiently handled, saved ground through the final bend rallying up the rail, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly.
R THREE ANGELS set the pace while well rated down the backside, maintained the advantage to the quarter pole and lacked a response when engaged
turning for home. CEVICHE prompted the pace to the far turn and flattened out coming home. PRINCESS HALIME went evenly without impact. HAPPY
BEE caught wide through the first turn, raced up to a stalking spot down the backside and was through early.

broke a step slow to be near the rear, rallied along the fence cutting the corner at the top of the lane and closed well to gain the place. BODIL reserved off
the leaders to the turn and made a mild rally through the stretch. MIZZEN THE POINT tracked the pace to the bend, rallied four wide through the turn to
threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. CHICA CHULA stumbled badly leaving the gate to be well behind the field and showed some late
interest in the stretch. GO GIRL showed brief speed to be on the lead and was through early. MARGARITA CINCO well placed in the early going and fade
through the turn.

HOUSEBUILDER tracked the pace to the turn, rallied five wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch and pulled clear late in a determined drive. TOYI well
placed along the rail just off the pace, made a threatening bid while cutting the corner turning for home, drifted out in the lane and finished willingly while
unable to keep pace with the winner. LITTLE VAQUERO stalked the pace to the turn, ranged up three wide between horses to challenge at the head of the
lane and finished evenly while in tight down the lane. GOLD HERITAGE reserved off the leaders through the turn, angled wide in upper stretch and made a
mild late rally. FAST FELIX slow early to trail and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. WARHORSE WEST pressed the pace to the quarter pole and weakened
in the lane. AWESOME ENOUGH set the pace from the fence under pressure throughout and gave way coming home. ESTILO CLASICO was never a
threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY IN REGARDS TO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE.

CONTROLLER stalked the pace to the far turn, assumed command into the bend opening a clear advantage to upper stretch, was engaged by stablemate
and dueled to the wire gamely coming back to prevail by the shortest of margins at the wire. CASUAL ATTIRE tracked the leaders from three wide to the
turn, rallied to mid-stretch to collar the leader, battled with that one to the wire and was denied by a nostril on the head bob. KNOCK WOOD reserved off the
pace to the top of the lane and ground out the show placing. HITE slow early to trail and passed tiring rivals in the lane. WETZEL chased the leaders into
the turn mounting a four wide rally into contention and flattened out in the drive. INTO GOLD sped to the lead opening a clear lead and stopped midway on
the turn.

NEXT GENERATION squeezed at the start to be taken up and trail early, made a steady advance leaving the three-eighths pole, angled to the clear five
wide in upper stretch and finished well to be up in time. SEEYOUINMOTOWN unhurried in the early going, rallied four wide through the turn to engage the
pacesetter in mid-stretch, took command inside the eighth pole and was caught in deep stretch. THE MIRACLE KIUT broke outward start, sped to the lead
to have a comfortable advantage through the turn and tired down the lane. KAT TRAX pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened in the drive.
SUGAR LOVES IT pinched back at the start from between rivals, raced up the fence into the turn to be in contention and lacked a closing response.
SORORITY SISTER stalked the pace from three wide to be prominent at the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. KISS VALENTINA showed brief foot
to be well placed and came up empty.

RAINBOW'S PRIDE hustled up the fence to take the lead shortly from the gate, responded when challenged turning for home and cleared off in the drive
impressively. QUARANTINO broke alertly, taken in hand to settle into stalking position three wide, rallied to threaten at the top of the stretch and finished
willingly while no match for the winner. ATLANTIC VAQUERO tracked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to loom boldly in upper stretch and was
outkicked down the lane while clearly the best to the rest. NAPA DUDE slow early to trail and passed tiring rivals in the lane. AURA OF GOLD failed to
menace. DUKE OF FENWAY was never a threat. ESTILO FAVORITO pressed the pace for three-eighths and tired.
