Footnotes
STOLEN MAGIC was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came out into upper stretch then made a
bid at the three-sixteenths, gained the lead coming to the furlong marker and edged clear under steady handling. BONUS MOVE was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start, moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was asked at the
quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage near the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the place. WAJDA moved out then
tracked the pace on the outside, stalked in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole then passed the three-sixteenths in the four
path, remained on his inside lead in the drive and came up empty while clear for the show. LIVEHAPPY tossed his head at the start then lunged and was off
slow, checked between horses shortly thereafter, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SARDIS broke in and
bumped the hindquarters of a foe while off a bit slow then was taken up with a snatch of the right-rein, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along in
the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. ALLEGRINI hit the inside of the gate then veered in before being corrected by the rider and was off slow,
spotted the front several lengths, went around the turn in the three path and also was no factor.

RUNNING BEE angled in while going to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far
turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch then extended the advantage, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and
powered home determinedly to prove much the best. CRABS N BEER traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused along
the rail on the far turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. EMARAATY (GB) broke through the front of the gate prior to the start, was
brought back around and reloaded, saved ground while well placed in hand just off the pace, came out into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final
furlong and weakened but held the show. WOW WHATA SUMMER settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
OCALA DREAM rounded the opening bend in the two path, settled towards the back, was roused in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. HIGH TIDE went five then four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn,
chased while coming out some into upper stretch and capitulated. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled
off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to respond. NOLO CONTESTO
was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, drop back three then four wide on the far turn, floated six wide into the
stretch and had nothing left. CARPENTERS CALL was last to commence then hustled before being taken in hand, raced inside for most of the first turn then
moved to the two path, settled at the back, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little.

Footnotes
M B'S MUNNING led briefly early on before chasing three wide stacked between foes in aim of the leader, had GUN MAESTRO and HATCH tuck in a path
from the outside nearing the half mile pole and got shuffled out from between foes when eased off into the turn, tipped out five wide placed to coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths and began a steady advance, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear to the
finish kept to task. PREDICTED chased three then two wide until briefly tucked to the inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing just off the inside at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. GUN MAESTRO just off the pace six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, advanced into the turn tucking four wide to vie outside a trio for command coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch kept on to preserve the show honors. BAD LARRY established the front a furlong into the running and showed the way narrowly
over a quartet in hand along the inside, vied inside a trio through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch
clinging to the front, got displaced nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. FLASH KISS bobbled at the break, chased along the inside and
then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HATCH forwardly placed
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn advancing to vie for command between rivals under coaxing from three
furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LEGENDARY LORE chased just off the inside and then along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. SORPRESO chased in the overland route
six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper
stretch and came up empty. BUILT TO LAST fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced forwardly placed holding narrow and brief command with six
furlongs to go before settling in closest aim of the leader, advanced in the turn to vie for the front just off the inside between foes and under coaxing from
midway, continued in the two path at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BRICK AMBUSH drifted out early, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while two then three wide on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then
shook clear, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. INONIT broke in and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, was urged in
the two path on the turn and improved for the place. VIN SANTO was hustled from the gate, settled off the pace, advanced late on the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, shifted to the two path outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. QUIET
WISDOM was sent hard to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and tired.
PROPHETIC was ridden along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. JUDGE RULES was bumped at the start then
forced into another rival, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. SWEET TONE bumped with a rival at the start, raced at the rear, moved from the
rail to the two path on the turn and showed little. PODERE was urged along off the pace, came up empty on the turn and retreated then was eased but
walked off.

Footnotes
KINETIC SKY settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the leading duo under a drive into the
final sixteenth and got up under strong urging to prevail. GUN IT broke very alertly from the outside post, moved in while going to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive while remaining on his inside lead,
dueled inside of BABY YODA into the final furlong, drifted out under a left-handed crop while continuing on his left-lead outside the sixteenth-pole, led into
the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the place. BABY YODA was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the three
path on the turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the show.
SCARAMOUCHE was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch and weakened. NOVA RAGS was restless
in the gate, lunged at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, settled on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, was roused in
the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. CHEWING GUM settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SYNTHESIS settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, moved from
three to five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ROAGNA went around the first turn in the two path, moved out early on the backstretch, settled outside without cover starting before the nine-sixteenths,
was roused four then five wide on the final turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the furlong marker then powered away to prove
much the best in an impressive debut. SAINTE CHAPELLE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under encouragement on the far turn,
shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner at the furlong marker and proved no match
while just able to hold the place. VOLEUSE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground while rated off the pace, waited off heels into
upper stretch, was roused inside the furlong marker, raced along the rail while crowded a bit in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place
while clear for the show. TURRIGA went three to four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn,
