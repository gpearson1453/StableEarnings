Footnotes
SMILES FOR DAVID had the lead after the break, was reined back to track the frontrunner on the rail by the half, rallied inside splitting runners in the two
path turning for home and tenaciously battled to the wire winning the bob at the finish line. GENTLE SEAS settled four deep in the middle of the pack down
the backstretch, advanced smartly outside foes at the half, tracked the leader three wide around the turn, pounced three wide outside straightening out for
the drive, poked her head in front at the eighth pole and gamely fought to the wire losing the photo at the finish. LOOK AT LIL SISTER was hustled at the
start outside to take command by the half mile marker, set the fractions on the fence around the bend, was collared outside at the quarter pole, was no
match for the top two in the stretch but held for a clear third in the end. JIMMY IS A BREEZE stalked near the rear in the early stages, began to pick up
rivals midway through the turn, nudged for more at the quarter pole and willingly finished up down the stretch for a minor share. HARD ROCK WARRIOR
had one beat down the backside, trailed entering the turn, edged closer to the pack at the quarter pole, angled outside four wide at the top of the stretch and
finished with intent battling for a minor share in the end. CLASSICALCROSSOVER travelled in mid-pack on the rail with a half mile to run, crept closer on
the fence running around the turn, was in range for a share at the top of the lane but needed more late to be a factor at the wire. TANGERINE TWIST was
under a tight hold watching the front two at the half, chased the pacesetter on the turn, bid for the lead with horses on each side in the two path at the
quarter pole, could not find another gear turning for home and faltered in upper stretch. SMART IRENE was unhurried trailing in the early going, made a
brief and early move four wide around foes at the three furlong marker, could not sustain the run and had little to show in the stretch run. FEROCIOUS
QUEEN prompted the pace at the start, was then relegated to settle in midfield on the rail between foes at the half, could not keep up to runners through the
turn and came up empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LADY EVA broke on top, was quickly clear and shifted in to set the pace inside, was shadowed by foes on the turn, moved clear while coming off the rail a
bit into upper stretch, was kept to the task and extended the margin. MO TOUGH exchanged a very minor bump at the start, was coaxed forward, pursued
the eventual winner three wide just off that one's flank, was no match but held the place. LOOKHOWPRETTY advanced outside four to five wide on the
turn, evened out thereafter. FEW REGRETS exchanged minor contact at the start, was within range stalking outside three to four deep, shifted in late on the
turn, lacked the needed late kick. GAVEL GIRL switched out off the inside racing toward the rear but unencumbered into the turn, swung seven wide into
upper stretch, showed mild late interest. WILD QUEENIE raced outside foes at the rear about three wide on the turn, was never a threat. BLACKMARSH
lacked early speed, raced off the rail into the turn but inside a foe, was never a threat. GUNNAWIN was close up very early but dropped back off the heels of
the leader, chased two to three deep, weakened. LADY GABRIELLE pursued from inside, checked at the five-sixteenths, was not persevered with in the
stretch and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BE LIKE CLINT stalked on the fence near the rear in the early stages, angled outside three wide starting to move at the quarter pole, quickly pounced out
widest in the six path turning for home and drew away convincingly in deep stretch. ENCHANT ME stalked four wide into the first turn, improved outside of
foes in the four path down the back straight, circled three wide around rivals at the three eighths marker, took command in the five path in upper stretch and
no match for the winner running on the wrong lead to the finish. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY was unhurried seeing this field down the backside, rallied on the
fence into the final turn, shifted just outside off the tiring early leader at the quarter pole and finished up mildly splitting runners late for third money.
BRINGER OF RAIN travelled in midfield on the outside down the back straight, edged closer three wide narrowing the gap at the quarter marker and was
one paced down the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. MT LOGAN settled in mid-pack on the rail at the half, crept closer to the leader on the far turn,
bid for the the lead at the quarter pole between horses and stalled on the rail at the furlong marker. FOUR K FORCE took command into the first turn,
opened up under brisk fractions along the backside, was engulfed by rivals outside at the quarter pole and emptied out turning for home. STORMIN DAVE
was content to track the loose pacesetter down the backstretch, could not quicken with others starting a move on the far turn and was not a presence in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
IT WORKED broke out just a bit, attended from outside with a narrow advantage then settled off the leader stalking patiently into the turn, moved closer
heading into upper stretch, struck the lead past the eighth pole, was lightly bumped by the weakening pacesetter and edged past. SWATH was lightly
bumped into a rival at the start, moved clear after the opening five-sixteenths setting the pace from off the rail, widened on the turn, was challenged in
mid-stretch, drifted out a bit lightly bumping the new leader, fought on gamely but was outfinished. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN stalked from off the pace going
two to three wide on the turn, gained steadily but slowly inside in late stretch but was too late. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was forced out just a bit at the start,
was caught four to five wide on the turn and ridden starting three furlongs out, kept on late. EXECUTIVE GIANT broke quite awkwardly, was unhurried at the
rear under some rating, advanced between foes two to three deep late on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, ran on but evened out late. ORPHAN
HALLIE was outpaced early, went three to four wide on the turn under encouragement outside the quarter pole, ran on evenly in the stretch. COPINSAY
was lightly bumped at the start, raced off the pace and off the inside, went evenly and made no bid. FIRST SPRING was urged forward from the start,
pressed the early pace inside, dropped back and faded. LUCYS CHILD fanned six wide into the stretch, failed to menace. TOURIST'S DREAM bumped a
rival lightly at the start, raced at the back near the inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SEA TO AIR took control from the start, opened up considerably under brisk fractions down the backside, had a comfortable lead throughout the turn, was
getting leg weary in mid- stretch but built up enough of a lead to hold safe by a diminishing margin at the wire. BENLION stalked near the rear in the early
going, began to lengthen stride midway point on the turn, swung outside runners reaching for ground turning for home, switched leads a couple of times
closing in through the stretch but could not reel in the frontrunning winner in time. RIVER OF BABYLON tracked the pacesetter on the rail, continued inside
dueling in the chasing pack around the bend and gamely prevailed in the show battle down the lane. BET N WIN tracked on the outside three deep down
the backside, inched closer to the winner three wide outside foes at the quarter pole, was in the mix of things for a share in the four path straightening out for
home and ran on mildly to the wire for a minor placing in the end. MIA AND ME tracked the speed between horses through the turn, came under a ride
trying to keep pace with other rivals on each side at the quarter pole and levelled off in upper stretch. ARAMOS hopped slightly at the start travelling inside
to trail with another foe down the back straight, was urged inside running around the bend, could not close the gap and made little impression in the stretch
run. BARTICA co-trailed on the outside in a strung out field down the backside, made no headway running outside foes through the turn and could not get
involved in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
FABELMAN was forced in at the start. HE SHOOTS HE WINS soon led, moved clear early on the turn about the three-eighths, was overtaken in mid- to
late-stretch while drifting a bit and proved no match but held the place. CORNWALL angled in early racing toward the rear, advanced inside on the turn,
checked in behind a drifting foe nearing the wire, was best of the rest. TECH WIZARD shifted in, saved ground near the rail toward the rear through the turn,
was guided out eight wide in upper- to mid-stretch, showed some good late effort. VALYRIAN SKY broke inwardly bothering a rival, was forwardly-placed
stalking three then four wide, lacked the needed late kick. HARD DIAMOND moved out from three to five wide on the turn racing in the back half of the field,
fanned seven wide into upper stretch, needed more. I'VE DECIDED broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace and outside on the turn four to five deep,
failed to menace. HALCON NEGRO went about three wide through the turn and ran evenly. CONTRIVANCE moved forward inside tracking the leader, was
guided out two deep by the five-sixteenths and a bit wider coming to the top of the stretch and in range, faltered and faded. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY chased
from between runners roughly two to three wide, faded. PERFECT FOREST chased from outside racing close up and four wide, turned up empty.
CLARENCE B got away a bit slowly, was entirely devoid of speed dropping far back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUITE READY tracked on the rail with a half remaining, patiently waited nestled on the fence around the turn, burst up the rail in upper stretch and
determinedly held off the late closing foe at the wire. DOWNY BOY stalked four deep on the outside in the third flight at the half, kept pace four wide through
the turn, swung outside in the seven path driving to the wire and closed strongly through the stretch but could not overtake a stubborn winner at the finish.
ONE MORE BREW settled on the rail in mid-pack, followed the eventual winner throughout the turn, angled outside five wide turning for home, lost his path
at the eighth pole, rallied outside late and surged at the wire to get up for the show placing. PRICELESS WILL tracked the front pair with horses on each
side at the half, watched the contesting trio outside in the second flight two furlongs from the finish, angled out in the six path for the stretch run and willingly
ran to the wire just missing holding onto third money. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE had a slim advantage down the backside, continued up front while pressed
outside on the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole, bravely shrugged off the early challengers in upper stretch, could not find more late and faded
in deep stretch losing some positions. SOUPER RIVER was allowed to settle trailing down the backside, began to pick up runners saving ground through
the turn and ran evenly on the fence passing some down the stretch. LUV TO WIN tracked the front duo three wide outside at the half mile marker, made an
early move around runners three furlongs from the wire, bid for the lead three wide outside rivals at the quarter pole and yielded at the furlong marker.
BOSSY HOLIDAY had one rival beat down the backside, made no impact seeing the field around the oval, swung out widest in the eight path straightening
for home and showed little effort lacking a stretch bid. SOUPER CLASSY contested the pace outside in the beginning, hounded the pacesetter outside
through the turn, bid for the lead between foes at the quarter pole and wilted at the furlong pole. BIG EXECUTIVE stalked in the third flight three wide
between runners at the half, was roused midturn, offered little response and had nothing to give in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NEOPHYTE attended the very early between runners then eased back off the leading pair to stalk, moved four wide turning for home, struck the lead in
upper stretch and forged clear. ALLEN DIGGS settled off the pace, entered the turn about four wide, advanced while moving out a path to make a brief bid
five deep in upper stretch outside the eventual winner, was no match but second best. ROLLING HILLS settled between runners off the pace going about
three wide on the turn, shifted in near the quarter pole, got through inside in the stretch to secure show honors. LAKE SHORE DRIVE was prominent
between runners early but soon dropped back stalking in behind, tracked along the rail, bided time near the quarter pole after saving ground, moved out in
the stretch, came again four to five wide finishing up willingly but too late. RELOAD BULLET was urged at the break, moved forward inside to contest the
early pace, dueled late on the turn floating off the rail a path turning for home, came up empty. CONFUSING was devoid of early speed, showed some late
interest racing just off the inside. SMART COVERAGE attended the early pace from outside, forced the pace dueling two to three wide on the turn, came up
empty. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE broke a bit awkwardly while brushing the outer foe, raced inside that one four wide on the turn and well back of the leaders,
was not a threat. I LIVE BY FAITH was brushed lightly at the break, caught outside at the back going five wide on the turn, was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
MUSKOKA SUMMER hounded the pace outside down the back straight, dueled outside for the lead around the oval, poked her head in front between
horses turning for home and was resilient fighting down the stretch to prevail by a head nod at the finish line. TELLTALE had a good position on the outside
tracking the engaged pair down the backside, edged closer three wide on the turn, moved smartly to bid in the four path for the lead in upper stretch but was
outgamed late losing the head bob at the wire. LILLZ HOPE was unhurried trailing down the backstretch began to uncork her run three wide extending her
stride midway on the turn, swung outside of foes with momentum seven wide driving to the finish and closed well to be a non threatening third crossing the
line. ASHLEE'S RING broke outwards brushing rival on the start, tracked the front two on the rail down the backside, waited for run tucked in on the rail
behind the co-leaders through the turn and ran on gamely down the stretch just missing holding onto third money at the finish. GAV'S DREAM GIRL was
brushed by the inside rival on the start, made an early move four wide around runners at the three furlong pole, loomed in the five path outside foes turning
for home, could not sustain the run and stalled in deep stretch. ITS A BIRDIE stalked near the rear five deep down the back straight, made some
progression while carried five wide around the turn, shifted inwards to the three path driving to the wire and finished up mildly in deep stretch. KRYPTO
GAINS stalked close to the back five deep in the early going, was shuffled back some seeing the field running around the bend and showed some late
interest in the six path straightening out for the drive passing runners to the wire. SILVER SIGN settled on the fence in mid-pack at the half, advanced mildly
on the rail through the turn, was in range for a share of the prize in the two path at the top of the stretch and was one paced on the rail making little impact to
the wire. MOONBRIGHT travelled in midfield three wide between runners down the backside, was scrubbed on midpoint on the turn four wide with runners
on each side offering little run and could not get involved driving down the stretch to the finish line. HOT OMELET had one rival beat down the backside,
made little progress saving ground through the turn, had nowhere to run stuck on the fence behind the tiring early leader in mid stretch and could not get
clear in time to be a factor at the finish. MOUNTAIN SOUND sat alone in the third flight down the backstretch, was hard ridden going in the wrong direction
three wide at the three eighths marker and came back on a bit to pass tired runners in mid-stretch. WAR'S END KISS travelled in midfield two wide between
rivals at the half, offered a brief run improving two wide midway through the turn and weakened behind foes in upper stretch. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE had a
slim lead on the rail down the backside, battled inside with the winner around the turn, could not find more at the top of the lane and backed away through
the field in mid -stretch.
