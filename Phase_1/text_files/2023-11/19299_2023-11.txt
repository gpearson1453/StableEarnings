Footnotes
SHAKE IT BABY saved ground around the turn stalking the pace under patient rating, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, wrested command
near the eighth pole, was put to urging and eagerly drew off. BOOTSY'S MERLOT lacked speed, angled in leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail
around the turn and in upper stretch, moved to the three path in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and rallied between horses. TRUE SUNSHINE
bumped MADE BIRDIE when bearing in at the break, was four deep leaving the backstretch, chased the pace outside horses to mid stretch, weakened and
drifted out late. REMEMBER ME sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, was in the tow path turning for home and gave way the final furlong.
FAINOR'S FILETS bumped WAIT FOR TOMORROW when bearing out at the break, chased the pace between horses and weakened. INDEPENDENT
broke awkwardly, swung to the five path leaving the turn and was not a factor. MADE BIRDIE , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was
outrun and drifted very wide turning for home. WAIT FOR TOMORROW , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while in the three
path around the turn and gave way. BROWN SUGA BABE broke awkwardly and trailed.

Footnotes
HEADS OR TAILS bobbled at the break, recovered and was taken to rate off the pace and to the inside of a rival, commenced a run leaving the five
sixteenths, eased out entering the lane, closed determinedly under left handed asks, forged past ARISTOCRATIC in deep stretch and was edging away at
the wire. ARISTOCRATIC sped clear early, dropped in and set the pace under a light hold maintained a clear advantage under a drive past mid stretch,
continued well but just could not contain the winner's charge. NOTTOWAY broke a step slow, raced off the pace and outside the winner, moved up with that
one past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide into the lane, straightened away and slowly gained. FREE SQUARE stalked the leader under some early
rating, came under pressure three wide into the lane but went evenly through the final furlong. SENATE CHAMBER , urged along early while saving ground,
failed to respond. BLACK CANDY , off the rail, failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
VON HOFF , steered to the inner rail near the six furlongs pole, set the pace along the rail, responded to urging in the drive and prevailed. PASCHAL
MOON stalked the pace outside horses, was four deep on the turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch and rallied. HOLEY MOLEY stalked the pace
three wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally in an even effort. MONEY ROOM , in the two path chasing the winner throughout, weakened late.
CORRECTED PEDIGREE , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and was not a factor. MARYLAND MOON bumped
with LONGWORTH leaving the starting gate, was along the inner rail around the turn and failed to be a factor. THE BIG MOZZ , never a factor, raced in the
two path around the turn. IMSTILLHERE was outrun. LONGWORTH bumped with MARYLAND MOON at the break, four deep leaving the backstretch,
faltered and was eased.

CHARMING WAY , confidently handled shadowing the leader through the backstretch run, moved to apply more pressure leaving the three eighths, had her
rider take a look back to measure competition as she took over heading to the lane, was guided out to about the five path soon after, opened up after being
put to a stout drive then held sway while being flashed the stick through the final seventy yards. I CAN RUN rated close up while racing to the inside of a
pair of rivals, eased out and came under a serious ride pursuing the leaders past the three furlong pole, dropped back down making progress past mid
stretch and finished strong to gain. RUDA sped clear early, set the pace toward the inside, could not shake free from the winner around the final turn, ceded
to that one approaching the stretch, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded late. SURYA , off the pace, was coaxed along leaving the far turn, cut the
corner into the lane but lacked a serious finish. HAINT BLUE settled off the pace, dropped in through the backstretch run, saved ground into the stretch,
eased out nearing the furlong grounds but failed to threaten. CHAMPAGNE TOAST stalked between rivals, was ridden along leaving the far turn, failed to
kick on and weakened. SHE IS WISKY , three deep stalking the pace, faltered leaving the three eighths and was eased through the drive.

FOOL YOURSELF chased the early pace, found room along the inner rail to take the lead entering the turn, steadily drew off and was under brisk urging in
the drive. NINJA ABARRIO stalked the pace outside horses, circled the turn four deep, was well positioned turning for home and flattened out. TWEET
AWAY ROBIN , rank at the break, stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ILLUSION OF
HOPE lacked speed, was four wide entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. VIKING QUEEN , four wide on the turn, failed to rally. LUCKY LORRAINE
broke sluggishly, was along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out leaving the bend and was no factor. CHALK HILL , outrun, raced along the inner rail
on the turn. THEA'S THEME showed speed three deep and gave way leaving the turn. RED WIND was outrun after stumbling at the break.
REDWHITEANDTACOS showed speed, was kept in the two path leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
POST TIME edged up between rivals nearing the half mile marker, eased out a path then made progress four wide between runners into the lane, saw
NINETYPRCENTMADDIE get away a bit leaving the three sixteenths, dug down and closed in under strong handling, drew alongside then was floated out
some leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on doggedly and forged ahead to earn the narrow decision in the final strides. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE , away in
good order, drafted back off the early pace while saving ground, moved up to the inside of runners while coaxed along past the three eighths, eased out
advancing into the lane, forged clear under a drive nearing mid stretch, wandered outward under left handed pressure near the sixteenth pole, dug in when
confronted, battled valiantly inside the winner but just could not deny that rival. PRAETORIAN GUARD lagged far back, came six wide for the drive, shifted
out some past the three sixteenths and continued on willingly to gain the show. VEESON , forwardly placed off the inside, lost ground while four deep
leaving the three furlong pole, was fanned five wide into the lane, stayed on with willing pursuit past mid stretch then flattened out late. BYK moved clear
early then dropped in towards the rail to set a rated pace, dictated the issue past the five sixteenths, came under a strong ride soon into the lane, failed to
resist NINETYPRCNTMADDIE leaving the three sixteenths then weakened through the final furlong. LET IT RIDE angled out near the five eighths and
stalked the pace of BYK, was under pressure three wide between runners into the lane, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths, faltered leaving mid
stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
HOWL stalked the pace outside horses, moved up three deep on the turn, took command in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch, was kept under
pressure and lugged in inside the sixteenth pole. APPLE PICKER circled horses on the turn, eased out to the four path entering the stretch, drifted in inside
the eighth pole, angled out near the sixteenth pole and her rider dropped his whip near the sixteenth pole. WARRIOR'S RANSOM lacked speed, was along
the inner rail into the turn, moved to the two path leaving the bend, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. WORST BEHAVIOUR bumped with UNIFIED
ALLIANCE leaving the starting gate, chased the pace racing along the inner rail, failed to keep up leaving the turn then lacked a rally. LIQUIDATOR bobbled
slightly at the break, showed speed in the two path and weakened in the drive. UNIFIED ALLIANCE bumped with WORST BEHAVIOUR at the start, set a
pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. DOT MARIE was no factor.

Footnotes
KING KUMBALAY broke a step, quickly recovered and moved up off the rail around the first turn, took closer order under rating while about two wide past
the five eighths, was hemmed in then blocked past the five sixteenths, was able to be guided out and found a seam three wide between rivals into the lane,
forged through and went clear a furlong out, kept on under solid handling and proved resolute to the wire. FOREWARNED broke a step slow, lagged far
back through the backstretch run, angled out and advanced seven wide outside runners into the stretch, ranged up to be the closest pursuer of the winner in
mid stretch, kept on willingly and was able to save the place. BE BETTER settled off the contested pace while saving ground, moved up under coaxing into
the far turn, remained under asking while staying in touch past the three eighths, steadied when blocked from the quarter pole to the three sixteenths,
altered out, split rivals leaving mid stretch and finished well to the inside of the top pair. MARKET MAVEN rated in range while off the inside, moved up four
wide outside the winner keeping leaving the three eighths, bid five wide into the lane, failed to keep pace past mid stretch and faded. HAY CHIEF settled off
the pace, angled out around the final turn while gathering steam, made a six wide run into the lane then flattened out. OUTLIER moved up to the inside of
rivals around the first turn and poked a head in front, dueled from the seven eighths to upper stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. AIN'T DA
BEER COLD moved up outside runners to briefly clear, was joined near the seven eighths, sparred outside OUTLIER through the backstretch, fought on
between rivals from the far turn to upper stretch then weakened late. MOVISITOR had speed then was rated off the dueling leaders and tracked three wide,
moved up to make in three across nearing the far turn, dueled around the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, failed to go on soon after and
faltered.
