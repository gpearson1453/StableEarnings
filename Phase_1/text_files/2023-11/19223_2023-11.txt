Footnotes
FLITTER prompt the early leader from the outside, made a strong two wide bid through the far turn to challenge, raced four to three wide in the drive and
edged clear under steady pressure. PUNKIN quick to begin to set an early pace, met bid near the five sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly to the wire.
VISUAL ILLUSION stalked the pace, raced near the rail around the far turn, eased out through the lane and was even late with no closing run. BEST
WORST IDEA raced three deep near the three eighths pole, altered out near the eighth pole and closed in mildly. HERE WE GO AGAIN broke slow, was
hustled along early from the inside, continued its inside bid around the far turn and was even in the drive with no closing run. MILLROSE drifted in, bumped
rival at the start, raced near the back of the pack early on and never menaced. PANTHER COMMAND stalked the pace from the outside of rivals racing
three deep, raced four wide into the upper stretch and faded. APRIL'S GOLD raced mid pack between early on and failed to respond. TWO SPOT settled off
the early going and failed to threaten. NEVERTOOMUCHELVIS was bumped soundly at the start and was outrun.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN GUY lag early on, ridden along near the half mile pole, eased out through the upper lane and finished well to get up under strong pressure.
BILL OF RIGHTS rated along under a hold down the backstretch through the far turn, slipped through along the inside into the lane, drifted a bit in the final
stages and kept on gamely to the wire. MASTER OF NONE stumbled at the break, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole and raced even late with
closing bid on the top pair. LAW OF THE JUNGLE raced mid pack early, swung seven wide into the lane and had not enough in the drive.
SWAY'SINMYDNA was off slowly, raced from the inside around the far turn past the quarter pole, shifted six deep and never threatened. SUCCEED
dropped back early and failed to respond. PRINS FIRE prompt the early pace from the outside, race in tight quarters near the five sixteenths pole and gave
way. STORMING CHROME set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded in the drive. EL DE CHIMI was unhurried early and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GO TO THE KINGDOM settled off the early pace, handled confidently around the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, surged late and
just got up under strong pressure. JACK'S LEGEND stalked the pace, raced four wide between rivals near the quarter pole and rallied gamely to the wire to
just miss. HENDRICKSON was bumped at the start, pulled clear early, continued to have a clear lead near the sixteenths pole and kept on gamely to the
wire. ST. JOHN'S tracked the early pace setters from the inside, eased out through the upper stretch and was even late. CONSULTANT was bumped at the
start, raced off the early going, altered out eighth pole and made a mild late run. IRISH RILL checked into the first turn, raced mid pack early, saved ground
and had not enough in the drive. FURIOUSLY saved ground down the backstretch, race in traffic near the three sixteenths pole while continuing an inside
bid and was even late with no closing run. JOHNG was bumped, squeezed back at the break, raced at the back of the pace after the poor start, was four to
five wide into the upper stretch and had no response. WIRED IN raced three deep early and gave way. FLETCHER tracked the top pair from the outside
and faded.

Footnotes
PIRATE RICK quick to begin to set his own uncontested pace, race two wide into the upper lane and prevailed in a determined run under strong pressure.
STAGE LEFT was off a step slow, raced from the inside past the three eighths pole, eased out near the quarter pole and just missed in a game effort.
CLASSIER drifted in, bumped start, advanced between through the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. DOLLARIZATION raced four wide from the
outside of foes, edged up through the far turn into the lane and flattened out. NO SABE NADA raced three wide between near the three eighths pole, light
steady near the five sixteenths pole and was empty in the drive. THREES OVER DEUCES settled off the early pace, saved ground and never threatened.
HOLLYWOOD JET was off a step slow, hustled from the inside and faded the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
COURT CONTENDER was off a step slow, raced with the second flight early, made a four to three wide move and edged away under steady handling.
ICETECA was a bit fractious in the gate, raced mid pack early on, made a four wide advance and finished willingly to the wire. POP SOCKS was away
alertly, moved clear near the rail half way down the backstretch, continued its inside run around the far turn into the lane and gave way to the top pair
grudgingly. STEP AHEAD raced three deep down the backstretch, edged up near the five sixteenths pole, chased into the upper stretch and weakened. A
THOUSAND IDOLS chased the pace along the inside and gave way. GENERAL J R lag early, shifted in down the backstretch, raced near the inside into
the lane and was outrun. MARVIN'S GRAY was off a step slow and lacked a bid. TELECAST used four wide early and faded. BUKOVEL showed good early
foot while racing off the rail and faltered near the five sixteenths pole. HARNESS CREEK was off a step slow, lost ground to race far back and never
threatened.
