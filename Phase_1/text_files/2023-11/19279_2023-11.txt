CALLING vied for the early lead near the rail and held well in the drive to prove best under steady pressure. NICELY UNIFIED pressed three deep from the
outside of rivals and kept on gamely to the wire. STRUMMIN MARY dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside throughout and moved up late to
improve position. KASENS TRIBE was unhurried early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. EASY ACES was allowed to
settle early on, raced three wide around the far turn into the stretch, angled out near the three sixteenths pole to race from the far outside and had no late
response. SAINT MARY vied for the early lead between rivals and gave way.

ZAICI bobbled at the start, pressed two deep from the outside of Time to Meddle, took over through the far turn and held well to prove best under strong
handling. FABLED RULER dropped back off the early going, moved up along the inside around the far turn, eased out through the stretch to race four deep
and rallied willingly to the wire. CHILI RED was unhurried early, raced five deep into the upper lane and closed in mildly. TIME TO MEDDLE vied for the
early lead from the inside and gave way the final three sixteenths of a mile. SWIFT N TRAFFIC veered out at the start, raced mid pack early, was six deep
near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. CLASSIC RUNNER stalked the top pair two deep and gave way in the drive. I DONT KNOW EITHER
raced four wide around the first turn, shifted in down the backstretch, raced from the inside into the upper lane and never threatened. COME ON COME ON
broke awkwardly, raced near the back of the pack early, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no response.

effort. GALLANT BUCK vied for the early lead near the rail and weakened a bit through the drive. OVER CALENDARED chased the early pace setters two
deep, raced four wide into the upper lane and was even late with no closing run. KEESAWAH dropped back off the early pace, raced from the inside around
the far turn, eased out through the stretch run and raced even late with no late gain. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY lag early on along the inside, angled to the far
outside into the upper stretch and never was a serious threat. CREME DE BALI stalked the pace along the inside and tired. PREFERITO DA BARBI raced
off the pace, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.

Footnotes
PROFESSOR HIGGINS rated along the inside, shifted out four wide through the upper lane and finished well to prevail under strong handling. SOLOMON
VANDY rated along while racing mid pack, raced along the inside around the far turn, eased out near the three sixteenths pole and just missed in a game
effort. GOD OF WINE set a pressured early pace along the inside and gave way late grudgingly. FOE settled off the early going, saved ground throughout
and had not enough in the drive. BENISSIMO prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and weakened in the drive. WHISKEY AND EASY void of
early speed, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no response. MOESAHANDFUL saved ground, raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
BA DEE YAH was unhurried early on, advanced into the far turn, circled the field six wide and finished well to be clear late under strong encouragement.
UNION MIST set a pressured early pace from the inside, dug in and kept on gamely to the wire. THORNY stalked the pace, made a three wide bid near the
five sixteenths pole and was outkicked in the drive. COLONIAL ROSE tracked the early pace along the inside and weakened through the stretch run.
STARINA saved ground and never threatened. FLEET FROST prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
REAL CITY SPEED was off a step slow, raced off the early pace, moved up four wide around the far turn, circled the field seven wide and finished strongly
to edge clear under steady handling. DEER CROSSING stalked the pace, made a four wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, raced five to six wide into the
upper stretch, closed in from the outside but was no match for the winner. HUDSON'S TURN settled off the early pace near the inside, continued its inside
run into the upper stretch, shifted out four wide between rivals and rallied gamely to the wire. COFFEE COUNTY showed good early foot from the inside and
weakened in the drive. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT tracked the pace setters from the inside, took aim from the rail near the three sixteenths pole and had no final
winning bid. PEPPER JACK dropped back early on, raced five wide into the lane and had not enough. RANCH WATER stalked the pace two deep and
weakened through the drive. CHARLIE G was off slowly, raced near the back early after the poor start, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and
never threatened. BRITTS A CLOSER raced two to three wide into the upper lane and was pulled up to be eased.
