Footnotes
INTERMITTENT FAST vied for the lead with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, kicked away nearing the lane, then tired in the final
sixteenth as an outer rival closed in, but lasted safely. READY FOR TROUBLE trailed early on, rallied in the five path and outside of foes around the turn,
gained place in upper stretch before changing to her right lead approaching the furlong grounds, and was belatedly gaining on the clear leader. MILA
JUNES laid off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch then stayed on to edge show in the
final sixteenth. KRICKLE tracked along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer rival while entering the lane in the two path and ran on mildly. ALMOND
FUDGE sparred for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off the rail around the turn, proved no match for that one nearing the lane and
weakened. LITTLE SASS broke outwardly, lacked speed in the four path and was outrun. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT bobbled a bit at the start, chased the top
pair from the three to four path and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
TIZZY INDY vied for the lead inside of a rival while remaining in the four path around the turn, then drew clear from in upper stretch. STING MUSIC stalked
outside of the leading pair while pursuing them from the six path around the turn, then stayed on evenly while drifting inwardly in the final furlong and gained
place from an outer foe at the wire. VERACRUZIN vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner while being kept in the five path by that one around the
turn, but yielded in upper stretch and was caught by an inner bidder for place at the wire. NOBLE GENTLEMAN tracked outside of rivals while hung in the
seven path around the turn and failed to factor. RICHIESDERBYSTRIKE broke slowly and was outrun in the two path. CHAPS KNIGHT as off a step slow
and showed little.

Footnotes
MALIBU SMART stalked three wide, chased around the far turn before being floated four wide by an inner rival approaching the lane, yet sustained a rally in
pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth and edged past. IMPERATOR FURIOSA set the pace along the inside, shook
clear entering the lane in the two path, but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was bested in the late stages. SALSALITA VERDE laid
off of the pace along the inside, pursued in the two to three path around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on to reach show
late. TRIBEST (ARG) broke outwardly and was firmly corrected via a strong left rein, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, tracked behind
traffic before taking aim three wide and between foes turning for home, but only managed to chase into midstretch, then yielded late and was nailed for
show. LADY FREE WILL stalked outside of the pace setter, chased that one around the far turn, tipped in to take aim along the inside in upper stretch but
lacked a bid and faded late. DOMINA pursued from midpack along the inside, chased while tipping just off the rail in midstretch and ran on mildly between
horses. SHA GIRL broke a step slow and was put to tight quarters by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace three to five wide around the first turn,
then in the five to six path around the far turn and failed to factor. MISS ANALYZED made little impact at the rear in the four to two paths. JAYLA tracked
four wide but gave way in the five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
CONVERSING settled off of the pace in the three path, inched closer in the four to five path outside of UTAH BEACH around the far turn, sustained a rally
along with that one after being floated wider nearing midstretch, drove past the leader along with his inner counterpart at the sixteenth pole, sparred
thereafter and edged ahead late. UTAH BEACH pursued from midpack two wide, came under urging tipping to the three to four path around the far turn,
rallied in the six path along with an outer foe in midstretch, bid along with that one at the sixteenth pole, vied in deep stretch but got outfinished. ORBI ONE
set the pace along the inside, resisted an outer challenge turning for home, held sway through midstretch, but was bested by a wider bidding pair at the
sixteenth pole and held show. AS ONE DOES pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, but was kept at bay through midstretch before getting outkicked by
an outer pair in the final furlong and was denied show. CROSSING stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair to take aim in upper stretch, but
failed to change leads while chasing into the final furlong, faded late yet lasted for fifth. FAYETTE SPIRIT settled far back two wide, fanned from the three
path to the five path entering the lane and moved up. PRESIDER broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, moved to the four path in upper
stretch but lacked a rally between horses. PROTON SPIRIT nudged the inner railing early on, then saved ground in midpack and lacked a bid.
WHITEWALKER broke a step slow, tugged forward between rivals approaching the wire for the first time, tracked two to three wide but faded turning for
home. EARL OF DASSEL trailed in the two path and never got involved. PILKINGTON was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPA stalked along the inside, pursued behind the leaders nearing midstretch, brushed an outer for to take aim three wide and between horses at
the furlong grounds, bid approaching the final sixteenth, led from her outer bidding counterpart in the final sixteenth and gamely held. CHARRIERE stalked
the top pair from the three path, took aim on them in upper stretch, but was brushed four wide by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, kept on to bid along
with that entering the final sixteenth but was denied late. MISS ARLINGTON dueled for the lead two wide, led entering the lane, but was bested by a pair of
outer bidders in the final furlong. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT bobbled at the start, recovered to duel for the lead inside of a rival after a furlong, but was
headed by that one nearing the lane and gradually yielded in the final furlong. LOVER GIRL trailed early on, surpassed a faltering foe in the five path around
the turn and failed too threaten the rest. PARODY chased in the four path but faded after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the pace setter entering the turn, bid along with an outer rival entering the
lane, yet kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway. SPARKLE OF HOPE tracked along the inside, wisely tipped out to take aim outside of the leading pair
approaching the five sixteenths pole, ranged up to bid in the four path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch
and chased that one home to prove second best. ROC'S PRINCESS steadied from tight quarters as an outer rival shifted across her path nearing the
chute's exit, trailed in the two path, picked up stride between horses in upper stretch, sustained a rally to split foes in the four path at the sixteenth pole and
gained show from an outer rival in the shadow of the wire. PROMISE OF HOPE tracked three wide, chased into the turn, yielded between horses after being
floated four wide nearing the five sixteenths pole, yet regained stride among foes while tipping to the five path in midstretch, gained show in the final furlong
but was caught by an inner bidder late. MISS FOXANN bumped an outer rival with eleven sixteenths to go, pursued from off of the pace in the three path,
moved between horses entering the lane and chased evenly thereafter. PUNCHY GIRL broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside into the turn,
shifted out turning for home, tipped from the five path to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on outside of rivals, attempted a bid for minor placings in the
final furlong but leveled off. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders entering the lane and
weakened on her left lead. VOW tracked two wide and between horses, cut the corner turning for home and faded. ARDEN'S ASSAULT took contact from
an inner rival nearing the eleven sixteenths pole, chased from midpack four to five wide and faded between horses in upper stretch. MUSIC FESTIVAL
leaned inwardly while off a step slow at the start, lacked speed in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and made little impact.
FRANKEL BABY broke a beat slow and was outrun along the inside.

LEAVE IT TO KITTEN tracked from midpack three wide, gained around the far turn to bid in the four path entering the lane and kicked away in upper stretch
before widening through the final furlong. STROKE OF MIDNIGHT lacked speed four wide around the first turn, crept closer in the three path around the far
turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds and held that position while no threatening the leader.
SHERLOCK'S JEWEL broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, was keen to place while well back soon after, advanced in the three path around the
first turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and ran on willingly while hanging on his left lead. SAFE TRIP HOME tracked two wide, was urged along in
pursuit around the far turn, then chased evenly in the four path and between horses. MADISON LUVS DUKE raced at the rear two wide, improved in the
four path around the far turn before swinging to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. WRITE OFF JERRY prompted three wide, vied two wide
down the backstretch and around the far turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch and gave way. EL AHIJADO made little impact from
the two to three path. TEPEU vied along the inside but was bested by outer foes in upper stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT RISING bobbled slightly upon
leaving the gates, tracked along the inside, chased turning for home and faded. GATLINBURG vied two wide and between horses, backed off to stalk those
rivals entering the backstretch, but chased between foes around the far turn and weakened. CAIRO'S GHOST took contact from an outer rival at the start
and was outrun along the inside. ROJA REDEMPTION lacked speed along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
FOREVER HOME set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin passing the half mile pole, widened her advantage turning for home and was driven
home to seal the deal. LOOKIN ROYAL broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, fanned from the four path to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to
gain place late. OFF THE CHARTS was squeezed back between horses at the start, lacked speed in the two path, split foes in midstretch while staying on
to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival late. ROCK THE NILE prompted two wide, chased her inner counterpart into the
turn, kept on in the four path through midstretch, but yielded place to bidders on both sides with a sixteenth to go. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI pursued two
wide and between horses, shifted out in midstretch and lacked a bid. STORMY EMPIRE chased along the inside and yielded. ICY STARE DOWN was
reluctant to load, came in at the start, steadied while tough to handle behind and among foes leaving the chute, pursued from midpack two wide and
between horses, progressed to vie for place with an outer rival turning for home, but drifted to the three path entering the lane and weakened between
horses at the furlong grounds. LUNAR ICE broke slowly, lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and made little impact.
SACRED BEAUTY tracked three wide, entered the lane in the six path and weakened. GRAN CHEMIN broke outwardly, laid off of the pace four wide but
faded into the turn and was done early.
