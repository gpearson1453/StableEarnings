Footnotes
SMOOTH ATTACK broke alertly, was overtaken from outside midway on the backstretch, regained the lead when allowed on the bend, came off the rail
some entering the lane, drew off and kept STORMYSTORMYNIGHT at bay under steady handling. STORMYSTORMYNIGHT in contention between rivals,
was three then four wide taking the turn, altered inside PLAY THE BLUES upper stretch, moved clear for second and was closing in on the leader late.
HALF THE BATTLE without early speed, was just off the rail on the bend, made a strong move from inside the last furlong and drew off for third the final
sixteenth. BRUCE ATTACK hesitated then stumbled inward at the break and failed to menace. CHERRY ORCHARD raced widest and had no late bid.
PLAY THE BLUES displayed early speed outside SMOOTH ATTACK but began to yield before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE without early speed, though urged along, was just off the inside on the bend, rallied in the lane, squeezed through rivals three
wide upper stretch and got up in time. COOKIN ROSES bobbled at the break, was corrected and sent to a clear lead, just off the rail taking the turn, drifted
out late under left-handed pressure, was outfinished but clearly second best. FOGGY KITTEN hustled along from inside, continued to save ground through
the bend, moved clear for second as she angled out some upper stretch then leveled off the last furlong. MINI DRESS was away slowly, raced widest of all
and showed a willingness to run through the lane. AUNT STELLA chased in midpack from just off the inside, angled out on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and had no late bid. ABBMAR was prominent early, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and flattened. ARCH
FLYER chased from between horses, saved ground through the turn and came up empty for the drive. GHAALEB'S APPEAL chased from inside, sustained
an injury on the bend, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
FANCY HILL rated on the front end from outside, was let out into the bend, stayed in path three as she moved clear then steadily opened up under a drive
in the lane. HARPER BRIANA advanced from outside, stayed in path four on the turn, floated out further into the stretch, was no match for FANCY HILL but
pulled away for the place. ONACOUNTA broke inward bumping MADELYN ATTACK, angled out early, progressed three wide on the bend, lost ground
staying outside HARPER BRIANA into the lane then drew clear for third deep stretch. KONA KONNECT hesitated then broke inward, advanced just off the
inside on the turn, swung out behind HARPER BRIANA entering the stretch, battled for third, yielded in the late going but was clearly best of the others.
RAIN ATTACK chased from between rivals, lost ground widest through the bend then improved position some in the lane without threatening. MADELYN
ATTACK bumped at the start, contested the pace from inside but began to yield leaving the turn. HOT N FRESH retreated from inside on the bend then
drifted out and angled back in through the stretch run. FEATURED POWER was just off the inside taking the turn then altered her path twice to stay clear of
HOT N FRESH in the lane. SILVER EYES was sent to dispute the pace between horses but started fading before finishing four furlongs. COLLIE WRAYS
KITTY showed little.

Footnotes
ANCIENT MAN stalked the early speed from outside, was roused after a half mile, drew clear on the second bend, took the rail in the lane and kept
TEMPLE FOOL at bay under urging. TEMPLE FOOL shared the lead from inside, moved clear on the backstretch, did not stay with ANCIENT MAN on the
second turn, came off the rail some for the drive and drew clear for second as he closed the gap on the lead in the waning yards. ELECTRIC CHARGE
settled early, gradually progressed along the rail, waited for room behind TEMPLE FOOL on the second bend, gained a clear path entering the stretch but
was boxed in behind ANCIENT MAN until nearing the wire. WICKED GUS was fractious behind the gate before the start, hesitated then broke awkwardly
inward when the gate opened, lost ground staying well off the inside but showed a willingness to run late. SECRET HONOR displayed brief speed just
outside TEMPLE FOOL and began to yield in tight quarters between rivals on the second turn. CREPE YARNS stumbled at the break, chased from off the
rail and was never a factor.

Footnotes
VIVA VIOLENCE kept close between horses, found herself boxed in on the bend, got through three wide leaving the quarter pole, fanned out to path five
entering the lane, took the lead with a sixteenth to go and began to draw off. DEAUVILLE MIST pressed the early speed from outside, went for the lead two
wide on the turn, drifted out some into the stretch, began to close in on RANK AND FILE inside the last furlong, lacked the needed late kick but edged for
second in the waning yards. RANK AND FILE reluctant to load, broke on top, was hustled along to set a pressured pace off the rail but inside rivals, was
challenged from outside on the bend, roused with a quarter mile left, came off the rail some into the lane, moved clear upper stretch but began to gradually
wear down inside the final eighth. LITTLE ACCOUNT pressed the pace from outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, began to fan out with
two furlongs to go, lost ground coming widest into the stretch, was closing the gap inside the last furlong and proved easily best of the others. BUMPER
GIRL hesitated the broke awkwardly, steadily progressed from outside, was four wide on the bend then flattened out for the drive. MARIA'S GIFT crowded
at the start, chased from just off the inside, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened then had no significant response. BAILESTON LASSIE was a
contender from inside on the backstretch but faded on the turn. BEING CREATIVE broke outward, soon trailed, saved ground taking the turn, altered out
inside the final eighth for a clear path but had little to offer. LITTLE BELLA raced in contention between horses, faded two wide on the bend, steadily gave
way and was weaving deep stretch.

Footnotes
GOLD SMOKE broke inward, bumping HANDSOFFTHEGOODS, advanced three wide between horses on the bend, angled out widest at the top of the
lane, was all out the last furlong and got up in time. AFTER MY BROTHER contested the pace inside rivals from the beginning, was just off the rail taking
the turn, lost the advantage upper stretch, edged ahead again inside the last eighth but was outfinished in a game effort. IMMORAL vied for the early lead
outside horses, brushed and then bumped CYCLONE ATTACK going to the bend, moved in beside AFTER MY BROTHER soon after, battled that one
through the lane but also did not have enough in the waning yards. LORD DYLAN broke outward, chased in midpack from outside, reached contention five
wide on the turn and found best stride too late deep stretch. MAPACHE G hesitated at the break and was slow getting into stride, began to progress along
the rail on the bend, surged the final furlong but also was too late. BLUE NORTHER soon overcame a hesitant start to race in contention toward the outside,
took over third four wide on the turn, also rallied inside the last eighth, angled out some deep stretch then continued to drift out nearing the wire.
HANDSOFFTHEGOODS bumped at the start, was never far off the inside and failed to menace. HELIOCHROME broke on top, was soon chasing others
from between rivals and gave way four wide on the bend. CYCLONE ATTACK displayed early speed between horses, was caught in tight quarters going to
the turn, appeared to be bumped into the turn, retreated at the point and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
FROSTED ECLAIR shared the early lead from outside, drew off when allowed into the bend, responded to some hand urging upper stretch to lengthen
command, was put to drive the final furlong and maintained full conrol. AWESOME SUNDAY was soon well back, lost considerable ground five to seven
wide through the turn, surged from outside the last eighth and got up in time for second. WILDWOOD POSSE reluctant to load, left the gate slowly, trailed
well off the inside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, had the rail on the bend, fanned out into the lane, altered out some nearing the eighth pole, split
rivals soon after, battled for second inside ORNERY ANGEL in the waning yards but was outfinished for the place. ORNERY ANGEL chased from just off
the inside, swung out five wide for the stretch run, fought for second inside the final furlong but did not have enough left nearing the wire. MAYSTART
progressed just off the inside on the turn, dueled for third between horses upper stretch then leveled off the last eighth. PALAGO chased from between
rivals, retreated four wide on the bend, swung out further into the lane and failed to have a late bid. LIL BIT TIPSEY raced in contention toward the outside
on the backstretch, improved position three then four wide to upper stretch then flattened out. FREE LOVE was hustled along from inside to prompt the
early pace but gave way on the turn. KIANA'S LOVE made a small leap from the gate, contested the pace inside FROSTED ECLAIR, did not stay with that
one after a quarter mile and steadily faded three wide in the stretch.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S HONOR was kept close from outside, circled rivals on the bend, angled in some nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane from path three,
widened command under a drive, was allowed to coast the final sixteenth and proved much the best. PAPA ROCKET without early speed, lost ground five
wide through the turn then pulled away for second inside the last furlong. ROCK N RYE seriously urged in the early going, prompted the pace from just
outside, went for the lead between rivals into the bend, could not stay with MEGAN'S HONOR on the turn, came four wide into the lane and began to wear
down deep stretch. DIAMOND MAXIMUS soon trailed, saved ground through the turn, altered out three wide for a clear path midstretch and passed
between tired ones. SNOOZER well placed from inside on the backstretch, faded just off the rail on the bend, altered in upper stretch, improved position but
could not sustain his bid in the late going. SAND MOUNTAIN was a contender toward the outside for a half mile, came four wide into the lane and flattened.
FASTNFURIOUS displayed early speed but began to yield along the rail before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
WILDCAT BOBBIE hesitated then broke inward, chased from outside, angled in after two furlongs, swung out four wide to advanced on the bend, continued
her bid in the lane, took the lead inside the final sixteenth and began to drew clear. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT pressed LICHITA from just outside, came to
that one upper stretch, her rider lost his riding crop inside the last furlong, fought the latter on even terms but could not hold back WILDCAT BOBBIE in the
late going. GHAALEB'S RANGER soon trailed from off the rail, swung out to path four entering the lane, lost some time angling out widest upper stretch,
surged the final eighth but was too late. LICHITA set a pressured pace just off the inside, was challenged from outside in the stretch and slowly wore down
inside the final furlong. BETHY reluctant to load, steadily angled out looking for a clear path on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out
further entering the lane and flattened. NOT TO BE DENIED was hustled along early to race in contention, gained the rail on the turn and began to retreat.
PRANCIPANTS was a factor from outside on the backstretch but faded widest on the bend. I LUV THIS BAR was prominent from inside for a half mile,
floated out some into the stretch and gave way.
