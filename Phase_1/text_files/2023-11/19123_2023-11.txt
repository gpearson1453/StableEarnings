Footnotes
WMA BIG BABY was forwardly placed inside, then gained command into the first turn to lead the way in the second turn, was threatened by an inner rival
briefly in the early stretch then shook clear and was kept to task till the end proving best. KISSOUUR was well rated while four wide down the backstretch,
then was advancing on the turn to rally in the late stretch and was gaining but did not have enough and was best for the place prize. WMA GRAND FINALE
chased the pace from the inside, then bid on the far turn and got up in the upper stretch to challenge the pace settler then was outkicked in late stretch. RB
TEXAS HOLD EM led the way early while two wide then settled back inside behind the pace setter, was under a hard drive when confronted with rivals on
both sides at the quarter then flattened out in the stretch. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE raced at the back of the pack early then passed a tiring foe entering the
bend and lacked bid in late stretch. VAZS DANCING HESS settled inside then faded after the half and eased across the wire.
