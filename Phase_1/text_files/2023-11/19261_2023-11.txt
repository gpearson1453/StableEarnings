Footnotes
INSIDE STUNT broke in front, set all the pace, responded under left handed urging through mid stretch and won going away. RIKIO never far back, had a
mild late rally in the six path and finished second best. MAYITO unhurried early, finished with good courage in the three path. STRIKE A BEAT trailed early,
swung wide and closed gap late. UPTOWN GUY pressed the pace along the inside through the turn then weakened. STRASBOURG was no factor. HINK'S
PALADIN chased the winner two wide and was through after a half. FRANK N DUCKY close up five wide, faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
IN TROUBLED WATERS never far back, closed willingly along the rail under right handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and drew clear.
ANCHORWOMAN stalked the pace through the turn, rallied to make the lead in upper stretch then was no match for the winner. I'M LEGIT trailed early,
closed rapidly along the rail through the stretch and just missed getting up for second. MAYBE FRANKY settled mid pack and improved position in the five
path. LADY FORTUNE settled inside, angled out on the turn then passed tiring rivals through the stretch in the six path. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS dueled for
the lead two wide down the backstretch, inherited a clear advantage midway on the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.
FACTISIMFLASHY contested the lead inside rivals into the turn then flattened out. MISS ELLIE flashed speed and stopped.

JIM'S RIVER RUNNER prompted the early pace along the inside, dropped back on the turn, came on again under left handed urging and proved best in a
stretch long drive. ORVILLE B vied for the lead three wide and finished second best under right handed urging in a game effort. WAR ON THE RIVER set a
pressured pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. AGNELLO CITY went evenly. LITTLE RONS ROCKET found his best stride late in the four
path. ORLEANS STORM was bumped then steadied at the start, saved ground, improved position into the stretch then leveled off. MUCH TIMES TWO well
placed, failed to respond. PLAYING BALL was no factor. CHECK THE FACTS bore in bumping ORLEANS STORM at the start, veered in shortly thereafter
and was no factor.

Footnotes
IPPOLITO'S WONDER prompted the pace two wide into the turn, took charge, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch at will to win as
much the best. SOMETHING ON TAP stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, made the lead, was passed by the winner before a half and
finished clearly second best. MARQUITOS M never far back, found his best stride late in the four path. WHY KENNY WHY slow early, swung wide and
closed gap late. HARTSTEIN sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn then weakened. NO MAS CERVEZA
failed to menace. MY HOMBRE had good early speed along the inside then faded. RUNAWAY RUSSELL well placed, lacked the needed response. RAISE
YOU ONE was no factor. MY TICKET was outrun. FORMYBOYS was through after a half. R CLIFFHANGER had brief speed.
