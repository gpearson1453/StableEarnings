Footnotes
WALK WITH ME went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under coaxing, was
asked for more outside the quarter-pole, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch, was given final pop of the crop inside the furlong marker then
held under a strong hand-ride to the finish. CALL HER BLUFF was coaxed along just off the pace, angled from the two path to the four path while placed
under stronger encouragement on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead until just before the furlong marker then
swapped to the proper lead, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed. MANGIA brushed with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the outside while
in hand, was let out in the three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled with foes into the final furlong, dropped back into the final
sixteenth and weakened. DOLCE VELOCE was rated just off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path early on the turn, drafted behind horses
around that bend, was roused three wide into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and tired.
TONE OF SILENCE brushed with an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the four path to the
two path while falling well behind on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SHE'S AWESOME established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from a pair coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MIM coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. LA GROTTE bobbled at the
break, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
HARLAN'S BOND chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BIG HAZEL coaxed
from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened. REBEL CONSORT chased along two
path briefly and then the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. DOLCE SERA
chased along the inside briefly and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. PER
RULING EMC2023-225 FROM HIWU, SHE'S AWESOME IS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSTIVE TEST.

Footnotes
OPPORTUNITY SET was hustled from the gate, moved out early then advanced to the lead inside the seven-eighths pole, controlled the action in the two
path on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop
and was given one pop outside the sixteenth-pole then held under a solid hand-ride to the finish. MOTIVO was hustled from the gate, established a good
position just off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch
and willingly earned the place. GOLDEN PURCHASE was hustled from the gate, settled just off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, drifted out
in the vicinity of the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. I LOVE CARA broke in then was bumped in the hindquarters
while off a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and failed to rally. UNION TAP bumped the hindquarters of I LOVE CARA while
off slow then was slow into stride, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. LOUIE'S
HEAT showed in front early, lost the lead inside the seven-eighths then stalked on the outside, dropped back in the four path under strong urging on the turn
and retreated.

Footnotes
FREUDIAN chased three then two wide advancing on the leader at the five-sixteenths, took command nearing the quarter pole and swung four wide into
upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. RUN DEVIL broke outwards under hustling from the start forcing SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN to steady very
briefly when losing her lane, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. VEGAS WEEKEND showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN briefly steadied at the start when RUN DEVIL took over her lane, crossed directly after to chase along the inside coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GRINGOTTS chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, tired. MARIAH'S FORTUNE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. TRIPLE P three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five
wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
CLASSIC DIVA came out in front then stumbled after the break, showed the way with a clear advantage, extended the lead while inside on the turn,
responded well when put to the crop outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under strong urging. GOING FOR GLORY chased the pace,
saved ground on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, was bumped outside the sixteenth-pole and
earned the place. NECESSARYANDPROPER tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three to four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive into the final furlong, bumped with foes on both sides outside the sixteenth-pole and earned the show. NEEDED stumbled just after the start, was
urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole then bumped with a foe, was kept off that opponent under
extra right-rein pressure late and just missed the show. WISE CONVERSATION settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, came
five wide into upper stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. MOTHER MARY was ridden along towards the back, went five to six
wide on the turn, moved in outside the furlong marker and failed to rally. SHE'S A LAKER climbed while off the pace near the five-eighths, went five then
four wide on the turn and failed to respond. CARA'S GIRL dropped to the rear of the field on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail early on
the turn, saved ground into the stretch and faltered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO was away alertly from the outside post, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, took over under a drive
outside the furlong marker and drew clear under strong urging. AMERICAN LAW was urged along off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, went
five wide on the turn and finished willingly for the place. VODKA MARDINI was away quickly then hustled, showed the way with a clear advantage, was
challenged while in the two path on the turn, came under encouragement near the five-sixteenths, was put to the crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage to
the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened. CLUBHOUSE was taken in hand early, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the
turn and lacked the needed response. MASTERWORK was last to commence, raced towards the back under urging, went two then three wide on the turn,
came six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. MAGICAL WAYS was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and came up empty.
MEMPHIS was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. EQUALJUSTICEFORALL bobbled at the start, was urged along
at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor.
