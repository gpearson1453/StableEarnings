Footnotes
ROYAL RUSE was settled and comfortable going for the first two miles, advanced on the third circuit into contention, made a bid nearing the stretch and
then drew off impressively to dominate late to prove best, driving. SHOOTIST was reserved throughout, then finished well for the place award while no
match to the winner, clearly second best. AWESOME ADRIAN was reserved throughout and lacked a rally. MONBEG STREAM (IRE) set the pace and
went clear after the first mile, remained clear on the second circuit, then was challenged nearing the seventeenth fence, fell over that jump and lost the rider,
then was vanned off. RENEGADE RIVER chased the pace and tired, then was pulled up and left the course after the sixteenth fence, then was jogged back
to the paddock and had to be vanned off. Per the Stewards ruling, SHOOTIST was disqualified from second and deemed unplaced following the jockey
failing to weigh out.
