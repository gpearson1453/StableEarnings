Footnotes
GRAZIA pressured GIRL OF MY DREAMS from outside, moved up on even terms around the bend, took over at the quarter pole, put away inner rival in
upper stretch under right handed urging, drew away while racing a bit green and on the wrong lead but still remained clear to the wire. SHE'S A TEMPEST
shifted in toward the extended rail leaving the chute but was quickly corrected, stalked from inside then two wide into the lane, came out and bumped rival at
the eighth pole and kept on to best the rest. AFFAIR tracked between rivals early, rounded the bend two then three wide outside a rivals, got bumped by
SHE'S A TEMPEST at the eighth pole and kept to task to edge GIRL OF MY DREAMS for the show. GIRL OF MY DREAMS stepped to the front and
showed the way early under pressure from GRAZIA, dueled with that rival around the turn, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole, yielded to that rival in
upper stretch, weakened in deep stretch and was edged for the show. AIR FORCE THUNDER broke a step slow, stalked outside a pair of rivals to the turn,
lost ground under a ride and exited the bend four wide, then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
TABLE FOR TEN rated in the two path, bid three deep on the far turn, got floated out a bit into the lane, took over in upper stretch, held a short advantage
into the final sixteenth and won the bob over MO REWARDS at the wire. MO REWARDS tracked the pace from the rail to the far turn, tipped two wide near
the quarter pole, angled out widest, rallied and drew alongside TABLE FOR TEN past the sixteenth pole but was outnodded on the line. RED CROSS
KNIGHT had good early speed and led in the two path around the first turn then moved over to the rail, took pressure in the middle stages, vied with outer
pair with a quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch but stayed on well for a game third. JAMMING EDDY stalked from inside then switched to
the outside of the pacesetter approaching the backstretch, pressed up the backstretch, gained the advantage past the quarter pole, came out a bit at the top
of the lane, lost command in upper stretch and faltered late. ZIMBA WARRIOR settled at the back in the two path, exited the second bend three wide,
moved back in a bit in upper stretch, chased within striking range through the final furlong but needed to find more late.

Footnotes
GREAT FORTY EIGHT stalked two then three wide on the first turn, closed in tandem with FLYNN'S CHANCE on the far turn and challenged three deep at
the quarter pole, took over late on the bend, cleared inner rival in upper stretch and held safely under urging. NAFISA chased four wide around the first turn,
trailed two wide into the second bend, moved inside while advancing then steered back out and came three wide into the stretch, rallied and nailed
FLYNN'S CHANCE for the place honors. FLYNN'S CHANCE settled along the rail off the pace, on the move through the far turn, tipped two wide and
challenged between rivals approaching the quarter pole, gained command briefly before being overtaken by GREAT FORTY EIGHT late on the turn, kept on
through the lane but got edged for second at the wire. PACIFIC ROSE bobbled leaving the gate, traveled two wide outside a rival at the back early, went
between rivals in the middle stages, got put in a bit tight entering the far turn, moved out to the three path and had little left for the drive. GREER MY DEAR
chased three deep into the first turn then got moved out to the four path, continued wide through the second bend and weakened down the lane. ELEGANT
sprinted clear and moved inside then two wide on the first turn, opened up on the backstretch, grew weary on the far turn and was reeled in at the quarter
pole, tired in the lane and eased to the wire and walked off.

inside then began to pull and rushed up between rivals into the clubhouse turn, bumped at the nine-sixteenths pole, applied pressure on the backstretch
then chased into the far turn, continued in the two path to the stretch and weakened down the lane. ROPERS N WRANGLERS cleared quickly and crossed
over to the inside, vied with rivals into the first turn then assumed control once again, showed the way under pressure in the middle stages, cleared leaving
the backstretch, challenged by the winner at the quarter pole, lost command approaching the stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY quickly took control from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, put to right handed urging and remained well clear to the wire. ROSE
DAWSON bobbled and broke outward before being corrected, stalked outside rivals, went five wide into the turn, advanced around the bend, chased four
wide into the lane, could not threaten the winner in the late stages but finished willingly to best the rest. CARMEN MIRANDA hit the gate and broke in a bit
at the start, stalked four wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide, lacked the needed late punch when called upon and got outkicked for second.
GLORIOUS SPRING broke out and bumped SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH, tracked along the inside into the turn, remained along the fence and cut the corner
into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and kept on to improve position. CHISMOSA broke a bit slow and got bumped at the start, chased off the pace
then moved closer up the backstretch, went between rivals but got put in tight at the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the clear on the bend, steered
out in upper stretch and could not rally. BELLA D raced up close early off the inside, chased two wide around the bend and weakened.
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH got sandwiched between rivals at the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, spun three wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CALI BAY (IRE) traveled two wide outside a rival near the back, angled out approaching the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch, surged clear at the
eighth pole and powered away under right handed encouragement and steady handling in deep stretch. TAISHAN raced on the inside towards the rear, ran
into traffic briefly at the quarter pole, split foes leaving the bend, bumped inner rival at the top of the stretch, angled to the inside at the eighth pole and
rallied for second. SOULMATE was off a bit slow and bothered leaving the gate, went up to press the pace from outside, took over at the five-sixteenths
pole and cleared quickly, moved over to the inside, offered no resistance to the winner at the eighth pole and flattened to third. JACKS OUTLAW rated along
the rail early, tipped two wide on the far turn, chased within range entering the final furlong but needed to find more late. SUBSIDIZE broke a step slow,
stalked four then three wide early, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, four deep at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. MY INDY stalked
two wide then between rivals on the clubhouse turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole and faded. BUCK OWENS tucked inside at the back, trailed to
the stretch, altered out from behind trouble rival at the top of the lane and failed to menace. NAUVOO showed keen early foot pulling early, set the pace
under pressure from outer rival, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to fight back and chased the new leader into the lane, took a bump from
outside and steadied at the top of the stretch and faded.
