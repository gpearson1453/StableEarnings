Footnotes
STEEL RACER set the pace inside of a vying rival while a bit off of the fence into the turn, clung to an advantage inside of a trio of rivals entering the lane,
gamely sparred with an outer bidding WHAT'S TO DO in upper stretch, got narrowly headed by that one leaving the furlong grounds, yet fought back to
reclaim an advantage in the final sixteenth and inched ahead. WHAT'S TO DO settled off of the pace, inched closer in hand in the five path around the turn
to loom a danger outside of the leaders entering the lane, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with an inner STEEL RACER, wrestled a narrow advantage
inside the final furlong, but hung and gave in to her inner counterpart in the final sixteenth. MISS TAPPY TONE broke half a beat slow, tracked along the
inside, trailed turning for home, committed to a rail rally entering the lane, but lacked enough room to slip inside of the leader in midstretch, tipped outside of
the top pair with a sixteenth to go and ran on. FAST GAL vied for the lead two wide, then in the three path and between horses around the turn but gave
way at the three sixteenths pole. BYZANTINE stalked three wide, ranged up in the four path nearing the three furlong pole to offer a bid around the turn,
vied between horses entering the lane but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LIKE A SALTSHAKER bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of that one while in the two path into the turn, shook away before meeting
JUNIOR BUG's outer challenge turning for home, dueled with that one entering the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, then clung to an advantage while
driftng out in the final furlong and held. JUNIOR BUG stalked the top pair from the two path, split them to bid outside of the leader and from the three path
turning for home, sparred entering the lane before getting floated to the four path in upper stretch, battled while getting herded further out through the final
furlong and was denied late. SPEND BENJAMINS trailed along the inside, surpassed an inner rival entering the lane, shifted back inwardly to aim inside of
the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, grinded to attempt a bid in the final furlong but needed more. ALL WEST saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail. SAND MOUNTAIN bobbled a bit while bumping with an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead outside of that one into the turn, but yielded in the four
path with three furlongs to go and weakened while drifting wider nearing the lane.

Footnotes
THE PRINCESS SAYS tracked three wide, ranged up to bid along with an inner SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL entering the lane, struck the front in upper
stretch and held sway from her inner persistent counterpart. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL stalked two wide, was roused to inch closer along with an outer rival
turning for home, bid entering the lane but was outkicked in upper stretch, yet fought on well. VALIANT PRAISE bumped with an inner rival before brushing
with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, ran on to gain show at the furlong grounds and held
it from an outer bidder late. LIL TOWN SIS broke a beat slow and bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, improved
entering the lane before tipping to the five path in midstretch, stayed on to bid for show in the late stages but missed. AUNT JO set a clear pace into the
turn, but was headed by an outer pair entering the lane and weakened. ISLANDINTHESTREAM brushed an inner rival shortly after the start, stalked along
the inside, paused behind the leaders at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch but came up empty. ROCKABILLIE steadied out of tight quarters
between horses soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path, but drifted to the seven path entering the lane and was outrun. PROUD PERFORMER
tracked in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and faded.

LET'S BE CLEAR tracked the top pair from the two path into the turn, took aim on them from the five path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, drove clear
at the furlong grounds and held sway. HONEY RUN broke half a beat slow, raced at the rear in the two path, gained between horses entering the lane,
altered three wide while among foes at the furlong grounds and sustained a rally to edge show late. ZING laid off of the pace three wide, gained in the four
to five path around the turn, then ran on willingly to reach show late. MERCY WARREN set the pace along the inside, but was bested by an outer bidder
nearing midstretch and gave way. LOVE OF MY HEART chased from midpack along the inside and failed to menace. PIPELINE GIRL prompted two wide,
bid turning for home, entered the lane in the four path as an outer bidder challenged and weakened in upper stretch. FOUNDER'S DAY was fractious in the
starting gate, then got outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
SHEFFLIN dueled for the lead two wide, sustained the battle as the war persisted into deep stretch and inched ahead approaching the wire. TASTERFOR
THE KING dueled for the lead inside of a vying rival, clung to an advantage from that one through midstretch as the battle continued, but was bested in the
closing stages. BE THERE tracked along the inside, ran on to bid for show inside of rivals at the sixteenth pole, dueled for that position through the late
stages and prevailed. PINFIRE stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, tipped out to aim outside of the embattled leading pair entering the final
furlong, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid, sparred with an inner rival for show through the late stages but missed. CUORE SACRO tracked two wide,
tipped four wide in upper stretch but only offered a mild kick. PAPA ALDEN stalked three wide, chased in upper stretch and faded between horses at the
furlong grounds. WHISKEY AND EASY broke slowly and was outrun in the two path. UNCLE WILLIAM was a bit reluctant to load, broke outwardly while off
slow, lagged well behind in the four path and showed little.

TIMELY PROSPECT vied along the inside, shook free in upper stretch, met an outer challenge in the final furlong and held firm. WASHINGTON'S UNION
stalked in the two to three around the first turn, took aim three wide and between horses entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge to bid in the final
furlong but was denied. JR'S GIFT tracked in the three to four path early on, prompted the top pair under urging while leaving room for an inner rival around
the far turn, got outmoved by that one entering the lane, yet kept on to gain show in midstretch and held that position from an inner bidder late. WESLAN
lacked speed along the inside, improved in the two to four path around the far turn, then stayed on between horses but was denied show by an outer foe
late. DESERT WOLF vied outside of the eventual winner, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. HARLEEZY bobbled a bit while off a step slow at
the start, then steadied when put to crowded quarters by an inner foe entering the first turn, clipped the hind heels of an outer rival in the aftermath, trailed in
the three path, improved around the far turn and failed to menace along the inside through the lane. PHILHARMONIC stuttered a step at the start, tugged
between horses approaching the first turn causing trouble for an outer rival into it, raced off of the pace tucking from the four to two path around that bend,
but gave way in the four path around the far turn. CARNIVORE had his left hind heel clipped by an inner rival entering the first turn, laid off of the pace in the
five to three path around that curve, tucked to the inside approaching the far turn, but weakened around that bend.

KNIGHTSBRIDGE tugged forward two wide and between horses, steadied while hard to handle approaching the half mile pole, tipped to the four path into
the turn, ranged up to bid among foes turning for home, assumed command entering the lane and shifted inwardly while drawing off. GIVE ME A REASON
prompted along the inside, stalked into the turn, but was outmoved by outer rivals while lacking rail racing room turning for home, fanned out to the five path
entering the lane as the leader kicked away, yet ran on to gain place in midstretch and held from an outer bidder late. LOU'S LEGACY tracked in the five
path, ranged up outside of rivals turning for home, but proved no match for an inner foe while floated to the six path entering the lane, yet kept on to rebid for
place in the late stages but was denied. LEFT TACKLE pursued from midpack in the four path, but failed to sustain position despite coming under urging at
the half mile pole, faded outside of rivals into the turn, trailed turning for home, yet regained stride in upper stretch and stayed on in the final furlong.
PROMISSIO raced at the rear in the three path, then failed to menace between horses while hanging on his left lead. SHARP SHOT pressed three wide,
then two wide while in the three path between horses around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the process,
chased through upper stretch but faltered late. POKER RUN set the pace in the two path, got headed while inside of a trio of bidders turning for home and
weakened. MCQUEEN made little impact from the two path.

Footnotes
MAKE THE BOYS WINK tracked three wide, ranged up in the four path turning for home to bid entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch and held
sway. WHENTHEDAWNBREAKS saved ground in midpack, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth.
WINGS LIKE EAGLES raced keenly between horses early on, settled off of the pace along the inside into the first turn, steadied behind a faltering foe
turning for home, shifted out but encountered traffic entering the lane in the five, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, altered out at the furlong
grounds and offered a late kick to gain show at the wire. BE MY SUNSHINE prompted three to two wide, led in the three path around the far turn, but was
bested by an outer bidder in upper stretch and steadily gave way late. SWEET ALYSSA steadied slightly behind foes moving through the lane for the first
turn, settled far back in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the backstretch, inched closer in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out and
chased between horses in the final furlong. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) raced at the rear two wide, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and moved up. WORK OF FICTION tracked along the inside, then just off of the fence around the far turn, chased through midstretch but was
blocked behind traffic through the final sixteenth. HURRY UP HANNAH shied subtly from inner foes early on, rated three wide, altered course four wide at
the five sixteenths pole before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, but gave way. FACCIA BELLA set the pace along the inside, got headed by an
outer presser around the far turn and weakened entering the lane. SPICY ITALIAN brushed an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and
between horses, swung to the six path entering upper stretch and faded. LADY COMMANDER raced at the rear along the inside and was outrun around the
far turn. LEMON BOMB took light contact from an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, stalked down the backstretch, but wilted
among foes turning for home.

Footnotes
GASOLINE tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the new leader and from the five path entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage
at the furlong grounds and kicked away. GIANT GAME stalked outside of the pace setter, bid turning for home, led in the four path entering the lane as an
outer GASOLINE threatened, resisted that foes bid through upper stretch, but was bested passing the furlong grounds and remained clear of show. WAR
CAMPAIGN brushed with an inner rival a pair of times at the start, saved ground off of the pace, crept closer entering the lane before taking aim two wide
and between horses in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the top pair while claiming show inside the final furlong. DECISION MAKER bobbled a bit
at the start, trailed, picked up stride in the two to three path in upper stretch, split foes three wide at the sixteenth pole to bid for show in the late stages, but
was denied. BIG BLUE LINE exchanged light brushes with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to four path, shifted to the three path
approaching the far turn, then fanned to the six path entering the lane and ran on mildly. CONFIDENCE GAME set the pace in the two path, met an outer
challenge while saving ground turning for home, got headed entering the lane and gave way. WARRIOR JOHNY tracked from the four path, chased in the
three path around the far turn, shifted back to the five path entering the lane and faded between horses. TWO BIRDS pursued outside of rivals around the
first turn, weakened into the far turn, got eased around the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TEJANO TWIST trailed in the two path, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied outside of rivals to bid in the final furlong, led entering the final
sixteenth and drove clear. MILES AHEAD chased four wide, was urged along while floated to the six path around the turn, lacked progress in pursuit in
upper stretch, but kicked on along with an outer oncharging foe in the final furlong, attempted a bid at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. BANGO tracked
three wide, tipped to the five path at the three furlong pole to range up outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid in upper stretch while hanging on his
left lead and drifting in subtly, changed over while forging an advantage passing the three sixteenths pole, but was caught by an outer pair entering the final
sixteenth and yielded. NECKER ISLAND laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path and between rivals entering the lane, then chased
among foes. SIR ALFRED JAMES set the pace in the five path early on, tucked to the three path while leading from an outer presser entering the turn,
showed the way entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder passing the three sixteenths pole and gave way. MANNY WAH lacked speed along
the inside, trailed turning for home, shifted out and surpassed tiring rivals. EMPIRE OF GOLD stalked forwardly two wide and between horses, took aim
inside of three leaders in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and weakened. EXXEL tracked along the inside and gave way. AWESOME AARON prompted
outside of the leader and from the six to four path into the turn, then weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
EDGARTOWN stalked the clear leader from the two path, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, led while battling with that one through midstretch
and shook free late. SURF CITY tracked two to three wide, bid along with an inner rival entering the lane, vied through midstretch but was turned away late.
DASHMAN pursued from midpack three to four wide, ranged up along with an inner pair turning for home, took aim entering the lane but only managed to
chase those foes home. POLAR BEAR PLUNGE pursued two wide and between horses, chased in the three path around the far turn, ran on after being
herded outwardly in midstretch and reached a dead-heat for fourth. DROBNY sped clear early on, but was headed inside of a trio of bidders entering the
lane, gave way yet saved fourth via a dead heat. MONEYSHOT tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn, drifted out in midstretch and
weakened. BRITISH SEA bumped with an outer rival at the start and failed to factor from the two path. TIGGEROO broke slowly, lacked speed along the
inside and made little impact. EVENING NEWS bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued along the inside and faded. UNION RUN laid off of the pace
four to two wide and failed to factor. THE LOOK FACTOR showed little.
