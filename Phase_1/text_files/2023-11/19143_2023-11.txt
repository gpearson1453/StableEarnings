Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT three wide in aim of the leader early on, advanced to take over five furlongs out and tucked briefly to the two path before taking to
the inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong
out, dug in coming back again to retake command just inside the sixteenth marker and inched away gamely to the finish. TETSU chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, drifted out two paths straightened away, rallied to take command a furlong out,
dug in head to head and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. HIGHER QUALITY chased just off
the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. COOL QUARTET broke out at
the start bumping LEDDY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to
the finish. GOT THUNDER prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch,
weakened. BUSTIN SHOUT chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. LEDDY got bumped at the start by COOL QUARTET, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and tired. MISTER J T led early on crossing to show the way along the inside, got headed for the front five furlongs out and
chased along the inside coming under brief and light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch backing away, then got eased
home through the final eighth to the finish.

Footnotes
PROGENY stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three to four path on the turn, shook clear at the quarter-pole,
responded well in the stretch and proved best under steady urging. YOU'RE FOREVER showed speed on the inside of a foe, dropped back late on the
backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. LA
PICASITA settled under some urging, dropped from the rail to the two path on the turn, fought with UNION BELLE for the show in the final furlong and
narrowly earned that position while no match for the top two. UNION BELLE was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, battled with
LA PICASITA for the show in the final furlong and just missed that position. TO BE LOVED BY YOU bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then
stumbled and checked, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch
and came up empty. MEL'S ANGEL broke in then was hustled, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, moved from the rail
to the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TAP THE KEG made light contact with a foe at the start then was
hustled, showed speed on the outside, moved from the two path to the rail early on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. MISS PLA was
urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
SIGNATOR four then three wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before going four wide through the far turn
advancing on the front with five-sixteenths to go, swung four then three wide into upper stretch taking over command, edged away under a drive to prevail.
COSTA TERRA along the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking back inside through the far turn getting
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. LITTLE DEMON established the front
and showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from the
front, kept on to preserve the show honors. PORTOS three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch, came under
coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on under a drive to the finish. GUNTOWN stumbled at the
start, chased two to three wide, tipped four wide through the far turn and came under coaxing midway, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. GOOD
SKATE hustled from the gate, raced briefly along the inside before tipping three wide through the first turn, settled three wide in closest aim of the leader,
suddenly retreated near the midway point on the far turn losing contact with the field when swinging four wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased
home to a walk through the final sixteenth crossing the wire nearly distanced, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
R CALLI KIM was off towards the back of the field, settled while racing in the two path on the turns, was roused six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside
into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. RHOMBIQUE was reserved between
horses in the two path until near the second turn, continued off the pace down the backstretch, stalked two then three wide on the final turn, came under a
drive in upper stretch, pursued the leader into the final sixteenth and earned the place. VERGARA showed the way on the outside in the two path, vied
inside on the final turn, dueled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE prompted the pace on the
inside, was eased back off the pace near the half-mile pole then moved out, re-engaged the leader on the outside while in the two path on the far turn,
dueled with that foe into the final furlong and also weakened then just missed the show. EMBRACE ME was reserved while saving ground, went two then
three wide on the final turn, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. UNRULY JULIE stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given
her cue on the final turn, spun five wide into upper stretch and capitulated. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) was rated on the inside, faltered on the final turn and
was eased then vanned off while reported to have bled.

SAVINGS RATE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
sixteenth from home, edged away to the finish to prevail. LOGIN REQUIRED showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive repelling
the challenge of XCELLENT MEN inside the eighth pole before being collared by the top one a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors.
XCELLENT MEN placed his barn mate in tight in the early going inside then chased three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch and issued that challenge through to the eighth pole
before being shaken off, weakened in the late stages. WAR STRIDE four wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, weakened
in the stretch. GOLDEN SOMBRERO showed brief speed five paths off the inside prompting the pace early on, tucked three wide through the turn and
steadily faded and continued three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. PARTY WITH SMARTY chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. FOREIGN INFLUENCE chased inside briefly and was placed in tight by his barn
mate shortly after the start along the rail, altered to chase just off the inside, suffered an injury and fell heavily at the three-eighths marker and was
subsequently euthanized on track. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident midway on the turn before the result was declared official.

BIG EVEREST (GB) was rated just off the pace on the inside while tugging hard at the bit, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong
then made a bid inside of two foes, took the advantage near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. EXACT ESTIMATE went three wide on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, was corrected off heels outside the
eighth-pole, fought on well in the final furlong but missed. MASEN (GB) went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, came out outside the furlong marker then was corrected by the
rider, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to get the show. PIONEERING SPIRIT was hustled from the gate, saved ground on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, moved out while chasing in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the
show. JERRY THE NIPPER settled in the two path, stumbled outside the quarter-pole, was roused into upper stretch and gained late but failed to impact.
JAMES ALOYSIUS was taken in hand early then moved out behind horses, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn
in the three path, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WICKED FINN rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, moved from
the rail to the three path on the final turn and was no factor. ST ANTHONY went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on
the far turn and came up empty.

weakened. OUTTAWATERBURY chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. TEMPESTA CREMISI broke in at the start, chased along the inside and was forced to check off
