Footnotes
CASTAGNO veered in and bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far bend, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to get up for the
win near the wire. KYGO (GER) bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground quickly to the wire
despite being carried out when LEO MONTE drifted out into him to just miss. LEO MONTE saved ground around the first bend, led the way on the inside up
the backstretch, battled from the two path coming around the far bend and dug in in the lane while drifting out near the wire, carrying KYGO with him and
getting caught late. VELOCE raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. MR. SARCASTIC raced off the pace on the outside through the
opening half mile, came around the far bend in the three path and gained ground late in the stretch. BUSTIN UP bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved
ground around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and was outkicked in the
stretch. AZURE SKY saved ground early, raced at the back of the pack on the inside from there, came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring
horses in the lane. SWEEPING GIANT bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first bend, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and faded in the stretch. BENS MALICE
bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming
around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. ALVY bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, was pinched back and checked, raced in the three
path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the three path and
made no bid. PRACTICAL WAY raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
tired from there. HORSE TWO, KYGO , AND HORSE THREE, LEO MONTE, DEAD HEATED FOR SECOND PLACE. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
MADE INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, HORSE THREE, LEO MONTE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE WITH HORSE TWO,
KYGO AND PLACED THIRD, GIVING HORSE TWO, KYGO, THE PLACE POSITION OUTRIGHT.
