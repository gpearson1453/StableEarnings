Footnotes
NIXA raced four wide through the first turn when pressing the leader, cleared when straightening in the lane, widened through late turn and continued to
lengthen the advantage to the wire. EMERSON'S DREAM raced in the three or four path through the far turn, came into the lane three wide, was nearest
the winner through the lane, could not gain on that one but stayed on to save the place spot. MISS DIAMOND RICH chased the pace from the three path
into the turn, was closest the winner in late turn, shuffled back when passed on both sides into the lane, reengaged while shifting into the seven path and
moved up. LEGS FOR DAYS vied for the lead through the first turn while along the inside, continued along the rail into the lane when never far back and
weakened. RAISE N PRAISE pressed the early pace three wide through the first turn, continued to chase the pace into the far turn then dropped back, was
in the seven path into the lane, drifted in to the three path and was no a threat late. SEQUEEKER pressed the pace while two wide early, continued to chase
the winner while in the two path into the turn, dropped back and was eased through the lane and returned bleeding from the nostrils and was vanned off.

Footnotes
COPPERLITE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, continued to move closer to the pacesetter through the turn, took over into the lane from
the two path when leader faltered, cleared outside the eighth pole and was under a drive to hold. FINN MCSORLEY was in the two path through the first
turn when unhurried, continued near the inside into the far turn when shuffled back to trail, was asked for more leaving the bend, angled into the six path
and was rolling late while drifting in a couple of paths and ran out of time. BADGE OF WAR saved ground through the turn, cut the corner and continued a
serious threat, came off the inside to pass a tiring rival near the eighth pole, continued on with good energy to be gaining at the end. YELLOW JACKET was
along the inside through late turn when never far back, came into the lane three wide, had aim on the top ones but needed more late. FINN AND BRENNAN
raced in the four path through the turns when near the back, swung into the lane from the five or six path and offered a mild gain. JAILHOUSE JUSTICE
pressed the pace two wide, lost momentum into the lane and weakened. GOOD POINT never a factor while along the inside. WOODFORD HOLLER set the
pace along the inside while under pressure then faded along the inside through the lane. DOUBLE GOLD never a factor while saving ground. CALL EM
KARL raced in the four path through the turns and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
CABLE BOSS was in mid-pack while in mid-pack, bid into the lane from the three or four path, drifted into the six path then back into the four path when
gaining serious momentum and was up in time from the three path. SATURDAY LONG LEGS set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the
lane, had his largest advantage with an eighth to go, was joined by the winner in deep stretch and gave ground grudgingly. POLYGLOT chased the pace
along the inside into the lane, moved into the two path for the drive and was finishing with the winner and missed between. COACH PETRO raced in the two
path while near the back, came off the inside through mid-turn, continued with momentum into the lane while angling to the six path, continued willingly from
mid-track and was closing in. SMART PRIZE was unhurried while off the rail into the turn, was three wide into the lane, continued in the three path for the
final eighth and was gaining to the wire. LYTE CRUDE saved ground through the turn and into the lane, was still a threat and lost positions late. SIX
MISSIONS raced in the three or four path through the turn and into the lane and lacked the needed response. TEXAS TOAST raced three wide through the
first turn, continued into the three path through the far turn and tired turning into the lane. HILTON HEAD chased the pace from the two or three path into the
far turn. SERPA was outrun while near the inside. OPERATORE PAZZO was getting out through the first turn and into the backstretch, dropped back into
the far turn and was never in it.

Footnotes
CHANDANA chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, stalked the two rival duel through mid-turn, bid three wide in late turn, dueled with another
through the lane then edged clear late. EKATI FLATTER settled off the early pace while off the inside, moved through the three path on the turn, came into
the lane from the four path and was up for the place spot while not a threat. POETIC VERSE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, dueled with the
winner through the lane then yielded to that one approaching the sixteenth pole. HUNGARIAN PRINCESS raced in the three path through the turn and into
the lane and was not a threat while moving up a spot. BELGIAN BLUE never a factor while in the two path through the turn. BELLA BOLLE chased the pace
along the inside into the turn then was done in late turn. GIRLS ARE TUFFER set the pace under pressure into the turn, vied with one then two rivals into
late turn and gave way.
