the turn, challenged passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to get up for the win late. CANT ATTACK ARCH led the field on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn and dueled gamely to the finish to narrowly miss. RING TWICE bumped
with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path, began a
bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. FIREY EMBLEM tracked the pace setter on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the three path and finished evenly. FROSTED DIAMOND raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, saved ground around the bend and passed
tiring horses in the lane. FLAT OUT ROSE bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the
turn in the four path and was outkicked in the stretch. ALLOTROPE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn
in three path and weakened in the lane. LIGHTNING HART stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. ATOMIC ROSE bumped with the horses to both sides at the start and was squeezed back

around the far bend in the two path and weakened in the lane. WHISKEY RED hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the
pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. MY UNCLE BILLY
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the second bend in the two path and improved position mildly in
the stretch while never truly threatening. CAMALEON raced in the five path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack from there, saved ground
around the far turn and showed no kick. VALID EARLY was pinched back leaving the gate, dropped back to trail far behind the field while saving ground
around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and made up some ground in the lane but was never a threat.
CHAMOIS' EMPIRE tracked the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, dropped back while saving ground around the second turn and was
empty in the stretch. VALLEY MISCHIEF raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the pace setter on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
continued around the second turn in the four path and tired quickly in the lane.
