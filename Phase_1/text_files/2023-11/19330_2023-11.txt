Footnotes
CHASIN' WHISKEY was away alertly to set a pressured pace in the two path, then was on the inside on the turn and dug in gamely in the drive, then held
sway late to prove best under a drive. SHELTRFROMTHESTORM after a half a step slow moved up and was between rivals and had to steady by the half
mile marker, then saved ground on the turn, finished well on the inside to gain the place award. CLEVER TIGER tracked the pace along the inside early but
checked leaving the half mile marker and dropped back to trail the field entering the turn, saved ground on the turn, angled out to the far outside leaving the
three sixteenths and closed fast late, gained show award. BRIGHT PATH chased the early pace from between rivals, steadied slightly by the seven
sixteenths, then advanced three to four wide by the quarter pole, finished willingly but needed more late. BIG SMILE broke in and bumped a rival at the
start, then pressed the pace three wide early, made a bid between rivals at the quarter pole but flattened out in the final furlong. WORK FROM HOME was
bumped at the start, then advanced on the outside to track the pace five wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, but faded the final furlong.
PLUOT stalked the early pace four wide, then dropped back three wide on the turn.

LONGTAIL dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid on the turn to take over and shake clear, then widened the margin off the turn and drew out to prove
much the best under a drive. COAST TO COAST was well placed early, made a three wide bid on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner, clearly
second best. GREAT WORKOUT was settled early, dropped to the inside on the turn and had a mild late rally to gain the show award. HE'S A SHOOTER
bobbled at the start, prompted the pace three wide, fell back on the turn and dropped to the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. MANAHAWKIN was
off a step slow, then passed the tiring rivals. BOYS OF QUEENS was reluctant to load, settled early, five wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.
BAVARIA dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. PECOS BILL failed to menace. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY was reserved early, came wide into
the lane and was no threat.

Footnotes
STASSI stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid on the turn, then slowly edged away in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. COULD BE A
COUGAR set the early pace two wide, then dueled with the winner by the quarter pole but could not match strides with that rival late, saved place award.
CHAPA stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but hung in the lane, needed more. ARROGANTE was off a step slow, chased
the pace three wide on the turn but had no late kick in the drive. HIDDEN CACHE was well placed early on the inside and faded. FREYDIS was off a step
slow, came six wide into the lane and had no serious rally. MORGANS COVE chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
COOL COMEDIAN dawdled along on the inside early, drew clear on the turn, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. HANALEI'S
HOUDINI was rated early between rivals, dropped to the inside on the far turn and chased the winner, tipped out leaving the turn and finished willingly,
second best. ONCE A GIANT was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show award
late. CAERUS prompted the pace three wide, then pressed the pace two wide on the backstretch, then chased the winner on the turn and faded, lost show
award late. BUCK WILD was off slowly, reserved on the inside, came into the lane four wide and angled out to the outside and had no serious rally. SANTO
was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside and tired. JACKIE A was well placed early on the inside and tired.

MAKE A SPLASH tracked the early pace and made a two wide bid and took over at the three eights marker, drew clear on the turn and then drew off in the
drive while being kept to left handed crop urging to prove much the best. DIXIE MUSIC chased the early pace on the inside, made a bid two to three wide
nearing the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner, clearly second best. DUSTED was settled early on the inside, then made a mild bid four
wide by the quarter pole and then lacked a late response, bested rest. WILD N' SASSY was allowed to settle early, four wide by the quarter pole and had no
rally. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide, then was three wide on the far turn and tired. MISS MIA LIA had an
outside pursuit early, then dropped back and moved to be three wide on the turn, then dropped to the inside in the lane while being no threat. HERE WE GO
AGAIN set the early pace while clear, then stopped after five furlongs. DANCEWITHTHEBAND checked after the start, then was guided to the outside and
was far back, showed little.
