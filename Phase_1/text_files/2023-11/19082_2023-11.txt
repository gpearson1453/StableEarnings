Footnotes
SPOTONJUSTICE dueled outside of a rival, bid near the three-eighths pole to go clear, then came out under left-handed encouragement near the sixteenth
pole to bump PICKLE FEET hard and cause that one to take one, then lasted under steady urging. PICKLE FEET stalked the pace in the three path, bid at
the eighth pole, was bumped and taken up near the sixteenth pole when SPOTONJUSTICE came out and closed late. CABOOSE raced in the five path and
had no late bid. GOOD FOREVER saved ground to no avail. ONE WAY RAY dueled inside, then faded on the turn. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE stalked the
pace in the three path before giving way at the quarter pole. SPOTONJUSTICE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PICKLEFEET AGAINST SPOTONJUSTICE CONCERNING INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH.

Footnotes
ONLY EMOTIONS set the pace into the first turn, continued on a clear lead while near the inside, widened through the turn and into the lane, was asked for
more after straightening in the lane and drew off. JANEY CREED was unhurried while off the inside, angled into the five path through the turn when gaining
momentum, continued with a good run into the lane while in the six path and stayed on well to be up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner.
LILMORECRAKEN settled off the pace while near the inside, bid into the turn to be a threat, continued near the inside into the lane when moving closest to
the winner then lost the place late. MS QUALITY CONTROL raced in the two path into the far turn when gaining momentum, checked when in tight near the
inside, swung into the lane from the five or six path when gaining energy, shifted into the two path through the drive and was gaining. VINO ROSATO trailed
early while off the inside, bid from the six path through late turn, came into the lane from the seven path and finished evenly. TAAMUQ raced between while
in the two path through the far turn and tired after straightening in the lane. PERFECT MANHATTAN was close up early to chase the winner into the
backstretch, steadily retreated along the inside to trail the field through the far turn, swung into the lane from the five path and passed tired ones. SELES
never a factor while along the inside. HOUSEFLY (IRE) chased the pace from the four path into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane. DON'T
TOUCH chased the pace from the two path into the far turn then was suddenly done in late turn. SENSIBLE CHOICE raced five wide through the first turn,
continued in the five path down the backstretch and into the far turn and had nothing for the drive. HAZIEL chased the winner from the three path into the
lane then retreated.

Footnotes
GET BACK GOLDIE saved ground throughout, cut the corner into the lane when leaders drifted off rail, quickly cleared on the lead and was under a drive to
hold. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE) raced near the rail when near the back, moved up through the turn, followed the winner into the lane while cutting the
corner, could not gain on the top one while winning the duel for the place spot. HEMP HEAVEN was near the rail throughout, came into the lane from the
three path, dueled for the place spot and just missed while slowly gaining on the top one. FOUNDER trailed for half when in the two path, was still well back
into the lane, gained momentum from the five path, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. CIRCLE BACK JACK chased the pace from the
three path into the turn, continued as a serious threat into the lane then weakened late. MUTAKATIF (IRE) raced in the three or four path through the turn
when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the six path, was seven wide in deep stretch and never was a serious threat. ELUSIVE TARGET raced in the
three path through the far turn when near the back, came into the lane from the five path and never was a serious menace. AUTHORITARIAN vied for the
lead through the turn and into the lane, came off the inside into the lane, chased the winner while straightening then faded. NIP N TUCK vied for the lead
two wide through the turn, was floated into the four path into the lane then gave way. RICH KINGDOM chased the pace from the four path down the
backstretch and was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DEAL chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn, moved to challenge the leader into the lane, dueled with that one
through the final eighth and edged up late. C F V TEXAS RED vied for the lead while two wide, cleared down the backstretch and into the turn, was joined
by the winner into the lane, dueled through the lane while along the rail and could not keep up late while clearly second best. MONUMENTALJUSTICE
saved ground early while unhurried, moved off the inside in mid-turn, continued into the three path for the drive and moved up to be best of the rest. DEVILS
GOTTA GO saved ground into the far turn, was asked for more in late turn then lacked a closing response. PAYNTER'S CANVAS vied for the lead early
while along the inside, chased the pacesetter into the turn and faded through the lane. FOXY BOXY raced in the two path through the turn and was empty
through the lane. FOREVER FRIENDS trailed through the far turn then passed a couple tired ones. LOONY raced in the two path through the turn and was
empty into the lane. CUPID'S RUNAWAY was in the three or four path into the far turn and was done soon after.
