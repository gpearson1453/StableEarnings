Footnotes
SMALL SAILOR vied for the lead two wide down the backstretch, shook clear into the turn, widened into the lane then continued to extend the advantage
through the final eighth while under a hand drive. MATLOCK was unhurried while off the inside, moved into the far turn while in the three path, was asked
for more in late turn, got closest to the winner into the lane while drifting to the inside, could not gain on that one but stayed on to save the place spot.
QUALITY DANCER unhurried while in the four path, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the five path and gained on the place rival
while drifting in a couple paths. MOMENT OF INSIGHT trailed early while near the inside, was under a drive when straightened into the backstretch, moved
up the inside until the half-mile pole, was in tight, steadied and altered into the three path, was asked for more through the turn and never was a factor.
FORTUNE raced four wide through the first turn, chased the pace from the three or four path into the far turn then was empty in the drive. MUD PUDDLE
was in the two path throughout and tired. ALPHA LEA vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn then was done nearing the five-sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
GET N TIPSY raced in mid-pack while in the two path, continued near the inside while moving closer through the turn, came into the lane from the four path,
gained momentum once straightened, caught the leader just inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. TAPERINEA raced into the first turn when under a
strong hold while getting out a bit into the turn, moved to set the pace down the backstretch when under intermittent pressure, cleared into the lane, looked
in good shape inside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while saving the place spot. IZZY'S MONSTER was unhurried through the far turn
when in the two path, shifted into the six path while entering the lane and was gaining to the end and missed the place spot. DIVINE EXCHANGE settled off
the pace while off the inside, bid four wide into and through the turn, continued into the lane from the six path and moved up. AMAZING GAL tracked two
path, came into the lane three wide then weakened through the lane. LUCKY SHORE never a factor while along the inside though the turns. FORGLO was
unhurried while off the inside, moved three wide through the turn and never factored. PINK PARTY PANTS raced along the inside when not far back,
continued along the rail into the lane and faded. PRESCIENCE raced in the four path through the far turn when near the back, swung into the lane from the
seven or eight path and made no impact. NATIVE LION was in the four path through the first turn, chased the pace from the three or four path through the
turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
KEEPIN IT CLASSY stalked the pace in the four path, dueled around the turn and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. DOUBLE TUFF stalked the pace
in the four path, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't close late. BOURBON TEDDY led between rivals, bid clear at the three-eighths pole, dueled and gave
way in the stretch. ROGER MCQUEEN threw his head in the gate and was back six lengths and had a bid at the quarter pole. HILLBILLY LOGIC pressed
the pace between foes, then gave way on the turn. HIGHEST PRAISE was not a factor. KITTENS ADAIR pressed the pace inside for a half mile and gave
way. After an inquiry, the Stewards determined that ROGER MCQUEEN received a fair start.

Footnotes
MAJOR WAGER tracked the pacesetters while near the inside, guided to the three or four path into the lane, gained momentum inside the eighth pole and
was up in time. JIMMY DAN was unhurried while off the inside, moved three wide through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four or five
path and was closing in too late. MILITARY FORCE set the pace while near the inside, vied with another down the backstretch, was still under pressure
through the turn, cleared into the lane, had his largest advantage with an eighth to go then was caught near the wire and just lost the place spot as well.
PARKLAND was in the two path through the turn when never far back, straightened in the four path, was steadied near the eighth pole when a rival drifted
over and he lost his path, reengaged and finished with good energy. VINTAGE VINYL saved ground into the lane, had an open rail for the drive and needed
more. MAJOR SPARKS raced in the two path into and through the far turn, angled into the five path for the drive and was gaining belatedly. J'S NAUGHTY
BOY was near the inside into the far turn, raced in the two or three path in late turn, straightened in the six path and showed interest too late. TOPF ROAD
RULES chased the pace into the backstretch, vied for the lead into the turn, continued to chase the pace into the lane then faded. STORM'S REFLECTION
saved ground into the lane and lacked a response.

Footnotes
MR NEGATIVITY set the pace while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane on a clear lead, continued clear through the final eighth while slowly
drifting into the five path. INFINITY'S WARRIOR chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path and could
not gain on the top one while finishing in the six path. BUCKLE UP was in the four or five path into the turn, raced three wide in late turn, came into the lane
from the five path and finished evenly while in the seven path late. PAIGE PERFECT trailed early while near the inside, came off the inside in late turn, was
in the five path into the lane and moved up while not a threat. DIGGER DALE chased the pace from the four path into and through the turn and tired. REVS
MEDAL never a factor while in the three path through the turn. MOTION TO ADJOURN raced along the inside and steadily lost ground. REITERATION was
fractious at the gate and had to be removed and reloaded, broke on top then quickly retreated to near the back and was outrun. TANEYCOMO tracked the
pace along the inside through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

strides in the drive. ONE BIG DUDE pressed the pace in the three path before fading in the drive. HOBNOBIN GENERAL stalked the pace in the three path
and then faded in the stretch. GRAND IN BAY raced in the two path, then improved position late while three wide. MANSFIELD TIGER was unrushed in the
three path and improved position late inside. RICH KINGDOM stalked the pace inside, then gave way on the far turn. STOP HAMMERTIME was off
awkwardly, was hustled inside and gave way after a half mile.
