Footnotes
TROUBLE N PARADISE sent for the lead, assumed a clear advantage on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, spurted away in upper stretch and
held well. CARELESS STAR chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, proved no match for rival in upper stretch, and
stayed on to be a clear second. FLASHY PASS tracked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, entered lane in the three path
and quickly drifted in, had a brief battle with inside rival and kept on to be third. MO CONNELLY settled off the pace two wide on the backstretch, continued
off the rail on the turn, entered lane three wide and responded well to urging to finish willingly. AFTER SUNDOWN stalked pace two wide on the
backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, entered lane along the rail and weakened while being in tight. FLAG SALUTE stayed near rail throughout and
failed to threaten when asked in the lane. SECRET OF WAR away cleanly, showed brief speed chasing the clear leader, began to lose ground on the turn
and tired in the lane. PLEASE NOTE, DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE WAS HAND TIMED

prove best. EPIC DRAMA tracked two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, floated out by rival into the lane, took aim in the four path
and repelled by game rival. MILEYS BLUECAT stalked paced two to three wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, swung widest into the
lane and kept to task to be a clear third. LOUD FUSAICHI track pace along the rail on the backstretch, stayed along the rail through the turn and into the

Footnotes
MACHO SAM vied for lead under a light urging, kept on leaders flank on the turn, dueled in the stretch and proved best late. POLLO D'ORO away best,
went to rail and led along the inside heading into the turn, continued to lead entering the lane, dueled with rival in the lane and grudgingly bested late. NOT
GONNA LAST shifted in and solidly bumped rival early, stalked pace three deep on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in the
four path, and kept on gamely. OMAHA RUTSCH settled along the inside on the backstretch, continued near the rail on the turn, launched bid two wide in
the lane and kept to task to the wire. MONGOLIAN MASTER away cleanly, bumped hard by shifting in rival early, dropped to rear of the field, made
progress on the turn advancing two wide, eased out to get around rival entering the lane and kept on in a good try. SMUGGLER'S COVE stalked pace in
between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and lacked needed response in the lane. WEGOTBEERONICE broke out while coming
away last, stalked pace four deep on the backstretch, continued the wide journey on the turn, fanned five wide in the lane and weakened mid stretch.
STORMY JOE stalked pace along the inside of three rivals, continued to hold the rail on the turn, launched a brief bid at the top of the lane, but quickly
flattened mid stretch. MISSING MAURICE settled off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, fanned very wide into the
lane and quickly flattened out. FRIENDLY SHUFFLE broke in, dropped back and stayed on the rail throughout, and lacked any response in the lane.
