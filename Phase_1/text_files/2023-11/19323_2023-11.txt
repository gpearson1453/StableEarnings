Footnotes
BENDER was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and made a bid off the turn, lugged in by the furlong
marker, then was corrected and then lugged in again by the sixteenth marker and prevailed late to prove best, driving. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM was
allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the far turn to vie for command off the turn, then had a long drive with the winner but was out-kicked to
just miss. TIBURON was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then ran on to the
wire but could not go with the top two, bested rest. TEXTHELEGEND was settled early on the outside, four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane
while improving but had no late kick. TONE FEELIN pulled up the inside to tracked the pace, then was boxed and lacked room on the turn, swung out three
wide leaving the turn but had no rally. HA HA FOR YOU prompted the pace two wide and weakened. INDY MOON set the pace on the inside and was
headed on the turn and gave way. JR'S CONFIDENCE was three wide into the first turn, tracked the pace early in between rivals two wide, then tired.

MINE THAT STAR prompted PRESIDENTIAL throughout to his outside, made a bid nearing the quarter pole to go on even terms for command, then dueled
to the the furlong marker and then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. PRESIDENTIAL set a pressured pace to the inside and was headed by
the quarter pole then dug in gamely but could not go with the winner late, second best. BYE BYE BOBBY was rated along the inside easrly, eased out and
ranged up four wide by the quarter pole to loom boldly, but flattened out in the drive. PALUXY was settled early and three wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

CANDY AISLE angled in leaving the nine sixteenths to chase the pace on the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside, waited nearing the quarter pole,
then cut the corner to make rail bid to be clear by the sixteenth marker and then held on late to prove best, driving. TX WOMEN FOR ARTS was allowed to
settle early on the inside, angled out by the three sixteenths and closed well on the outside but was too late, missed. GREASE MISSLE prompted the pace
on the outside, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, but hung in the lane, bested rest. CURLIN'S MAGIC was reserved early, three wide on the turn,
shifted out in the lane and offered a late rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. ONLY ONE AMERICA set a pressured pace on the inside, two wide into
the lane and weakened the final furlong. CROWN THIRTY pressed the pace two wide and weakened. ACES OVER DEUCES chased the pace three wide
and weakened. X RAY VISION was always outrun and showed little.

AMERICAN RASCAL shifted out leaving the five eighths marker and stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide move in hand to latch on to PAY
RAISE nearing the quarter pole, then drew off in the final furlong under a vigorous hand ride while flagging a couple times with the crop, sharp. PAY RAISE
set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled with the winner at the quarter pole to the furlong marker, then proved to be no match for that rival while
staying on to save the place award. LITE RANCHIN KID pressed the pace two wide and then fell off the pace on the turn, then faded, but ran on for the
show award. CATS BY FIVE was settled early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally on the outside to gain the last spot in
the superfecta. AMERICAN WARRIOR tracked the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. GENERAL CROOK was reserved early, saved ground on
the turn and had no rally. U CAN DO U broke awkwardly and off slow, then rushed up four wide and tired the final quarter of a mile.STEWARDS INQUIRY
concerning the start, after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew off in the drive to prove much
the best under crop urging, sharp. PRAYER OF JABEZ stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, but proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. COMPETITIVE IDEA chased the pace on the inside, eased out and came three wide into the lane lacked the needed bid
while besting the rest. TRUTH SEEKER was outrun early, swung wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta.
ALBIZU was settled early, two to three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. MINISTER OF SOUL was settled three wide, came five wide into the lane and
had no rally. DIAMOND RIM was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TOO MUCH ACTION was reserved on the inside and
failed to menace. TACTICAL ATTACK set the pace on the inside and faltered. TULANE TRYST was settled back early, came seven wide into the lane and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
FLYING CONNECTION was well rated in hand on the inside, made a inside bid and inherited the lead when the front runner blew the turn, then drew off to
prove much the best, driving. LOVE TANK didn't have good early speed but made up ground on the turn then had a strong rally down the stretch, was
second best. MAGIC BUBBLES was bumped at the start,chased pace three wide, made a four wide bid at the quarter pole and flattened out. TRIPLE L'S
CUTTER settled inside but lacked rally late into the race. HALOSNHEAVEN dueled from the gate to the middle of the second turn and weakened
throughout the remainder of the race. BANGS stalked three wide and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. FREEBRITNEY was reserved early, four wide
on the turn and was not a threat. PEPPER MILL dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear on the turn but bolted nearing the upper stretch
and then was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
TWO RIVERS OVER tracked the early pace three wide, then moved up to duel for command two wide by the five eighths marker, made a bid on the far turn
to gain a short lead by the five sixteenths, then was clear off the turn and then kicked away to prove best under a drive, new track record. HEROIC MOVE
was allowed to settle early two wide, eased out on the turn, came five wide off the turn and finished well but could not get to the winner, second best. RED
ROUTE ONE was settled back early to trail throughout towards the inside, swung out six wide leaving the turn and had a good late rally, bested rest.
WILDATLANTICSTORM was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, shifted off the rail and made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out.
BATTLE STRIKE pulled four wide on the first turn, then was three wide on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn but faded in the final furlong. SLIP
MAHONEY was rated along two wide and failed to respond. NO WHITE FLAGS broke outwardly at the start, then moved up and crossed over to set the
pace on the inside, then dueled for command to the far turn and gave way.
