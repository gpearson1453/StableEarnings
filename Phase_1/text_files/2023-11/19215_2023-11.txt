Footnotes
ADELIE (IRE) brushed leaving the gate, traveled two wide near the back, swung out leaving the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, rallied from
outside, dueled with HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) late and bested the runner-up. HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) tracked the pace from inside, steered out to the three
path on the far turn, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole, gained the advantage midstretch, dueled with ADELIE (IRE) in the final sixteenth and got
outkicked. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT bumped with inner rival at the start, cleared and angled across to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, put to left
handed urging and was tested in upper stretch, lost command approaching the sixteenth pole, yielded to the top pair and stayed on to secure the show.
VIEWERS DISCRETION got bumped on both sides at the start, raced three wide into the clubhouse turn then angled to the rail around the bend, made
progress up the inside but had to pause when boxed in on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, came back in some and kept trying late but was
unable to get by PRINCESS MIDNIGHT for third. INVENTING ANNA broke well then took a stalking position next to the fence, patiently ridden through the
far turn, roused into the lane and weakened. MONIQUE brushed at the start, rated while keen early in the two path outside a rival, coaxed along on the far
turn, chased between into the drive, bothered by outer rival midstretch but was already starting to weaken. STORMING GRAY got bumped on both sides
leaving the gate, tracked in the three path to the far turn, dropped back on the second bend, trailed two wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
NOTHING LIKE YOU chased along the rail into the turn, came under a ride on the turn, entered the lane two wide, drifted out past the eighth pole, surged
late and got up at the wire. TAMBO closest in pursuit of ROYAL SLIPPER up the backstretch, challenged from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, took over
in upper stretch, put away inner rival midstretch, drifted out late meeting the bid from NOTHING LIKE YOU and got nailed on the line. ROYAL SLIPPER
away quickly from the gate to clear the field, controlled the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from TAMBO at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into the
lane, lost command in upper stretch, faltered in the furlong grounds and churned on for a clear third. DON'T BRING CRAZY chased three wide into the turn,
inched closer around the bend, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. HALONE hit the gate and came away a bit slow, trailed well off the rail
early on, rounded the bend four then five wide and was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
NEON LIGHTS (IRE) sprinted to the front and moved across to the inside, pressured leaving the backstretch, cleared again on the turn and held well under
a drive. VEGAS BURNER forwardly placed from inside, saved ground through the turn, remained on the fence through the lane and got up for second.
PETCOFF came in and caused a chain reaction between rivals early, went up to press the pace at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep the pressure
on through the turn, chased two wide into the drive, finished willingly but got edged for second at the wire. JOHNNY DRAMA bumped in the beginning, got
bumped around between rivals and crowded shortly after, chased two then three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. CLASSICAL bumped hard with MOBE
TOWN early, chased between then two wide on the turn and weakened. MOBE TOWN got bumped on both sides and checked early, saved ground through
the turn, lacked room and put the brakes on again at the top of the lane and lacked a rally. ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR broke in and bumped rival, got forced into
inner rival and checked early, raced in range three wide through the bend and weakened down the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED PETCOFF FROM THIRD TO LAST FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SEVERAL RIVALS EARLY IN
THE RACE.

Footnotes
ASIAN MATRIARCH vied between rivals around the first turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, headed the leader again on the far turn, took over past
the quarter pole, led three wide into the stretch, dueled with SHE'S MY NIECE in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. SHE'S MY NIECE vied three deep
into the first turn then ceded command to inner rivals, stalked up the backstretch, continued three wide into the second bend, bid three deep with a quarter
mile remaining, dueled outside ASIAN MATRIARCH in the furlong grounds and lacked the needed late punch to go by. BOSSY BRUIN GAL vied along the
rail with outer rivals before inching ahead on the first turn, set the pace with ASIAN MATRIARCH in the middle stages, headed again on the second bend,
relinquished the lead past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. HIGH FLYING GRACIE chased two wide then moved inside on the clubhouse
turn, lost ground around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. SUPER ENTICING trailed on the inside into the first turn and dropped back, continued
to lose ground on the backstretch, eased into the far turn, pulled up midway around the bend and walked off.

Footnotes
MARKS HIP stepped to the front and moved to the rail, controlled the pace to the quarter pole, given his cue at the top of the lane, put to the left hand
shortly after and held safely to the wire. FOR A LAUGH (IRE) tracked two wide then moved inside, angled out past the quarter pole, altered out around
troubled pair in upper stretch and finished well to gain second. TOM AND JAZZY pulled early along the inside then settled into a stride stalking the leader,
coaxed along through the second bend and tipped two wide at the quarter pole, shifted out for room in upper stretch but bumped LOW EXPECTATIONS in
the process and finished evenly in the late stages. SYNTACTIC unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside at the back, saved ground through the far turn,
steered out in upper stretch, passed a pair of rivals but failed to threaten. KID AZTECA chased in the three path on the clubhouse turn, continued three wide
into the second bend, moved down to the two path before angling four wide into the drive and lacked the needed response. LOW EXPECTATIONS stalked
in the two path outside a rival, got moved out to the three path at the quarter pole, knocked off strides briefly by inner rival in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOOK SMART sprinted to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, asked right handed with a furlong left to run,
then widened under steady handling to win going away. DOUBLE JAB closest in pursuit two wide into the turn, gave chase along the rail into the stretch,
moved out in the lane, could not make any headway on the winner in the drive but stayed on to best the rest. CRIBBAGE BOARD broke a step slow, chased
from off the pace two wide then moved inside, ran into traffic past the quarter pole, lacked room again in upper stretch, moved out past the eight pole then
steered towards the rail and summoned a mild rally for the show honors. RACHEL'S COACH chased on the inside into the turn, exited the bend a bit off the
rail, moved out in the lane and could not rally. BARELY FUNTIONAL broke a step slow from outside, dropped back and angled in, saved ground through the
turn, angled out and kept on to improve position. GEEZER tracked out of range early, rounded the bend two wide and failed to respond when asked.
MEESH traveled outside a rival off the pace into the turn, spun three wide into the drive and failed to menace. GYPSY TEARS settled inside, cornered
nicely into the stretch and failed to make an impact. GOLD COUNCIL traveled near the back early, rounded the bend two then three wide and came up
empty.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON dueled outside PRINCIPE CARLO for command, shook free past the quarter pole, roused in upper stretch, tapped with the left hand
midstretch and stayed clear under steady handling. BIG CITY LIGHTS stumbled leaving the gate, bumped inner rival shortly after and lost his path when
THE CHOSEN VRON crossed in front, chased wide up the backstretch, ridden along six then five wide on the turn, finished determinedly down the lane but
had to settle for second best. MOOSE MITCHELL raced up close outside the top pair early, rounded the bend five then four wide and weakened in the
furlong grounds. NONE ABOVE THE LAW bumped with BIG CITY LIGHTS early, stalked off the inside, went three wide into the turn, steered to the rail
around the bend, then faded in the drive. PRINCIPE CARLO dueled inside THE CHOSEN VRON to the turn, kept the pressure on to the quarter pole, could
not kick on leaving the bend and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE LUTE chased between rivals then ran up on the heels of MAVEN and had to check at the seven-sixteenths pole, checked again entering the
turn, raced along the inside then tipped out into the lane, ran into traffic at the eighth pole, steered to a clear path, surged late and edged MAVEN for the
victory. MAVEN vied three deep then ceded command and chased outside a rival, rounded the bend two then three wide, rallied to the front with fifty yards
remaining but run down by the winner in the final moments. HOT BOX vied for command inside rivals up the backstretch, dueled with outer rival past the
five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead in upper stretch, put away CODE CHARLIE with a sixteenth remaining but offered no resistance to the top pair late and
saved the show. KIMMER dropped back and angled to the inside, tipped out into the drive but got put in tight between rivals in upper stretch, moved inward
and put in a late rally but missed the show. PERFECTIONISTIC broke out and bumped, chased three deep then two wide into the turn, bothered by MAVEN
coming out slightly midway around the bend, spun four wide into the lane and needed to find more in the late stages. LANSDOWNE (GB) bumped by
PERFECTIONISTIC in the beginning, chased four then three deep up the backstretch, exited the bend five wide, moved out in the lane and failed to
threaten. TOM BOMBADIL raced in range along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch and lacked a response when called upon. STORMY SAMURAI
vied between rivals early, fought between to the five-sixteenths pole then failed to kick on with the top pair, chased two wide into the drive and flattened out.
CODE CHARLIE vied four then three deep early, continued to battle three wide then dueled outside HOT BOX past the five-sixteenths pole, fought into the
furlong grounds then gave way late.
