Footnotes
SWEET MISS stalked the pace from the two path, bid between foes, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and just lasted. PARTY SHAKER tracked the pace
four wide, steadily gained outside, reached even terms late and lost the bob. LAST GLORY settled off the pace while racing in the two path, angled to the
rail in upper stretch, swung out leaving the sixteenth pole and was quickly gaining between foes late. SKY DIVINE set a pressured pace in the two path,
continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. ALEXANDRA'S SONG chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane,
rallied between but was outkicked. OYA THUNDER hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path and rallied belatedly. PERFECTLY MPERFECT failed to
menace while racing four wide. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS played no factor while racing five wide. CROWN JAK was outrun inside. CONDORA pressed the
pace in the three path and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
HARLAN'S LEGACY bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the five path, ranged up and tipped into the three path under rousing going
into the far turn, bid passing the quarter, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, took the lead while still on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and
held sway. A RING THING set the pace in the two path, lost the lead and was coaxed from the rail early into the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning
into the lane, and ran on for place. DAISY BEE stalked in the two path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path in upper
stretch, and finished evenly for show. ONE TRACK MINE rated between foes in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but made no
impact. GOLDEN HAVEN laid in midpack along the inside, shifted out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but flattened. KATZ THAT GAL
bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path early and did not threaten from the far outside in the stretch. DISCO QUEEN chased in the
four path, was under a hard drive going into the far turn, swung out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but was tired. LOVE UNLIMITED tracked in
the three path but retreated around the far turn. DOWNTON TABBY prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead while in the two path going into the
far turn, was under right handed urging along the inside turning into the lane, but gaveway passing the eighth pole.

WIDERIGHT set a rated pace inside and held firm under a drive. IMMENSE FAITH came in soon after the start and bumped TIZADUKE into ROYAL FOX
HILLS, raced off the pace five wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, continued to gain four wide around the far turn and rallied
for the place. CURLIN'S KITTEN raced off the pace four and five wide, angled in in upper stretch and rallied between foes to gain the show. ROYAL FOX

Footnotes
CHI CHI tracked in the two path, was under coaxing while waiting patiently for an opening midway around the turn, split rivals while shifting out to the four
path at the top of the lane, took the lead just after the eighth pole, and drew clear. HEPBURN rated in the six path, ranged up in the five path around the
turn, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. MISS SAYELY stalked in the five path, bid in the four path passing the three-eighths
pole, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. AVELLINO set the pace in the two path, was challenged by an outer duo
passing the three-eighths pole, dug in while still in the two path turning into the lane, but faded in the final furlong. EPONA'S HOPE bumped with an inner
foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid between foes going into the turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, but flattened while
drifting out on her left lead. FLORINDIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed from the rail into the turn, moved up as spot along the inside around
the turn, but did not threaten. GENUINE PERIL raced off the pace in the three path but never menaced.

wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, set the pace in the three path around the turn, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, could
not keep pace with that foe but held well to be clearly second best. SECRET LOVER raced off the pace five wide, bumped with REEF RUNNER in upper
stretch and was along for the show. IRIS'S DREAM raced off the pace four wide and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. REEF RUNNER chased the pace
four wide, bumped in upper stretch and faded. FORT CHARLES was bumped at the start, steadied entering the turn, swung five wide near the
five-sixteenths marker and never threatened. IMPROPTUDE failed to menace while racing three wide. KING FALIERO was bumped at the start, had some
speed inside, steadied entering the turn and retreated around the turn. CATALINA WINEMIXER vied inside and was through after a half.

MISTER MOORE stalked in the four path, bid passing the three-eighths, took the lead passing the quarter, and held safe from the four path in the stretch
under a drive. MAKE 'EM TAP rated in the two path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
ran on for place. NOWITZKI tracked in the five path, was ridden into the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show.
RACKET set the pace in the three path, was roused early into the far turn, but lost the lead nearing the quarter, and faded. ARTICO raced wellback in the
two path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, but made no impact. TRAVEL GUIDE settled in midpack
out in the six path, was driven from said position around the far turn, but flattened entering the lane. DIAL HIM UP trailed in the two path and did not threaten
from the six path down the lane. ADORIAN laid off the pace inside but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
SQUINTS rated in the two path, cut the corner under a ride turning into the stretch, rallied on his left lead up the rail to take the lead passing the eighth pole,
and drew clear. SOUND OF THE BEAST bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the turn, bid in
the four path in upper stretch, and kept on for place. BIG EFFECT laid up close in the two path, bid from the rail going into the turn, led from the two path
going into the stretch, but finished evenly to show. SAINT NO MORE set the pace in the three path, was roused between foes in the two path entering the
turn, lost the lead while in the three path passing the quarter, fought on between foes, but faded late. PRIVATE THOUGHTS trailed along the rail, floated out
to the five path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. LACE UP prompted the pace in the six path but gaveway turning into the lane. GENERAL
LEDGER bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace in the five path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
KHOZEIRESS chased in the four path, was roused in the three path midway around the turn, took aim from the six path at the top of the lane, rallied to lead
just after the eighth pole, and held sway. WEST COAST COWBOY travelled up close in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, swung out
to the seven path going into the stretch, and kept on for place. DREAMING OF KONA brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was cued
midway around the turn, cut the corner turning into the lane, and ran on inside of foes for show. SWIRVIN set the pace in the two path, was ridden along the
inside into the turn, dug in from the two path in upper stretch, but faded in the final sixteenth. LEGACY ISLE stalked inside, was roused in the two path
midway around the turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and finished evenly on his left lead. LOCO ABARRIO tracked in the five path, bid in
the three path midway around the turn, but flattened in the four path down the lane. LIGHTNING TONES trailed in the five path, fanned out to the nine path
turning into the stretch, but made no impact. MIDNIGHT PRANKS raced wellback in the four path and did not threaten in the six path down the lane.
BOUNCER brushed with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path but gaveway entering the stretch.

Footnotes
CALMING SEA settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide midway around the far turn, took over
near the five-sixteenths marker and drove clear. ESKIMO STREET raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the
left lead in the lane, bid in upper stretch but was turned back by the winner. BRITISH EMPRESS led early, settled into stalking position midway around the
first turn, re-bid two wide between rivals around the far turn, briefly led but could not keep pace with the winner in the lane. BELLESHAZZA saved ground in
range, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. CARBONEL failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
SUBTLE SENORITA played no factor while racing two wide. GIRVACEOUS advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared late on the bend,
set the pace inside and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. SHILOH was outrun inside. STARSHIP DYNASTY was off slow, raced three and four
wide and never threatened. GLADIATORA was fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly and trailed inside.
