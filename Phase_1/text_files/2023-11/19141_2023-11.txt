Footnotes
GRACEFUL FIGHTER was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backside, began to uncork his rally at the quarter pole, swung outside widest in the
six path full of run, took control outside at the furlong marker and was drawing away comfortably crossing the line. POINT TO THE STARS chased the pace
in the two path around the turn, battled inside for the lead straightening out for home, was no match for the closing in winner at the eighth pole but continued
to run to the wire besting the rest for second place. GENDRAGON stalked four deep near the rear at the half, started to pick up the pace five wide two
furlongs out and finished with intent through the stretch to win the battle for third money. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY was away alertly to prompt the pace outside
down the backstretch, was shuffled back positions three furlongs from the finish line running in mid-pack around the turn and re-surged down the lane to get
a minor role in the end. ROOKIE RADAR settled between runners in midfield at the half, lost position plus ground running through the turn and finished with
interest weaving through horses putting in a good run in the late stages of the race. SMALL TALK chased the pace three wide on the outside around the
bend, bid three wide in upper stretch for the lead, could not switch leads down the lane and tired in the final eighth. JUST START ME UP travelled on the rail
in mid-pack, was nudged midway on the turn keeping pace with the leaders, had a chance for a share when in the mix three wide behind the front group at
the top of the lane but faltered in the final furlong. BOXER BRIEF stalked close to the back on the rail in the beginning, crept closer improving on the rail
throughout the turn and had little to give inside for the run to the wire. SUPER HEADLINE settled near the rear having only the eventual winner beat down
the backside, made a brief run three wide at the three furlong marker but failed to menace in the stretch drive. HARDWARE GAP took command down the
backstretch, was collared outside by rivals at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and retreated on the fence in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROMANCE tucked in behind the leaders stalking, moved rapidly four wide on the turn taking the lead just past the five-sixteenths, was clear by
upper stretch drifting in a bit, held sway while being kept to the task despite drifting out late. WICKED MERCURY settled outside off the pace tucking in
three wide heading into the turn, moved out five wide advancing rapidly late on that bend with aim on the leader at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit and
made no headway but was clearly second best. LOIS LEN attended the pace from outside, moved clear early on the turn, was overtaken late on that bend,
proved no match for the top pair but kept on well enough to hold show honors. MAKE NO MISTAKE was encouraged along by the midpoint of the turn
moving out from three to five wide by the end of that bend, ran on but missed show. CEFALO bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward inside
tracking, saved ground early on the turn, moved out four wide for the drive, showed good late effort between foes but needed more. WINYAH BAY settled
outside at the rear four to five wide into and on the turn, fanned seven wide into upper stretch and ran on. EMERALD LAKE bumped with the inside rival at
the start, pursued up close in behind two to three wide, ran evenly. TEMPEREYA was outpaced early racing inside, swung five wide, passed tired rivals.
KATCHY NAME was forwardly-placed stalking three to four deep, weakened. LADY IN RED was coaxed forward, vied briefly inside, dropped back tired.

Footnotes
PLEASURE'S GOLD travelled in midfield with rivals on each side around the turn, angled outside starting to gain momentum in the four path at the top of
the lane and was full of run late to get up for the well timed stretch rally. A GAME kept a close eye on the frontrunner down the backstretch, crept closer
hounding the pace throughout the turn, bid for the lead in the two path turning for home, briefly took control at the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the
closing winner in deep stretch. GAMBLE'S SILVER was brushed outside on the start, co-trailed outside in the early stages of the race, swung out to the four
path for the drive to the line and found her best stride late to close in to be a non threatening third at the finish. YA MAR broke in at the start, took this field
down the back straight, continued setting the pace while hounded outside through the turn, was still clinging to the lead on the fence at the furlong marker,
did not switch leads and faded late holding for a minor placing. TRADING BAY was pushed in on the break, co-trailed on the inside down the backside, was
checked mildly behind tracking rivals nearing the half and willingly finished up down the lane to just miss for a minor share in the end. OL' BLONDIE
travelled on the fence in the middle of the pack down the backside, kept pace saving ground running around the bend, was in range hugging the rail turning
foe home, lost its path at the furlong marker and could not rally in deep stretch. SACRED DANCER broke inwards at the start, settled in mid-pack three wide
on the outside down the backside and throughout the turn, shifted out widest in the five path for the drive but could not get involved running to the wire.

Footnotes
SILKEN DOLLAR set the early pace from outside with a narrow advantage, moved clear late up the backstretch racing off the rail, held safe while being kept
to the task. TALK TO YA LATER stalked from up close three wide on the turn, ridden along outside the quarter pole, moved out about four wide into upper
stretch, was no match for the winner but secured the place. SOCIETY'S KAT exchanged a light bump at the start, rated off the early pace in hand, went four
wide on the turn, kept on for show honors. SARAH'S DANCER exchanged a light bump at the start, settled off the pace nearer the inside but off the rail,
moved out five wide in upper stretch, ran on. ANAM CARA tracked from inside, came out three to four wide in the stretch, ran on. ASHBURY bobbled just
slightly at the start, raced up close two wide early, failed to rally. DIOSA CATRINA raced at the rear inside, failed to threaten. GRACE ON THE GREEN was
outside foes three to four wide on the turn and never near enough to threaten. HOT CARGO stalked mid-pack three wide into the turn, came out a bit for the
stretch run and was forced out a bit further, failed to rally.

Footnotes
WHY EM SEA AY tracked the top three between runners down the backside, started to rally angling into the rail at the half taking closer order to foes,
patiently waited inside throughout the turn, pounced on the fence in mid-stretch and comfortably prevailed at the wire. KIN'S CONCERTO stalked near the
rear, was under a ride midturn going around rivals smartly and closed with every stride with a strong stretch kick to the wire but could not get there in time.
LUNCH WITH BERNIE was steadied sharply on the rail at the half, regrouped to begin to lengthen her stride improving around the turn and closed strongly
down the lane in a solid performance considering the circumstances. RED SAMURAI pressed the pace on the inside down the backstretch, chased the
pacesetter outside around the turn, bid for the lead in the three path straightening out for the drive and ran on willingly to the finish to settle on the fringes.
ECSTASY had one horse beaten down the back straight, began to commence a run run picking up horses on the fence with five sixteenths to go, swung
outside in the six path with good momentum turning for home and found his best stride late, finishing with intent passing many rivals down the lane.
HOLIDAY IN JAIL tracked the pacesetter three wide down the backstretch, was hard ridden trying to keep pace throughout the turn, shifted inwards to rail at
the top of the lane and was one paced to the wire. YOU BE THE JUDGE travelled all alone in midfield down the back straight, offered a mild run on the
fence in midturn, was steadied on the rail nearing the three sixteenths pole and could not regroup to offer a finish. LODGE HILL took command from the
onset, continued setting the fractions unchallenged around the bend, was collared on each side in mid-stretch and shortened stride stopping in the final
sixteenth. PRINCESS MAYFAIR had an awkward start, stalked near the rear down the backstretch, could not get interested three wide through the turn and
was not a factor in the stretch drive. CITRINA had a good spot early tracking the front trio outside four deep, could not quicken with others running around
the turn and emptied out at the top of the stretch. MITOLE POWER broke inwards brushing the gate at the start, trailed down the backstretch and could not
get involved throughout the race. STEWRADS INQUIRY DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH AT THE HALF MILE MARKER RESULTED IN #5 WHY EM SEA AY
BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED 3RD FOR INTERFERENCE ON #1 LUNCH WITH BERNIE

Footnotes
MILLIE GIRL settled at the back shifting in but outside foes three to four wide through the first turn, began to advance willingly entering the far turn four wide,
moved out six wide later on that bend picking up speed, floated eight wide into upper stretch with aim, struck the lead in mid-stretch, drew clear. SOLO
ALBUM bumped the inside rival at the start, settled off the pace three wide, moved with the leader and inside that one on the far turn fanning six wide into
upper stretch, altered in several paths in mid-stretch, rallied between foes for the place while no match for the winner. ANGELOU was bumped at the start,
stalked from mid-pack outside three to four wide, advanced four then five deep on the far turn, reached contention for the stretch run but was outkicked.
INDY CHAMPAGNE tracked from inside, switched out on the far turn, edged nearer late on that bend but was forced to wait in behind from the
five-sixteenths to the top of the stretch when swung out four deep and finding room between foes to make a mild bid, needed more late. READY LADY
settled mid-division inside on or just off the rail, advanced inside foes past the quarter pole reaching contention by the top of the stretch after cutting the
corner, evened out. TALBEYAH (IRE) settled off the leaders inside on or just off the rail, took closer order on the far turn in behind off the fence seeking
room late on the far turn, moved out four wide for the drive, split horses in mid-stretch but lacked room at the sixteenth pole as a rival came in. IL
MALOCCHIO tracked from inside off the loose leader, edged nearer having come off the fence and reached contention coming past the quarter pole, floated
four wide into the stretch, evened out. INVENTING set the pace, moved well clear early up the backstretch, began to weaken on the far turn, came off the
rail leaving that bend and lacked the needed late kick. EPHRATA (GB) was bumped sideways into a foe at the start, settled between runners two to three
deep into the first turn, moved out for the far turn, fanned nine wide into the stretch, was unable to menace. LADY BREW tucked in unhurriedly bringing up
the rear, shifted seven wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. STATE OF MIND was up close heading to the first turn between foes, eased back off those
to stalk two to three wide, retreated. EVER SMART was up close two to three wide early and outside a foe, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
MY SUNNY VALENTINE had a good position tucked in on the rail watching the leaders, patiently waited for her que through the turn inside, shifted to the
three path for clear run at the top of the stretch and surged to the lead at the eighth pole and was kept to the task holding safe at the finish. JAB was
unhurried co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, advanced smartly in hand saving all the ground running around the bend, rallied up the fence
turning for home and ran on well to the wire to wire the battle for place. SPIDER BELLE co-trailed on the outside down the backside, rallied four wide going
around horses at the quarter marker, swung out with good run seven wide at the top of the lane and was full of run to the wire just losing the duel for place
at the finish line. WEEHAWKEN settled in midfield between foes in the two path, was coaxed three furlongs out keeping pace while lacking running room
and showed good late energy to get up in the final jump at the wire for a minor role. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) stalked with rivals on either side in the three
path along the backside, rallied four wide circling runners in midturn, loomed in the five path turning for home and could only finish up mildly in the late
stages of the race. GIZMO'S B F F travelled three wide in mid-pack between runners down the back straight, was shuffled through the turn, could see the
field at the top of the stretch and finished up passing tired runners to the wire. HATMAKER HOLIDAY had a slim lead inside down the backstretch,
maintained a narrow margin up front through the turn, was asking for the wire just holding onto the lead at the eighth pole and was engulfed by runners on
each side in the final sixteenth. COLLECT DATTT prompted the pace three wide outside, was nudged three wide taking closer order around the bend, had a
chance for a piece of the prize in the five path straightening out for the drive but could not find more and faded in the final furlong. SECRETARYOFTHENILE
stalked outside four deep down the backside, made little headway going four wide outside runners on the turn and had nothing to show in the stretch drive.
HAI BOBBI pressed the pace between foes in the two path early on, was hard ridden with horses on either side but go not go on with others running around
the turn and yielded in upper stretch.

LOYALTY stalked from between runners racing about three wide into the turn, fanned seven wide, took aim and drove clear. LOVE TO SHOP stalked from
outside, went five wide on the turn sweeping to the lead at the three-sixteenths, was outkicked but held second. DOLCE SOPRESA was bumped then
bobbled at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear, saved ground inside on the turn taking closer order coming to the top of the stretch, rallied inside foes
before being guided out and finishing up between runners but was too late for place. OUR FLASH DRIVE settled inside mid-pack, waited briefly about the
five-sixteenths, found room inside at the top of the stretch, made a mild bid, was outkicked. AWESOME TREAT settled off the pace, advanced while forced
five to six wide on the turn, kept on but needed more. TIME FOR AN ANGEL bumped the inside rival at the start, settled nearer the inside off the pace,
moved out from three to four wide on the turn beginning to gain some, angled seven wide at the top of the stretch and ran on. ARTIE'S PRINCESS settled
off the pace, fanned eight wide into the stretch, kicked on mildly but needed more. READY TO VENTURE (GB) stalked two wide, edged closer in behind
coming to the end of the turn, was within range moving out three wide turning for home but evened out thereafter. MISS DRACARYS was forwardly-placed
stalking three wide between runners, dropped back early on the turn, moved out to pass a tiring rival near the quarter pole, was guided back inside in
mid-stretch seeking room, ran on. SPUN GLASS switched out off the inside racing toward the rear, fanned ten wide into the stretch, was not a threat.
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE broke just a half-step slowly, was coaxed to the lead, set the pace racing off the rail with outside pressured, weakened when
headed and tired in the lane. MIDNIGHT STROLL raced toward the rear, shifted eight to nine wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten.
COLLECTING FLATTER stalked four wide, dropped back on the turn, eased through the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
I'M INTO MISCHIEF was in a good spot nestled on the rail in the beginning behind the pacesetter, rated kindly waiting for her que on the rail around the
bend, pounced on the fence at the furlong marker for the lead and drew away in deep stretch. MICHELE M. settled in midfield outside horses three wide
down the backside, kept pace between foes throughout the turn, found her best stride late in the final furlong and surged at the wire to get the nod for place.
BOTTA SWING stumbled after the start, recovered to lead down the backside, continued comfortably around the bend, could not hold off the winner inside
at the furlong marker and faded late losing place at the wire. SOUPER SUNDAY stalked inside close to the back of the pack in the beginning, began to inch
closer around the bend travelling on the fence, shifted outside four wide for the drive to the finish and willingly ran to the wire to get up to settle on the
fringes in the end. HAPPY VALENTINE travelled in mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, started her run closing in three wide midway on the
turn, posed a threat in the three path at the top of the lane but levelled off in the final sixteenth. TOO MUCH VINO trailed the field in the early stages, swung
outside in the seven path turning for home and ran on the the wire passing some tiring rivals down the lane. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH stalked near the
back on the outside down the back straight, made little progress outside horses running four wide on the turn and lacked a bid through the stretch drive.
YOGA prompted the pace outside early on, was urged between runners chasing the frontrunner on the turn, could not go on turning for home and faltered in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE TEDDY was bumped by inside foe on the start, travelled on the outside in mid-pack down the backside, was nudged circling around horses four
wide three furlongs from home, pounced to the lead in the four path straightening out for the drive and drew off comfortably in deep stretch. ROYAL
RIBBON settled in the third flight all alone with three furlongs from the finish, edged closer on the fence through the turn, angled outside with run in the five
path in mid-stretch and closed belatedly to get for second at the wire. MAGICAL TRICK broke out bumping rival on the start, stalked near the back in the
beginning, rallied four wide with three eighths remaining, was in the hunt behind the winner in the four path turning for home, continued to fight on down the
stretch and gave way late losing the duel for place. SWEET CHARLIZE kept a close eye on the contesting duo down the backside, waited behind the front
twosome around the bend, found a clear path to run at the furlong pole and rallied late to get up for a minor role at the finish line. MOMUNNYFOR RO
tracked the front pair three wide between foes at the three furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner to her outside at the quarter pole, chased
in vain down the stretch and weakened in the last sixteenth. PRIMA veered out on the break, stalked four wide near the back in the beginning, offered a mild
run two wide midway on the turn, was in the mix with a chance for share just behind the winner at the top of the stretch but stalled in the final furlong.
FEDOROVA had a good spot early on watching the contesting duo down the backside, was roused for more three eighths from the wire, could not
accelerate with rivals on the turn and ran on evenly to the wire. SPEED INTHE FOREST stumbled on the break, recovered quickly to lead by a slim margin
outside down the backside, battled outside up top through the turn, was collared outside by many runners at the quarter pole and backed away on the fence
at the furlong marker. DAISYCREST travelled on the rail in midfield, was urged inside three eighths from the wire, offered little response, swung outside in
the seven path turning for home but could not get involved down the stretch. SPEED LOADER was void of early speed having one beat along the backside,
could not get interested around the bend and failed to menace down the stretch. KIKITSA hustled for the lead pressing the issue inside down the back
straight, dueled inside through the turn up front, was swallowed up by rivals outside at the quarter pole and emptied out in upper stretch. ROHESE hopped
up bumping inside rival at the start, trailed down the backside, still could see the field around the turn and never was a factor.
