Footnotes
CECIL THE GREAT pressured the pace and took the nod two deep midway on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and cleared HARLEY
SIOUX in later yards. The latter ducked in leaving the gate and made contact with Gambling Fever, set a pressured pace through the backstretch but was
met at the rail midway on the turn, relented in mid-stretch and just lasted for second. MY BALBOA gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three
path on the turn, ran evenly in the lane and just missed second. DIMELO PAPI was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, raced evenly in the stretch
but pulled up lame on the clubhouse turn and was consequently euthanized. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn
about the four path and showed little in the lane. GAMBLING FEVER was bumped soundly at the break then angled out to give chase, but to no avail. This
race was hand timed.

the final yards. PRACTICALLY THERE raced well back about the three path the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, picked up the chase past
the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, raced in the four path on the far turn, angled in leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BONNIE

the lane. ONEPRETTYTHING set the early pace inside, was met approaching the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase into the backstretch, but faded past
the five sixteenths pole. MARKETABILITY raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and showed little in the lane. CICI UNIFIED rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. SOCIAL

Footnotes
ZAP MAN rated off the pace inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of
the lane, took the lead in later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. REMASTERED took over and moved to the inside to show the way, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in leaving the turn but was met in later yards and flattened toward the wire.
HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE raced well back in the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved from that
point, rounded the far turn about the four path and dueled through the final sixteenth for third. AGAIN WE MEET saved ground well off the pace the first turn,
picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and was outfinished for third the final sixteenth. FLOOR IT raced
in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in later yards. NET
WORTH came away awkwardly, bore out on the first turn and was no factor racing wide. SMOKIN SMITTY stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the three path on the far turn. RUSH TO CANDY saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. RUN FOR KARL came away awkwardly and rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but
faded in the five path on the far turn. CAPT COMPLICATED showed little response.
