Footnotes
GRAND PICK raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path
coming around the far turn and kicked clear. CHELONIAN saved ground around the first bend, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and could not go with the winner in the final furlong but kept on to the wire. MR JACK pressed the pace on the outside
through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and chased the winner home in the stretch. THE COLORA KID raced in the two path
early, tracked the front runner on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and was outkicked from
there. HUSBAND MATERIAL stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate, chased the field around the oval and walked off afterwards. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

GUILLAUME raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bold move from the four path coming around the far
turn and dueled to the wire to just get the win. STACKS OF SILVER raced in the four path early, settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
began to move up while racing in the three path around the second turn and dueled gamely to the wire to just miss. CONSPIRACY FACT chased the leader
on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend still in the two path and kept on in the lane while proving to be no match for the
top two. MAKABIM raced in the two path around the first bend, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still
in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. ZIPPER ZAPPER raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, raced in the four path around the far turn and faded from there. HIGHWAY BOUND saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANDY tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and dueled gamely to the wire to get the
win. COLONEL BOWMAN pressed the pace between horses through the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and dueled gamely the length of
the stretch to narrowly miss. ROMINSKI led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the turn and gave way entering the
stretch. OCTOPUS trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane while never threatening.
HEADS OR TAILS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick.
BABY BOOMER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and was empty in the lane.
