Footnotes
SIZE DOES MATTER settled inside behind the pace always traveling well, bided time inside through the turn, slipped through a narrow opening along the
rail near the three-sixteenths pole, responded to strong handling and sprinted clear in the final yards. READY TO STORM was pushed hard to get forward
position but was outrun to the turn, made a three-wide rally through the turn, caught the dueling pacesetters passing the furlong marker but was outfinished
by the winner. DRIVE BY was first away from the gate then had SINGING N DANZING pressing the issue to the outside, allowed that one a short advantage
through the turn then came back on turning into the stretch, battled to a short lead passing the eighth pole and kept on with good courage, shifted out a path
near the stretch and got out-nodded for the place. SINGING N DANZING was hustled from the gate to contest the early pace took a short lead to the
half-mile pole then traded punches with DRIVE BY through the turn, came into the stretch racing on the wrong lead then had trouble keeping a straight
course and weakened in the final furlong. ROCKET RIBBON broke alertly, raced close to the pace but four wide, rallied through the turn while still four wide,
came into the stretch with a chance but flattened out. COME OUT FIGHTING broke in slightly after the break, was close up to the half-mile marker then had
to be ridden to keep up through the turn, raced greenly, had trouble changing leads and could not improve. J. B. BOOKS was slow into stride and outrun
from the break, jumped a shadow near the three-eighths pole and was never a factor.

Footnotes
UNION WAVE was away in good order and assumed command away from the start, was well handled while setting decent fractions, extended the lead into
the far turn, kept to task while holding a safe lead to mid-stretch, dug in while on the left lead into the final sixteenth and held in a drive to prevail at the
finish. CHIEF WILD EAGLE tracked outside of rivals to begin, was well placed while three wide along the backstretch run, was given his cue into the far turn
and gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, shifted to the two path into upper stretch and chased UNION WAVE to the furlong pole, could not make
headway on the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. CANELITO settled along the inside in the early going, saved all of the
ground while well positioned through the backstretch run, chased from the inside along the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, closed in the late stages
but could not reel in the top pair and held safely in the end for third. WORTH LOOKING was unhurried in the early stages, tracked the decent pace from a
two wide path into the backstretch run, slipped to the rail entering the far turn, offered a mild rally in the stretch but was unable to the threaten.
WELLSWORT (IRE) was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the early pace from a two wide path and attended to the decent pace through the
backstretch run, lost position two wide along the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace into the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
BLUE WILDCAT was prominent leaving the start and moderately pressed the quick early pace, advanced two wide into the turn and disputed the fast pace
to the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew
away in the late stages. HOT RAGEOUS tracked the fast pace from the inside, improved position along the turn and chased from the inside to the quarter
marker, angled three wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, was not able to impact the winner in the final sixteenth but stayed on to
earn the nod for second at the wire. LA VIKINA bobbled leaving the break but was away in good order, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked two
wide into the turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final furlong and just missed for second at the wire, while
holding clearly for third. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER showed good early speed and assumed command leaving the break, set a fast pace while moderately
prompted by BLUE WILDCAT, was pressed along the turn by that rival and carved out quick fractions heading to the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper
stretch, fought back to the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages. NAN ELIZABETH was allowed to settle, tracked outside of runners into the turn,
was roused four wide into the stretch and finished evenly.

Footnotes
MADE THE TEAM tracked from the outside in the early going, rated off of the fast pace and was steered to the two path heading to the turn, was roused at
the quarter marker and angled five wide into upper stretch, responded to urging and gained ground at the furlong marker, rallied in deep stretch, caught
AMANOFMYSTATURE in the final strides and pushed past the runner-up to determinedly prevail at the finish. AMANOFMYSTATURE showed speed
leaving the start and set a fast pressured early pace, shook free into the turn and carved out quick fractions heading to the quarter marker, extended the
lead into the stretch and drew to a clear advantage inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from
MADE THE TEAM, was tagged in the final strides for the win and was clear of the rest for second. AYRTON SENNA raced close up to the early pace, took
back and tracked between runners approaching the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide path into the turn and chased along the bend, angled four wide
into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth and
just held for third at the finish. THE SANDY SURPRISE came in tight soon after the start, was squeezed back and spotted the field in the early stages, raced
well behind the others into the turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and mounted a six wide rally approaching the
furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch and just missed for third at the wire. OBVIOUS was prominent away from the start and pressed the fast early
pace, pressured AMANOFMYSTATURE two wide into the turn and prompted the quick pace to the quarter pole, raced three wide into the stretch, chased to
the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. GALOPIN GOURMET checked slightly in the opening stages, chased the fast early pace from the
inside, improved position along the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into deep
stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. BIG DON'S SMILING chased the fast early pace from the outside, lost position along the turn three wide, swung
to the five path into upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was forwardly placed leaving the break, tracked the fast early pace between runners and steadied while in tight quarters
approaching the turn, chased to the quarter marker then waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, tipped four wide in upper stretch and gained
ground at the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, wore down STORMIN GALILEO in deep stretch and prevailed in a drive at the
finish. STORMIN GALILEO was hustled leaving the break and contested the early pace, gained command and dictated terms into the turn, carved out fast
fractions along the bend and drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter marker, raced in hand into upper stretch and maintained that clear lead to the
furlong marker, came under pressure and was asked for more nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off of the oncoming winner in deep stretch and
was outfinished, while holding safely for second. SATANTA settled off of the fast early pace, was unhurried into the turn and saved ground to the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong grounds, needed more in deep stretch but churned on in the final sixteenth
and was clear in the end for third. FAR WEST was allowed to settle, raced in two path into the turn then slipped to the rail nearing the top of the stretch,
could not threaten the top three in the end but showed good late interest. WINTER FALCON threw his head at the start and was away slowly, rushed up
outside of runners in the early stages and chased the quick pace into the turn, advanced three wide heading to the quarter pole, ran evenly to the furlong
marker while within aim, lacked a response in deep stretch and weakened. ARTEMUS GORDON was prominent away from the start and disputed the fast
early pace, took back and tracked from the inside heading into the turn, chased the quick pace along the bend and tipped two wide into the stretch, ran in
pursuit of STORMIN GALILEO to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and tired. MITICO broke alertly, lost the early lead and chased
the fast pace three wide into the turn, lost position heading to the quarter pole and chased three wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and
gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
DOO WOP DON broke awkwardly and was off slowly to begin, regrouped and chased from the rear heading into the turn, raced outside of rivals
approaching the quarter marker and circled six wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth,
overtook BOBBY'S ALIBI in deep stretch and kicked clear in the final strides to win going away. BOBBY'S ALIBI broke a step slowly away from the gate,
tracked the fast pace two wide and between runners into the turn, loomed in upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command and
held a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth-pole, was caught in deep stretch by DOO WOP DON and was outfinished, while holding safely in the end for
second. TORPEDO AWAY was allowed to settle in the early going, tracked the fast pace three wide into the turn, came in a bit tight at the quarter marker
and swung five wide into the stretch, responded to urging and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not match strides with DOO WOP DON in the final
sixteenth but continued to close into deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. BANDERA AZTECA tracked the solid early pace from the inside,
chased from the rail along the turn and was put to a drive into upper stretch, tipped two wide and advanced to vie for the lead at the furlong marker, battled
into deep stretch, could not muster the needed response in the late stages, weakened and was edged for third. GABBY HAYES tracked the fast early pace
from the outside, raced four wide into the turn then was floated to the five path nearing the quarter marker, recovered and chased four wide into the stretch,
raced within aim to the furlong grounds and did not offer a late rally. LUCKY LAD vied for the lead away from the start then was sent to establish the front,
set a fast early pace, cleared to the rail heading to the turn and drew to a clear lead approaching the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch
and battled to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded. OUR BOLD PRINCE was forwardly placed away from the start and
contested the solid early pace, took back and tracked two wide heading to the turn, drifted out a path leaving the three-eighths marker and floated out
COUNTING CARDS, chased from the three path to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. COUNTING CARDS vied for
the early lead while between runners, took back and tracked the fast pace heading to the turn, was floated four wide entering the turn and in turn floated out
GABBY HAYES midway through the bend, lost position heading to the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CURVY CURLS broke well and was sharp in the early going with the rider doing his best to temper the pace, started to make a forward move at the start of
the turn then backed out when blocked, awaited room then split horses at the top of the stretch, sprinted clear and held sway to the wire. STOUT outrun
from the break then allowed to settle into stride down the backstretch, responded when asked to pick up the pace passing the seven-sixteenths marker,
saved ground through the turn, had to navigate through some traffic mid-stretch, tipped out when a hole opened up at the eighth pole and finished up well to
gain the place. MY BUCKET LIST settled mid-pack early and was content to let the pace scenario play out in the initial stages, then made a nice forward
move approaching the three furlong pole, made a three wide bid to put some pressure on the leaders, lugged in at the top of the stretch then rallied while
racing on the wrong lead but still got up for third. MAVERICK ROSE got a good break from the gate, took the early lead then was overtaken by
FASTTRAINTOTEXAS, settled into a pressing position just off the flank of that rival while under some restraint, was let loose approaching the
five-sixteenths, bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, started to weaken approaching the eighth pole and was outrun for a minor award. GALLO DEL
CIELO hopped in the air and came away awkwardly from the gate, then twice made contact with FASTTRAINTOTEXAS, the second bump causing the rider
to lose balance, had to regroup after spotting the field several lengths, saved ground through the turn while attempting to make up ground, steadied briefly to
avoid a tiring BIG IRISH near the quarter pole then swung seven wide into the stretch and finished with some interest. FASTTRAINTOTEXAS broke smartly
and went straight to the front, led the field to the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. BIG IRISH was fractious in the gate, broke with the field, raced
close up to the half-mile marker, struggled to keep up on the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch.
