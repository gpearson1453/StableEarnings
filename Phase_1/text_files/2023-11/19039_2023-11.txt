Footnotes
LORD BULLINGDON stumbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside early, moved out for the far turn, drew closer and swung five wide leaving the bend,
rallied to the front at the eighth pole, drove clear midstretch and won going away. GO WITH GUSTO tucked inside chasing from off the pace, on the move
from inside then tipped to the two path but had to pause in traffic at the quarter pole, waited again for room at the top of the lane, moved to the inside then
got put in tight along the fence, rallied once in the clear and got up for second. MO FOX GIVIN showed early speed four deep then moved into the three
path chasing the leader on the first turn, drew alongside to pressure the pacesetter, chased that rival leaving the backstretch, re-bid and dueled around the
far turn, led into the stretch, overtaken by the winner at the eighth pole and got edged for second. UNCHARTED vied between briefly then ceded command
but started to pull in the two path then between rivals on the clubhouse turn, continued two wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick in the furlong grounds. ACE OF CLUBS stalked along the inside, angled three wide on the far turn, got boxed in through the lane and never
found room. ULTRA POWER showed speed three deep then took control and angled over to the inside on the first turn, pressured on the backstretch before
moving clear again at the seven-sixteenths pole, challenged again by MO FOX GIVIN on the far turn, lost command leaving that bend and weakened down
the lane.

Footnotes
GRAND SLAM SMILE shadowed the leaders four deep, came to level terms with seven-sixteenths to run, forged command entering the lane, shook off
MIRINDA nearing the furlong marker and drew away. PETIT FILET attended the pace toward the inside, commenced her advance between runners through
the turn, shifted out four wide into the stretch and continued on willingly to earn the runner up spot. MIRINDA vied for the lead outside, was collared between
horses into the turn, contested the issue to the stretch, relinquished the lead entering the stretch, weakened further in the drive and settled for the minor
award. PRANCINGTHRUPARIS tracked three deep, came under a ride and moved up to make a mild bid mid way through the turn, but faltered into the
lane and failed to sustain the drive. PUTT FOR DOUGH was slow into stride, tucked in to save ground, advanced between rivals on the turn, but failed to
seriously threaten. MADISON RAE was allowed to settle, was hung wide throughout and failed to threaten. FLY A FANTASY settled in the second flight four
wide, angled in entering the stretch, but lacked a response when called upon. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY broke awkwardly and was away behind her field,
settled saving ground, but showed little. RECALCITRANT contested the pace inside for a half and dropped out,. SATELLITE HEART pitched her head at the
start, was away slow and never recovered.

Footnotes
WET MY BEAK bothered a bit leaving the gate, unhurried in the early going, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch,
rallied from outside, surged and got up in time. ELM DRIVE stalked from inside, pushed on approaching the lane, launched a bid inside the leader in upper
stretch, cleared briefly with a past the sixteenth pole but got run down by the winner near the wire. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER cleared early and steered
across to the inside for the turn, led two wide into the drive, challenged by ELM DRIVE in upper stretch, relinquished the lead midstretch, faltered late but
managed to save third. ROSE MADDOX stalked the pacesetter five deep early, four deep around the bend, finished willingly down the lane and missed the
show. WHITE MOONLIGHT tracked from inside and saved ground through the turn, finished willingly along the fence and was outkicked for the show
honors, bled following the race and walked off. UNBRIDLED MARY tracked outside a rival or in the two path, roused entering the stretch and lacked the
needed response. BENEDICT CANYON broke a step slow, reserved in the early going and moved inside, steered out across the dirt and improved position
in the lane. FREEDOM FLYER broke a step slow, chased three deep early, was closest in pursuit two wide at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the
drive and weakened. CAN'T BUY LOVE stalked between rivals into and around the bend and weakened down the stretch. PLAYLIST chased four deep
early, three deep around the turn and also weakened in the stretch. STOIC LUNA trailed two wide into the turn, continued at the back while moving out and
exited the bend five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC SPOON settled in hand on the outside, made a sweeping move to join the vanguard five deep leaving the turn, poked his head in front inside the
three-sixteenths pole, dug in to meet the challenge of PRIVATE GEM late and held stubbornly. The latter attended the pace off of the inside, split horses to
launch his bid entering the stretch, kicked on well but was unable to best the determined winner. DR. NO NO contested the pace along the inside, disputed
the issue to the final furlong and succumbed. MICI'S EXPRESS was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, took closer order through the turn,
shifted out for the final furlong and was making up ground. GOING MOBILE contended between horses four wide, fanned out further into the lane, but
flattened and finished evenly. SHADY APPEAL prompted the pace three wide, but faltered between horses entering the stretch and gave way. LAST CALL
LONDON was allowed to settle, moved up four wide to make a mild bid leaving the turn but failed to sustain the drive. STAY ON THE FENCE vied for the
lead between rivals through the turn and tired. MR. SUDS settled in the second flight, but lacked a response when called upon. SALSATION was fractious in
the gate, settled saving ground but was never a factor. JUST A GUESS broke a step slow and showed little thereafter. TIGER IN MY TANK was through
early, dropped well back and was distanced through the stretch.

inside, tipped out and brushed rival at the top of the stretch, finished willingly in the late stages but lacked the needed late punch. SHARDS sat off the pace

bend three then four wide, moved out in the lane, kept trying in the furlong grounds but needed to find more late. CHERRY BLOSSOM (IRE) chased

chased outside a rival, spun three wide into the lane, steered out and could not rally. AMIDST WAVES raced off the pace between rivals, got put in tight at
the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend two wide and could not rally. ASEAN (IRE) came away slow from outside, steered inward trailing the field,

Footnotes
JUST F Y I shadowed TAMARA three deep, moved up to engage on the second turn, forged command inside the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear a
furlong out, was kept to task and maintained a diminishing advantage. JODY'S PRIDE was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out to launch her bid
nearing the quarter pole, kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. CANDIED bobbled at the start, settled saving ground on the first turn, took closer
order advancing between rivals on the backstretch and through the second turn, angled out five wide into the stretch, brushed with LIFE TALK near the
three-sixteenths pole but kept on well and was making up ground. LIFE TALK settled in hand, moved up four wide through the second turn, loomed a
danger entering the stretch, brushed with CANDIED and flattened in the drive. SCALABLE was unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs
to run, came five wide and improved position. BRIGHTWORK contended three wide, but weakened between horses leaving the second turn and faded.
TAMARA was bumped at the start, recovered quick and shook clear to dictate terms, was collared on the second turn, relinquished the lead three-sixteenths
out, stayed on the the final furlong and caved. WHERE'S MY RING was bumped at the start, was keen and pulled along the inside through the opening half,
leveled into stride and got through to make a mild bid but came up empty leaving the second turn. CHATALAS was jostled hard between rivals at the start,
settled between horses and failed to make headway. ACCOMMODATE EVA was hustled along four wide to the second turn and retreated. ESPRIT
ENCHANTE was hustled along between horses in mid pack for six furlongs and dropped out. OMAHA GIRL was bumped between horses at the start and
never recovered.

PRETTY rated four deep in the early going, remained wide into the far turn, took aim three wide into the lane, bid five deep at the eighth pole, fought three

Footnotes
FIERCENESS prompted the pace outside GENERAL PARTNER to the second turn, forged a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, opened clear entering
the stretch, was kept to task and widened through the drive. MUTH stalked the pace in hand, launched a bold bid leaving the second turn, was unable to go
on with the winner, then was all out to just preserve the runner up spot. LOCKED settled off of the inside, moved up between rivals, wheeled out five wide
leaving the second turn, quickened in the final sixteenth but found her best stride too late. TIMBERLAKE was rank to place in traffic into the first turn, settled
into stride three deep, ranged up to make a mild bid midway through the second turn, but flattened during the drive. PRINCE OF MONACO checked behind
a rival on the clubhouse turn, settled in hand between horses, came three wide but failed to make headway through the stretch. GENERAL PARTNER was
away in good order, set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed inside the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on to the final furlong and gave way.
CUBAN THUNDER (IRE) was unhurried into stride, lacked a response when called upon and passed only the tiring ones. WINE ME UP was forwardly
placed along the inside to the second turn and dropped out. NOTED went wide and was never a factor.
