Footnotes
DABNEY was off a bit slow at the start and settled to the back, was asked for more approaching the turn, quickly gained on the field through the turn, came
three wide into the lane while sweeping past the leaders, cleared and widened to the eighth pole and was kept to the task to the end while shortening strides
late. LUCKY LINDA W trailed through the turn while in the two path, angled into the five path for the drive and rallied through the final eighth and just ran out
of real estate. ABRA ABRA was unhurried while off the inside, came into the lane from the four path, was in the place spot inside the sixteenth pole while
closing in on the tiring winner then lost that spot late. COMP stalked the duel from the three or four path into mid-turn, bid three wide in late turn, was a
serious threat into the lane then weakened. SALTY SUE vied for the lead with another while along the inside, continued under pressure into the lane and
gave way. TEN LIL VICTORIES vied for the lead while two wide through the turn and into the lane and was empty.

Footnotes
LADY HELENA raced near the inside throughout while near the inside and in mid-pack, cut the corner into the lane, rallied up the inside, caught the leader
nearing the sixteenth pole and edged up. JUST BE QUIET stayed away from all rivals during post-parade and pre-race, loaded first and broke on top, set
the pace along the inside, was joined by two others down the backstretch, continued on a short lead into the turn, cleared in late turn, under pressure again
into the lane, dueled from between rivals through the final eighth and was just outfinished by the inside rival. STEPHANIESWARRIOR was four wide into the
far turn, bid from well off into the lane, continued with good momentum while in the seven path and was closing in to the wire. OUR GIRL FLINT was asked
for more while four wide in late turn, came into the lane from the 5path and finished evenly. NEWLYWED saved ground through the far turn when near the
back but not far back in terms of lengths, came into the lane from the two path and finished evenly. SEAU N'TAP chased the pace from the four path into the
far turn, bid four wide into the lane, was four wide and on near even terms with an eighth to go then flattened out late. EL KOWN never a factor while along
the inside through the far turn. THE ENEMY OF FUN outrun while saving ground. THREE COATS hopped at the start, raced in the five path into the far turn
and was never a factor. BELLA VALENTINA chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was three wide into the lane and was empty. WHAT YOU
WISHED vied for the lead two wide and between rivals down the backstretch then was done entering the far turn.

SARGENT HULKA stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, wore down the leader and was clear late under mild urging. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS
was clear early, drew off in the stretch and was caught late. MONUMENTALJUSTICE was unrushed and rallied late four wide. SECRETO DE AMORE was
unrushed, then bid belatedly in the four path. DEVILS GOTTA GO saved ground and offered a mild late bid. HUMBLE WARRIOR found his best stride late
in the three path. JACK'S SUMMER stalked the pace in the three path, was checked at the half-mile mark, came back but faded in the stretch. CADILLAC
JUSTICE stalked the pace inside and faded in the stretch between foes. PAYNTER'S CANVAS was steadied at the start, then lacked a late bid. SHA KON
O HEY stalked the early pace between rivals before fading. ROCKET DOCKET bore out at the start, pressed the early pace in the three path, stalked the
pace, then bolted just past the quarter pole.

TURBONATOR chased the early pace while in the two path, moved to press the leader in mid-turn, dueled with that one into the lane, gained a short lead
just outside the eighth pole and drew away. PHILIP SNOW set the early pace while in the two path, vied with the winner through the turn and into the lane
and could not keep up while clearly second best. SAN RONIN saved ground into the lane, was no match for the top two while winning the show duel. BIG
ANCHOR went to his knees at the start, trailed into the mid-turn while in the three path, angled into the six path for the drive and moved up while not a
threat. GRAY MIKE raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane four wide, launched a bid while straightening then weakened late.
GLORIFIED WINNER chased the pace two wide into the turn, continued in the two path and faded after entering the lane. PRADO CITY was done early
from off the inside.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVE SKIES raced four wide into the first turn, continued in the four path down the backstretch and into the turn, continued off the inside through the
turn, bid into the lane, cleared from the three path and held while drifting out a couple of paths late. MEAN ELENITA pressed the pace while two wide into
the turn, was shuffled back some when others made bids through the turn, stayed on well and dug in through the final eighth to gain the place spot. BRODY
MO reared at the start and spotted the field some five lengths, raced in the back through the firs turn, continued in the three path through the far turn when
gaining momentum, swung into the lane from the five path, looked a threat with an eighth to go then flattened late. EMPIRE SUNRISE set the pace along
the inside under steady pressure, continued with a short lead into late turn then gave way after entering the lane. LUSH BE A LADY chased the pace three
wide throughout, continued to be close up in mid-turn then faded in the lane. ICEY ANGEL never a factor while in the two path through the turns. OUT OF
PROMISES raced in the three or four path into the far turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was a menace. BICARB BETTY saved ground
while in mid-pack and tired through the stretch run. SUTTON'S PASS was done after traveling a half from the five path.

Footnotes
NO JOKING MATTER was clear soon after the start while in two path, slowly widened to the eighth pole then was kept to the task to the end to remain
clear. LILMISS SASSYPANTS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the winner, could not
gain on that one but stayed on well to hold the place spot. MYGALJUSTICE raced in the four path through the turn when near mid-pack, continued well off
the inside into the lane, straightened in the seven path and was gaining. ANGELSNDISGUISE chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into
the lane and tired. SANTIVA DIVA in the two or three path through the turn when near the back and never a factor. ALLIE MAES REVENGE chased the
early pace while along the inside and was done entering the turn. SHES MY TREASURE was outrun while in the three path through the turn.
