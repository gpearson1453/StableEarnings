Footnotes
DISAPPEARANCE dropped back quickly while showing no speed from the start, moved out early then shifted back in near the five-eighths pole, was urged
while inside to the two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide, floated seven wide into the stretch then drifted further out under a left-handed crop,
was switched to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and closed strongly to get up in the final stride. ICE ROAD pressed the pace on the outside
then in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, took the advantage in the four path into upper stretch, responded well under heavy
pressure in the final furlong, led until the final stride but was denied. JEEPER settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, chased in
the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, gained to make a bid near the
sixteenth-pole but missed while able to get a share of the show. BLAME D RULE MAKER broke a step slow, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his
cue in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, chased outside under a drive into the final sixteenth, made a bid late and shared the show.
DADS GOOD RUNNER went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, lost
the advantage in the two path into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
FANCY AZTECA angled in while going to the front, showed the way while inside of a foe down the backstretch, moved clear outside the seven-sixteenths
pole, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper stretch and held under a strong hand-ride. PRETTI
XTREME settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and finished willingly for the place. I'M BUZZY pressed the pace on the outside, dropped
back in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the
proper lead and kept on for the show. ROYAL MEGHAN moved out near the five-eighths pole, was urged along near the back, went five wide on the turn
and failed to threaten. HALO CITY angled out near leaving the chute, was urged along at the rear, moved in leaving the backstretch, angled from the inside
to the four path on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. HYDRA was last to commence, settled off the pace, was roused three wide
on the turn and failed to respond. CARBON settled between horses, was urged along in the two path on the turn and came up empty. FREDDYMO
FACTOR was hustled from the start then carried in while showing speed before being taken back off the pace by the rider, fell back towards the rear of the
field, lugged out some while four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. GOOD PENNY was urged along off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
QUEENS MASTERPIECE was well placed just off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, stalked three to four wide on the turn, was put to a drive in
upper stretch, rallied to the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady handling. QUEENS OVER THREES went to the front, showed the
way down the backstretch, shook clear in the three path midway through the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside
the furlong marker and proved no match while able to hold the place. BETTER HUMOR ME was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside of a
rival, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, chased into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while just able to
get the show. LAVON dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path, angled out into upper stretch and improved position.
YANKEE AGATE bobbled outward at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide on the turn and weakened. REIGNING CHICK was
hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE lost her footing at the start then bumped lightly with a foe, moved up some midway down the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor. STELLA MARS made light contact with an opponent just after the start, was
urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BORLETTI (IRE) chased six then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advancing to take command just inside the five-sixteenths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. WHENLOVETAKESOVER chased just off
the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, closed willingly to secure
the place honors while well clear of the rest. GRAND AGAIN showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded
the front just inside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ALIBI IKE chased four to five wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals while weakening himself. TUESDAY'S CHILD chased five then three
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and went by some tired foes while also weakening to the finish. PINE
ALLEY got away sharply to a well timed start under some coaxing, led briefly and then chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAGIADORO chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch, made no impact. LITTLE SKIPPY chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired.
EQUALIZER chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no impact, then got pulled up after the finish and was ponied back without the rider to be unsaddled before walking off
under his own power while reported to have bled.

Footnotes
COMPARATIVE was well placed just off the pace, made a bid under urging in the three path on the turn, took the lead while drifting out in upper stretch,
fought outside of CRYPTO MAMA into the final sixteenth then edged clear under steady handling. INTO HAPPINESS moved out early then settled on the
far outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn, gained outside in the stretch and finished with good energy for the place. CRYPTO MAMA showed the
way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, fought on with that foe into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished then lost the place while well clear for the show. TONED UP was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, angled in leaving the
chute, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MISSY GREER stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and
retreated. MISS BONNIE T bobbed outward at start then brushed the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged in the three path on
the turn and was no factor. BUSTIN BAY angled out early then was forwardly placed, moved to the far outside late on the backstretch, shifted from the six
path to the four path early on the turn and faltered.

seventy yards and just lasted at the end. JULIA SHINING chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into

Footnotes
LADY BANKER was away alertly from the outside post, stalked the leading duo on the outside, was asked while three to four wide on the turn, took the lead
in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH was bumped at the start then forced into another foe, disputed the pace
on the outside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner in the three path upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the
place. SWEET LIBERTY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was well placed while coaxed along on the backstretch, chased in the two to three
path on the turn, steadied off heels while lacking room in an attempt to go between foes near the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner in the stretch and just
missed the place. CHIARA broke out and bumped with a rival, was coaxed along just off the pace, chased three to four wide on the turn, remained on her
inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and weakened. FOLLOW THE FED broke in at the start, was urged along on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. PUREST PERFORMANCE broke out and bumped with a rival, moved up
while hustled to contest the pace on the inside of foes, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and tired. BELLA ISOLA came in at
the start then bumped with a foe and was taken up, angled in at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. COUNTESS
CONSTANCE was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten then was reported to have bled. BANK HOLIDAY was ridden along off the pace, angled in late on the backstretch, went two to
three wide on the turn and failed to respond. DARLING CAT bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground
on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and also was no factor.
