Footnotes
KAALA rated close to the early pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in the two and three paths on the far turn, took the nod into the lane,
ran clear mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. FAR MORE took over into the opening turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead into the lane, dropped back toward mid-stretch and had to settle for second best.
PRINCESS MARGARET had a slim early lead then stalked into the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
showed little further. TAPTAP saved ground well off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail. OUR BREW
raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response. LOCKDOWN VANNA was detained in the gate and consequently declared a non-starter.

Footnotes
JUBAY gave early chase toward the inside, angled to the four path approaching the top of the lane, drifted leaving the turn but dug in under steady handling
and got up and cleared ELEANORS JACK in the final yards. The latter drew clear at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the
turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final yards. CHARITABLE WINDSOR pressured the pace to the head of the lane then
flattened inside the eighth pole. JEFFERSON SECURITY gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. BEAR'S ESTATE
gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path. HE'S ON THE LINE gave chase through the backstretch and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
SARAH'S CANDY CAMP settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and improved in the four path on the far
turn, was carried to the outside leaving the turn but dug in under steady handling and got up the final strides. LOVE IS WICKED veered in at the break then
saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and
dueled to a brief lead mid-stretch, but was caught in the final strides. MR. DUMBLEDORE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the three path leaving the turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. YES
MY PRINCE tapered in and stalked two deep, challenged CHRISTOPHER'SHEART leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep midway
on the far turn but flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. The latter came away awkwardly and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the
three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and relented the final sixteenth. YACHTSMEN raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn
outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response. RUDD'S ROCKET was never a factor. GOGO GADGET came away
awkwardly then stalked from the three path the first turn, but faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
FORT FORTITUDE rounded the first turn about the three path and was eased out entering the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the four path on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to get up the final yards. FOX RED rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole and was met while between horses toward the quarter pole, dug in gamely leaving the far turn but was caught in the final
yards. SHANGHAI WARRIOR stalked three wide, challenged toward the five sixteenths pole and contested even terms three wide on the far turn and
remained a factor to mid-stretch before flattening stride. MAGICAL EXPRESS rated close inside, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested
even terms at the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. SKILLFUL saved early ground while racing well back and never factored.
MAKE THE WAY CLEAR showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
IN GOOD TROUBLE chased inside through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail, left the turn three wide and took the lead past the eighth pole, drew
clear inside the sixteenth and widened through later yards. MY SISTER CLURRIE set a pressured pace through the opening quarter mile, was met and
dueled at even terms toward the five sixteenths pole, took the nod past the quarter, gave up the lead leaving the furlong pole but cleared second past the
sixteenth. SHUTUPN'KISSME dueled to even terms at the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms at the rail on the turn but flattened
nearing mid-stretch. JUBA'S HOUSE chased through the backstretch, came through the turn about the five path, left the turn outside and could only improve
her position. LOLA FLO gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. CHEROKEE CASTLE gave chase through the backstretch,
raced in range in the four path on the turn then weakened. GOT YOUR NUMBER was not a factor.

Footnotes
CREOLE took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was given rein approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and finished
on her own initiative. PLANET FROLIC tapered in and stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn and had to settle for second best. SOMEBODY LOVES ME rounded the opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened in the lane. LILY THE KID saved ground on the first turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. DASHING LASS was forced out leaving the gate and saved early ground.
HERECOMESPUDD ducked out leaving the gate, raced in the four path on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
CHEYENNE SPRING rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded nearing the far turn. HEY MACARENA
broke a step slow and saved ground on the first turn, showed little response and was eased from the five sixteenths pole.
