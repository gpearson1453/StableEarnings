Footnotes
CHURCH HARBOR rated nicely off of the decent early pace, tracked from the inside along the turn, tipped two wide nearing the top of the lane and was
asked for run into the stretch, chased COPPER BO TEN to the furlong grounds, responded to urging and closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, took
command in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prove best. COPPER BO TEN showed speed leaving the break and dictated terms in the
early going, set a decent pace into the turn and extended the lead at the quarter marker, was kept to task into the stretch and held a safe lead at the furlong
pole, was confronted by CHURCH HARBOR nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that bid into deep stretch but could not match strides in the final stages and
was outfinished, while besting the rest. VALERIE broke alertly, took back off of the decent early pace and tracked two wide to the turn, gained ground at the
quarter marker, maintained a two wide path into the stretch, brushed with TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS nearing the furlong grounds and ran evenly to
mid-stretch, could not impact the top two in the final sixteenth and was outkicked, while clear in the end for third. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS chased the decent
early pace outside of rivals, raced three wide into the turn, maintained that path into upper stretch and brushed with VALERIE heading to the furlong
grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. DORINE'S WILD CAT was away a step slowly, tracked the
decent early pace from the inside, chased to the quarter marker, saved ground into the stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. HEAVENLY VIOLET
raced close to the decent early pace, chased COPPER BO TEN two wide to the quarter marker, swung three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace at
the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
NUESTRO ENGREIDO was forwardly placed leaving the break, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch
run and was given his cue three wide into the far turn, vied for the lead three deep at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and kicked clear
at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish. DE LA LUNA was bumped at the start by BALLROOM
PRINCE and was off slowly, settled two wide into the first turn and was unhurried into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker
and was steered to the outside heading into the far turn, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker and raced within aim nearing the top of the stretch,
chased NUESTRO ENGREIDO to the furlong grounds, made a mild late gain in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and held well for
second. BALLROOM PRINCE was squeezed at the start by a neighboring rival then bumped with DE LA LUNA and was away a bit slowly, saved ground
into the first turn while unhurried, tracked from the inside through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, waited for racing room along
the rail nearing the top of the lane and angled five wide into the stretch, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for second, while clear in the end for
third. MEDAL ICE broke in at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, settled off of the fast early pace and saved ground into the backstretch run,
advanced heading to the half-mile marker, continued that gain three wide into the far turn, chased into the stretch, could not sustain his run into the final
furlong and flattened out. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE was away alertly, showed speed in the early stages and was prominent into the first turn, engaged with
THEMAINPROTAGONIST and disputed solid fractions with that rival into the backstretch run, contested the pace into the far turn vied for the lead inside of
a pair of rivals at the quarter marker, could not match strides into upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong grounds and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS PADDY broke alertly, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked two wide into the turn, maintained a two wide path to the quarter
marker while not far back, swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was full of run into the final sixteenth, closed fast while
widest in deep stretch, took command in the final yards and held in a drive at the finish. BELLY UP was prominent in the early going, vied for the early lead
then pressed the fast pace into the turn, kept close attendance to J C'S A LEGEND along the bend while outside of that rival, battled into upper stretch and
drew to even terms with J C'S A LEGEND at the furlong marker, dueled into the final sixteenth, was overtaken by MISCHIEVOUS PADDY in deep stretch
and bested J C'S A LEGEND for second on the wire. J C'S A LEGEND bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was asked for early speed and gained
command in the opening stages, set a fast pace from the inside and was pressured by BELLY UP into the turn, carved out quick fractions while pressed to
the quarter pole, battled into the stretch and maintained a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dueled with BELLY UP into the final sixteenth, was outfinished
in deep stretch and was just edged on the wire for third. TRINIDAD was away in good order then took back off of the fast early pace, tracked from the inside
into the turn, gained ground into the bend then waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, tipped to the three path in upper stretch and ran evenly to
the furlong marker, raced in a bit of traffic in the final sixteenth and could not improve his position at the finish. SMILING FELON tracked the quick early
pace from the outside, raced three wide into the turn and raced within aim approaching the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch, lost
ground at the furlong marker and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SPEED GRAZY tracked the early pace two wide into the first turn, was well placed along the backstretch run, was asked for run into the far turn and chased
to the quarter pole, slipped to the rail in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth and rallied in deep
stretch, bested OH GREAT in the final strides and held in a drive at the finish. OH GREAT (IRE) was sent leaving an alert beginning and dictated terms into
the first turn, carved out the pace through the backstretch run while well rated, came under pressure from BUTTONWOOD TREE into the far turn and was
pressed to the quarter marker, drifted out into the stretch and shook free approaching the eighth pole, was kept to task while leading into the final sixteenth,
was confronted by SPEED GRAZY in deep stretch and was bested in the final strides. EL JOY was away in good order then took back off of the early pace,
saved ground into the first turn and maintained that inside position into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the half-mile marker, chased into the
far turn and was coaxed along two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch, could not reel in the top two in the
final stages and was clear for third. BUTTONWOOD TREE tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained his three wide position into the
backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, advanced position into the far turn and pressed OH GREAT to the quarter pole, was
turned away in that effort and chased OH GREAT to mid-stretch, could not muster a response into the final sixteenth and weakened late. ATTENZIONE was
unhurried away from the start and saved ground into the backstretch, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn, ran in
pursuit into upper stretch and did not threaten. GROSS PROFIT was forwardly placed leaving the break, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn,
tracked OH GREAT through moderate fractions along the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and lost position heading to the quarter marker,
was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOCHMARA broke well but was outrun to the turn, found her best stride about a furlong in then began to gain ground racing three wide around the turn, kept
on running through the stretch, collared SAHARA SUE inside the final sixteenth and won clear. SAHARA SUE broke well and stalked the pacesetting
HILLSDALE NATION to the turn, moved up to challenge approaching the five-sixteenths pole, drew even at the top of the stretch, got the best of that foe in
mid-stretch, ran on but could not hold off the winner in the final yards. PLEASANT WARNING was four wide into the turn, backed off the pace and angled
towards the inside for the run into the turn, got a clear run through the turn and carried the bid into the stretch, had a little trouble changing leads near the
three-sixteenths pole then straightened and ran on well to gain third. DIVINE PASSAGE raced close up two deep into the first turn, came under a ride near
the five-sixteenths, struggled to keep pace at the head of the stretch, and finished evenly. HILLSDALE NATION came away well and sprinted a length or
two clear of the field in the early stages, took on a challenge by SAHARA SUE from the five-sixteenths marker, battled to mid-stretch and gave way.
AUTISM SHINE broke well, chased the pacesetters close up from inside to the three-eighths marker, came under pressure trying to keep up nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the stretch. DAZZLE ME GINGER was reluctant to load, broke last, was trying to get out on the turn and chased
the field into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
SIR GREYSON tracked the fast early pace from the inside, shifted two wide into the turn and chased the dueling pacesetters to the quarter marker, swung
three wide into the drive and was asked for run nearing mid-stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled with GOLDEN ALE into the final
sixteenth, disposed of that rival in deep stretch and kicked clear in the end. DISKO TRIBUTE took back off of the fast early pace and tracked from the inside,
saved ground through the bend and advanced at the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, was outkicked by SIR
GREYSON in deep stretch, stayed on in the final strides and was up at the wire to secure second. GOLDEN ALE was crowded by a neighboring rival at the
start and was off a step slowly, was hustled to show early speed and disputed the fast pace with COWBOY CHARLIE into the turn, took a narrow lead
outside of COWBOY CHARLIE and set a fast pace two wide to the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch and was confronted by SIR GREYSON
nearing the furlong marker, met that bid and battled approaching the sixteenth-pole, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and was nailed
on the line for second, while holding clearly for third. TOP EXECUTIVE broke out at the start and crowded GOLDEN ALE in the early stages, tracked the
fast pace three wide into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker,
needed more in deep stretch and finished evenly. COWBOY CHARLIE broke sharply and assumed command away from the start, was engaged in the
opening stages by GOLDEN ALE and dueled with that foe through fast early fractions, dueled inside of GOLDEN ALE into the bend and pressed the pace to
the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and weakened. STORMING
MACHINE tracked the fast early pace between runners, came in a bit tight entering the turn, steadied and lost position heading to the quarter pole, chased
two wide into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the pace two wide into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch
run, confronted BLUEBERRY MUFFIN into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth and kept to task in deep
stretch to prevail. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN showed early speed and assumed command away from the start, set solid fractions while controlling the pace
through the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn, came under pressure in upper stretch and battled with SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE to the furlong
grounds, could not go on with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the final strides for second. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS rated off of the early
pace and tracked between rivals into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace between two wide heading to
the half-mile maker, raced a bit in tight into the second turn, found room at the quarter marker and was roused three wide into the stretch, angled four wide
and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the late stages and just missed for second at the wire, while well clear in the end for third. BEA MISCHIEF was
allowed to settle leaving the break, raced three wide into the first turn and was unhurried into the backstretch run, shifted to the two path and tracked the
decent pace to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, needed
more in the final sixteenth and passed a tiring rival in deep stretch. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA broke alertly, conceded the early lead and tracked from the inside
into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while well positioned through the backstretch run, gave chase along the far turn, saved ground into upper stretch,
ran evenly to the furlong marker and could not muster a late rally. JAZZY LOVE was forwardly placed into the first turn and tracked the early pace three
wide, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, chased three wide into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and
tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TAMARA MINE broke best, quickly assumed command, was well-handled throughout, extended the lead through the turn, had plenty left when roused
passing the three-sixteenths pole and won as the rider pleased. TESSA (GB) was away a step slowly but was quickly up to contest the early pace, raced
between horses as a trio chased TAMARA MINE into the turn, emerged passing the five-sixteenths marker as the main threat to that rival, ran on willingly
under intermittent urging but was no match. DRAW ME lacked early speed and raced at the back of the field in the early stages, saved ground and started
to make some forward progress through the turn, swung out to the seven or eighth for the stretch run and produced a strong rally down the middle of the
track to gain the third spot. TIP TOP GAL came away a bit awkwardly but was quickly up the rail and into the early mix, tipped out three wide for the stretch
run, responded to urging but was outfinished in the late stages for third. MOMMA MOCCA raced near the back of the compact field through the early stages,
was between horses turning in to the stretch, took up nearing the furlong pole when TIP TOP GAL drifted out, changed paths to the inside but could not
recover. MISS UNION hopped in the air at the start, rushed into contention then raced three wide through the turn, was fanned four wide into the stretch
then was unable to sustain the bid late and weakened in the final furlong. O'NEILL'S LEGACY came away well, raced close up but four to five wide down
the backstretch, started to lose ground at the halfway point and was not a factor in the stretch.
