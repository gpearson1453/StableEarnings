the turn, came inside the drifting runner-up in mid-stretch and dug in to take over the final strides. SISYPHUS rated close in the three path the first turn,
started a four wide bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, took the nod in the three path entering the stretch, drifted past the eighth pole and was caught
in the final strides. HAMMER rated a slim lead inside, was met leaving the half mile pole but recovered the advantage approaching the three eighths, gave
up the lead at the rail leaving the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. RAINBOW DAY stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
dropped back toward the quarter and faded through the far turn. CATALINA KID raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. SILVER REDESDALE drifted into the first turn then stalked from the three path, took a brief lead into

Footnotes
GRAND FIBER contested the pace through the backstretch and raced at even terms nearest the rail on the tun, dug in for the nod mid-stretch and
determinedly held on. MISCHIEVOUS JESSE exchanged contact with BE BE BOP at the break then dueled for the lead nearing the three eighths pole,
contested the edge two deep on the turn and dug in gamely for second while outfinished for the win. The latter exchanged contact with Mischievous Jesse
leaving the gate then engaged in close chase, contested near even terms three wide on the turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
BUFFALO SHUFFLE came away a step slow then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly to take
third later yards. JAZZ MAN DO broke in the air then gave chase, raced in range of the lead in the three path on the turn but flattened later yards. NO
FOOLING DUDE gave close early chase inside but steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and faded through the turn. MACY'S BOY gave chase,
raced near the rail into the turn, angled out leaving the turn and could only close the gap. This race was hand timed.

was steadily handled to hold on. CONTINGENCY pressured the pace through the backstretch, dropped back approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn
off the rail but came back to close the gap in late stretch. CAUSETOWIN gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and came along to take third mid-stretch.

evenly in the lane. NOBLE OBSESSION became edgy in the gate, was forced inward and into P B Foxy at the start then gave chase, raced in the three path

path on the turn and flattened in the lane. ONE CANDY CASTLE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little
more. REATA'S CASTLE gave chase and rounded the turn in the four path. ABENDEGO was hustled to the lead inside at the half mile pole and showed the
way, but was met past the five sixteenths, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER RENEE stalked from the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch, dueled briefly clear in later yards and held on. SIDESWIPED raced well off the early pace about the four path, started a bid
approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the six path, drifted wider leaving the turn, dug in to take second later yards and was
gaining on the winner. LACE REVOLUTION raced off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path,
eased out leaving the turn, was outfinished in the duel through the stretch but just got up for third. DULCIMER DAME rated close inside on the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. FULL MOON LOVER tapered in and
stalked two deep, took the nod past the three eighths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, but was met while flattening stride mid-stretch.
COMPLETE SURPRISE rated the early pace inside, was met at the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail past the
quarter and weakened nearing mid-stretch. CAJUN COUSIN rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed
little response. TUNSTALL raced off the rail the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
SURF CITY GOLD came away awkwardly and was bumped soon afterward, raced off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled to the front past the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and drew away while kept alert. VOICE OF NOW
moved to the inside and rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met past the
eighth pole but held on for second. DANNY'S WINKSTER raced well back two deep the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. DISTANT FIRE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MR. CELLULAR ducked out and made contact with Surf City Gold leaving
the gate then settled inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and
flattened stride. SEIZE THE BREEZE stalked three wide the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened.
MISS YOU AJAX rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the six
path on the far turn. SILVER R rounded the first turn in the six path and showed little response through the backstretch. SAAFEN raced well back about the
three path the first turn and showed little. FOR HONOR AND LUCK became fractious in the gate then stalked two deep, gave chase past the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.
