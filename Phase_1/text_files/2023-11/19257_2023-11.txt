Footnotes
HOPESHECANRUN roused to the front to take a pressured lead to the top of the stretch then drew clear proving best. CHIPEEE was shuffled back after the
break then steadily advanced through the turn, moved out to seven wide for a late rally. TRUVY'S BANDIT raced off the pace to the turn then made a three
wide bid on the turn and engaged the leaders at the top of the stretch but was no match for the top two and held the show. LITTLE WARRIOR trailed the
field early, saved ground around the turn then moved out to five wide going into the stretch to make a late run to improve position. COUNTRY CAT JAKE
pressed the pace from the inside but lacked the late response needed. I'M A NIGHT TRAIN raced off the pace from four wide through the turn but was
empty in the stretch. BELLAMY BROTHER broke in slightly at the start and bumped inside rival, settled in the middle of the pack to mid turn then moved
between horses at the three sixteenths pole but faltered. FLASH OF RAIN went to a brief early lead then vied for the lead from two wide to the top of the
stretch and tired. BOSS MAN ZONG raced near the back and was not a threat. FISHIN WITH PETE was bumped then veered out after the break, settled in
the middle of the pack early and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GOD'S GOLD was roused to the front to set the pace and take a clear lead into the first turn, held that position through the final turn then drew off.
HULLINAHURRY raced off the pace down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the final turn, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to be a
clear second. DIRECTIONAL raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved out to four wide on the final turn and was along for the show.
SOULOLOGY saved ground to the final turn the moved out to the two path to make a mild bid to improve position. AWESOME CAJUN was away alertly
then settled on the inside to save ground to no avail. ANGOLA VACATION raced near the back and was not a threat. EL JEFE COBB was rushed to the
front to track the leader for a half then dropped back. MULETRAIN trailed.

Footnotes
RUNTODAY rushed up to press the pace from three wide down the backstretch then shared command around the final turn, dueled down the stretch and
dug in late to prevail. VIOLENT CITY vied for the lead from the inside while sharing the command through the turn, dueled down the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. FAHAN was unhurried down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally. LULOS stalked the pace from off the rail
down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. YO DAWG tracked the leaders while racing evenly to the top
of the stretch and weakened. STRAIGHTEN UP roused to the lead from between horses while setting a pressured pace to the five sixteenths pole and tired.
HALO MOON was always back.

the front to press the pace down the backstretch and fell back on the turn but dug in in late stretch to save the place. MISS LONELYHEARTS raced off the

DREAM was off the pace down the backstretch but fell back on the final turn and came again to be best of the rest. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, moved up from the two path on the final turn for a late run but was outkicked in the stretch. CZAR'S BALLERINA
raced near the back around the first turn advance from four wide at the three furlong maker to improve her position. ROSES ARE GRAY raced in the middle
of the pack, moved between horses at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid on the leaders at the top of the stretch but hung. PAINTBRUSH was never a

COOLCROSS saved ground from off the pace to the final turn then slipped through into the stretch and drew off. GETCHA was allowed to settle down the
backstretch, moved up from the inside on the final turn and proved to be a clear second. HURTS SO BAD went to the lead for a half then floated out
entering the stretch and was empty in the stretch. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER prompted the pace from between horses to the top of the stretch then fell back
slightly but finished evenly, vanned off. TENSAS ALL OURS raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail down the backstretch then moved up on the
final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to make a mild late run. TAPALIST was unhurried down the backstretch, saved ground around the final
turn while showing late interest to improve his position. TAPPIN FORA DANCE raced near the back down the backstretch, moved between horses at the
quarter pole but was never a factor. JOEBOY raced in the middle of the pack while racing three wide around the first turn then retreated. TEXAS TITAN
hustled to vie for the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and gave way. MEAN CRUISER failed to menace.
