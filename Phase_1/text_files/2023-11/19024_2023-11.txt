Footnotes
VIRAT bumped with outer rival at the start, went up to take control and set a pressured pace, cleared around the turn, showed the way along the inside into
the lane, opened up in upper stretch and held safely under urging. EDDIE'S LAST trailed in the early going from inside, saved ground through the turn,
tipped off the rail in the lane and rallied for the place. BELMONT BILL stalked three wide into the turn, chased two wide into the drive, failed to summon the
needed late kick to threaten the winner in the furlong grounds and got edged for second. AWESOME RHYTHM chased from inside into and around the
bend, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MARS ON FIRE settled early outside rivals, rounded the bend three wide and failed to rally. THIRTY
FOUR COUPE bumped with inner rival in the beginning, prompted the pace from outside to the turn, failed to keep up with the winner around the bend,
chased a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. VAGABOND SHOES sat off the pace three deep then off the rail, navigated the turn two then three
wide and proved no menace. POWERTRAIN forwardly placed early between rivals, chased two wide still in between on the turn and came up empty in the
drive.

Footnotes
BANGS dueled for command between rivals early then took control leaving the backstretch, headed by RILEY G midway around the bend, fought with that
rival down the stretch and held gamely to the wire. RILEY G bumped with outer rival at the start, shifted in early, raced up close three deep, pressed from
outside then headed BANGS near the five-sixteenths pole, fought through the lane, drifted in and bumped BANGS at the sixteenth pole and could not get
by. SIDE BY SIDE broke well and vied for command inside a pair of rivals early, chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, asked right handed leaving the
bend, kept on through the lane and finished a clear third. STORMING GRAY raced outside rivals at the back, ran three wide on the turn, two wide into the
stretch and proved no menace. DANCING MO drifted into the heels of RILEY G and had to steady early, traveled in the second flight along the inside into
the turn, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and lacked further response. JAZZY BOO broke slow and bumped with inner rival,
chased off the pace two wide into the turn, moved out to the three path then angled to the inside leaving the bend and weakened in the stretch.

took over in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and lasted over the runner-up. ISLAND CRUISER broke a step slow, reserved in the early going, went
two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied from outside and just missed. AINT NO JOKE chased from inside out of range,
lost ground around the bend, remained inside to the stretch, rallied along the fence and got up for the show. RASTAMAN VIBE broke in, raced towards the
rear early, went three wide into the turn, got bumped out to the four path near the five-sixteenths pole, finished willingly through the lane and got edged for
third. SKETCHY traveled along the inside near the back into the turn, coaxed around the bend while tipping two wide, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch,

Footnotes
SHERLYN GO GO set the pace under pressure from GYPSY LYNN early, maintained a short lead two wide into the lane, shook free in upper stretch and
drew off. GYPSY LYNN pressed the pace from outside into and around the bend, came three wide into the lane, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch
and stayed on to secure second. ON PURPOSE stalked the top pair from outside up the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and lacked a response
when called upon. AWESOME TAYLOR settled at the back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to threaten. BACK ON THE STREET raced
outside rivals in the second flight, took the turn four wide and could not make an impact. SUGAR SUGAR sat off the pace, rounded the bend two wide and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
AVENUE bumped with outer rival at the start, unhurried in the beginning, moved closer from inside on the backstretch, pushed on through the far turn,
tipped out at the top of the lane and lacked a bid. CASH EQUITY (FR) got bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, moved out three deep on the
backstretch, chased three then two wide around that bid, bid outside the leader in upper stretch, got floated out by that rival through the lane and lacked the
needed late punch to go by. ALIGATO settled outside a rival early then moved over to the inside on the clubhouse turn, went between foes in the middle
stages, roused two to three wide on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and flattened. CARMELITA'S MAN raced off the pace and moved inside, tipped two
wide around the clubhouse turn, trailed into the far turn, navigated that turn three then two wide and could not threaten. PERCOLATE (IRE) bobbled leaving
the gate, showed early speed then ceded command to TIO MAGICO and stalked from inside, roused on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TIO
MAGICO dueled briefly then cleared and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged by CASH EQUITY (FR) in upper stretch, drifted out while
maintaining a short lead through the lane and gamely prevailed.

Footnotes
DON'T BRING CRAZY stalked from inside, waited for room to open on the turn, tipped out to the two path for a clear run but ran into traffic briefly at the
quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch and drew away under mild urging. CRITICISM broke well, raced up close five deep
into the turn, vied three deep then led three wide outside a rival into the lane, overtaken by DON'T BRING CRAZY in upper stretch and stayed on to prove
second best. PETITE ANGE stalked off the inside, had to steady into the turn, rallied three, four, then five wide around the bend but flattened in the furlong
grounds. WE'LL DO IT LIVE broke a step slow, vied four deep between up the backstretch, fought in the two path through the turn and weakened in the
lane. SHE'S MY NIECE showed speed three deep between rivals, got bothered past the three-eighths pole, went five wide into the lane and came up
empty. BLISSTERINTHESUN got bumped leaving the gate, vied for the lead from inside then inched ahead up the backstretch, fought with outer rivals
around the turn, chased those rivals into the lane and weakened. STORMY GAL broke in and bumped, vied between foes to the turn, dropped back around
the bend and tired.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS DANZING stalked in the two path into the turn, launched a bid from outside at the quarter pole, fought between rivals in the lane and dug in the
final sixteenth to prove best. QUEEN OF POMPEII stalked four deep then had to take hold briefly when running up on heels, stalked four wide into the turn,
bid three deep at the quarter pole, battled down the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. SONG OF SHADOWS sped clear quickly, moved inside for the
turn, met the bid from outer rivals at the quarter pole, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late. GOLDEN AGAIN stalked the pace from
inside into and around the bend, roused in the lane and could not summon the needed late kick. SENSIBLE MOVE stalked between rivals, bumped with
inner foe approaching the turn, ran two to three wide around the bend, moved out for a clear run and kept on while needing to find more late. ROMAN
EMPRESS stalked between foes, bumped with SENSIBLE MOVE nearing the turn, steered to the inside, angled out across the dirt and lacked a rally.
DON'T JU FORGET broke a step slow and inward, raced off the pace two wide into the turn, came out across the dirt and failed to menace. HOT ROD
MAMA came in early, lagged behind to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BLESSED ANGEL broke out and brushed with outer rival, showed speed inside BLACKENED then switched to the outside to give chase, drew alongside
and headed that rival on the turn, fought two wide to the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and drew away. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ lacked early
speed, trailed on the inside then two wide on the turn, moved in at the eighth pole, steered back out some and closed belatedly to nail BLACKENED for
second. BLACKENED cleared inner rival and crossed to the inside, dueled with BLESSED ANGLE around the bend, could not keep pace with the winner at
the furlong marker and got nailed for second. ILA VEIW TOO chased two wide into the turn, traveled between runners around the bend, asked right handed
three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. LIKE NO OTHER brushed from inside at the start, chased three deep between rivals into and around the
bend and lacked a rally. PAID IN GOLD stumbled a bit while breaking quickest then dropped back to a tracking position four deep, remained four wide
through the turn and came up empty in the lane. ROPERS N WRANGLERS stalked the pace from inside, moved out in the lane and weakened.
