Footnotes
MARTINI MARTIN was bumped at the start, settled on the inside, advanced in hand on the turn, shifted out to make a four wide bid off the bend, was given
one pop right handed with the crop by the furlong marker and responded well to draw clear, then widened the margin while being wrapped up the final
sixteenth of a mile, speed to spare. ASSUME NOTHING dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the bend, but was headed by
the winner nearing the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. WICKED SECRET was reserved early, saved
ground on the turn and made a inside bid off the bend, but flattened out in the final furlong, bested rest. AGARRAMESIPUEDES broke in at the start
bumping a rival, then settled early, three wide into the lane and had no rally. KING COVEE was bumped hard at the start, reserved early, four wide on the
turn and came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. MIDNIGHT RENEGADE was sandwiched and squeezed back at the start, then raced
between rivals and lacked a rally. JOLLY BY GOLLY dueled for the lead on the outside and tired. LABARDE showed brief speed and stopped, eased in the
lane, walked off.

out three wide leaving the turn but had no late kick. SUPER BOURBON was well placed on the inside, then steadied slightly nearing the half mild marker,

FOOLISH GHOST was close up early, then rated two wide, eased out and made a four wide move on the turn, then was given one pop right handed with
the crop and responded well and drew clear, then was ridden out to prove best. CHIEF RON was off a step slow, then went up to press the pace from the
outside, then was three to four wide deep on the turn, then kept on well but proved to be no match for the winner, second best. PRESIDENT Z vied for the
lead on the inside and faded in the lane, held show award. INDIAN LAKE vied for the lead in between rivals and faded in the lane, missed show award.
MOJOVATION was reserved early on the inside, swung out six wide leaving the turn but had no significant rally. SURPRISE HELLO was close up early
from between rivals before weakening.

TYRANT was reserved early, came three wide into the lane, angled out nearing the furlong marker and closed well. SPOILS OF WAR stalked the early pace
in between rivals, shuffled back on the turn, then came again late. FORGOTTEN GIFT was well placed early on the inside, then was two wide off the turn to
have aim on the front runner but faded. JOB'S NOT FINISHED lacked a serious rally. VIXSINZKELTKBANSHE chased the pace on the inside and
weakened. PALMARY was bumped at the start, then chased the pace on the outside on the turn and tired.

ANONYMOUSLY was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, waited for racing room and then made a inside bid in the lane to edge
clear to prove best, driving. BRZINA set the early pace while clear on the inside, two wide into the lane and dug in gamely in the drive but could not hold off
the winner while saving the place award. ROYAL WHISPER was reserved early, advanced on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, came widest
into the lane and closed well. MY FLICKER tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the bend to loom boldly but flattened out the final
furlong. KINGDOM QUEEN was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn but weakened in the drive. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH stumbled leaving the
starting gate and was outrun.. MATTITUDE chased the early pace in between rivals and weakened. ORGANIZED CHAOS stumbled at the start, showed
good speed after recovering and stalked the pace two wide and then was empty.

Footnotes
RENNIE was allowed to settle early, advanced in hand on the turn and eased out to circle the field five wide off the bend to take over, then was given a
vigorous hand ride to remain clear to the wire to prove best. THE LAST JUMPSTART was settled back early, shifted out and advanced two wide on the turn,
came three wide into the lane and then angled out to close well on the outside. WEST STAR was void of early speed, advanced on the inside on the turn,
angled out in the lane and rallied well late. THUNDERHOUSE tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out in the final
furlong. FUN COAST set the pace on the inside and weakened in the lane. GREAT KOSTAS lacked a serious rally. MOONSET stalked the early pace and
made a two wide bid on the turn but then was empty. WAR ROCKET was bumped at the start, then raced three to four wide on the turn, came five wide off
the bend and then lugged in while racing greenly, no factor. LIL BUDDY was through early.
