Footnotes
DIVINE CROSS coaxed from the gate, raced four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to take
command when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was bumped twice by IRISH JACKSON
coming inwards a furlong out, had that rival get on near even terms before digging in gamely to rebuff the challenge and prevail at the end. IRISH JACKSON
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, rallied coming inwards and bumping the aforementioned foe twice a furlong out and got on near even terms a sixteenth from home before being
repelled in the late stages. DOLCE SERA seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. BUSTIN HOT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path,
tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing near the the five-sixteenths under challenge to the outside, got displaced from command at that station and
spun two to three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. PROPER GRAMMAR chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking inside through the turn getting put to coaxing at the three-eighths, went two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened.

Footnotes
SISTER LINDA went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival, moved clear late on the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the
turn, responded well when set down after turning into the stretch and held under strong urging. RUN DEVIL prompted the pace on the outside, dropped
back late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch, kept on well in pursuit of the winner into the final
furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the place. MIA BEA STAR settled just off the pace, dropped back under urging in the two
path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. DISTORTED VIEW broke out at the
start, settled on the outside, was roused in the four path on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TRIPLE P broke out and hit the
gate then dropped back while taken in hand some with the left-rein, moved up under urging to race just off the pace, saved ground under extra left-rein
guidance on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and came up empty. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN dropped well behind under urging, went three then four
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
TOMMY GUN bobbled at the break, showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got headed near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came again to take back narrow command a furlong out, dug
in and gamely held on to prevail on the wire. SIX PERCENT broke a half a beat slow and was paused when losing his lane to the flanking pair of rivals who
each filled the space, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and just missed at the end. QUICKFLASH three wide in pursuit, advanced
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths to take command swing three wide into upper stretch, got headed nearing the eighth pole, dug in fighting on to the
finish briefly between foes before being shaken off in the final strides to the finish. BUSTIN SHOUT broke out at the start, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to the finish. UNFLAPPABLE MAX chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. ALWAYS CHARMING stumbled at the start, chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. UNCLE CURLY bobbled at the break,
chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EMERALD FOREST moved out outside the five-eighths, settled towards the front, angled from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied outside to get
the lead in upper stretch then shook clear outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. LIFE CHANGER was urged along off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and gained willingly for the place. AMUNDSON was hustled from the gate, established a good
position just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, came off the rail into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. SCILLY CAY dropped well
back, came under urging late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and improved position to just miss the show. JEFF FA FA bumped
with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue near
the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. ROYAL TRYST was forced out at the start then bumped with a foe, raced off the pace
while ridden along, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and was no factor. CLEM LABINE bumped with a foe after the start, was urged along
on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to impact. SEVEN NATION ARMY broke out and bumped with a foe, was eased back a touch while
letting the pacesetter cross in front then tracked that rival on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up
empty.

under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. VINTAGE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then

Footnotes
GUANARE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid inside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the three path
nearing the quarter-pole then came further in while shaking clear into upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. IRIDESCENT was hustled from the
gate, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
quarter-pole and proved no match while well clear for the place. TWO'S A CROWD lost his footing in the hindquarters at the start, was urged along off the
pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn and weakened. TAPORICAL dropped well behind the rest of the field, rounded the
turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. AWESOME FOR SURE clipped heels after the start then was taken up, raced on the
outside under urging, went five then four wide on the turn, came out into upper stretch and capitulated then was reported to have bled. RUNNING LUCKY
had AWESOME FOR SURE clip his heels after the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while asked for more on the turn and
faded.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC DREAMS was hustled from the gate, went three then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the
backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, was carried out near the eighth-pole, led narrowly in the final furlong
and gamely prevailed. MISTICAL CURLIN was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, went two then three wide on the first turn, was rated off the
pace, moved out inside the five-eighths, was asked in the four path on the far turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, was carried out some
near the eighth-pole, fought outside of two opponents to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. SUERTE broke out at the start, went three
wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the advantage leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path for most of the far turn then dropped
to the inside, fought inside of two foes in upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and was outfinished but just held the show. LEADING
CONTENDER stumbled at the start but broke with the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, was well placed while rated just off the
pace, came under urging in the two path on the final turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the leading trio in the drive and finished willingly to
just miss the show. BOLD VICTORY dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, went two then three wide under urging on
the far turn and was no factor. BILLIEVE IN JOSH was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the advantage leaving the backstretch and
stopped then was distanced in the stretch.
