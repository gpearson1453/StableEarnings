Footnotes
HERD IMMUNITY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and gained ground steadily to get up for the win late. STARBURST dueled on the outside up the backstretch, pulled clear while saving ground
around the bend and kept on to the wire, getting caught in the final strides. WEST WARPATH chased the leader through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch, no match for the top two. GALLANT STAR raced off the pace through the early going,
trailed the field while saving ground around the turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and passed tiring horses from there. HOMEVIEW dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to fade in the stretch. SPECIAL BREED raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside early, continued around the turn in the three path and tired in the lane.

SOUNDS LIKE POWER veered in and bumped hard with the horses to her inside, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and pulled clear. BOBBY TWO SHOT'S dueled on the outside up
the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and could not go with the winner late but chased that rival home. HANDSOME
HAROLD dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, continued to save ground around the bend and dug in in the lane, getting caught in the final
furlong while finishing well. PASS ON NOTHING chased the pace setters up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to the wire.
HOUSE BOURBON tracked the leader on the inside through the early going, continued around the bend in the two path and chased on from there.
TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR bumped an outer rival early on, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and
improved position in the final furlong. ELLS was brushed by an outer foe at the start, then steadied after being forced to bump an inner foe when his outer
counterpart shifted in early on, raced off of the pace in the four to five path and moved up. DEACON JONES stalked the leaders between horses up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and weakened in the stretch. MISTER BANDERAS stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to track the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and tired in the stretch. SPEIGHTFUL ONE bumped soundly with the
horses to both sides at the start, raced at the back of the pack on the rail early, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. A G'S GEM
bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane.
JACKSON D broke half a beat slow, took back after being bumped and put to crowded quarters among rivals early on, trailed in the aftermath and was
outrun thereafter
