Footnotes
DEPOSITION settled inside, awaited room on the final turn to the stretch, split foes near the top of the lane and drew off under moderate pressure. AMORE
D'ORO alternated for the lead outside then came again to gamely gain the place. STANDPOINT stalked the dueling leaders outside, bid to a narrow lead
then weakened. FREE BIRD BORDO vied along the rail to the stretch and faltered. EVASIVE MOVES chased off the pace outside and gave way readily.
MARINE PATROL trailed far behind then caught fading rival. TRAILING MONSTER was urged off the pace three wide and stopped abruptly.

horses, closed willingly to gain command near the sixteenth marker and then held well late, driving. BODE O was outrun early, moved up entering the
stretch, rallied between horses and finished well for the place spot. MIZZEN MAN chased three wide for the opening half mile, came four wide into the
stretch and rallied mildly outside. ON OUR WAY BOYZ dueled two wide for command, dueled on the turn, led into the stretch, dueled and weakened.
BOOM BOOM KABOOM chased four wide, four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. KING OF CHAOS raced off the pace, came
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROCKIN FREEBEE broke a step slow, chased close up on the inside, waited for room at the quarter pole, rallied
on the rail turning for home, bid and tired. ALMOND CIDER dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.

ZUMA split rivals to the lead into the far turn, bid clear and maintained her advantage under moderate urging. NOISY ON THE BAY broke a bit awkwardly,
settled inside, bid on the final turn and proved easily second best. KINDRED HEARTS set a pressured pace inside, faded on the final turn then came again
to gain the show. OVERMUCH stalked the pace four then three wide and proved empty in the stretch. SWEET DISTRACTION broke slowest and was
outrun early then moved extremely wide in the stretch. BOSSY KATE forced the pace outside for half a mile and gave way. LA SIERVA C trailed for three
quarters then caught a stopping rival. MOLLY MALONE saved ground well behind and gave way readily.

BATTER UP BUD raced two wide off the early pace, then inside, moved up inside nearing the quarter pole, rallied on the rail in the stretch run, closed
willingly in the final sixteenth and proved best. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED tracked close up on the inside, angled out on the far turn, came four wide into the
lane, rallied steadily outside, closed well in the final sixteenth and came up second best. CATCH THE SMOKE raced off the pace inside, then stalked two
wide on the backside, bid three wide on the far turn, took over, kicked clear in upper stretch, then weakened late and yielded to the top pair. BEYOND BEST
trailed the field, rode the rail in the stretch, failed to threaten and got up for fourth. HEY PORTER pressed the pace racing close up outside of LIBERTY
STAR, bid two wide, dueled on the far turn, took over and faded in the lane. LIBERTY STAR set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and gave
way.
