Footnotes
MOONSHINE MOLLY was kept close between rivals, moved to the rail into the bend, lost her path and was angled out leaving the turn, rallied two wide the
last eighth and edged ahead inside the final seventy yards. REDHEADEDSTRANGER forwardly placed outside from the beginning, advanced three wide on
the turn, rallied belatedly deep stretch but caught LASTCHANCESALOON for second nearing the wire. LASTCHANCESALOON soon edged ahead for the
lead between rivals, took the rail with two furlongs to go, lengthened command upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth but was easily best
of the rest. BABAS GAL well placed from inside, did not keep up on the bend, angled outside REDHEADEDSTRANGER upper stretch and continued to
yield. RICKY'S PART broke a step slow and somewhat awkwardly and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS away slowly, gradually picked up his pace under hand encouragement, came into contention along the rail on the bend, angled
outside with two furlongs to go, came into the lane from path four, rallied the final furlong, gradually lugged in deep stretch but caught HAND OVER MY
HEART under a well-judged ride. HAND OVER MY HEART fractious in the gate, contested the pace inside rivals from the beginning, edged ahead on the
turn, drew clear upper stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. SPICY DELIGHT vied for the early lead from outside, was three wide
through the bend, angled in some upper stretch, still loomed a threat with a furlong left but leveled off instead. BEST MAN SPEECH was soon far back,
picked up his pace some along the rail on the turn, angled out widest upper stretch and showed some late interest. WILDISH displayed early speed between
rivals but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
FULL MAGAZINE stalked the early speed between rivals, angled in beside MY LITTLE TIPSY on the bend, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the
lane, kept a straight path for the drive and drew off the final sixteenth. MY LITTLE TIPSY bobbled inward at the break, quickly recovered to set a pressured
pace inside horses, was challenged on the turn, floated out to path three into the stretch, was no match for FULL MAGAZINE the last sixteenth, began to
wear down in the waning yards but lasted for the place. STUMP forwardly placed from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, lost time moving outside
FULL MAGAZINE upper stretch then rallied belatedly the last furlong. REMEMBER THE MAINE was a step slow and forced in at the start, settled outside,
advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out to path five for the stretch run and made a strong move the final eighth between rivals. TROY OUNCE
prominent just outside MY LITTLE TIPSY, began to yield on the bend, swung out to path four into the lane and failed to have a late bid. BACKSHOT was
away slowly, raced in contention from inside but began to fade on the turn. INDIAN SIGN was a factor just off the inside but began to yield before finishing
three furlongs.

WILDWOOD ENOUGH shared the lead outside LIMANI, was roused midstretch and drew off as much the best. LIMANI broke on top, shared the lead from
inside, was no match for WILDWOOD ENOUGH inside the final eighth, angled outside the latter nearing the sixteenth marker, drifted out further but was
unchallenged for the place. CLASSY ACTION hesitated then swiped the gate breaking outward, was settled inside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile,
two wide taking the bend, took over third nearing the eighth pole then could only hold her position late. MULSANNE (IRE) chased from outside, advanced
three wide on the turn, drifted out some entering the lane and had no late bid. MOLLY'S TEMPLE in contention early, improved position two wide on the
bend to move clear for third, fanned out some into the stretch and gave way. MO WANNA GO pressed the early pacesetters but faded from inside on the
turn.

Footnotes
CLYDE'S GREEN GO angled out two wide midway on the backstretch, took over when let out on the bend, widened command under urging upper stretch
and was kept to task in the late going. SPAN reluctant to load, was void of speed, though hustled along from inside, angled out to advanced on the turn,
came into the lane from path six, closed well and caught GOD GUNS N GUTS for second. GOD GUNS N GUTS chased while toward the outside on the
backstretch, closed the gap four wide on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch then leveled off in the late going. SHEBA'S PAL was bumped by
RED ROIL then bumped with DENNIS'S PRIDE leaving the chute, chased from between horses, was two wide on the turn, improved position some upper
stretch then also leveled off inside the final furlong. DENNIS'S PRIDE was bumped off stride from the rear at the break then bumped with SHEBA'S PAL,
quickly recovered, steadily angled in as he vied for the lead, soon moved clear, was overtaken from outside on the bend and yielded through the stretch.
RED ROIL was bumped at the start, forced inward and pinched briefly between horses, chased behind GOD GUNS N GUTS, angled in on the turn and
lacked a stretch rally. NOBLE CREEKER raced widest of all and only passed a couple tired rivals deep stretch. ITS MAMBO broke a step slow and inward,
bumped hard with DENNIS'S PRIDE, stayed well off the inside throughout and had little to offer for the drive. LATE BLACKSMITH broke inward, bumping
RED ROIL, pressed the early speed, was three wide taking the turn then gave way between rivals through the lane. PER RULING FROM HIWU, DENNIS'S
PRIDE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME stalked the early speed from just outside, took the lead when allowed on the second bend, moved clear leaving that turn, drifted out under
left-handed pressure upper stretch, held a straight path when switched to right-handed urging, widened command and proved much the best. KEEN
RESPONSE bumped and forced out some at the break, was settled inside, gradually closed the gap on the backstretch and through the second turn, rallied
two wide in the lane and gained second nearing the wire. ZARMAE chased from just off the inside, angled out on the second bend, came into the stretch
from path four, took over second just inside the final sixteenth but was outfinished. CHERNYAHOVSKIY was a brief factor from inside, failed to keep up on
the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, forced out entering the lane, angled out widest upper stretch and showed late interest. PRINCE OF
MAYHEM soon had the lead, showed the way off the rail, was overtaken from outside on the second turn and weakened inside rivals deep stretch.
BOURBON DELIGHT broke outward, bumping KEEN RESPONSE, raced in contention from outside, moved to the inside with a half mile to go, floated out
leaving the second bend and faded between horses.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD rated off the pace, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, took over nearing the sixteenth marker and
drew off. FEVER NATION prominent from outside, moved clear for second just off the rail on the turn, stayed outside CAMPISI into the lane, floated out
some upper stretch, was relegated to third approaching the sixteenth marker, regained the place with fifty yards left and narrowly held his position. TRY TRY
AGAIN forwardly placed from inside, angled out some after two furlongs, came into the stretch behind CAMPISI, tried to gain a clear path to make his bid
between the latter and FEVER NATION inside the last eighth, was checked briefly when his path narrowed in the waning yards then altered in to split rivals
in the final strides. MON AMI FUZZIE pressed from between horses, did not keep up after a quarter mile, angled in midway on the turn and found best stride
too late along the rail in the stretch. VIOLENZA D'ORO trailed from well off the inside, stayed in path four through the bend then made a strong but too late
move the last eighth. CAMPISI edged ahead from between horses nearing the end of a quarter mile, drew clear and took the rail into the turn, came off the
rail some entering the lane and wore down two wide inside the final furlong. ONE PUTT RICHIE displayed early speed between rivals, gained the rail
nearing the bend, began to yield on the turn, was steadied briefly when his path was taken midway on the bend and continued to fade.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY made a small leap from the gate, advanced from outside to share the lead outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS on the second bend, moved
ahead when roused two wide with a quarter mile to go, was clear entering the lane, began to drift out upper stretch, steadily lengthened her lead while still
drifting out, held a straight path inside the last sixteenth and proved much the best. LIFE OF SATURDAYS bumped with JERSEY GOLD at the break, vied
for the early lead outside THINK BLUE, moved ahead on the backstrech, was challenged from outside on the second turn, was no match for BEIRUT
BEAUTY when set down for the drive, gradually drifted out the final furlong but was unchallenged for second. THINK BLUE also bumped with JERSEY
GOLD at the start, contested the pace from inside, began to yield before finishing a half mile, angled out on the second bend, came into the stretch from
path four and could only pull away for third in the late going. MIKE'S LADY broke inward, chased from paths three or four and failed to menace. JERSEY
GOLD was bumped from both sides at the break and never a factor in a ground-saving trip. HARD LIKE HOLLY a step slow at the start, altered in abruptly
to avoid MIKE'S LADY, was then checked behind traffic and showed little.

Footnotes
BEEASY stalked the early speed from just outside, took the advantage on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, under urging in the lane and proved much
the best. CRANKSHAFT set a pressured pace from path three, moved to the rail into the turn, was overtaken, no match for BEEASY in the stretch but was
unchallenged for the place. SANTINO'S FANTASY was checked briefly behind BLOOMING GARDEN nearing the end of the first furlong, altered out, just off
the inside on the bend, swung out widest into the stretch and gained third late. BUREAU was away slowly, advanced from outside to be a contender on the
backstretch but began to fade four wide on the turn. LONESOME DREAM threw his head up just before the gate opened and was off somewhat slowly,
progressed from inside on the bend then leveled off. LAYTON THE DAY forwardly placed between horses, stayed in path three through the turn and
flattened out for the drive. BLOOMING GARDEN moved to the inside before finishing the first eighth of a mile and steadily faded soon after.
