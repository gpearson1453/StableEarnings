Footnotes
PLANET FROLIC settled off the rail the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep approaching the quarter pole,
drifted into the lane but dueled clear toward mid-stretch and was taken in hand late. VIENNA'S TWIRL surged clear and moved to the inside to rate the
pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but dropped
back nearing mid-stretch and settled for second best. I LOVE MARIA settled inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. BEST WORST IDEA rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. DREAM OF GOLD broke a step slow then lunged
from the gate and saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. NINETY
PROOF veered out leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the three path and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but showed little
response. IVY WAY ducked in leaving the gate and rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
IHEARTRAINACOMN rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, briefly ceded the nod
to SPARKLEINYOUREYE approaching the quarter pole but recovered the advantage past the eighth pole and was steadily handled in the lane. The latter
stalked off the rail, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and took a brief lead two deep nearing the quarter, was caught passing the eighth pole
and relented in the duel through the stretch. PHILMARY CASTLE rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in through the stretch to hold third. KAALA stalked from the four path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. NEW AGE BAD GIRL saved ground on
the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. LUZIA rounded the opening turn in
the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. O K SMARTY PANTS closed to contention while tapering in and stalked two deep, took a
brief lead into the backstretch, gave chase from that point then faded off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
KARMA BUS was hustled to contention inside and raced with the pace, raced at the rail on the turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole and held well under
steady handling. MAGICAL SURPRISE veered out leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and dug in to take second the final yards.
EL PACHO raced with the pace through the backstretch, raced at even terms two deep on the turn but dropped back entering the stretch and ceded second
in late yards. GOLDEN ARROW gave chase, raced in the four and five paths on the turn, left the turn outside and passed some rivals. BORN TO SIN gave
chase then faded off the rail on the turn. S S MIRAGE broke a step slow, gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened
in the lane. DONNIE B saved ground. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul for alleged interference through the turn, lodged by the rider of El
Pacho, against the rider of Karma Bus.

BLUE TWIRLIN stalked off the rail the first turn and drew to even terms leaving the half mile pole, dueled for the nod past the five sixteenths, contested the
advantage two deep on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. SKYLAR'S SISTER rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, then dueled for second nearing mid-stretch. MARTHARITA settled
in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and came along for third inside
the sixteenth pole. SUPERSNAKE rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. WICKED SAUCY rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up the lead passing the five sixteenths
pole, raced close at the rail through the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. THE MONEY MACHINE rounded the opening turn about the five path,
gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but flattened stride on the far turn. BLUESKYSLOOKINATME stalked from the four path the first turn, moved

MINISTRY OF MAGIC settled off the pace in the four path the first turn, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far
turn three wide and dug in to edge out REMYS SHOWTIME through later yards. The latter stalked from the three path, challenged Colt Rock toward the
seven sixteenths pole, took the nod two deep at the quarter pole, raced clear into the lane but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. ROCKIN THE
PALACE settled off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
seven path and dug in widest to take third under the wire. MACHEN'S RIDGE was unprepared for the break then saved ground, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, left the turn between horses and finished evenly but was nipped from third under the wire. TIMMY saved
ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but raced hemmed in past the quarter, raced near the rail on the far turn and
showed little further. COLT ROCK took the lead while tapering in and rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of Remys Showtime leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, gave the nod to that one at the rail at the quarter pole and flattened inside the eighth pole. MAKOTO rated close inside on the first turn,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. CHANGE YOUR LUCK rounded the opening turn in the four path,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
INDIANA RED saved ground well off the pace, gave chase leaving the first turn and steadily improved, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady handling to get up the final yards. MONTAUK DADDY stalked off the rail then challenged approaching the five sixteenths pole, took the nod
approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear into the lane but was caught flattening stride the final yards. PROTA rated the pace inside, dug in to the
challenge of Montauk Daddy nearing the five sixteenths pole, ceded to that one at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back into the lane and flattened
the final sixteenth. ELVIRUS settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the turn about the four path and ran
evenly in the lane. NEWS BOX saved early ground then gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the
stretch. NOTION TO TAPIT raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the six path and showed little in the lane. TOP OF THE MINT broke through the gate prior the break, raced in the three path the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. CRIMSON ROCKET rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn. PRINCE OF FENTON raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then
weakened at the rail on the far turn. HEY CONGRATS stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
into the far turn.
