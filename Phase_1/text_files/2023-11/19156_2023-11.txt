path, three path on the last turn while in gear, reached the leader, took the advantage and was no match late. BENCH WALK Tracked four wide, command
on the last turn, was hooked and stayed on well. MO DANCIN In hand four wide, gained five wide into the last turn, chased and weakened. NO LIME Broke
slow, five wide on the turns, was no a threat. BLOOD MOON Set the pace along the rail, was hooked and gave way. STARINTHEMAKING Broke slow,
three path on the turns, was not a factor. THAT'S MY BUSINESS Tracked along the three path and was done on the last turn.
