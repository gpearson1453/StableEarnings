Footnotes
FORDY G hustled leaving the break and assumed command in the early going, set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out fast fractions while pressed to
the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew clear heading to the furlong marker, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in
deep stretch to prevail. ONE BIG SMILE broke alertly, took back off of the solid early pace and tracked three wide into the turn, raced close up to the pace
three wide heading to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, re-rallied in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely
in the end for second. R HEART OF GOLD chased the solid early pace, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final
sixteenth and got up in the final strides to secure third. ZEE CARROT EAGLE tracked the early pace from a three wide position, shifted to the two path into
the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, chased FORDY G to mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outfinished for
third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased three wide along the turn and offered a mild late rally. WOLF'S LIFE lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch
and did not factor. BIG IRISH asked for speed in the early stages, pressed the solid pace from the inside and kept pressure on FORDY G to the quarter
marker, lost position into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
THE CALABRESE KID sent leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, was engaged by POUR ON THE COLE into the backstretch run
and set a prompted pace to the half-mile marker, carved out moderate fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, drifted to the two path into upper
stretch, met the bid of ATTENZIONE to mid-stretch, lost the lead to that rival at the furlong marker, battled with ATTENZIONE while drifting into the final
sixteenth, determinedly came again in deep stretch and outfinished the runner-up in the final strides to prevail. ATTENZIONE rated nicely off of the early
pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground heading to the far turn,
mounted an inside bid nearing the quarter marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with THE CALABRESE KID to mid-stretch and took a
narrow lead at the furlong marker, dueled into the final sixteenth and held a slim lead in deep stretch, was outfinished by the determined winner in the final
strides and held clearly for second. GALLANT WARREN settled in the second flight early on, advanced into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate
pace outside of rivals, was well placed four wide into the far turn, maintained that four wide path into the stretch, could not muster the needed response in
deep stretch and was outkicked, while holding safely at the finish for third. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) allowed to settle, saved ground into the first turn then
was guided to the three path into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, inched closer while two wide along the far turn and
continued his gain into the stretch, could not sustain his bid into the final sixteenth and flattened in deep stretch. BROKEN FINGER away in good order and
was prominent in the early stages, shifted three wide into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, bid three wide
approaching the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and gave way. POUR ON THE COLE asked for early speed and stalked the pace three wide
into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, continued to pressure the pacesetter into the far
turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLASSY CITY stumbled at the start then was content to track behind the moderate pace set by AUTISM INCLUSION, stayed towards the inside then got
stuck behind horse on the far turn, had to check while full of run between the five-sixteenths and quarter poles, still had to wait for room turning into the
stretch, got loose, surged ahead and won clear. DIAMOND CONCERTO last away, bided time near the rear of the pack, made steady forward progress
down the backstretch while racing three wide, continued to race out in the clear through the turn, attempted to keep CLASSY CITY from getting out at the
top of the stretch then could not match strides with that foe in the final furlong. UNCLE LEON showed some good speed from the break but was keen and
hard to place going into the clubhouse turn, went to press AUTISM INCLUSION on the lead while the rider kept a measured half length or so behind that
rival, then was set down at the quarter pole, took over the lead at the top of the stretch ran on well but was unable to hold off the top two but finished well
clear of the next horse. AUTISM INCLUSION was able to secure the lead without being asked, then had to deal with UNCLE LEON stalking just off the flank
but not pressing the issue, was allowed to set fairly moderate fractions to the far turn, gave way at the quarter pole when that foe mounted a serious
challenge at the quarter pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch. CORAL CAT was outrun into the first turn then took up a tracking position behind the
two leaders, held the rail to the far turn, was unable to quicken with the rest passing the three furlong marker and chased the rest of the field to the finish.

Footnotes
RICH GOLD away slowly and was allowed to settle in the early going, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground and
improved position into the far turn, was taken off of the rail and was roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, floated out BALLROOM PRINCE
approaching the top of the lane, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch, confronted IMPACT ZONE and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, dueled
to the sixteenth-pole, repelled the runner-up into deep stretch and kicked clear to prevail. IMPACT ZONE forwardly placed leaving the start and tracked
three wide into the first turn, rated into the backstretch and tracked the moderate pace from the second flight, was roused into the far turn and mounted a
three then four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, met the bid of RICH GOLD and battled with that rival to the furlong
marker, dueled to the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and was well clear of the rest for second. SKY DINSKI was
forwardly placed leaving the start and tracked the pace into the first turn, shifted to the three path into the backstretch and stalked the moderate pace to the
half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide and between runners into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, was asked for more into the
stretch and chased the top two to the furlong grounds, could not impact the top pair in the final stages and held for third at the finish. BALLROOM PRINCE
was allowed to settle and raced two wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and tracked four wide to the half-mile marker, shifted to the
two path heading into the far turn and gained ground approaching the quarter pole, was floated five wide nearing the top of the lane, recovered and shifted
to the three path into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and just missed for third.
HICKORY WIND settled along the inside to begin, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the far turn,
gained ground nearing the quarter marker then came in tight heading into upper stretch, was boxed in to the furlong marker, found room into deep stretch
and did not offer a late response. MEDAL ICE was prominent away from the start and raced close up to the early pace, advanced into the backstretch run
and contested the decent pace outside of SGT POWELL heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace two wide into the far turn, could not keep pace
into upper stretch and tired in the lane. SGT POWELL away in good order and was hustled to establish the early lead, showed the way along the first turn
then was engaged by MEDAL ICE and contested decent fractions with that rival to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace into the second turn, was
overtaken in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AUTISM BLUE was hustled from the gate, cleared the field, then angled over towards the inside and hooked up on the early pace with SCHOCHOH, pulled
away from that one approaching the three furlong pole, then easily repelled a bid near the quarter pole from STAND TO, opened up a clear lead in the
stretch when set down, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held safely in a drive to prevail. COBRA JET got pinballed twice after the break, recovered
well then took up a tracking position behind the dueling leaders, made some forward progress through the turn racing in the two path, was looking to swing
wide in the stretch but found room on the inside, ran on under some urging and was gaining ground approaching the wire. HANDSOME GARY was outrun
from the break, made a middle move through the turn to get into contention came into the stretch in the four path and produced a late rally to gain third.
STAND TO broke in and bumped with COBRA JET after the break then was allowed to settle into stride and rushed up to join the dueling leaders on the
turn, got within a length of AUTISM BLUE at the top of the stretch then came under pressure and weakened. AWESOME DUDE trailed the field through the
early going, switch off the rail and out to the three path for clear run down the backstretch, remained three to four wide through the turn while attempting to
mount a rally, swung into the stretch in the five to six path but was unable to improve position but did pass one in the stretch. SCHOCHOH broke out into
COBRA JET at the start, then hustled to the front and engaged on the early pace with AUTISM BLUE, was unable to keep up after passing the three furlong
marker and faded.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY broke alertly and was prominent to begin, tracked the solid early pace then advanced to press SMILIN EVIE into the turn, maintained a
two wide path into the bend and pressured SMILIN EVIE to the quarter marker, overtook that rival into upper stretch, took command and was set down
heading to the furlong marker, was kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, dug in in deep stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted for the win at
the finish. MARY MARGARET took back off of the decent early pace, was well placed into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, maintained
that three wide path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, mounted a three wide rally and closed willingly in deep stretch, pressured the winner
in the final strides and missed for the win, while holding safely for second. DON'T TELL HYDEE prominent away from the start and contested the solid early
pace, took back and stalked the leading pair into the turn, lost position along the bend and waited for racing room approaching the quarter pole, tipped two
wide for the stretch drive, re-rallied and came within range at the furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth, was outfinished by her stablemate for
second in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. LION'S LAIR stalked the solid early pace, went three wide into the turn and gained ground
approaching the quarter marker, chased three wide into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth and was outkicked in
deep stretch. TRULY FABULOUS rated off of the solid early pace, raced three wide into the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker,
mounted a four wide bid into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, needed more in the final stages and offered a mild late rally. NAN ELIZABETH
allowed to settle away from the start, chased from the inside along the turn, angled three wide approaching the furlong marker, offered a mild late rally but
did not threaten in the late stages. SMILIN EVIE hard sent leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set a solid pace while pressed into
the turn, slowed the down the pace along the bend and maintained a narrow lead heading to the quarter pole, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
MY BUCKET LIST settled well off the pace mid-pack down the backstretch, was set down and put into a drive from the three furlong pole, swung five wide
into the stretch, was full of run at the furlong grounds, took command into deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages. AS LUCK HAPPENS was quick
away from the break and sent to the front, then allowed to set an uncontested lead through reasonable fractions took on and repelled a challenge from
MAVERICK ROSE approaching the quarter pole, opened up in the stretch then could not hold off the late bid of MY BUCKET LIST while finishing well clear
of the next horse. CARDINAL TRICK veered in and bumped WESTERN SIERRA at the start, then raced six wide down the backstretch, made some forward
progress through the turn while under a drive, came into the stretch four wide then shifted out a path for clear run, produced a mild rally while lugging in and
managed to gain the show. STOUT outrun early, the was ridden to regain contact with the field while saving ground through the turn, kept on under strong
handling and was gaining some late but was never a serious threat. I AM AMADEO was forced into the gap after the break when FIINCAIRN came over
sharply, then rushed up into contention and was inside of the group chasing AS LUCK HAPPENS through the early fractions, lost position into the stretch
and gave way. WESTERN SIERRA was bumped hard by MY CARDINAL TRICK at the break, raced five wide down the backstretch but close to the group
tracking the early leader, was put into a drive with three furlongs to run and responded with a sweeping move into contention around the turn, loomed a
threat to mid-stretch but flattened out late. MAVERICK ROSE broke in at the break and bumped lightly with MY BUCKET LIST, was between horses in the
group chasing the pacesetter through the first quarter mile, set off alone to challenge AS LUCK HAPPENS when that one tried to open up on the field
passing the three furlong marker, had the bid rebuffed at the three-sixteenths pole then flattened out in deep stretch. CALLUM broke slowly, was void of
early speed from the gate, raced greenly into the turn, rode the rail to the stretch and did not factor. FINCAIRN veered in sharply at the break and forced I
AM AMADEO into the gap, rushed into contention and was in the middle of a group of horses chasing the pacesetter, came under pressure passing the
five-sixteenths pole and hung in to mid-stretch but weakened in final furlong.

Footnotes
DELUSIVELY had her head turned at the start and was off slowly, settled three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path while unhurried through
the backstretch run, improved position into the far turn and was roused three wide heading to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the lane and
continued to advance at mid-stretch, responded to urging inside of the furlong marker, closed fast in the final sixteenth and came within aim in deep stretch,
surged in the final strides and got up on the wire to determinedly prevail. MY YAMMY LADY allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, tracked
the decent pace from the inside through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and rallied
approaching the furlong marker, tipped two wide at mid-stretch and loomed nearing the sixteenth-pole, took command into deep stretch, was tagged on the
wire for the win and held for second in a game runner-up effort. VRONSKY FEINT away in good order, conceded the early lead and stalked ALFONSIA into
the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the decent pace to the half-mile marker, pressed ALFONSIA into the far turn and took
command into the stretch, was set down at the furlong marker and held foes at bay to the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken in deep stretch by MY YAMMY
LADY, was outfinished by the top two in the final strides and held clearly for third in a good effort. SHEZARUNAWAY allowed to settle and raced two wide
and between runners into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run and improved position heading to the half-mile pole, raced two
wide into the far turn and continued a steady gain to the quarter marker, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and continued her advance at the
furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch but was gaining in the final stages. STREET SHADOW forwardly placed away from the start,
settled in the second flight and saved ground along the first turn, was well placed while tracking the decent pace from the inside approaching the half-mile
marker, saved ground into the far turn and raced within aim heading to the quarter pole, angled three then four wide into the stretch and improved position at
the furlong grounds, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened. CAROLE LOMBARD prominent leaving the start and tracked the early
pace four wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run while outside of runners, maintained that four wide path into the far
turn and raced within aim at the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and got caught in a bit of traffic at the furlong grounds, offered a mild late rally in
the final sixteenth but needed more. ALFONSIA asked for speed away from the start, cleared to the rail and assumed command into the first turn, was
engaged by VRONSKY FEINT into the backstretch run and set prompted fractions to the half-mile pole, carved out a decent pace while pressured into the
far turn, lost the lead to VRONSKY FEINT in upper stretch, chased that foe to the furlong marker, lacked a response in the late stages and faded. MOMMA
MOCCA rated off of the early pace and tracked two wide into the first turn, shifted to the three path into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to
the half-mile marker, went two wide into the far turn, came in tight midway through the turn and steadied approaching the quarter pole, shifted three wide
into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. HOLY ZAGS broke a half-step slowly, rushed up in the early stages and
stalked two wide and between runners into the first turn, shifted to the three path into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile pole,
chased three wide along the second turn, dropped back nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
HYDRO FROST was outrun to the first turn but pulled hard under a stout hold from the rider, lurked just behind the dueling pacesetters to the far turn,
squeezed through a tight spot near the seven-sixteenths marker to get clear run going into the far turn, then was let loose passing the three furlong marker,
set down at the top of the stretch, quickly pulled clear of the field and won wrapped up at the wire. BID ON THE PRIZE steadied after the break to avoid
INCREDIBLE SHOT, then immediately angled to the rail, saved all the ground to the stretch, had to wait for room passing the three-sixteenths pole, got
clear and responded to intermittent urging to gain second while no match for the winner. J D'S RUDE BOY was not pushed for speed from the gate and held
back to avoid getting caught very wide on the first turn, was still caught three to four wide, then made steady forward progress down the backstretch, started
a rally on the far turn but was still last at the quarter pole, went eight wide turning into the stretch and responded to strong handling to gain third. J C'S A
LEGEND became rank after the break and had to be steadied hard going into the first turn to avoid running up heels, continued to fight the rider through the
turn the first part of the backstretch run, settled down passing the five furlong pole and kept to the inside while moving up into contention through the far
turn, idled a bit while boxed in then found a seam at the three-sixteenths pole, kept to task under steady handling, finishing evenly. MOONRISE DRIVE was
allowed to settle mid-pack through the early stages, lacked the room to make a move on the far turn then tipped out about six wide for the stretch run,
responded to strong handling but needed more. INCREDIBLE SHOT broke in and caused a chain reaction to the outside, then was unhurried and settled
near the rear of the field through the early going, saved ground through the first turn then gradually got closer to the leaders on the run down the
backstretch, was stuck behind horses through the far turn but waited patiently for some racing room, opted to stay towards the inside, was unable to get
clear until mid-stretch made a mild late run. THREEBROTHERS broke well and was able to seize the rail going into the clubhouse turn, was pressed to the
far turn by OH GREAT (IRE) while taking turn on the lead, matched strides with that one turning for home, battled to mid-stretch but tired from earlier efforts
and faded late. OH GREAT (IRE) was sent hard from the gate but allowed THREE BROTHERS to slip through along the rail, then traded blows with that
one alternating the lead down the backstretch and through the far turn, came into the stretch heads apart but weakened mid stretch and could not keep
pace in the late stages. GONNA GETCHA GOOD raced forwardly and was within striking distance of the leaders to the quarter pole then was outrun down
the stretch. CUT ACROSS SHORTY race near the back in tandem with INCREDIBLE SHOT through the first half-mile, made some steady forward progress
