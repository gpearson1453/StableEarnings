Footnotes
STORM BORN rated off the early speed, picked up his pace after a half mile, saved ground on the second bend, angled two wide upper stretch and edged
ahead of BLOOMING GARDEN nearing the wire under a well-judged ride. BLOOMING GARDEN hesitated at the break, split rivals into the first turn, drew
away from the field soon after and gradually wore down along the rail the last two furlongs. MAPACHE G moved to the outside on the backstretch, lost
ground widest through the second bend, altered in sharply midstretch and got up for third nearing the wire. OKLAHOMA HEAT settled just off the inside,
also commenced his bid after a half mile, was three to five wide taking the second turn, angled out further midstretch then rallied belatedly. SAFE closest to
the early leader, reached a striking position just off the inside on the second bend, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the last eighth and finished
evenly. MARCHING ORDERS moved to the inside on the backstretch and failed to have a significant stretch response.

Footnotes
GREAT PLAINES shared the early lead between rivals, moved clear and took the inside on the bend, floated out some midstretch, began to wear down in
the late going but lasted for the win. LIMA ZULU vied for the lead inside GREAT PLAINES on the backstretch, did not keep up after a quarter mile, angled
outside the latter leaving the turn, rallied deep stretch but was too late. PERFECT WAGER was away slowly, gradually progressed along the rail, closed well
but also came up a bit short. READTHETRANSCRIPT without early speed, commenced his bid two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run,
surged the last furlong and was boxed in behind rivals in the waning yards. BAM BAM CAM forwardly placed, lost ground four wide through the turn, rallied
the final furlong and lugged in some deep stretch. TRIPLE CHROME was prominent toward the outside, three wide taking the bend then flattened out the
last two furlongs. JOEY B stayed off the inside and failed to menace. WARNING LABEL gave way from outside after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
MINI DRESS picked up her pace two wide on the bend, angled outside VIVA VIOLENCE upper stretch, continued her bid the last eighth and got up in time
under a well-judged ride. VIVA VIOLENCE shared the early lead between horses, moved clear and stayed just off the rail on the turn, lengthened command
in the lane, could not hold back MINI DRESS in the waning yards but was easily second best. DEAUVILLE MIST forwardly placed from outside, was four
wide on the bend, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the stretch, rallied inside the last furlong and was drifting out again in the waning yards.
BAILESTON LASSIE chased from well off the inside, advanced four wide on the turn, angled outside HIDDEN FIGURE upper stretch and made up minor
ground the final eighth. BEING CREATIVE far back early, picked up her pace while saving ground through the bend, steadily angled out in the stretch and
passed outside tired ones in the late going. RANK AND FILE chased from outside then began to fade three wide on the turn. BOBBIE TOO TOO contested
the pace from inside but began to yield before finishing a half mile. NIFF moved toward the inside early on and gave way along the rail on the bend.
HIDDEN FIGURE fractious in the gate, displayed early speed outside VIVA VIOLENCE but quit from between rivals in the lane.

Footnotes
ARROW STRIKE prominent from inside, altered outside PAYNT BY LETTERS upper stretch, took the lead with a sixteenth left and drew clear as he drifted
out in the late going. PAYNT BY LETTERS reluctant to load, soon had a clear lead once the race began, showed the way just off the inside, did not have
enough left deep stretch but was clearly second best. IZEONDEC in reserve the first quarter mile, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch,
circled outside rivals on the second bend, angled in beside PAYNT BY LETTERS nearing the quarter pole, began to yield at the top of the lane, altered out
some when ARROW STRIKE came close upper stretch and continued to fade. PATH TO SUCCESS bumped at the break, was boxed in behind PAYNT BY
LETTERS in the early going, swung out leaving the second turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. SMILE LIKE KYLE broke inward, bumping PATH
TO SUCCESS, raced in contention between rivals but began to fade on the second bend. MERLOTTI four wide on the first turn, pressed the early speed
from outside but yielded between horses on the second turn. PER HISA RULING DATED 11/7/23 RECEIVED FROM THE FANDUEL BOARD OF
STEWARDS, IZEONDEC WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM ALL PURSE MONEY FOR A RIDING CROP VIOLATION.

Footnotes
STOSH progressed three wide on the bend, lost some ground staying outside SCARLET CITY into the lane, edged ahead upper stretch, lugged in some
with a furlong to go, was challenged from inside after entering the final furlong, battled on even terms deep stretch and got the nod at the wire. TAPIT SAM
hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, advanced between rivals, found himself boxed in through the turn, split horses three wide upper stretch,
challenged STOSH inside the last eighth, fought gamely, lost the photo but was easily second best. PEACOCK MAN in midpack early toward the outside,
was four to six wide taking the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid and moved clear for third inside the final sixteenth. W W RUSSIAN GOLD moved to the
inside early on, was two wide on the turn, angled out seven wide at the top of the lane and improved position without threatening. WINGING WAYS bumped
leaving the chute, steadily drew off on the backstretch, began to wear down along the rail on the bend, floated out some into the stretch, was overtaken and
gave way the final eighth. ORBITAL STARR was away slowly, chased from well off the inside, lost considerable ground widest through the turn, angled in
some upper stretch and passed between tired ones. TIZRIK broke outward, bumping SCARLET CITY, was a factor from inside but gave way after a quarter
mile. SCARLET CITY broke inward, bounce off TIZRIK then into WINGING WAYS, chased the latter from outside, loomed a threat on the bend, floated out
to path four into the lane and began to fade. KING TITO chased from off the rail, angled outside W W RUSSIAN GOLD for the stretch run and had little to
offer.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPIRE broke outward, bumping KARAYEL, was encouraged to a clear early lead, allowed to relax while staying just off the inside, let out on the
second bend, drifted out to path four entering the lane, lengthened command, was put to a drive midstretch and proved much the best. KARAYEL bumped
at the break, raced closest to GLOBAL EMPIRE from just outside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch
but lasted for second. KING DOODLE prominent from outside, lost ground four wide through both turns, drifted out to path seven into the lane and made up
minor ground inside the final furlong. IRISH DECLARATION broke inward, brushing with DIAMOND DAVE, was steadied, settled not far off the inside,
angled out six wide into the second bend, lost further ground fanning widest for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. BEEALEA was caught
five wide on both turns, forced out to path eight entering the stretch then flattened out. DIAMOND DAVE crowded at the break, raced in contention from
inside to the second bend then began to yield. MKAR THE FAST advanced between horses on the backstretch but gave way before finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
CAMARGO was sent to share the lead from inside, moved clear when allowed leaving the second bend, floated out some entering the lane, began to wear
down inside the last furlong, was all out and kept SOUPER FORTUNE at bay. SOUPER FORTUNE bore out at the break, was corrected and encouraged to
vie for the lead outside CAMARGO, did not stay with the latter leaving the second turn, drifted out to path four into the stretch, came again inside the final
eighth but was too late. DEVIL'S RULE rated just off the inside, angled out four wide to advance on the second bend, fanned outside SOUPER FORTUNE
into the lane, took over third, steadily angled in the last furlong, only made up minor ground but pulled away for the show. READY REDDING well placed
from inside, flattened out for the drive. CHANGE DIRECTION reluctant to load, jostled briefly with CARL G at the start, lost ground four wide on both turns,
drifted out to path eight entering the lane, improved position some upper stretch then leveled off. COPPER CROSSING chased from inside, angled out
through the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and had no late bid. SON OF GRACE a step slow at the start, stayed off the inside throughout and
was never a factor. MOVE ON OVER raced in contention three or four wide for six furlongs then gave way. CARL G jostled with CHANGE DIRECTION at
the break, quickly recovered to race in the second flight between rivals but gave way two wide on the second turn.

Footnotes
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL rated off the early speed, gradually progressed three wide after the first two furlongs to vie for the lead into the lane, was bumped
solidly and forced out upper stretch, moved clear inside the last eighth and held sway under steady handling. AVIANO was away slowly, steadily advanced
from outside once on the backstretch, lost ground four wide on the second bend, altered out some upper stretch to stay clear of ETERNALLY GRATEFUL,
took over second with a sixteenth left and began to drew out as he drew off for third in the waning yards. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY chased from just off the
inside, angled out on the second turn, lost considerable ground fanning widest for the stretch run, advanced upper stretch, angled inside AVIANO when that
one came out in the late going and got up in time for third. MILLARD'S SMILE chased from along the rail, fanned out some entering the lane, altered back to
the rail upper stretch and found best stride too late. SNOOZER shared the lead just outside CHEEKERS, moved ahead on the second bend, stayed off the
rail, bore out under left-handed pressure at the top of the stretch, bumped solidly with ETERNALLY GRATEFUL, began to yield, drifted out some again
inside the eighth pole, was straightened and continued to fade. CHEEKERS displayed early speed from inside but began to fade with three furlong to go.
The trainer of SNOOZER lodged an objection alleging interference from ETERNALLY GRATEFUL upper stretch. After their review, the stewards did not
uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
CHARM THE LADIES rated off the early speed, went for the lead three wide on the bend, angled in beside KANITHAPPEN entering the lane, edged ahead,
moved clear inside the final furlong, drifted out under left-handed pressure the last sixteenth but held on. MARY'S BOY void of speed, though hustled along
early, advanced along the rail on the turn, fanned out three wide for a clear path into the stretch, was forced out by KANITHAPPEN after entering the final
eighth, held a straight path the last sixteenth but came up short. FUTURE VISION in the second flight between rivals, took the bend four wide, was forced
out by MARY'S BOY after entering the last furlong, also kept a straight path the final sixteenth, closed well but was too late. KANITHAPPEN crowded from
the rear at the start, vied for the lead from inside, began to slowly yield while in close quarters along the rail upper stretch, was checked and abruptly altered
out after entering the last furlong and continued to gradually fade. MR FROST jostled with TEA AFTER BALLET at the start, was an early contender just off
the rail, angled out five wide upper stretch and had no late bid. TEA AFTER BALLET jostled between horses at the break, chased from just off the inside,
angled out widest upper stretch and had no significant response. READY MADE broke inward starting a chain reaction of jostling, quickly recovered to vie
for the lead from outside but began to fade two wide before finishing a half mile.
