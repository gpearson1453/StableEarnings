Footnotes
B B BAD settled off the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch and edged clear under steady handling. RUDY ROD well behind early, rallied, was in tight briefly
in midstretch and continued willingly. TACO BEAN vied three across, led narrowly at the quarter pole then weakened. SAMURAI SAINT squeezed back
early, was in tight into the far turn then lacked a solid bid. HIDE THE RANSOM moved slightly closer nearing the eighth pole then flattened out. FOREST
SURVIVOR dueled between rivals, came over on rival near the top of the stretch fading. CRAFTY DON vied along the inside, was taken up tiring near the
top of the stretch. An objection by the second finisher against the winner was dismissed as was a claim of foul by the seventh finisher against the third
finisher.

CORONA CAMPIONE quickly took control, widened before half a mile and was kept to her task while weakening slightly. ALMA BRILHA chased outside
then made a gradual gain without threatening. MARIA SAYS SO lacked speed, saved ground and continued well while edged for the place. GWEN STACY
dropped back early and was always outrun while no factor. LADY SHEBOYGAN raced in closest pursuit of the winner briefly, stopped and lost contact with
her field.

Footnotes
KEEP DEM TALKING close up in the two path, took over at the quarter pole and edged clear while under urging. COMMISSION ALWAYS angled inside
setting the pace, lost the lead nearing the stretch but continued well. LORD SEABEE prompted the pace near the inside and held on for the show award.
OUT ON THE TOWN never far back, angled out on the turn but lacked a rally. UPTOWN SHOES rushed to contention wide in the opening quarter then
proved empty in the stretch. CAUTELOSO lacked speed outside and was never a factor. NOMAR'S HOPE moved extremely wide on the turn and never
involved. BIG POPPER broke slowly and lagged far behind throughout. DOCTOR MAGIC dropped back inside and gave way readily.

BURNING EMBERS was a bit reluctant to load, then broke sharply, set the pace racing off the inside, responded when roused, drew off and widened under
urging in the final furlong. LA COLORADA chased the pace, raced between rivals on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside
and earned the place spot. SOPHIA'S ROSE was bumped at the start, chased three wide, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and was
outkicked for second. A PHILLY THING chased in the two path, chased on the turn and finished evenly. ORCHARD chased on the inside, angled out and
gained mildly in the lane. HARLEE stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn and lacked a rally. GOLDEN BOSS LADY
raced off the rail, off pace, three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DISCO FLASH was bumped at the start, chased close up on the rail, was in tight
and steadied at the half mile marker, chased inside on the turn and faded. I SERVE THE KING was outrun.

FOR SALE bid inside to the front midway on the turn and drew away eagerly under moderate pressure. ON ANOTHER LEVEL rallied with the winner
outside on the turn and proved easily second best. GYPSY WANDERER chased wide throughout and continued willingly to the finish. MERRYCHILL far
behind early, advanced inside with some late energy. BAY BAY BIRDIE saved ground just off the leaders and faltered. NEIGHBELLINE rushed to the front
in the opening quarter then began fading on the turn. SWANS ISLAND lacked speed and was never in contention. EMILY'S ON FIRE was taken up sharply
between rivals near the half mile pole and failed to recover. BONNIE PARKER raced off the leaders outside and stopped abruptly.
