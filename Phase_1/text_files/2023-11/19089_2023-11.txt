DREWNANIMOUS raced within contention, steadied around the first turn, getting in tight quarters and followed the top two to the wire. UNCLE CHAN raced
within striking distance, got in tight quarters around the first turn, bobbled, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MUSTBELIEVE raced near the middle of the
field, came around the final turn on the out side and put forth an even effort. VALID EARLY lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat.
CRAZY MUGGS void of early speed and was never close. D'FESTIVE CAT always raced near the back and showed little. TRUVY'S BANDIT pressed the
early pace and made a steady retreat. CORTE trailed throughout and was outrun. THE JOCKEY OF #1 UNCLE CHAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL

FLAWLESS TAKEOVER vied for the early lead, saved ground throughout, drove clear late and won under steady urging. SWEET ALEXIS pressed the
pace, raced outside around the final turn and finished willingly. LAWLESS TIMES dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't keep up
with the top two. PORTO DEL ACE lacked early speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. RONA VISION raced
near the back, improved position, but was never a threat. MO BANDI raced within striking distance and weakened. CRAFTROOM showed early speed and
made a steady retreat. WAKE UP DOLORES always raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and showed little.

Footnotes
SHUT UP MAN pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid down the stretch, took the lead and held on well for the win. VIOLENT CITY
raced near the back in the early part, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and closed well. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced in the middle of the
field, made a late gain and proved no match for the top two. FIELD OF VISION lacked early speed, came around the turn seven wide, gained ground, but
was no real factor. FLASHY BOY went to the front, drove clear and weakened down the home stretch. MOR BIG LEE raced within contention, faded and
was no threat late. OCEOLA void of early speed and passed tired ones. BULLETSREVENGE pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. BELLO
CREEDO raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. RAUL'S ENCANTO always raced near the back and showed little.

MISS ST. CLAIRE vied for the early advantage, steadied around the turn, getting in tight quarters, angled out, waited behind rivals, split horses, moved to
the rail and proved the best. SHARONS'MOONSHADOW raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid, took the lead, but
proved no match for the winner. DAT GUITAR void of early speed, showed late interest and was a clear third. PSALM PRAYER pressed the early pace and
weakened. AFLEET CHARLENE always raced near the back and showed little. CUSTOMIZED TWIN dueled on the front end and dropped back.
