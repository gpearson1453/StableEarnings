stretch, but only managed to chase the leader thereafter while being kept at bay. WITS AND WAGERS was off a bit slow, raced at the rear two wide, inched
closer four wide turning for home, but leveled off and chased the top pair home evenly. LADY MERCEDES set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer
bidder into the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole and gave way in upper stretch. OVERINDULGENCE saved ground off of the pace but to no
avail. AZURA tracked three wide but was done into the far turn.

LARK'S MISCHIEF took a nudge to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of a prompting foe, vied with that one turning for
home, inched an advantage in upper stretch, leaned outwardly as his outer counterpart persisted in the final sixteenth, but held firm. WAKE SURF broke a
bit outwardly at the start, pressed outside of the leader, vied turning for home, but failed to sustain even terms in upper stretch, kept on to vie again after
flopping leads at the sixteenth pole, but was denied. RUGGS leaned outwardly and lightly bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked his foes from the two
path, took aim outside of them in upper stretch, but only managed to chase while needing more.

Footnotes
LOU ANNA vied two wide, cleared in hand entering the lane, came under a drive as an outer rival pursued in upper stretch, met that foe's challenge while
tiring in the late stages yet lasted. BETTE DAVIS bobbled a bit at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, took aim on the clearing leader from the
three path in upper stretch, but lugged inwardly while flopping to her left lead at the three sixteenths pole, changed back over while sustaining pursuit
nearing the final sixteenth, closed in once again to offer a late bid but missed. DANCING PRINCESS pressed three wide under urging, got floated to the four
path while chasing entering the lane and sustained stride for a minor share. MO'S VINO MESA vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no
match for that one entering the lane and weakened. CHOCTAW GRACE chased four wide, then faded in the five path entering the lane. PARTAKE
stumbled severely at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane and made little impact. YAREE D TAT stalked along the
inside and weakened.

MYSTIK DAN vied two wide, then between horses turning for home, yet kicked away in upper stretch and drew off under light urging. EUSEBIUS laid off of
the pace in the three to two path, shifted to the five path while behind foes entering the lane, tipped six wide for clear sailing in upper stretch, stayed on in
the final furlong to bid for place approaching the wire and prevailed. EVAN ON EARTH broke slowly, advanced outside of rivals to track from the five path
into the turn, ran on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, forged that position in the late stages an outer rival offered a challenge and got outfinished. CHUN
MONEY vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no match entering the lane, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, held place through
midstretch but was surpassed by outer rivals in the final sixteenth. GRAND EMPEROR trailed in the four path and moved up in the eight path late. HENRO
broke slowly, chased in the three path, then lacked a bid in the six to seven path and between horses late. FLOTATION STATION broke a step slow,
stalked in the four path, ranged up turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch and gave way between horses. JOE SHIESTY vied two wide and between
horses early on, but shied from the shadow casted by the video board inside the five furlong pole, lost position in the aftermath, recovered to stalk along the
inside into the turn but faded. MIGHTY MESSAGE chased from midpack two wide and faded between horses. BRODY was outrun.

Footnotes
NASH set the pace in the two path, built an uncontested margin down the backstretch, showed the way in hand around the far turn, responded readily when
let out a notch in upper stretch, drew off under light hand urging and was put to wraps a sixteenth from home. JUSTIFREAK stalked along the inside, edged
place in midstretch and held. RESILIENCE trailed in the four path, shifted from the five to six path in upper stretch, rallied to reach show in the final sixteenth
and was gaining on place late. NYQUIST FREQUENCY stalked in the three path, but lacked a bid, yielded late and lost show in the final sixteenth. BE YOU
tracked while racing well in the bit two wide and between horses, shifted out and chased from the five path outside of foes around the far turn and lacked a
bid. DJANGO laid off of the pace along the inside, steadied slightly passing the three quarter pole, chased while shifting to the four path around the far turn
and flattened out. NUEVO EMPIRE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, steadied entering the backstretch, trailed turning for home then
improved between horses. CRUSADING lacked speed three to two wide and tired. NULLIFY tracked in the four path and faded between horses at the three
furlong pole.

pace inside of the eventual winner, vied with that one around the turn, got headed entering the lane, fought on through midstretch but yielded in the final
sixteenth and saved place at the wire. RUNGIUS stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, then chased willingly through the final furlong to miss
reaching place. SEVEN FLAT chased in the four path, but was floated to the six path entering the lane and gave way. HOODLUM tracked three wide and
between horses, came under urging to chase at the three furlong pole, but drifted to the five path entering the lane and faded.
