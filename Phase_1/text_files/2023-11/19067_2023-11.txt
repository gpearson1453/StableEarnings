Footnotes
DEBT MONGER chased 3wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, dueled in upper stretch with rival and floated rival to the rail to prove
best late. KING ADROCK away well, led in between rivals on the backstretch, continued to lead on the turn, entered lane in the two path, floated in by
outside rival and outgamed late while in tight along the rail. WHOA BUDDY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued off rail on the turn,
launched bid along the rail and grinded up for third. AROUND THE DIAL stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
asked and delivered a mild rally in the lane to improve. ABADON pressed paced in between on the backstretch, got to rail entering the turn, unable to keep
up with pair of outside rivals entering the stretch, so eased out around them and came up empty when roused. RIVER TIBER pressed pace along the rail on
the backstretch, pinched back entering the turn, and failed to threaten thereafter. DIVINELY DIVERSE in tight and pinched back, causing him to clip heels,
fell back and not asked in the backstretch, advanced well under own power on the turn, but failed to improve in the lane. FAMOUS ROCK STAR settled
along the inside on the backstretch, had to take up abruptly when RIVER TIBER was pinched and stopped in front of him, took till mid turn to regather and
coasted to wire while in the three path. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED

GOTHAM'S FINALE minor bump at the start, took command along the rail, continued to lead on the turn, shook clear into the lane and collared late by rival.
WON BID broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued chasing on the turn and weakened in upper
stretch. CAPACITY tracked trio of rival along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and stayed on along the inside to be third.
LORD MO away slowly, made some mild progress mid race and came up empty in the lane. ACCELERAY in tight early and started to climb, fell back and
failed to ever fully level while finishing with plenty of energy. WHACKO KID chased leader three wide on the backstretch, lost some ground on the turn,
launched bid three wide and surged late to get up. HECTOR'S HOSTAGE tracked trio on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, kept to task in the
lane to best the rest.

Footnotes
JERIKO off bit slow, but kept his path, leveled approaching the gap, asked once midway and finished strong under a drive to get up. SICARIO V off a bit
slow with rider hitting assistant starter, accelerated strongly to take the lead by the gap, kept to task and nailed by hard charging rival at the wire. PARTY
POLITICS continued his gate antics, away well, asked right handed and drifted in a path early, kept under steady right handed urging and outclosed by the
winner. FEARLESS MOON away well enough, asked right handed early, kept under a strong drive throughout and caught late for third in a game effort.
GHOST WITHA FIRE away well, asked right handed early, kept to task while unable to match strides with the top finishers. HES CHICKLESS away best,
asked early, kept to task, began to get leg weary reaching the final half and weakened under a drive. NAVAJA got away with the leaders, under a hand drive
early, asked midway and failed to respond. FUTURE VERSION ducked out five paths at the start, continued to lean out the first fifty yards, shifted in passing
the eighth pole, finally leveled out in the final sixteenth to finish with something left in the tank. HES JUDGEANDJURY came away a bit slow, lacked needed
quickness to hold lane, rider sensed he was about to lose his path approaching the final eighth and preemptively altered three to four paths out, and failed to
have any finish.
