Footnotes
FIRST RULE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn, dueled gamely to the
wire and just got the bob for the win. BERMONDSEY stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
dueled to the finish, drifting out in the final furlong and just missing. CHAMPION BY DESIGN raced off the pace on the inside through the early going, swung
out to the five path to began a bid entering the stretch and improved position on the outside from there. HINDENBURG raced in the middle of the pack on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. DIALING DIXIE dueled on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. SNEAKINESS dueled on the outside through the early going, continued to battle from the
two path around the bend and tired in the stretch. EVEN THUNDER trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and was gaining ground steadily when BERMONDSEY drifted into his lane, causing him to clip heels and fall in the final furlong and
later walk off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, HORSE SEVEN, BERMONDSEY, WAS DISQUALIFIED
AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE WITH HORSE ONE, EVEN THUNDER.

Footnotes
TAM CHAR stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path around the turn, dueled in the lane and edged clear near
the wire. BREEZY CONNECTION trailed the field early, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn and chased the winner home from
there. WILLFUL DESIRE led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened late. TRUE ATKA
raced off the pace through the early going, navigated the bend from the three path and made up some ground in the final furlong. SYSTEMIC RISK chased
the pace setter between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane. KASHAN tracked the leader on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
