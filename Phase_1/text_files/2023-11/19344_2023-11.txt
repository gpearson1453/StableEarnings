Footnotes
UNDER BUDGET was unhurried having one runner beaten down the backside, improved up the fence around the turn, had clear run on the rail gaining on
the leaders in upper stretch, shifted just outside to burst between foes at the sixteenth pole and edged away for the win at the line. SISTER COUSIN took
command from the start, was headed outside at the quarter pole, quickly put away the early challenger, opened up mildly at the top of the stretch and gave
way to the winner a few strides before the finish line. SILENT PATSY chased behind the frontrunner on the rail in the turn, shifted outside in the thee path
getting closer at the quarter pole, was in the hunt between horses in the four path at the top of the stretch and gamely battled to the wire just missing out on
getting up for the place share at the wire. MADAM GWEN was three deep outside foes in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, was roused three
wide midturn keeping pace with rivals, swung out widest in the six path straightening out for home and showed a good late run rallying in the final sixteenth
to close in to be on the fringes in the end. CITRINA travelled in midfield on the rail at the half, made a mild run with rivals on either side midway around the
oval and ran evenly on the fence down the stretch to the wire. LADIES RUM settled in mid-pack between horses down the backside, took closer order three
wide at the three eighths marker, continued three wide inching closer to the leader throughout the turn, was five wide at the top of the stretch mix of things
but stalled in the final sixteenth. WORKING HOLIDAY chased the pacesetter on the outside down the back straight, bid for the lead outside in the two path
at the quarter pole, was repelled by the frontrunner turning for home and flattened out in mid-stretch. GOOD BYE NEW YORK stalked near the rear on the
outside, made little headway running four wide through the turn and could not be a factor down the lane. TEXENSIS was void of speed trailing down the
backside, could not catch up to others running around the bend and was not involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY watched the front threesome on the rail down the backstretch, patiently waited for her cue to go running through the turn, shifted out to
the three path straightening out foe the drive and wore down the leaders by the sixteenth pole for the lead, clearing away when crossing the finish line.
RIFLING veered out at the start, tracked in the second flight on the outside down the back straight, made little gain on the turn, angled four wide at the top of
the stretch and closed in smartly to capture the second money just before the wire. VALLEY GIRL stumbled badly at the start, recovered to emerge with a
slim lead on the fence at the half mile marker, continued up front with only mild pressure from the outside around the bend and just missed holding for the
place share when fading late in deep stretch. TAYLORMOON was part of the trio up front with the other two leaders on each side at the half, reined back a
touch to nestle behind the frontrunner through the turn, found a seam in the two path between horses making a bid in upper stretch but needed more late
and was outfinished in deep stretch settling for a minor role in the end. SPANISH BEAUTY was allowed to settle near the back outside horses down the
backside, made little impact when urged three wide in midturn, angled out to be five wide straightening to the wire and finished up willingly passing foes
down the lane. SPARKLE SAMMY prompted the pace three wide outside at the half, chased the pacesetter through the turn, was in range if good enough in
the three path at the top of the lane, could not go on late and faded between foes at the furlong marker. GORMLEY GIRL stalked near the rear on the rail in
the early going, could not close the gap on rivals around the bend and was not a presence in the stretch run. REINS OF PURPLE was in tight soon after the
start, pinched back to trail down the backside, caught up to the field by the quarter pole outside rivals but had little to give driving to the finish line. TIS A
PITY settled in mid-pack with runners on either side down the back straight, lost position throughout the turn, swung outside six wide for the drive but came
up empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TAKE CHANCES galloped along trailing the field down the backside, made a good rally weaving between runners three wide at the quarter pole, shifted just
outside four wide when losing her path at the furlong marker and found more to surge past for the win in deep stretch. HIGH TREASON stalked near the
rear on the rail in the early stages, advanced smartly inside at the half, had nowhere to go when stuck behind the tiring early leader at the quarter pole,
shifted out to the four path at the top of the stretch and was full of run late but could not get to the winner at the finish line. WILD QUEENIE stalked near the
back three wide outside foes down the backside, circled four wide around runners midway on the final turn, briefly seized the lead just inside the eighth pole
and was outdueled late stretch. MUCHO MISSTIQUE travelled alone in midfield down the backstretch, closed the gap on the leaders by the half, kept pace
with rivals on the final turn and mildly finished up to the wire for a minor share in the end. LOOKHOWPRETTY had an ideal spot all alone watching the
contesting pair down the backside, chased the leader through the final bend, could not go on with others closing in through the stretch and tired in the last
sixteenth between horses. FOREVER DANISH pressed the pace outside through the first turn, hounded the pacesetter down the back straight on the
outside, assumed command three furlongs out, was desperately clinging to the lead on the fence in mid-stretch and retreated while not switching leads in
the final furlong. I'M PHANTOM was hustled on the rail to take this field into the first turn, continued up front down the backside, was collared outside with
three eighths to go, offered no resistance, backed away on the fence through the far turn, galloped across the finish line and walked home.

Footnotes
SUGAR IS GOLDEN tracked from inside, saved ground on the turn, bid inside near the furlong grounds, kicked clear then held. MI TORMENTA settled
mid-pack inside, was guided out past the five-sixteenths coming to the quarter pole four wide and within range of the leaders five deep at the top of the
stretch, drifted in a bit through the lane while running on well but was only second best. GREEN GABLES was coaxed forward after breaking out just a bit,
quickly made the lead, set the pace three wide, moved clear into the turn, raced off the rail through that bend, was overtaken by mid-stretch and yielded but
saved show honors. AIRY FAIRY was allowed to settle into stride off the leaders, picked it up a bit five wide on the turn, kept on but missed show.
NATASHA'S BIZNIZ broke a step slowly, settled off the pace and off the inside, moved out at the top of the stretch then altered inside a rival in mid-stretch
and showed moderate late effort. KATCHY NAME was forwardly-placed, tracked the pace between runners into the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
CHARLOTTE'S SILVER attended the early pace from outside, stalked in behind the leader and outside runners four deep into the turn, put to urging near
the quarter pole and loomed a threat within striking distance but faltered and faded. STORMY SUZIE raced off the inside at the back, moved nearer the rail
for the stretch run, went evenly and made no bid. PACENZA was outpaced early racing at the back into the turn six to seven wide, swung nine wide into
upper stretch, passed a couple foes. FRESH DREAMS was mid-pack racing mostly three to four wide through the turn, failed to rally. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD
was outside at the back five to six wide into the turn coming out a bit for the drive, was never near enough to threaten.

CENTENARY settled mid-pack outside four to five wide into the turn, bid in mid-stretch taking command and drawing clear. WORK IT BABY advanced
inside late up the backstretch into the turn, saved ground, loomed a threat inside in upper stretch, was no match for the winner. CRIMSON NIGHTS settled
off the pace outside and behind the eventual winner, went five to six wide on the turn, showed good late effort but needed more. LIAM'S AWESOME settled
in the back half of the field, saved ground through the turn, came out in late stretch and gained but too late. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was outsprinted early
shifting in and racing near but off the rail through the turn, angled out abruptly nearing the furlong grounds and drifted some as well now eight wide, kicked
on well but too late. ALL FOR HONOR broke a step slowly and bumped with a rival spotting the field several lengths, angled in soon after, settled at the
rear, saved ground on the turn, rallied inside but lacked room at the wire. CRYSTAL THE PISTOL moved forward inside to force the pace racing off the rail
but with outside pressure, drifted out in upper stretch, faded late. TAPPING A RHYTHM bumped with a foe at the start, raced off the inside at the back,
shifted about eight wide in upper stretch, failed to menace. NEOLITHIC NATION raced outside at the rear travelling five to six wide through the turn, fanned
nine to ten deep for the drive, failed to rally. SHAMELESS AFFAIR had a brief early lead but was soon outsprinted, chased the leading pair three wide,
faded. CHERRY GARDENS pressed the pace three wide, drifted out a bit into upper stretch, lacked room while weakening, faded.

Footnotes
SIR SAMUEL stalked near the rear having one rival beaten down the backside, was on hold briefly looking for room from the three eighths marker until
midpoint on the far turn, burst between horses at the quarter pole in the two path, had his sights set on the frontrunner at the top of the lane and closed in
strongly reaching for ground to go on by for the win in the final seventy yards. SILVER SMOKE took control while in hand on the rail into the first turn, set the
fractions down the backside with only mild pressure being asserted from the outside, opened up on the field turning for home, could not find more in reserve
to fend off the winner in deep stretch and easily bested the rest for second money at the finish. COLONEL MUSTARD travelled alone in mid-pack down the
backstretch, made a strong move going around runners four wide at the quarter pole, could not match strides with the top two but finished with intent down
the lane to be a distant third crossing the line. LESLIE CHOW watched the top duo travelling on the rail down the back straight, was scrubbed on three wide
around the far turn but was making little progress, never gave up, battling at the top of the stretch and finished up to the wire to garner a minor role in the
end. BASKETBALL JONES was under a snug hold content to track the frontrunner down the backside, came under a ride midway on the far turn to go after
the leader, offered little response and gave way between runners in the last furlong. GOODLUCKMATE was unhurried to trail down the back straight, could
see the field while roused throughout the far turn and passed a straggler in upper stretch. GUARD OF HONOUR tracked the front pair on the rail down the
backside, was urged for more on the fence through the far turn, could not quicken with others at the quarter pole, giving way and was not persevered with in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE BOOTS battled with rivals on each side down the backstretch, hounded the pacesetter on the fence in the turn, was let out a notch at the
quarter pole, quickly opened up on the field turning for home and extended the advantage cruising home down the stretch for the impressive score. QUIET
MADDELENA dueled inside for the lead down the back straight, gave way to the top two leaders into the turn, re-rallied posing the main threat to the winner
outside at the top of the stretch and chased the winner home easily holding for the runners up share in the end. KHOZZY VALINTINE watched the front
threesome from the inside down the backstretch, could not go on with others making a move on the turn and stubbornly fought on dueling down the stretch
to hold for third place at the finish line. NO WHAMMIE stalked on the outside near the back in the beginning, made little progress around the bend, figured
things out in the five path at the furlong marker and surged late to just miss closing in on third money at the wire. MISS BOBBIT stalked near the rear on the
fence in the early going, saved ground keeping pace inside throughout the turn, battled on the fence for show award down the lane but was outgamed in
deep stretch. HIT AND RUN tracked the contesting front trio on the outside down the back straight, offered a mild run from the three eighths pole until the
quarter marker and levelled out by mid-stretch. OHEAVENS trailed the field down the backstretch, could not get interested seeing the pack around the bend,
swung out widest in the six path for the drive but had nothing to show down the stretch. DETERMINED LOVE pressed the pace three wide on the outside
down the backstretch, emerged with a slim advantage on the outside up front through the turn, was no match trying to keep up with the winner at the quarter
pole and faltered between foes in upper stretch.

SEATTLE SIGNAL brushed inside rival on the start, had a narrow advantage while hounded inside down the backstretch, spurted away comfortably from
the chasing rivals at the three furlong marker and was kept to the task holding safe for the convincing score at the finish line. SMOKEN CHLOE broke
outwards on the break, began to pick off runners running between rivals at the three furlong marker, came under a hard ride four wide at the quarter pole,
determinedly ran on end to the wire, was gaining mildly on the winner late with a solid effort but was second best on this day. GUNNAWIN was inside foes
stalking in the middle of this strung out field at the half mile marker, improved when scrubbed on for more on the rail three eighths from home, shifted
outside with momentum at the quarter pole and finished with good energy in the five path down the stretch to close in and capture third when all was said
and done. ROYAL CHROME settled on the inside near the back in the early going, waited in hand on the fence at the three eighths marker, quickly rallied
up a clear rail at the quarter pole, was looking for a seam behind foes three wide turning for home, had running room when shifted to the outside in the four
path in mid-stretch and ran on gamely to be a fringe player in the end. LOOK AT LIL SISTER broke out brushing foe at the start, pressed the issue on the
rail down the back straight, chased but was losing ground to the frontrunning winner through the turn, was used up by the time they straightening out for the
drive and faded on the fence at the furlong marker. T'PRING tracked the top two down the backstretch running on the inside, tracked the winner three wide
in the second flight around the turn, battled for the minor shares with rivals on either side in upper stretch but faded in the final sixteenth of a mile. SHEZ A
SEALY was unhurried stalking near the rear on the fence in the early stages, began to pick up horses splitting foes in midturn, swung outside, five wide for
the drive and was one paced to the finish line. STANDING STRONG stalked on the rail in the third flight down the backstretch, kept pace with others while
saving ground around the oval, was in range behind foes for a small share in the two path at the top of the lane but stalled at the furlong marker.
BLACKMARSH was pinched back at the break, having only the other poor starter behind her down the backside, made no progress running around the oval
and could not get into contention driving to the wire. SWEEPING PASSION stalked in the middle of the pack three wide down the backside, ran on evenly
four wide through the turn, angled out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and had no rally to give outside foes to the wire. CASTLETON tracked
the front pair down the backside outside of challengers, was asked for more three wide at the three furlong marker, offered little run and backed away
through the field at the quarter pole. JIMMY IS A BREEZE was squeezed at the break seeing the pack down the backside, trailed the field around the turn,
caught up to rivals four wide at the quarter pole and was no menace in the drive to the finish line. SAKE AND SUSHI settled in midfield four deep outside
runners down the backside, was urged three wide at the three eighths marker but going in the wrong direction and gave way between horses at the quarter
pole.
