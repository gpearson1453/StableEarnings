LUCKY ANA was hustled to the lead on the run to the first turn, cleared into the turn, remained on a clear lead through the far turn and into the lane then
widened through the lane while being ridden out to the wire. CAPTIVE STAR unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through late turn and into the
lane, continued three wide near the eighth pole then edged clear for the place spot while not a threat. NAUTICAL MILE chased the winner from the two path
into the lane then weakened in the drive. GOLDEN HEIST was in the four path through the first turn, moved closer to the inside into the far turn, stayed near
the rail into the lane, came off the inside approaching the eighth pole and moved up while not a threat. WILMA chased the pace from the three path into the
turn then tired. BROADWAY CHARM chased the pace into the far turn when near the inside and steadily faded. CHIRP CHIRP was in the three path
through the turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TALKTOMEJUSTICE chased the pace from the two or three path into the far turn, moved to press the leader through the turn and into the lane, dueled with
the pace from outside the eighth pole to near the sixteenth pole then edged up late. MISS LUV SHACK saved ground throughout, cut the corner and rallied
up the rail and was outfinished by the winner in a good effort. RIBALDRY (IRE) set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, dueled with the eventual winner
after straightening in the lane then grudgingly gave ground. WAY TOO SMARTE was along the inside through the turns when near the back, cut the corner
into the lane, shifted into the four path near the eighth pole and was gaining to the end. NORA'S STAR raced in the two path through the far turn when in
mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. PRESSLY'S HOPE raced four wide through the first turn, continued in the
three path down the backstretch and into the far turn while never far back, swung into the lane from the six path and tired. BAND OF ROSES raced in the
two path through the turns when never far back then tired after turning into the lane. LOTTA ROSES was always last while off the inside, angled into the
seven path for the drive and never menaced.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT chased early while in the two path, bid two wide through the turn, shook clear into the lane then drew off impressively. FIRST KITTEN
chased the duelers through the turn and into the lane, remained in the two path while being no match for the winner and just got up for the place spot. KEEN
ICE SIGHT saved ground through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and showed good energy and just missed the place spot. SMOOTH
JUSTICE raced along the rail through the turn when near the back, came off the inside and into the four path for the drive and gained belatedly. VARTON
set the early pace on a clear lead, vied through the turn while near the two path, lost contact with the challenger into the lane then faded along the rail. MIA
BABY never a factor while saving ground through the turn and finishing in mid-track. WILD TAPIT raced in the two path into the turn when dropping back to
trail, came into the lane from the two or three path and showed some belated interest. MONTGOMERY PARK raced in mid-pack through the turn when in
the three path and tired. PROTOMAGIC in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was in it.

Footnotes
RODEO ZONE moved up to track the pace along the inside through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive, gained momentum once straightened,
caught the leader with an eighth to go then won going away. BARCA BILLY raced in the three or four path through the turn, was four wide into the lane,
straightened in the six or seven path and stayed on to gain the place spot. BOZAANO chased the pace from the two path through the turn, was no match
into the lane and was just beaten for the place spot late. SHIPCAPTAINNCREW set the pace from the two path into the turn, was caught by the winner near
the eighth pole then shortened dramatically late and lost the place and show spot. IZZAT never a factor while along the inside. FUNTASTICALLY was
forced in at the start and was slow to gather, raced in the three path through the turn and never menaced. SHIESTY TO CHASE was outurn near the inside.
AMATEUR DAY chased the pace through the turn, bid three wide near the five-sixteenths pole and was empty after turning into the lane.
