Footnotes
COME JOIN THE BAND sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, roused at the top of the stretch and remained clear under right handed
encouragement. SHE'S NOT KIDDING stalked on the inside and steadied slightly early when COME JOIN THE BRAND cut in front, continued along the rail
behind the leader and inside a rival, got boxed in with nowhere to go on the turn, came out and bumped SAND TO SEA in upper stretch and finished
willingly for second. SAND TO SEA came away fast while breaking outward, stalked outside a rival into and around the bend, got bumped by SHE'S NOT
KIDDING in upper stretch and went evenly late. SATOSHI tracked two wide into the turn, raced three wide turning for home and lacked a rally. IN HER
PRYME broke a step slow, chased between rivals three wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and failed to menace. PLUM CREEK raced three deep
at the back, raced four wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and came up empty. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE
RUNNING OF THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN SHE'S NOT KIDDING AND SAND TO SEA. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE
INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

C Z ROCKET broke a step slow, stalked off the rail, went three wide around the turn, got floated out to the four path leaving the bend, rallied to the front with
a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. GOOD WITH PEOPLE closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid inside PEACEFUL WATERS outside the
five-sixteenths pole and quickly took over, cleared that rival entering the stretch, led to midstretch and yielded to C Z ROCKET in deep stretch. PEACEFUL
WATERS took control early and showed the way two wide into the turn, challenged near the five-sixteenths pole and offered little resistance to GOOD WITH
PEOPLE and relinquished command shortly after, chased three wide into the lane and kept on to secure the show. KINGDOM HEART chased along the
inside to the stretch and lacked a rally. ARHAM climbed between rivals then off the rail, navigated the bend three then four wide and weakened.

challenged between rivals into the far turn, took over midway around the bend, dueled past the quarter pole in the two path inside TIZ TOK, lost command at
the top of the lane, fought back from inside then flattened to third in the final sixteenth. JIMMY THE BOOT chased in the two path then moved inside, began
to pull leaving the clubhouse turn and early on the backstretch, chased along the rail then tipped three wide into the drive and finished evenly late. TAKE
CHARGE CURLY traveled along the inside, two wide into the far turn, steered out and came four wide into the stretch but lacked further response. ALL THE
KING'S MEN grabbed the early lead and led three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, cleared outer rival at the half-mile pole, pressured by a pair of rivals
leaving the backstretch, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with outer rivals late on the bend and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
SUMMER LAKE stalked along the inside then moved out to the two path, drew alongside the leader near the quarter pole, cleared that rival with a furlong
remaining and lasted over the late run from the runner-up. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, split foes late on the far
turn, closed well from outside but ran out of time. JESSEBEAR traveled two wide outside a rival near the back, advanced between into the far turn, angled
out midway around the bend, came four wide into the lane and put in mild late bid for a clear third. HEY DEMPS cleared and crossed over, showed the way
to the far turn, tested from outside at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. YVETT'S SURPRISE was off a
bit slow to begin, trailed along the inside, swung out leaving the far turn and passed tired rivals. CANDY ON TOP tracked between rivals in the two path,
rounded the far turn two wide then entered the stretch three deep and weakened. JAZZY BOO was off a bit slow in the beginning, settled inside, tipped out
at the top of the stretch but flattened out. WARREN'S PARADICE tracked three deep early, got shuffled behind THE MUSIC WE MAKE at the three-eighths
pole, got moved out to the four or five path on the far turn, steered back inward in upper stretch and weakened. THE MUSIC WE MAKE stalked outside a
rival, lost some ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back three then two wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
SIGNORA MINISTER stalked briefly then went up to press from outside, dueled past the half-mile pole, put away inner rival at the three furlong marker, met
the bid from BIG POND at the five-sixteenths pole, shook free at the quarter pole and remained clear through the lane under a drive. BIG POND bumped
with inner rival at the start, stalked off the rail, put in a mild bid at the five-sixteenths pole but could not sustain the challenge approaching the quarter pole,
continued three wide in pursuit into the lane and finished willingly for a second best. KRISTI'S TIGER bumped with BIG POND leaving the gate, trailed up
the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, continued at the rear now six wide exiting the bend, showed a mild response to urging and got up for third.
SATIN DOLL chased three then four wide, could not make any headway in the final furlong and was edged for the show honors. POWER SURGE stalked
up the backstretch, coaxed along two wide on the turn then cut the corner into the lane and weakened. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN sent clear from inside then
dueled with the winner, failed to keep up at the three-eighths pole, gave way on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
EASTER (FR) broke a step slow, moved inside and became rank when reserved in the early going, continued to tug the rider along in the middle stages,
saved ground through the far turn, had to pause momentarily when running up behind rivals in upper stretch, tipped out and surged alongside HONG KONG
HARRY (IRE) and edged past late. HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) stalked from inside out of range, drew closer continuing to save ground on the far turn,
ridden along into the stretch, tipped out and challenged the leader with a furlong left to run, took over entering the final sixteenth but got outkicked by the
winner. BALNIKHOV (IRE) steered to the inside racing at the back, stayed along the fence to the stretch, angled out and put in a late run to gain the show
honors. SUMTER stepped to the front along the inside, opened up a comfortable lead in the middle stages, held a diminished lead still clear of the field
entering the lane, confronted by HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) with a furlong left to run, relinquished the lead to that rival and weakened in deep stretch.
ASTRONOMER rated in the two path outside a rival, chased three wide into the drive, moved out and lacked a bid. CABO SPIRIT closest in pursuit to the
far turn, cut into the lead around that bend, took aim two wide entering the stretch but lacked the needed response. YES THIS TIME raced in the two path
near the back, traveled three wide turning for home and failed to menace. FRONT RUN THE FED raced outside a rival off the pace, remained two wide to
the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
MOONLIT SONATA off slow to begin, made progress wide up the backstretch and went six deep into the turn, chased four wide turning for home,
challenged from outside at the eighth pole and drove clear. ALL THAT GLORY sped clear and angled inward, led two wide through the turn, held a short
lead entering the final furlong and was no match for the winner late. SAND BAGGER chased three deep between rivals, lost ground and swung out leaving
the turn, kept on determinedly through the lane and was along for the show. SCHWARZMEIER broke slow and made light contact with inner rival, chased
five deep between rivals into the turn, moved in and exited the bend three wide and flattened in the late stages. MR. LEASURE stalked four deep then
between rivals into the turn, got put in a bit tight early on the bend, traveled six wide turning for home and could not rally. AINT NO JOKE chased between
rivals up the backstretch, lost ground and steered over to the rail around the bend, kept on through the lane but failed to threaten. URBAN LEGEND chased
inside several rivals into the turn, remained along the fence to the stretch and weakened. DE' MEDICI chased from inside then began to climb past the
nine-sixteenths pole, raced along the rail into the turn, entered the stretch three wide and was not a factor. CORNELL raced a bit greenly up the backstretch,
came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. JOE'S CANDY broke slow and lost his path at the start, lagged behind early and trailed into the turn,
spun five wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISS LIZZY reserved on the inside, bumped by outer rival at the five-eighths pole, coaxed along on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, moved out in
the stretch, challenged from outside with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. ANNIE'S JOY closest in pursuit from the two path, bid outside with a quarter
mile remaining, finally took over with a sixteenth remaining but was outkicked by the winner. IN YOUR FACE stalked along the inside, saved ground to the
stretch and finished evenly along the fence for third. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) showed good early speed to take control, set the pace next to the fence, met the
bid from ANNIE'S JOY at the quarter pole, resisted to midstretch, lost command with a sixteenth remaining and faltered late. VINCERO GRANDE traveled
two wide at the back then went inside a pair of rivals, was worked on through the far turn, urged right handed entering the stretch but could not summon the
needed rally. RUFF RIDE tracked four wide into the first turn then began to pull around the clubhouse turn between rivals, rounded the far turn two then
three wide and also failed to rally. BUILT DIFFERENT rank early between rivals into the first turn, got bumped from outside at the five-eighths pole, chased
two wide through the far turn and flattened out. UNA PALABRA stalked in the three path, came in and bumped BUILT DIFFERENT at the five-eighths pole,
navigated the far turn two wide and failed to menace. COURT SNORT tracked five then four wide on the first turn, three then two wide on the second bend
and was not a factor.
