Footnotes
SUPER ELLIE stumbled leaving the start but recovered quickly and tracked the early pace from the inside, was well positioned while saving ground through
the backstretch run, inched closer along the far turn, took command in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was a bit green into
deep stretch, had the margin cut into by the oncoming runner-up but kept to task late to prove best. UNION HEIRESS broke in a bit and crowded CLICKING
at the start, settled two wide into the first turn, was steered three wide into the far turn, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch, was not able to impact the
winner in the final sixteenth but finished well and secured the place in the final strides. CLICKING was crowded by a neighboring rival at the start and was
away a bit slowly, settled inside to begin, saved all of the ground to the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in deep stretch and held safely in the end
for third. Z INDY LINDY was asked to rate in the early going, pulled on the rider and was keen while between runners into the first turn, raced two wide into
the backstretch run and settled while tracking the moderate pace to the half-mile pole, maintained a two wide path into the far turn, chased SUPER ELLIE to
mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outkicked. OOPS AND DOWNS settled three wide into the first turn, was unhurried
through the backstretch run and raced two wide into the far turn, swung six wide for the stretch drive and offered a belated rally in the late stages. VHAGAR
showed speed away from the start and assumed command in the early going, drifted to the three path into the first turn and floated out a pair of rivals, set
moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, led the way into the far turn while under pressure, drifted out to the three path nearing the
top of the lane, was overtaken into the stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the late stages. DESERT RUMBLE was forwardly placed away
from the start, raced outside of rivals into the first turn and was floated five wide leaving the seven-furlong marker, stalked the moderate pace from the
outside through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide heading to the quarter marker, was floated out into the lane and came four wide for the
stretch drive, could not keep pace into deep stretch and tired. CATTIN ALL AROUND was forwardly placed leaving the break, was floated to the four path
entering the first turn but recovered and attended to the pace into the backstretch run, stalked VHAGAR through moderate fractions to the half-mile pole,
pressed that rival to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DRIVER'S ED came away well from the gate and was hustled to the front, then once clear was put under some restraint, was pressed early and through the
turn by BAILS HIM OUT, had something in reserve when that foe moved to challenge at the top of the stretch, held sway then widened in deep stretch,
easily holding off a late challenge to the outside near the line. CHIPPEWA BUD was not pressed for speed from the start, settled near the rear of the
compact field and remained there as the field headed into the turn, was asked to go on past the three furlong marker, stayed towards the inside on the turn
for home, got a nice hole to run through near the furlong pole, tipped out a path and responded to intermittent urging with a late surge to grab the second
spot. BAILS HIM OUT broke in and bothered GORM after the break, then got forwardly placed and took up a stalking position right behind DRIVER'S ED,
followed that into the turn then moved up to challenge with some confidence, pulled even at the top of the stretch but had trouble changing leads, could not
reel in that foe and was passed late for the place. LASMUIGH (GB) came away in good order and raced in the middle of the tightly bunched pack through
the early stages, made a forward move through the turn while three wide, came into the stretch with every chance then struggled to keep up in final furlong.
GORM broke a step slow then got squeezed after the break, had to steady and was slow to get going, recovered nicely and was in the mix before passing
the five furlong marker, tracked the top two through the turn then quickened along with LASMUIGH (GB) from about the five-sixteenths but soon had to idle
behind horses turning into the stretch, briefly had a hole to run through along the rail but could not take advantage and finished one-paced down the stretch.
TALISKER BAY did not show speed from the start, raced wide and near the back of the field down the backstretch, continued to trail the field through the
turn, angled out five wide into the stretch and could do no better than chase the field to the wire.

BETTOR BET'R settled just off of the early pace and was well positioned in the opening stages, tracked the decent pace two then three wide to the quarter
marker, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, surged in
deep stretch, caught SHADOWED THOUGHTS in the final strides and got up on the wire to prevail. SHADOWED THOUGHTS was bumped at the start but
was away in good order and was prominent in the early running, contested the decent early pace outside of PONDERGATING then assumed command into
the turn, set a moderate pace to the quarter marker and drew to a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, was all out
to hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch, was tagged on the wire for the win and just held for the place. BROOKYS GAL was prominent leaving the start,
took back and tracked the decent early pace from the inside, lost ground along the turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole, came in tight and waited
for racing room in upper stretch, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds, closed fast into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed for the
win and place, while well clear of the rest for the show. STREET TIGER broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the decent early pace from
the outside, gained ground four wide approaching the quarter pole, maintained that four wide path into the stretch, shifted five wide at mid-stretch and lost
ground nearing the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth and finished evenly. BABY I'M A STAR was allowed to settle away
from the start, tracked the decent early pace two wide into the turn and chased to the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, responded to urging
inside of the furlong marker and improved position in deep stretch. PONDERGATING broke out at the start but was away in good order and pressed the
decent early pace from the inside, lost position into the turn and chased to the quarter pole, ran evenly while in pursuit to mid-stretch and faded in the final
stages. SYGRAYEM bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, rushed up in the early stages and raced close to the decent early pace, stalked
three then two wide into the turn and raced within aim at the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, lacked a late
response and tired. CHAMAVILLE lost her path at the start and was away slowly, chased the early pace from the rear, saved ground along the turn and did
not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
I'M GONNA SHINE got a good break but was not involved in the early pace down the backstretch, raced at the head of the tracking group to the turn, idled
in traffic near the three-furlong pole while surrounded by horses, found a hole near the rail at the three-sixteenths marker, responded to a vigorous hand ride
surged between horses and prevailed. SELSAE outrun from the break, settled well off the pace, launched a bid from the three furlong pole but had to work
through traffic, got clear near the three sixteenths pole, swung five wide into clear and produced a bold rally down the stretch to just miss. HARBOR
DEAREST was quick away from the gate and pulled the rider towards the lead, was taken firmly in hand and kept a couple of lengths behind HEAVENLY
VIOLET, was let loose at the three furlong marker, pulled even at the quarter pole, then set down at the top of the stretch and battled gamely to the wire only
to come up short. VALERIE broke well but ceded the lead, choosing to track the pacesetter from a few lengths back, started a forward move from the three
furlong pole, pulled even three wide turning for home then ran on well but flattened a bit late and was passed for a minor award. HARBOR'S BEAUTY was
bumped by ZEE PERFECT RUN at the break and in turn bumped into JUST SERENE, had to regroup and lagged behind for the backstretch run, made an
extended bid through the turn to get into striking position, lugged in a bit at the top of the stretch and ended up looking for running room while behind a wall
of horses, was kept to task and gained late. JUST SERENE bumped hard by HARBOR'S BEAUTY at the break and was away last, chased the pack from
far behind, tried to make up some ground through the turn but was forced to travel three to four wide, came into the stretch about five wide kept grinding
away and managed to improve a couple of positions. ZEE PERFECT RUN veered out sharply at the start, pushing HARBOR'S BEAUTY into JUST
SERENE, took up then was forced to chased from the back of the field through the turn, kept to task down the stretch and was gaining some in the late
stages. REALLY SATISFYING got away well then was allowed to find a comfortable rhythm through the early going, moved up into contention on the turn
while saving ground along the rail, was still with a chance near the eighth pole but could not keep up in the final furlong. HEAVENLY VIOLET broke sharply
from the outside, moved over to the rail when clear, came under pressure passing the quarter pole and faded down the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER showed speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set a fast pace into the turn and showed the way to the
quarter marker while prompted by MAYCEE JO, kicked to a clear lead into upper stretch, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt late
pressure from TURA LURA, was fully extended in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. TURA LURA was forwardly placed leaving the start
and tracked the fast early pace, chased two wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, tipped three wide into the stretch and chased
SUPERSONIC FLYER to the furlong grounds, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, rallied in deep stretch, pressured the winner in the final strides,
just missed for the win on the wire and was clear in the end for second. GET'EM TIGER tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, chased two wide
and between runners heading to the quarter marker, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the
final sixteenth, was outkicked by the top two in deep stretch and outfinished CODE RIBBON in the final strides to secure third. CODE RIBBON was
squeezed leaving the start and took up at the break, regrouped and was allowed to settle in the early running, raced two wide into the turn, angled three
wide at the quarter marker, was guided four wide into the stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, drifted out in the final furlong but was gaining
in deep stretch and missed for the show honors. MAYCEE JO showed early speed and was prominent away from the start, stalked the fast pace into the
turn and kept close attendance to SUPERSONIC FLYER heading to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased SUPERSONIC FLYER to
the furlong marker, could not muster a late response and weakened. SHOUT IT OUT chased the fast early pace outside of rivals, raced three wide to the
quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. LADY IN A HURRY was unhurried leaving the start, saved ground into the turn, tipped
to the two path into upper stretch and offered a mild late rally. SHELBY GOLD chased the fast early pace while between runners, lost ground into the turn
and raced two wide to the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and did not factor. RUNNING LUCK chased the fast early pace from the inside,
dropped back nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR broke sharply but backed away from the developing three-way speed duel, moved closer while holding the rail when that trio split up
passing the half mile pole, waited for room through the turn, slipped through the inside path when RALLY CAT left the rail open at the head of the stretch,
sprinted away from the rest and won geared down. MY DAD IS THIRSTY bumped twice with R M C HOOK'EM after the start, then rushed up to be part of a
three-horse pace duel then was three wide and fell back a bit on the turn as RALLY CAT quickened away, re-bid and was in the middle of a five-horse fan
into the stretch, kept to task down the stretch and outfinished all but the winner. RALLY CAT broke best and seized the lead from the gate, was soon joined
by ROISTER to the inside and MY DAD IS THIRSTY to the outside, slipped away from that pair passing the half-mile marker, tried to put some distance on
the field from the five-sixteenths pole but became surrounded by challenges at the top of the stretch, still held the lead, battled gamely and held off all but
the eventual winner to mid-stretch only to lose the place in the final yards. R M C HOOK'EM exchanged bumps with MY DAD IS THIRSTY after the break,
remained to the outside in the clear through the early stages, made a five wide sweeping move through the turn, came into the stretch on the outside of five
horses bidding to take command in the stretch, finished up well but did not have another gear when called upon. DEALERS HAND was content to track
behind the pace duel down the backstretch, then became stuck behind horses through the turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch run but could not
produce the needed response. ROISTER got away well then rushed up to race between a trio contesting the early pace, did not respond when RALLY CAT
quickened near the half mile pole, attempted to re-engage approaching the quarter pole, was in good position turning into the stretch but weakened in the
final furlong. HARBOR SKY rider lost the right iron right after the break, struggled for control then intentionally slipped out the left iron passing the half mile
pole, opting to ride bareback the rest of the way, swung six wide into the stretch, kept to task with a steady hand ride and managed to out-finish one.
CONTINENTAL UNION was away a bit slowly then under pressure to keep pace through the early going, raced four to five wide through the turn the swung
out to the seven path for the stretch run and flattened out.
