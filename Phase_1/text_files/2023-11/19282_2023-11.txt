Footnotes
MR. DUMBLEDORE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved from that point, rounded
the turn in the three path and dug in determinedly to eke out the edge over SHOOT THE BREEZE in the final yards. The latter raced with the pace inside,
dueled nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, and put Break The Chains away midway on the far turn, dug in to
the stretch challenge of Mr. Dumbledore leaving the turn but relented in the final yards. DANTE'S INFERNO saved ground well off the early pace, raced at
the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and came along for third the final strides. LOVE IS WICKED became a bit fractious in the gate then rated
close inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, closed to a boxed in position at the rail approaching the eighth pole then flattened the
final sixteenth. BREAK THE CHAINS raced with the pace two deep then dueled toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage into the
turn but dropped back midway through the turn and weakened. SEABROOK ISLAND came out and made contact with I'MLIVINGTHEDREAM leaving the
gate then rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. The latter became
a bit fractious in the gate and was bumped at the break, raced well back two deep on the opening turn and showed little response.

Footnotes
BURR HILL BULLET stalked two deep then challenged approaching the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in for
the nod mid-stretch and raced clear later yards. CURB THAT TIGER saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced
at the rail on the far turn, eased outward mid-stretch and dueled through the final yards for second. ASTRAYAL raced off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, raced evenly in the lane and was outfinished for second the final yards. I SEE
NOTHING rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
JOOBY DOOBY DOO rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn
but weakened mid-stretch. HILLBILLY ROCK saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. SUGAR
LIPS was never a factor. CHARTERED COURSE was never a factor.

three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. RED HOT TODDY steadied at the break then saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn
then flattened in the lane. COMEONTURNMELOOSE raced off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. MONKEY WRENCH took a quick lead and showed the way inside, was met
past the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but faded on the far turn. LAURA'S GRAND stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase

Footnotes
GREY FLAMINGO pressured the pace through the backstretch and raced close in the three path on the turn, took the lead nearing mid-stretch and edged
away later yards. MSSNAP set a pressured pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail but was met nearing mid-stretch and relented from
that point. SWISS HORIZON pressured the pace inside, raced close off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. VIESTE gave chase, raced in the
three path on the turn then flattened stride. JUNIPER GRACE became edgy in the gate and broke a step slow, picked up the chase leaving the half mile
pole, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. RUMORGOINGAROUND gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and ran
evenly in the lane. BIT OF BLESSINGS gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. LIME STAR gave chase inside then faded
at the rail on the turn.
