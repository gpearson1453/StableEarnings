Footnotes
MOTION TO STRIKE stalked up close and outside travelling four wide on the turn, was encouraged along three furlongs out, was guided out a bit nearing
the eighth pole, drove past inside the final sixteenth. BREAKING NEWS was taken back from between the leading pair early then shifted in and moved up to
press along the rail, dropped back again and came out a bit seeking room in upper stretch, edged nearer coming to the furlong grounds but checked on
heels and altered outside those two past the furlong marker, finished up to get up for second. CHARLI MICHAEL was strongly urged from the break,
pressed three wide, bid in upper stretch dueling with the previous leader, edged by that one but was outkicked by two outside foes. MIDNIGHT
HURRICANE moved forward to take the lead soon after the start, forced the pace inside a rival but off the fence, was engaged by that one in upper stretch,
dueled, lugged out a path near the eighth pole, had no extra for the final furlong. GOTTA GO broke a bit awkwardly, settled mid-pack outside a foe, moved
out from three to five wide on the turn, kicked on mildly. WIN YA WIN settled outside at the rear racing four to six wide through the turn, swung eight deep
into upper stretch, kicked on mildly but needed more. JRUE BREEZE was ridden along inside, came out at the top of the stretch, needed more. TWO DOT
failed to menace while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
STAR REDEMPTION chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, challenged entering the stretch and edged
clear late. LIKE THIS led the way up the backstretch, drifted out to the four path coming around the turn, and dueled in the lane, giving way late but keeping
on to the wire. BOULDERING raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the two and three path, began a bid in upper stretch
and gained ground late. HOOSIER trailed the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, angled in to save ground around the turn and
improved position in the lane. ANDERS SMILE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path
and showed no kick. STARPORT tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and weakened in the stretch.
CHAD'S FLASH raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. CUSTOM
BOBBY'S raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded from there.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE COURAGE exchanged a couple bumps and steadied along the rail entering the first turn, tracked in behind along the inside, shifted four wide
coming to the top of the stretch, struck the lead by mid-stretch and powered clear under urging. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX had light bumps between runners at
the start, soon moved clear to set the pace, was challenged by numerous rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner but kept on to
hold the place. ROCKALL was reluctant to load, settled outside four wide early, stalked into the far turn, kept on to improve position late. FEELING FREE
bumped lightly with a rival at the start, gained forward position stalking outside a rival three wide into the first turn, bid past the five-sixteenths, needed more.
GOLDEN FLASH exchanged a light bump at the start, was in a bit tight two to three wide entering the first turn, stalked in behind, attempted to bid inside
past the five-sixteenths and again in the stretch but could not get through. STORM STRATEGY was floated four wide into the first turn, raced toward the
back, moved swiftly five to six wide on the far turn but could not sustain the effort. MY TENNIS SHOES bumped a rival heading into the first turn, stalked in
behind mostly two to three wide, failed to rally. SWEET PRESENT floated out entering the first turn in behind bumping runners then moved back nearer
inside, was outpaced and failed to rally. MEET GEORGE JETSON broke outwardly, raced toward the back in the three to four path, failed to menace.
NEVER SORRY was a bit fractious in the gate, lacked early speed despite urging, was never a threat.

EL DINERO was bumped into a rival and in tight at the start, settled well back of the leaders, saved ground, rallied inside to prevail. POP'S PEPPYSTEPER
switched out early then back to the rail for the turn, saved ground inside and off the pace, came out five wide by mid-stretch, bid near the sixteenth pole but
was outkicked. STOVALL was encouraged forward to press the pace from outside racing about three wide, bid in upper stretch taking the lead, was
outfinished. WESTERN AFLEET was lightly bumped into a rival at the start, tracked in behind inside runners, moved out five wide by the top of the stretch in
range, evened out. BLAME ME SERIOUSLY lacked early speed despite encouragement, raced toward the back in the three to four path on the urn,
improved position. SUMMERTIME PEPPERS was quick to lead, set a pressured pace inside, gave way. RISING KOTO STAR was bumped at the break,
guided nearer the rail then back off the rail heading to the turn, raced outside a foe in the three path, swung nine deep into upper stretch, was not a threat. A
THOUSAND DOLLARS chased from outside, raced mostly four to six wide, failed to rally. PRODIGY PARADISE bumped a rival lightly at the start, chased

Footnotes
MANGUM settled off the leading trio stalking those through the early going racing about four wide, moved three to four deep on the far turn, put to urging
past the five-sixteenths, floated out a path turning for home, took the lead, came out in mid-stretch to engage with an outside challenger, met that one's bid
and dug in to hold. WHO TOOK THE MONEY settled off the pace outside runners three to five wide early, began to advance outside rivals on the far turn,
came into upper stretch seven wide full of run, gained steadily and bid near the sixteenth pole but was held off. BUDRO TALKING was unhurried inside at
the back, saved ground then was guided out at the top of the stretch four to five wide, was herded in a bit in mid-stretch, bumped with that outer foe near the
sixteenth pole, got up for show between runners. WOODS N WATER saved ground inside about mid-pack early, switched out and advanced four wide from
the three-eighths, evened out in the stretch and lost show. COSMIC TRAIN raced at the back off the inside, angled five wide at the top of the stretch, altered
outside foes seven deep seeking room, drifted in through mid-stretch, bumped with a rival late and evened out. ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT was
forwardly-positioned pressing into the first turn then stalking about three wide, floated out a bit on the far turn, failed to rally. BEHEMAH STAR was urged
from the break, switched out racing off the inside in the three to four path, was forced out six wide turning for home, steadied between runners near the
furlong marker and was not persevered with thereafter. HIGHLAND CREEK moved forward outside three to four wide on the first turn to the lead, forced the
pace, shifted in, came up empty. DRILLING REPORT had the early lead into the first turn then tracked the new leader along the rail up the backstretch,
came up empty.

the leaders while lugging out a bit, struck the lead near the sixteenth pole, lasted. LANGS DAY was unhurried at the back, moved out eleven wide through
upper- to mid-stretch, was flying late but missed. JAX MAN raced off the pace between runners, encouraged along late on the turn, fanned five wide into
upper stretch, gained late. MIKE J dueled inside a runners, drifted out a bit late, had no extra. HELAIRE settled off the pace, saved ground, rallied inside.
RANCH BADGE was within range early, raced mostly three to four wide through the turn, kept on but was bumped in upper stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. BLACK SWORD stalked from outside four to five wide, failed to rally. JACK HAMMER failed to menace racing a few paths off the inside.
