Footnotes
INSPECTOR ED stalked the pace from the two path down the backstretch then dueled around the final turn and pulled away nearing the end of the bend to
prove best. K V TARGET raced near the back down the backstretch then started his bid at the three furlong marker, tipped out to five wide on the final turn
to make a late rally in the stretch to prove second best. PAPIRINGO raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn then fell back but made a rebid on
the final turn for a late run while fighting gamely. NINEJUANJUAN CALL was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the
backstretch, moved between horses at the three furlong marker to engage the leaders into the turn but faltered. ADMIRAL AFLEET raced in the middle of
the pack around the first turn then moved up from five wide down the backstretch and engaged the leaders going into the turn but flattened out. SPARKIN
roused to the front to set the pace for a half then was headed and battled around the turn and gave way. LITTLE STAR TARGET saved ground to no avail.
ASTROLOGY WONOWON tracked the leaders from off the pace to the five sixteenths pole and retreated. WILDCARD GOLD went five wide into the first
turn but was unhurried and not a factor.

MINOR DISCREPANCY pressed the pace from the two path to the final turn, moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole and matched strides through
the turn and down the stretch, brushed slightly with SPECIAL STORMY in late stretch but kept on to prevail. SPECIAL STORMY vied for the lead from the

to three wide in the stretch for a late run to be a clear third. RUMPUSINTHESKY raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved out to
four wide on the final turn but only raced evenly. HELLO MR COPELAND set the inside pace for a half, was headed at the quarter pole, dueled around the

MUCHMORETHANREADY stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then took command at the quarter pole and drew off to be an easy
winner. BLESS D'SOUTH raced near the back down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the quarter pole to circle the field but was no match for
the winner and was a clear second. SIMPLE SUNDAY was allowed to settle while racing in the middle of the pack, moved up from three wide around the
final turn to be best of the rest. MYLIES STAR was allowed to settle down the backstretch while saving ground, moved between horses at the five sixteenths
pole for a late rally. THE GREY BEAUTY was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn but failed to sustain that bid and
finished evenly. BOSTON LUCILLE was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a mild four wide bid on the final turn but was
empty in the stretch. NON BINDING vied for the lead around the first turn then took the lead at the three furlong marker, was headed at the quarter pole and
weakened. CHATAIN'S FLYER tracked the leader while racing four wide on the backstretch and retreated. FUHR MEO roused to the lead to set a
pressured pace for a half then gave way.

Footnotes
RED WHITE AND LOUD stalked the pace from four wide then launched his bid at the quarter pole and ran down the leader in late stretch to be up in the
final jumps. PARLAY PETE went to a clear early lead around the first turn then was challenged to deep stretch but couldn't fend. LIMONITE raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, move out to five wide in upper stretch to have his best strides late but couldn't catch the top two. OVERDELIVER
was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn and flattened out. DRIVE FOR FUN saved ground while vying for the lead
then lacked room going into the final turn and didn't make a rebid. DRIED PEPPER hopped at the start then raced at the back and passed tiring rivals in the
stretch. MOTATAABEQ raced near the back and was not a threat. TIZHOTNDUSTY was off the pace around the first turn then slowly faded.

Footnotes
CREEKSIDE was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack on the inside through the final turn then made a strong rail bid to just get up for the win. THE
BOSS SOSS vied for the lead from the inside down the backstretch, moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole and took the lead at the three
sixteenths pole but couldn't fend of the inside rival and lost the nod. KING OF CONTRABAND hustled to the lead from the two path down the backstretch
then was headed at the quarter pole and fought gamely through the stretch and held on for the show. MANLY DEEDS tracked the leaders down the
backstretch then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole and faltered. SONYA KNOWS BETTER was allowed to settle near the back around the first turn
then advanced from the inside and tipped out to two wide on the final turn but flattened out. JAYS HOLIDAY was unhurried early while racing near the back
down the backstretch then made a four to five wide bid on the final turn to improve his position. LUCAS ZIP IT was forwardly placed around the first turn
then made a mild bid at the three furlong marker and weakened. NATIVE STAR raced evenly in the middle of the pack. BOY CHARLIE was off the pace in
the two path to the three furlong marker then gave way. IN A BIND remained back.

Footnotes
STREET ART was within striking distance from off the rail down the backstretch then made a bid at the five sixteenths pole to take the lead at the quarter
pole, drew clear in the stretch and held on. AMERICAN SMOOTH saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack, steadily advanced on the backstretch
and made a four wide bid on the final turn for the late rally but ran out of room and was clearly second best. RAUL'S ENCANTO sprinted to a clear early
lead from the inside around the first turn, held that position until he was headed at the five sixteenths pole and tired but held on for the sho. BELLO
CREEDO prompted the pace from the two path down the backstretch then moved to engage the leader at the five sixteenths pole but weakened. FULL OF
GLORY was unhurried down the backstretch then made a late run on the turn and only passed tiring rivals. CARLOS' BLAST raced in the middle of the
pack from the two path, made a mild bid into the final turn but lacked the late response. UNCLE BRAD went five wide into the first turn and raced four wide
down the backstretch but was not a factor. BULLETSREVENGE was off the pace around the first turn, saved ground but never made a bid.

SCRAPPY ARTIE roused to the front to vie for the lead from three wide then took the lead at the quarter pole and drew clear at the top of the stretch and
held on. HOSTILE AFLEET trailed the field early then circled the field and made a strong late rally. SIR ELI chased the leaders and passed tiring rivals in
the stretch. UPTOWN SOCIAL had good early speed then vied for the lead on the turn and tired. PENETRATOR was hustled away to be off the pace,
angled out to three wide for a mild bid on the turn and weakened. RUN AWAY SON was always back. STURGILL hustled to press the pace from the inside
to the turn and gave way.

MOSQUITO FLEET stalked the pace from three wide then was coaxed at the three furlong marker and took command at the quarter pole to draw clear and
prove best. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL went to a clear lead for a half then was overtaken at the quarter pole but was tiring and held on for the place. LOUIS
LE GRANDE tracked the leaders from the inside down the backstretch, angled out to three wide on the final turn to make a late run but was no match for the
winner. AMERICAIN JOEY raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn and finished evenly. NATE'S REVENGE
was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch to improve his
position. MIAS MOONBEAM was unhurried to the top of the stretch then made a three wide bid and showed mild late interest. THRILL RIDE was off the
pace for a half and gave way. COOL INDIVIDUAL was allowed to settle around the first turn the made a mild gain on the backstretch but lacked a rally.
