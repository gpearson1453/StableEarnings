Footnotes
KEEN CONTENDER trailed early on, circled rivals with a four wide move around the turn to bid outside of the clear leader entering the lane, assumed
command in upper stretch, kicked away under a drive then was put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. TONE ELISE leaned outwardly and brushed a foe
at the start, tracked two wide, came under urging in the three path to gain along with an outer rival around the turn, but was outmoved by that one entering
the lane, ran on to gain place leaving the furlong grounds and fended off an inner bidder to the wire. FREE TIME tracked along the inside, was shuffled back
in the two path behind a faltering foe around the turn, regained stride while cutting the corner entering the lane, sustained a rail charge to bid for place along
the inside in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. RECOGNIZE ME vied two wide and between horses, emerged to shake clear approaching the turn, met
an outer challenge while entering the lane in the two path, offered little resistance in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. COMMANDERS
PALACE prompted three wide exiting the chute, chased the clear leader two wide around the turn and weakened between horses entering the lane.
SUNDAY GRACE took light contact from an inner rival at the start, vied inside of a pair of foes leaving the chute, chased an outer clearing counterpart
cornering into the curve, but weakened at the three furlong pole, was done early and found to have bled.

Footnotes
HUSH IT HONEY was a bit antsy just before the off, vied outside of a rival while kept in the three path, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole,
repelled an outer challenge while shifting to the four path entering the lane and drew off under a drive. SAKURA SKY broke outwardly, raced off of the pace
four wide, shifted inwardly at the five furlong pole, gained show and tracked the top two into the turn, ranged up outside of them and in the four path turning
for home, but was turned away by the leader while getting floated to the five path entering the lane and maintained place thereafter. LOST LOVE acted up
momentarily while awaiting the start, then leaned inwardly when the gates sprung, trailed in the three path around the turn, swung out to the seven path
entering the lane and ran on willingly outside of foes to reach show at the wire. SHARP FLAME was off a bit slow and laid off of the pace exiting the chute,
shied from an outer rival and bumped an inner foe at the five furlong pole, pursued in the thee path and between horses into the turn, continued on into the
lane, but drifted inwardly in upper stretch, chased while vying for show with outer rivals in the late stages but missed. VINO FROM ERNIES took contact
from an outer rival at the five furlong pole while off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, offered a mild kick to vie for show
between horses in the stages but was outfinished. BABE IN THE WOODS pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped off the fence in upper stretch but
lacked a bid. SCARLET MISS shifted inwardly at the start, lugged outwardly through the chute while prominent inside of foes, showed the way in the two
path as an outer rival pressed, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole and folded through the lane. PARKINGTON broke awkwardly and was
floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in the five path, but faded while tipping in entering the turn. INTERCEPTION chased in
the four path, but faded turning for home before being floated to tee eight path entering the lane.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL KING prompted along the inside leaving the chute, backed off to stalk soon after, shifted to the four path and outside of the top pair and to the
four path entering the turn, chased them turning for home, inched closer in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. DOG RED pressed
the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, but was bested by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds,
yielded yet saved place from an inner bidder late. EL FRANCO was a bit restless in the gate then broke inwardly, tracked along the inside, pursued under
urging around the turn, kept on in the final furlong to bid for place in the final sixteenth but just missed. CARMICHAEL set the pace in the two path,
confidently embraced an outer challenge turning for home, but offered little response once set down while getting headed entering the lane and faltered
between horses in midstretch. MR. PETERKIN lagged well behind the rest down the backstretch, yet cut the gap on them in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MIXER broke outwardly, raced off of the pace in the six path, moved down to the four path into the turn, tipped in for a clear lane inside of rivals turning for
home, gained to take aim outside of the leader entering the lane, drove past at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, changed over and kicked
clear. CRAZY CAMI bumped an outer rival at the start before exchanging multiple blows with that one through the early stages, lacked speed two wide, split
foes turning for home, gained show from an outer rival in midstretch and rallied to reach place at the wire. TALE OF LA BEE rushed forward after breaking
slow and being last away, showed the way inside of a trio of rivals early on, led from only a single outer presser turning for home, inched away in upper
stretch as an outer MIXER took aim, but was bested by that one at the furlong grounds, yielded and got nailed at the wire for place. TEMPTING LADY
prompted three wide and between horses, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from the four path around the bend, then chased between
horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MIDNIGHT ANGEL bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, exchanged contact with that one again while put
to crowded quarters soon after, steadied once pinched among foes in the aftermath, trailed, gained in the five to six path around the turn and improved
position while leveling off. MODAROSA vied four wide, sustained pressure outside of the leader and from the three path around the bend, but faltered in the
four path in upper stretch. BRIGHT LADY DAY vied two wide and between horses, but yielded around the turn and weakened. SHE'S A SHOPPER lacked
speed in the three path, inched closer in the four to five path along with an outer rival around the turn, but hung on her left lead behind foes in upper stretch
and lacked a bid. MARGARET'S LADY chased along the inside and gave way. SILVERY MOON pursued two wide and between horses, but weakened
between horses to trail passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SUPREMELY dueled for the lead along the inside, got headed by an outer SOUND DOCTRINE with five sixteenths pole, reclaimed an advantage from that
wide rival in upper stretch, gamely fended him off through midstretch, then inched away entering the final sixteenth. SOUND DOCTRINE prompted the pace
four wide, led turning for home, but relinquished the advantage to an inner counterpart in upper stretch, got turned away in the final furlong and yielded at
the sixteenth pole. FAN THE FIRE tracked two wide and between horses, put an inner rival to crowded quarters approaching the quarter pole, then ran on
between horses in midstretch and gained show from an outer rival with a sixteenth to go. MASTER OF ARMS broke a step slow, tracked three to four wide
and between horses around the turn, gained show while chasing in upper stretch, briefly drifted from a left handed crop passing the three sixteenths pole,
then was bested for show by an inner rival at the sixteenth marker. POWER ALLEY trailed in the two path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and
moved up. WHAT A BLAST sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home and caved in hand. BALSA stalked in the five
path, chased in the six path entering the lane and faded. RIVOLI vied three wide and between horses then weakened nearing the lane. GUNNER BAY
broke a step slow, chased along the inside, gave way turning for home, steadied when put to tight rail quarters nearing the quarter pole and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
ENGLISH TAVERN stalked two wide, bid into the far turn, gained an advantage around that bend, drew clear in upper stretch and lasted safely from an
outer oncharging bidder late. FAIR DINKUM was severely slammed and pinched between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, bided time in the three
path behind rivals around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, rallied and gained place while shifting inwardly a touch at the furlong
grounds, closed in on the leader in the final sixteenth but ran out of ground. NATIVE THUNDER laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five to six
path while between horses in upper stretch, got subtly floated in by an outer rival causing contact with an inner foe at the furlong grounds, yet ran on to
secure show. FEBRUARY SON broke inwardly and squarely bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two to three wide, chased in the four
path and among foes in upper stretch, but bumped with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, yet kept on for a minor share. ALEX JOON settled off of the
pace in the two path, took the far turn four wide, chased in the five path and between horses in upper stretch, but took contact from rivals on either side at
the furlong grounds and gave way. TARTUFO vied along the inside, backed off to stalk around the first turn, then chased while aiming for a rail seam
through the lane. CHANCEUX stuttered a step before bobbling at the start, tracked three wide, attempted a bid outside of the new leader turning for home,
but was turned away in upper stretch and weakened between horses in the final furlong. FRANZ JOSEF took firm contact from an outer rival at the start,
vied in the three path, led and crossed over down the backstretch, but was headed by an outer bidder around the far turn, weakened in upper stretch, then
steadied between horses at the sixteenth pole. PINE KNOLL tracked along the inside, pursued between horses into the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
MINK'S PALACE tracked from midpack in the three path, split foes five wide entering the lane to take aim on the leader, bid at the furlong grounds, edged
ahead entering the final sixteenth and held. LEMON MUFFIN broke slowly and leaned inwardly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, shifted six wide in
midstretch and offered a late kick to reach place at the wire while running out of ground to reel in the leader. CANDY LOVER stalked in the three path, bid at
the three furlong pole, led turning for home, but was collared by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, got bested entering the final sixteenth and was
nailed for place. CRUISE MISSILE leaned outwardly at the start, prompted between the top pair early on, but was herded inwardly by his outer counterpart
at the nine sixteenths pole, pressed two wide and between horses under urging into the turn, then sustained a rail chase through the lane. FIGGY pursued
from the two path and ran on between horses. UNION MIST broke a step slow, raced off of the pace two wide, gradually shifted five wide coming to
midstretch and chased evenly between horses. JUST A COED rushed forward to prompt along the inside, but lost action when put to tight rail quarters by
outer rivals at the nine sixteenths pole, tracked in the three into the turn, took aim four wide entering the lane but gave way between horses. SPEIGHTER
WOMAN chased in the four to five path around the turn, floated six wide entering the lane and gave way. IN JUST MY HEELS was outrun. BERNAR MOSA
lacked speed in the five path and faded in the six path around the turn. MOENCHANTED broke slowly and drifted in multiple paths at the start, trailed along
the inside into the turn and made little impact. QUIMICHIS took brushes from rivals on both sides at the start, showed the way outside of a pair of rivals
shifted inwardly without being clear at the nine sixteenths pole, drew clear into the turn, but was headed by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole and
stopped.
