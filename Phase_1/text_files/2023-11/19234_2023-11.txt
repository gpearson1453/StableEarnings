Footnotes
SADIE THE GOAT pressed the pace two wide, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. BONMATI set the pace inside,
continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. CLASSIC BALLAD rated off the pace two wide between foes, tipped three wide midway
around the far turn, rallied outside and just missed second. ENTICING SUNSET raced off the pace two wide, rallied between foes and was in a bit tight in
the final strides. WOW LUCKY stalked the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. NORTHERN ROAD failed to menace while racing three wide.
SONADORA GIRL rated back early, steadied incessantly while saving ground and weakened through the lane. BETTY trailed while racing two and three
wide.

Footnotes
BEACH READY set the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, opened up while floating out to the five path going into the stretch, and held
sway under a drive. FLYING BLACK had an awkward start, raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed between foes early around the far turn, and ran
on from the three path down the lane for place. SHE FLED THE SCENE tracked in the four path, was driven around the far turn, swung out to the six path
entering the stretch, and kept on for show. TIZ ENOUGH stalked in the three path, tipped inside under rousing going into the far turn, angled outward and
was in the six path passing the eighth pole, but was one paced. DUBSTEP had a slow start and trailed in the two path, circled inner foes in the five path
around the far turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, but flattened. PANOTTI rated in the two path but never threatened. LA RUSIA prompted the
pace in the four path but gaveway turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
FIONA'S MAGIC set the pace in the two path, shot clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. TINKI ABARRIO was lugging in early, dispute the pace
between foes, bumped and checked near the half-mile pole, chased the pace in the two path around most of the turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole
and ran on to gain the place. DERBY HANGOVER was fractious in the gate, vied inside of the winner, chased that foe at the rail around the turn and
churned on through the lane to save the show. MAMA BELLA settled off the early pace outside, made steady three wide bid around the turn, reached near
even terms outside of the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. U LITE UP MY LIFE lunged at the start, saved
ground and never threatened. FAR AND FEW had early speed inside, was bumped into the rail and forced to take up near the half-mile pole and had no
further bids while racing two wide. KISSING ROCK broke slowly and was never involved while racing three wide. PANTHER CROSSING trailed in the three
path. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE HALF-MILE AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
HURRICANE J set the pace in the three path, was confidently handled in the two path around the turn, received a right handed cue at the top of the lane,
and went clear in the final furlong under a drive. REAL TALK prompted the pace in the two path, was roused in the three path midway around the turn, and
chased on for place. WILLY BOI had a slow start, trailed in the four path, was put to a ride going into the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane,
and kept on for show. DOC AMSTER rated inside, was coaxed from the rail passing the three-eighths, cut the corner going into the stretch, but flattened. A.
P.'S SECRET broke out at the start, chased in the six path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and made no impact. CATTIN tracked in the
five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. POSITIVE REVIEW stalked in the four path but faded between foes
turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
YOUKNOWNOTHING settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, kicked in, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and dug in
inside of TAPE RUNNER to prevail. TAPE RUNNER raced well back three wide, swung out in upper stretch, closed outside, reached near even terms
outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole but was turned back. VIVE VEUVE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide
around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole but was no match for the top two late. LETS GO KOKO raced in range four wide,
took the lead three deep near the three-eighths pole, was collared in upper stretch, fought on to deep stretch and weakened late. WONDER WAVE (IRE)
chased the pace two and three wide, angled out turning for home but lugged in badly through the stretch. LADY BLITZ raced in range inside and lacked a
closing bid. TIME IS MAGIC set the pace inside, yielded near the three-eighths pole, chased inside around the rest of the far turn, swung out turning for
home, bore out in upper stretch and dropped back while continuing to race erratically. FREE CHARGING chased the pace four wide and retreated through
the lane. SHINKA played no factor while racing five wide around the first turn and saving some ground around the far turn. HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL pressed
the pace two wide and faltered around the far turn. WHO LADY WHO dwelt and never reached contention. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START AND RULED THAT WHO LADY WHO CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE.

HANCOCK stalked in the five path, bid from the three path going into the turn, took the lead midway around the turn, and kicked away in the two path down
the lane under a drive. GO BILLY GO bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace along the rail, was ridden into the turn, had to steady
midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, and chased on. DIVO D'ORO bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the
three path, was driven along the inside around the turn, and got up for show. RYE'S MY GUY led in the two path, was roused into the turn, but lost the lead
midway around the turn, and faded from the four path down the lane. BIG TOBY pressed in the four path but backed up around the turn. ORB ALPHA trailed

FLYING LIAM set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. BETTA GO GO GO settled off the early pace outside, made progress four and five
wide around the turn and was clearly second best in the lane. DON'T ANSWER raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and was
along for the show. HEY RIVER saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and weakened. AJAAYB stalked the pace three wide and came
up empty in the lane. MIGHTY MIRACLE pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane. HAZON was outrun while racing five wide.

BEDTIME STORY bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close alongside the leader in the three path, bid going into the turn, stuck a head in front
passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and inched clear under a drive. FULMINATE set the pace in the two path, was
roused along the inside passing the three-eighths, lost the lead passing the quarter, but kept on in the two path down the stretch to hold place. TREVESS
stalked inside, was roused midway around the turn, swung out to the four path of the top of the stretch, and dug in to hold show. SONICUS raced wellback
in the five path, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and stayed on. BIG BAND LUZZIANN chased in the
two path, was coaxed between foes in the three path early around the turn, and finished evenly between foes from the five path in the stretch. LOVIN
MAKES CENTS had her head turned at the start, rated in the two path, but was stymied along the inside early around the turn, and flattened. ATHENA'S
WISDOM bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but never menaced.
