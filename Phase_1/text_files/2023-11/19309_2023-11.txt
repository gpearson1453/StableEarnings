Footnotes
KOPION broke well then settled outside rivals, moved to within range four deep entering the turn, bid outside the top pair then dueled with SHE'S A
TEMPEST three wide entering the stretch, put away inner rival approaching the eighth pole and drew off under hand urging. SHE'S A TEMPEST vied three
deep early then dueled outside TOULOUSE DETRAC, cleared that rival past the five-sixteenths pole then had to battled with KOPION with a quarter mile
left to run, fought two wide into the lane, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but was clearly second best. CRITICISM tracked off the rail
up the backstretch then went between rivals nearing the turn, exited the bend three deep and churned on for a clear third. ULTIMATE AUTHORITY showed
early speed between rivals then got put in a bit tight at the nine-sixteenths pole but did not lose much ground, chased the top pair three deep between rivals
into the turn, got put in a bit tight again early on the bend, traveled four deep into the lane and weakened. DISCREPANCY broke a step slow, moved down
to the inside to give chase, suffered a mild shuffle behind TOULOUSE DETRAC on the turn before gaining an opening along the rail, then weakened in the
drive. TOULOUSE DETRAC vied inside a pair of rivals then dueled with SHE'S A TEMPEST, could not keep pace with outer rivals approaching the quarter
pole and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
LAMBEAU sped clear and showed the way early while moving inside, met bids from outer pair on the turn, came off the rail a bit into the stretch allowing
JAMMING EDDY an opening along the fence, maintained a short lead over rivals on both sides through the final furlong and held gamely to the wire.
SANTOS TO WILSON bumped outer rival in the beginning, had to steady behind JAMMING EDDY early, chased two wide into the turn, angled out and
came five wide into the lane, rallied down the middle part of the track but could not get by the winner. JAMMING EDDY stalked the pace from inside into the
turn, saved ground around the bend, gained a clear run up the fence when LAMBEAU moved off the rail into the lane, challenged from inside, had the rider
lose the whip at the eighth pole, continued gamely under hand urging but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. ESTABLISHED raced up close
outside rivals, bid three deep on the turn, fought four deep into the final furlong, finished gamely but got outkicked in the end. IMPOSSIBLE TASK took a
bump from inside at the start, chased outside a rival then three wide into the turn, eased out around the bend and traveled six wide turning for home but
failed to rally when needed. DISKO TRIBUTE forwardly placed between rivals, challenged between rivals on the turn, fought to the eighth pole and
weakened.

Footnotes
PHENOM stalked the leading pair in the two path into the turn, moved out to take aim four wide into the stretch, took over with a furlong left to run, kicked
clear and was ridden out late. ANGELCENTS chased along the rail into the turn, spun two wide into the lane, cut back inside to challenge outer trio and was
no match for the winner late. DANCING SOUL dueled outside SHE'S RESILIENT up the backstretch and around the turn, got floated out a bit to the three
path entering the lane, fought between rivals to the eighth pole, could not kick on in the furlong grounds but managed to save the show. A NEW PEACE
traveled two wide at the back into the turn, entered the lane four wide, offered a mild response to urging and missed the show. ON PURPOSE tracked in the
two path, spun three wide into the lane and lacked further response. SHE'S RESILIENT went up to duel with DANCING SOUL, fought into and around the
bend, drifted out a bit into the lane, stayed on to the eighth pole, then weakened. QUIET SECRETARY settled off the pace and moved inside, saved ground
to the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA TIGER dueled between rivals then outside CAROL'S COMIC on the turn, cleared that rival at the quarter pole and drew away in the furlong
grounds under urging. EL REY DORADO was off a bit slow to begin, chased two wide into and around the turn, finished willingly through the lane but could
not threaten the winner. JOHN DUNBAR away quickly from outside, pressed three deep to the turn, chased inner rivals then after the lone leader three wide
around the bend, could not make any headway on the winner late but kept on to secure the show. BIG DRINKER broke a step slow and dropped back,
traveled along the rail into the turn, shifted to the two path then came three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. CAROL'S COMIC dueled for
command from inside, getting out while the rider did his best to keep her from drifting approaching the quarter pole, continued along the rail into the lane,
tried to drifted again in upper stretch and had to be corrected, then weakened in the late stages. SURE PROSPECT sat off the pace, went four wide into the
turn, exited the bend five wide and was not a factor. SMILING RULER chased greenly up the backstretch while coaxed along, entered the turn along the rail,
dropped back around the bend, raced three wide turning for home and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CANE CREEK ROAD showed early speed four deep between rivals then got put in tight and steadied at the half-mile pole, chased three deep into the turn,
swung five wide into the lane, rallied into deep stretch and drove past. KING APOLLO traveled along the inside near the back into the turn, steered out
around the bend and spun four wide into the lane, angled out widest to unleash a rally and was gaining to the wire. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) broke a bit
slow, moved into range under coaxing from inside, continued to draw closer on the turn, tipped two wide into the lane, challenged the leader past the eighth
pole, got floated out at the sixteenth marker and lacked the needed late punch. SAWASDEE set the pace under pressure from outer rival, cleared around
the bend, asked right handed at the eighth pole, tested by PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) shortly after, drifted out entering the final sixteenth and yielded late.
INCH settled outside rivals then had to steady at the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two then three wide, summoned a mild rally and improved position.
MISTER ICEMAN raced up close between rivals then chased two wide into the turn, got shuffled behind a rival at the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the
inside, tipped out in upper stretch, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining, got floated out at the sixteenth pole and flattened. VORPAL was
off a bit slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside to the stretch and could not threaten. SILARDI chased five then three deep early, remained three deep
into the turn, bumped with inner rival at the quarter pole, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK pressed the leader up the
backstretch, lost touch with that rival early on the turn, chased between foes and bumped with SILARDI at the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane.

DEVIL MOON took control early and set the pace outside K P KWEST, cleared that rival approaching the quarter pole, moved over to the inside leaving the
bend, continued clear into deep stretch, grew a bit weary late but was able to hold on. BUCK OWENS coaxed along near the back, left the backstretch three
wide then dove down to the rail on the turn, tipped out into the stretch, rallied steadily through the lane and just missed. ELEVADO chased on the inside into
the turn, eased off the fence around the bend, spun three wide into the lane, was closest in pursuit entering the final furlong but finished evenly late. PLAY
CHICKEN chased outside a rival or two wide into the turn, ridden along around the bend, raced four wide into the lane and kept on for a minor award.
TENTH STREET DON off sluggishly and took a bit to get going early then moved closer while steering off the inside, rounded the bend three, four, then five
wide and lacked a rally in the lane. K P KWEST forced the pace early from inside, came under a ride to stay with DEVIL MOON on the turn, lost touch with
that rival outside the quarter pole and weakened down the stretch. TOP OF MY GAME climbed early and dropped back, trailed on the inside into the turn,
moved out to leave the bend five wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LAKOTA SPIRIT tracked the pace from inside through both turns, launched a bid along the fence in upper stretch, took over in the furlong grounds and drew
clear late. BOLT'S BROAD brushed at the start, traveled between rivals off the pace early, drew closer two to three wide on the far turn, tipped out and
challenged four deep in upper stretch, was outkicked by LAKOTA SPIRIT in deep stretch and held the place. LUMINIFEROUS stalked from the two path,
asked right handed at the quarter pole, turned for home four wide, finished willingly but could not get by BOLT'S BROAD for second. KLEEN KARMA
bumped with outer rival at the start, sat off the pace along the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, altered inward midstretch and finished willingly for a minor
placing. GRACE PERIOD (FR) traveled three deep around the first turn off the pace, went between rivals on the backstretch, rounded the far turn two wide,
then steered out in the lane but could not rally. TIERGARTEN keen early while forwardly placed in hand, pressed the pace on the backstretch then chased
past the half-mile marker, shifted to the two path on the far turn, drew alongside the leader into the lane, took over briefly in upper stretch, then relinquished
the lead and flattened out. MISS MONARCH BAY settled outside a pair of rivals, got shuffled back on the far turn, angled into the two path leaving the bend,
found the rail in the stretch and failed to menace. IDESSIA bumped with inner rival at the start, trailed early on the inside, moved out and went four deep into
the far turn, steered out further in the drive and lacked the needed response. ANKYRAH pulled early between rivals, chased three deep into and around the
far turn and faded down the lane. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER set the pace early in the two path, took pressure on the backstretch then cleared at the
half-mile pole, pressured by TIERGARTEN again entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch, bothered by outer rival coming in and steadied
midstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MR FISK chased along the three path early, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the top pair past the five-sixteenths pole, challenged
again three deep into the lane, kicked clear midstretch and held safely over SKINNER late. SKINNER came away cleanly then dropped back early, trailed in
the three path around the clubhouse turn, advanced four deep in the middle stages, lost ground on the far turn while in the four path, kept on willingly in the
drive to gain the place but could not reach the winner. NEWGRANGE stalked in the two path, bid between leaving the backstretch, dueled outside
ARROWTHEGREAT on the far turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, put away inner rival then fought with MR FISK to the eighth pole, lost command
shortly after and weakened. ARROWTHEGREAT took control early and set the pace on the inside, met bids from outer rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole,
dueled inside NEWGRANGE through the far turn, lost command leaving the bend and gave way in the stretch run. KISS TODAY GOODBYE tracked two
wide early, went between rivals in the middle stages, chased two wide then spun four wide into the lane and came up empty in the lane. CELESTIAL MOON
broke a step slow, moved inside to give chase but began to climb, continued with the awkward gait around the clubhouse turn, up the backstretch and into
the far turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and failed to menace. VISITANT stalked along the inside, started to weaken on the far turn and tired
in the stretch.
