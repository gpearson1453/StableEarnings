GLORY O dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, drew off in mid stretch and was clearly much the best in the end. SEXY BROWN rallied on the
turn while four wide, was in a strong drive in the stretch and was second best in the end. OKIE CODE was two wide early then in tight and shuffled back
going into the turn, rallied three wide and moved back to be two wide in the stretch but was no menace in late stretch. GOSPEL CHOSEN dueled for the
lead while inside into the turn, was in a long drive but faltered in late stretch. TOTAL INSANITY chased the pace while inside, was checked off heels going
into the turn and shuffled back, made a bid in upper stretch but came up empty in late stretch. LITTLE RIVER JEWEL chased the early pace while three
wide into the turn, was forced out in upper stretch and faltered in the drive.
