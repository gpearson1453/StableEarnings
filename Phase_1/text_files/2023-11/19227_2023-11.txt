Footnotes
DESTINY RO was situated on the rail in midfield in the beginning, crept closer on the fence down the backside, was under a strong hold in the two path
looking for a seam behind the leaders at the quarter pole, had clear running room five wide straightening out for the drive and drew off under a hand ride in
deep stretch. CAMAROSA travelled in mid-pack on the outside at the half mile marker, advanced smartly three wide between foes at the three furlong
marker maintaining forward position, loomed five wide at the top of the stretch but was no match for the runaway winner in the final sixteenth. PENNYJET
stalked on the fence near the rear down the back straight, waited on the rail behind a wall of rivals with three furlongs to run, angled outside midway through
the far turn picking up runners, was in the mix in the five path driving to the wire, finished up well but could not go on with the winner but still closed soundly
to make it a race for the place share in the end. SECORD was reined back through the first turn to track the engaged leaders down the backside on the rail,
was coaxed for more keeping in close range just behind the contesting front pack at the quarter pole, slipped up the fence at the top of the lane and finished
up evenly to the wire to settle on the fringes. INITTOWINIT had a slim advantage on the fence on the first turn, dictated a comfortable pace along the
backstretch while pressed on the outside, dueled for the lead around the final bend, was surrounded by rivals at the top of the stretch and tired at the furlong
marker. SILENT PATSY prompted the pace outside in the first turn, hounded the frontrunner down the backside, dueled for the lead between runners at the
quarter pole, could not find more straightening out for home and faltered at the top of the stretch. GOOD BYE NEW YORK had one horse beat in the early
stages, made an early move four wide circling around rivals at the seven sixteenths marker, could not sustain the run turning for home and gave way in
upper stretch. TEXENSIS was away slowly spotting the field into the first turn, continued to trail down the backstretch and passed a tired foe in upper
stretch. SIX FOR A NINE tracked on the outside in the second flight down the backside, was roused to go on with others three eighths from home under a
vigorous ride, offered no response through the far turn and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STYLISH GENT was very quickly clear, set the pace, drew off when asked and was kept to the task. DIAMONDBACK broke inwardly, chased the eventual
winner from inside, was no match but held second. TARADAR advanced inside foes on the turn, came out six wide at the top of the stretch, kept on.
SYNCHROMESH broke a step slowly, settled well back, swung seven wide into upper stretch, had good late effort but with far too much to do. UPSTART
GENTLEMAN bumped with the outer rival at the start, raced near the inside, kicked on mildly. A I INITIATIVE lacked early speed, failed to threatne.
BEYOND BORDERS bumped with the inside foe at the start, chased from outside about four wide, came up empty. BOCELLI chased the winner three wide,
came up empty. UNILATERAL broke slowly and made no impact.

straightening out for the drive and was much the best drawing off convincingly in deep stretch. MALIBU SECRET had a slim lead at the start, was relegated
to chasing the pace down the backstretch, pressed the issue outside on the turn, pounced three wide for the lead in upper stretch, was no match for the
winner but gamely held on battling for second money. TRICKY MAGICIAN was bumped inside on the start, prompted inside for the lead early on, assumed
command on the rail at the half, set the pace throughout the turn while pressed outside, was headed on each side turning for home and just missed dueling
for the place share through the stretch. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS broke out bumping foe on the break, trailed down the backside, improved mildly on the
fence around the turn and finished with intent for a minor role in the end. DOT'S VISION tracked the top pair outside at the half, was asked midpoint on the
turn, could not match strides with the leaders and was one paced driving to the finish line. WENJACK stalked close to the back three deep outside of rivals
in the early going, offered a mild run three wide outside of horses through the turn but could not reach contention in the stretch run. GRAND ALLIANCE
stalked near the rear between foes two wide down the backstretch, made little impact seeing the field around the bend and had nothing to offer in the drive
to the wire.

Footnotes
APRIL DE VELP tracked from inside in behind the leaders not too far off, moved out a bit for the stretch run, surged between runners late to prevail.
MASON'S MUSIC chased from outside going four to five wide through the turn, made steady but slow gains in late stretch and got the nod for place.
CENTENARY moved forward inside, soon led, edged clear by the three-eighths, was outfinished. WAR VOW raced in behind and outside runners, moved
out from three to five wide on the turn, gained mildly late. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was bumped and away a step slowly, angled six wide passing the
quarter pole, kicked on mildly. HASLEMERE moved forward pressing the early pace from between runners, dropped back at the quarter pole, ran on. I'M
SNOW ANGEL lacked early speed, came out at the top of the stretch, failed to menace. CHERRY GARDENS was in hand with the very early lead but soon
relinquished and stalked three to four deep, came up empty. MISS WATERLOO was bumped and squeezed back at the start, chased two to three wide
through the turn, faded.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD took control on the inside at the half, opened up at will running throughout the turn and comfortably cruised home for the impressive front
running score. CALL MY BANKER improved steadily on the rail down the backside, was roused on the fence trying to close in on the loose frontrunner and
chased the winner home easily besting the rest at the finish. CHAIRMAN BOB stalked near the rear in the early going, began to weave pass foes midway on
the turn, swung outside in the five path gaining momentum straightening out to the wire and closed belatedly to be a clear third crossing the finish line.
LAPOCHKA sat alone in the third flight down the backside, came under a ride making mild gains at the five sixteenth marker, angled outside in the mix for a
share turning for home and ran on willingly to be a fringe player in the end. BLUE MAX travelled on the fence in mid-pack, saved ground keeping pace
through the turn and finished up mildly inside running the the wire. TEMPO MADNESS chased the frontrunner at the half, was scrubbed on midturn bit could
not go on with the top two, fought gamely in upper stretch for a minor role but faded inside horses in the final furlong. LENNY K co-trailed on the inside down
the backstretch, took closer order to the pack by the midpoint around the bend but lacked a rally through the stretch. READY HERO co-trailed on the outside
down the back straight, closed the gap on the field at the three furlong marker but was no menace in the drive to the wire. H C HOLIDAY settled in midfield
between rivals at the half, was roused making little headway at the three eighths marker and backed away at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LOGISTICS was just a bit hard to load, soon led, set the pace in the two path, held sway while being kept to the task. FLASHINTHESKY was encouraged
along early on the turn racing inside foes but off the rail, shifted four wide past the quarter pole, was within range at the top of the stretch, could not match
strides with the winner but surged late for the place. CATCH THE DRIFT stalked not too far off the leaders in behind three to four wide through the turn, was
ridden by the quarter pole, came out a few paths in upper stretch, gained late. STOLEN VALOUR tracked from inside, moved out three wide advancing
coming to the quarter pole, evened out. MCKENZIE ROAD settled toward the back, gained late along the inside after saving ground through the turn.
BRAQUET advanced outside foes four to six wide on the turn and improved position. GO GIFFEN raced a bit greenly in the early stages at the rear racing
off the inside part of the track, passed foes in the lane. VINE GROVE chased three wide, drifted five deep late on the turn, came up empty. SAVE THE
BEES was off the inside and failed to rally. VRANA (IRE) chased briefly, steadily retreated. PEGGY chased from between runners, came up empty.

Footnotes
SENSE YOU LEFT took this field on the rail into the first turn, comfortably set the fractions under only mild pressure at best down the backside, opened up
quickly spurting away from the field with three furlongs to run and was kept to the task to the wire for an eye catching victory. LITTLE FIRE was unhurried
trailing down the backside, began to pick up horses at the seven sixteenths marker, continued a good turn of foot passing foes in the final turn and closed in
splitting rivals at the eighth pole to be a distant second at the wire. TEMPEREYA tracked three wide into the first turn, was hard ridden trying to maintain
third position at the half, was shuffled back a couple of spots on the far turn and re-rallied in the four path turning for home to get up for third money.
ENDORPHIN RUSH travelled on the inside in mid-pack, improved position on the fence down the backstretch, continued to reach for ground around the far
turn to be in the hunt for a minor role at the top of the stretch and was just outgamed at the wire for show placing. BLAZING SKY tracked two wide on the
first turn, chased the pacesetter down the backside, could not go on with the winner who drew off at the three eighths pole, stubbornly tried to fight on down
the lane but gave way on the fence in the final sixteenth. BAYOU BELLE was close to the back in a stalking position down the back straight, put in a mild
run at the three eighths marker but could not get into contention running down the lane. ERASMO'S GIRL stalked near the rear down the backside, could
not offer a rally around final bend and lacked a closing finish to the wire. AMI'S LINK had one horse beat in the early stages, could see the field on the far
turn and passed a weary runner in the stretch drive. LIPLOCK travelled outside rivals in mid-pack down the backstretch, showed some run on the final turn
gaining a position and had nothing to give emptying out through the lane.

Footnotes
BORDER TOWN was quick to the lead and soon moved clear, set the pace near but just off the inside, kept on with enough in reserve to hold sway.
MASON'S GAMBLE settled off the pace inside, shifted five wide into upper stretch, surged for place. FROSTED OVER was urged forward from the start,
chased in behind the leader inside a runner, was no match for the winner and caught for second late. LIKE THE KING was unhurried early, saved ground,
rallied inside, came out off the fence late. SECRET RESERVE was forwardly-positioned stalking in behind, raced mostly three to four wide, lacked the
needed late kick. OLD CHESTNUT was forwardly-positioned stalking outside a rival three wide, faded. JOURNEYMAN settled off the pace about three
wide, moved out six wide late on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. CLEAR DESTINATION shifted in on the turn, was not a factor. SOUPER
WATSON came in a bit soon after the start, chased three to four wide, faded. WEYBURN was in tight early while forced in, switched out at that juncture all
the while ridden along, went four to five wide on the turn advancing some, could not sustain the effort.

Footnotes
FLAG OF HONOUR (AUS) had good position tucked in on the rail behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, waited for his que running in hand behind
the front trio around the bend, shot up the fence to take command at the eighth pole and was hard ridden to the wire to just hold off the fast closing runner
up in a photo. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) stalked three deep down the backside, started to rally four wide around foes at the three furlong marker, circled
runners smartly through the turn, loomed five wide driving to the finish, was closing in with every stride in the final furlong and just missed with this gutsy
effort at the wire by a head nod. DREAM SHAKE trailed this compact field on the rail shifting to the fence at the half, followed the eventual winner into the
turn on the rail, angled outside with five sixteenths to go, had to be throttled down lacking room behind a tiring foe at the quarter pole, shifted outside five
wide for a clear run down the lane and was gaining late on the top pair but could not get there in time, settling for a troubled third at the finish. IRONSTONE
had one foe beaten down the backside, was steadied three wide between horses trying to commence his run at the three furlong marker, trailed through the
turn afterwards, swung outside in the seven path straightening for home and offered a strong late rally for a solid finish garnering a minor share at the wire.
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN had a good spot tracking the top two outside down the back straight, closed in to prompt three wide on the turn, was in the mix of
things battling in the four path turning for home but stalled in the final furlong. ROCKCREST travelled in midfield between runners down the backside, was
asked for more but could not quicken with rivals around the bend and still fought on showing some late energy passing the fading early leaders down the
lane. JAZZ HANDS was hustled on the fence to emerge with the lead at the five eighths marker, continued to hold a narrow lead up front around the bend,
spurted away mildly at the quarter pole, could not find more clinging to the lead through the stretch and was overwhelmed in the last sixteenth. MACLEAN'S
POSSE was content to hound the leader outside down the backstretch, pressed the issue two wide between runners throughout the turn, could not go on
with rivals on each side at the quarter pole and wilted in upper stretch. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 IRONSTONE AGAINST #10 ICE CHOCOLAT FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE FURLONG POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
FISH MOONEY was allowed to settle having one challenger beaten down the backside, close the gap on the leaders when the field bunched up at the three
furlong pole, waited patiently inside through the far turn looking for running room, made a quick move closing in on the leaders four wide at the quarter pole,
pounced to the lead at the furlong marker in the five path and held off all rivals to the wire. LIAM'S GIFT was under a good hold on the fence near the rear
early on, advanced smartly on the rail in hand along the backstretch, waited while tucked in on the rail behind the contesting trio on the far turn, had to
switch off the fence to find running room in the four path at the eighth pole but could not finish as strong as the winner in deep stretch. BLUEBERRY FIELDS
settled in midfield finding her stride outside runners under a tight rein, began to pick up rivals moving strong outside circling three wide with three furlongs
remaining, swung out widest in the nine path at the top of the lane and was closing in with each stride but had too much to do through the stretch run.
WICKENHEISER stalked close to the back of the pack two wide between runners along the backstretch, began to pick up horses on the rail smartly at the
three eighths marker, moved strongly around the leaders four wide at the quarter pole, pounced to the lead at the furlong marker but could not hold off the
closers in deep stretch. SHE MAKES A POINT kept a close eye tracking the front pair down the backstretch, crept closer three wide on the far turn, bid for
the lead between runners in the three path straightening out for the drive but needed more late to pose a threat at the wire. HITS DIFFERENT travelled on
the fence in the third flight down the backside, was hard ridden trying to maintain position between horses at the seven sixteenths marker and was one
paced running evenly through the stretch. BUTTERED TOAST trailed the field in the early stages of the race, caught up to runners five wide at the quarter
pole , swung out to the six path for the drive to the wire and showed some late energy passing some weary rivals through the stretch. JUMPIN JUNIE
pressed the issue outside through the first turn, emerged with a clear lead down the backside, continued clinging to the lead around the final bend, was
collared outside at the top of the lane and tired in the last sixteenth of a mile. BOUDICA stalked near the rear three wide into the first turn, had one rival
beaten down the back straight, could not get interested through the final turn and wasn't a factor in the stretch drive. LADY MOONSHINE took this field on a
slim lead into the first turn, was relegated to the chaser role on the outside down the back straight, bid for the lead in the two path with rivals on each side
turning for home but retreated at in the final furlong. ROYAL BLUSH settled in midfield three wide on the first turn, continued in the third flight outside
runners three wide at the half mile marker, offered a brief run four wide at the three furlong marker until the quarter pole and emptied out in upper stretch.
