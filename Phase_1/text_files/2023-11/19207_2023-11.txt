QUICK RAE AA stalked the battling trio from the inside down the backstretch, then advanced on the turn to gain command at the quarter pole then held
clear down the stretch under a strong drive to prove best in the end. KISSOUUR saved ground in the early furlongs, then gained second position leaving the
bend but was no match in the end and was best for place. AA TAKE A CHANCE raced in the middle of the field from the inside then bid from the four path
leaving the turn but lacked the winning bid in the end. RB RATHOWAYNE settled in the two path early, then rallied in the early stretch but was too little too
late. UPTOWN RINGOFFIRE stayed in the gate at the start once again, rallied mildly in the upper stretch and came up empty. FOUR HUNDRED PROOF
AA vied for the lead between rivals, was in tight entering the turn, settled back and lacked late bid in the end. FLEET DE SAND vied for the lead while three
wide, menaced on the turn closely behind the new leader from the inside before giving way in the stretch. RB MUNCHIE vied from the inside under a hard
drive then flattened out on the turn. WMA NORTH WIND raced early from the inside then was finished after the half.
