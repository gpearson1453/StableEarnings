Footnotes
KING OF THE COURT stalked the early leaders while racing mid pack, was asked at the half mile pole and responded with a good turn of foot, made his
move as he pleased in the stretch and drew off for the win. GLENN'S JUMPER was hesitant to load, broke hsarp, sent for the early lead, took control of the
race early while setting the pace from the rail, but then faded at the sixteenth pole and had to settle for second place today. LET IT B vied for the early lead,
settled into a stalking position was in contention but had no late kick. WONDER RUN showed little. HUG THE MUNNY was never involved.

LAYLA'S SONG settled in the first turn, found her stride and took command by the half mile marker and was never challenged, much the best today. MISS
ARKANSAS raced from far off the pace along the rail, was allowed to rate at a comfortable pace until the half mile pole where she was asked to launch a bid
and she responded well by steadily gaining ground and momentum with every stride, was in contention at the quarter pole but had to much ground between
her and the eventual winner to make up today but still ran a game second. MARK WITH AN E brief speed, faded. GOTTEMINABIND briefly stalked the early
leader, then made no impact. PENNIE'S MAGIC was never involved.

HE'S A BOMB wire to wire. D TWO left the gates a bit tardy, was allowed to settle and race from off the pace, was asked and responded with a grand turn
of foot at the quarter pole and was able to claim second place honors. MCLEAN made no impact. SPECIAL BREED stalked, the early pace, then faltered
late. PEPPER JACK trailed through out.
