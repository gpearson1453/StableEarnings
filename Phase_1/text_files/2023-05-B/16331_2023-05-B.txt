DEVIL'S OFF DUTY was bumped at the start by Northern Blend, then moved up to take the early lead, saved ground setting the pace while increasing his
advantage and won with something left. DANNY ZUKO prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was no match for the winner but finished well for the
place. HADLEES HONOR was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. THIRSTY KISS dropped back early and failed
to be a factor. NORTHERN BLEND broke out to bump Devil's Off Duty, then saved ground to the stretch while being forwardly placed and drifted out during
the drive while tiring.

LANGSTON ROAD saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. UNCLE PETE settled in stride early, angled out to be three-wide
nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly for the place. TIME 'ER TOO prompted the issue while racing two-wide and held on for the show in a steady
effort. WITHEE raced three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE raced along the outside of Withee
and lacked a rally. QUALITY GRANDSON lacked early speed and failed to menace. ROYAL CANDY was off a step slow, then ducked in behind horses
shortly after the start, steadied in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, recovered to be forwardly placed to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TABLE BAY was forwardly placed early racing along the inside, rallied three-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught J C's a Legend nearing the sixteenth
pole, was bumped by that one late and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. J C'S A LEGEND prompted the early pace while two-wide, took the lead from
Amara Mike entering the stretch, came out late to bump the winner and just missed. SUPERMAX was prominent early while racing between horses on the
turn and finished in a mild rally. AMARA MIKE saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and weakened. MANGIA PANE dropped back early, then saved
ground and improved his position. ALL THE KING'S MEN was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and tired. THE GOLDEN EGG was unhurried
early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TAVERNELLE was off a step slow, raced three-wide and failed to menace. THE SREWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

held on well during the drive for the show. BRILLIANT BIRD vied for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and weakened late. PRESKITT was
allowed to settle in stride, moved up six-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally. EMERALD SEA broke in the air to get away behind the field and

ROYAL HALO vied for the early lead with Mister Midas from along the inside, shook that one off leaving the quarter pole and increased his advantage.
MISTER MIDAS vied for the lead from the outside, was no match for the winner but held on well for the place. DESHAMBEAU was forwardly placed while
racing three-wide and finished in a mild rally. ICE TOWER saved ground while being allowed to settle in stretch and went evenly late. BEAU MISCHIEF
settled in the middle of the pack, was five-wide nearing the quarter pole and failed to threaten. SECRET SAGA was prominently placed early while racing
four-wide but lacked a response when asked. MISTER MAFIOSO was off a step slow and failed to threaten.

ABOVE THE STARS saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. MISS ACCELERATE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide
and finished strongly to be gaining on the winner late. SCATALICIOUS was allowed to settle in stride early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a
mild rally. G G RULES was unhurried early, moved forward along the inside on the turn, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out. FLY
PATTI FLY dropped back early while saving ground and failed to menace. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP rushed up along the inside to prompt the early pace and
tired. STICKINITTOTHEMAN stumbled badly at the start to unseat the rider and was walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND
INQUIRY INTO THE START, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
