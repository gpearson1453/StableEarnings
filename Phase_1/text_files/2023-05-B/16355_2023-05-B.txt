Footnotes
LA TOURISTA bobbled slightly upon leaving the gates, then took back when put to tight quarters between horses leaving the chute, laid off of the pace
along the inside, trailed in the three path around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, then sustained a grinding charge to bid at the furlong
grounds before edging clear. OWEN'S PLEASURE stalked three wide, took aim on the top pair from the five path entering the lane, bid along with an outer
foe entering midstretch, but was outkicked by that one in the final furlong. STOPSHOPPINGAMY vied for the lead two wide, sparred in the three path and
between horses coming to midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair leaving the furlong grounds and prevailed for show. STANLEY MARKET broke
inwardly and snagged the gate at the start, vied along the inside, dueled entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer foes entering the final furlong and
gave way. MISS MOON PIE trailed, inched closer four wide around the turn, but was floated to the seven path by the eventual winner entering the lane and
faded. DUPLICITOUS chased in the two path and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
DOG RED bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed outside of the pace setter and from the three path, bid nearing the lane, brushed with his inner
counterpart entering it, forged an advantage in upper stretch, dueled while maintaining an advantage from his inner game rival through midstretch, then
inched away in the final sixteenth. APOLLO RISING set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, took a brush as that one bid entering the
lane, got headed in upper stretch, then fought on through midstretch but was bested. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked
along the inside while keen behind the leaders around the first turn, then chased those foes through the lane while holding show. PRINCELY laid off of the
pace two wide around the first turn, tucked to save ground nearing the far turn, improved while racing behind traffic through midstretch, tipped off the rail
entering the final sixteenth but did not have enough to reach show. CHILENO laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five path around the first turn,
inched closer outside of rivals around the far turn, but leveled off in upper stretch and lacked progress through the final furlong. O P FIRECRACKER laid off
of the pace in the two path, pursued from between horses around the far turn and failed to menace among rivals. NEIGHBOR tracked the top pair from the
four path, chased between horses around the far turn and yielded in upper stretch. AMERICAN ICON was outrun.

Footnotes
LINCOLN HIGHWAY tracked in the two path, gained three wide around the far turn to bid along with an inner rival entering the lane, wrestled a narrow
advantage while sparring in upper stretch and held thereafter. SOYBEAN MAN stalked the clear leader from the two path, gained along with an outer rival
around the far turn to bid with that one entering the lane, then battled gamely thereafter but narrowly missed. SURFACE TO AIR laid off of the pace in the
two to three path, then stayed on between horses while hanging on his left lead to gain show late. BERRETTINI pursued from midpack along the inside,
shifted out to the four path down the backstretch, tracked the leading trio from the three path around the far turn, tipped to the five path to take aim entering
the lane, but failed to progress on the top two through the final furlong and lost show late. ARCHIE THE GIZA laid off of the pace two wide around both
turns, fanned to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally. CURLINS INCHARGE set the pace, built a clear margin entering the first turn, but met a
pair of outer challengers nearing the lane, got headed entering it and weakened. QAADER saved ground far back, but to no avail. ACCIDENT lagged
behind around both turns, then cut the gap on the rest while outrun.

Footnotes
EDDIE M pressed the leader from the three path, assumed command turning for home and drew off under a drive. GOLD LUCK stalked along the inside,
gained place entering the lane after the eventual winner kicked clear and was second best. IDRATHERBEBLESSED exchanged bumps with an outer rival
through the opening stages, chased from off of the pace in the three path, spun into the lane in the four path before reaching show, and ran on to prove best
of the rest. MAMA'S GOLD bumped with an inner rival early on, set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a path off of the rail around the turn, proved no
match for that one leaving the five sixteenths pole and caved between horses shortly after. HUMOR ME NOW exchanged contact multiple times with rivals
on both sides in the opening furlong, then lacked speed in the four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
MO TOWN MAYHEM broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, trailed in the two path around the turn, spun into the lane in the four path, swung to the
seven path and outside of rivals at the three sixteenths pole, then offered a good kick to overhaul the embattled leading pair in the final sixteenth before
clearing. PUMPKIN SCONE stalked three wide, bid entering the lane sparking a duel with an inner ABSINTHE, led narrowly in upper stretch, but exchanged
brushes with that one at the furlong grounds while sparring, then again at the sixteenth pole as the battle continued, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in
the closing stages. ABSINTHE pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led as an outer rival loomed a danger entering the lane, dueled while getting headed
by that one in upper stretch, fought on gamely while exchanging brushes at the furlong pole and again at the sixteenth marker, but was outkicked by an
outer oncharging foe late and missed place. FAST N HAPPY broke slowly, lacked speed in the five path before floating to the six path entering the lane, and
ran on but was outkicked for minor placings by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. HAPPY AM I set the pace inside of a prompting foe, but got headed by
that one and another bidder entering the lane and gave way in upper stretch. UNDER ADVISEMENT nudged an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in
the three path, then lacked a bid between horses. CALL AGAIN broke a step slow before being brushed by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in
the four path, spun into the lane in the five path and between horses, then lacked a rally. UNCORKED chased the leaders from the two path and faded.

Footnotes
KAUFYMAKER pressed two wide while under steady coaxing around the turn, bid in the three path in upper stretch, led between horses at the furlong
grounds, and held well from a pair of outer pursuers late. LINGUISTIC broke a step slow before being brushed by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the
pace in the two path, vacated the rail turning for home, split foes in the five path in upper stretch while launching a rally, and sustained a charge to gain
place in the shadow of the wire. DARING DO broke a touch outwardly, tracked three wide, took aim on the leaders from the four path in upper stretch, bid in
midstretch as her stablemate led entering the final furlong, but was turned away by that one before being caught by an outer rival for place. FROZEN SOLID
stalked along the inside, took aim on the new leader while slipping through a rail seam in midstretch, but only managed to chase evenly through the final
furlong. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, spun into the lane in the five path before shifting to the seven
path in upper stretch and stayed on. LAURA'S CHARM broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed
on while shifting ground inwardly. ATLANTIC STRIKE pursued from midpack along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, but lacked a bid.
MADRILENA (ARG) laid off of the pace in the two path, got subtly shuffled back approaching the turn before shifting to the three path, tipped to the five path
turning for home before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and lacked a rally after floating to the eight path in upper stretch. QUICK MUNNY
brushed an inner rival leaving the gates, set the pace along the inside while well in hand around the turn, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, but
weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. MARGIE'S KITCHEN pursued from midpack in the three path while between horses around the turn,
fanned to the five, then six, path in upper stretch and gave way. AWESOME LAWSON broke a step slow, raced in midpack in the four path, but was floated
to the six path entering the lane and faded. SUNDAY GRACE lacked speed two wide and weakened entering the turn.

Footnotes
DEER DISTRICT tracked three wide, took aim on the leaders from the five path entering the lane, bid and quickly kicked clear in upper stretch, then drew off
under moderate urging. ZAMBEZI broke inwardly while last away, tracked along the inside, took aim along the rail while getting outkicked by an outer rival in
upper stretch, gained place at the furlong grounds after the eventual winner took charge, and safely held that position late. MIDNIGHT TAXES trailed in the
two to three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on to gain show nearing the wire. BOHEMIAN BO set the pace inside of a pair of
pressing rivals while a path off of the rail around the turn, got headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole, lost place to an inner rival at the furlong
grounds, and was caught by an outer bidder for show late. STUD LOVIN stalked the top pair from the four path, pressed around the turn, bid turning for hoe,
but weakened between horses in upper stretch. LARK'S MISCHIEF vied for the lead two wide, then in the three path and between horses around the turn,
but yielded entering the lane. STORM DADDY tracked two wide and between horses, but spun for home in the five path and tired.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT pressed three wide, vied into the turn, led approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in the four path nearing the lane, and held off
bidders on either side through the final sixteenth. GRAPHIC DETAIL tracked two to three wide and between horses, vied for place entering the lane before
taking aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge in hopes of bidding in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay and held place.
BAD TO THE BONES tracked outside of rivals, came under urging while pursuing in the four path around the turn, spun for home in the five path, chased
the clear leader through upper stretch, closed in along with an inner rival in the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch the leader and missed place.
HIGHWAY ROBBER stalked along the inside, but was subtly shuffled back turning for home as the eventual winner drew clear, angled out four wide in
upper stretch for clear sailing, and ran on for a minor share. YORK TAVERN vied for the lead two wide and between horses around the turn, but failed to
keep pace with his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. DEBATE broke a step slow while last away, lacked speed in the four path,
fanned to the six path entering the lane and moved up. COUSIN LARRY made little impact from the two path. MIACOMET set the pace inside of a pair of
vying rivals into the turn, got headed approaching the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the final furlong.
