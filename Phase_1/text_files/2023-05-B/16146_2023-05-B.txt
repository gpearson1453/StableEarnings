Footnotes
NO DRAMA MOMMA chased the pace into the turn, moved up to vie for the lead through the turn and into the lane, inched to the front outside the eighth
pole and slowly widened to be clear at the wire. IWANNABEPERFECT vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane, yielded to the
winner inside the eighth pole then stayed on well to be clear for the place spot and second best. C F V TU BRUTUS chased the pace while along the inside
into the lane, could not gain on the leaders while holding the show spot. WEST COAST JUSTICE was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane
four wide and offered a mild gain. NEVER TO MANY HUGS was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. NOT A ROLE
MODEL chased the pace from the three path, was three wide into the lane and faded. BERTIE THE BEAUTY trailed throughout while off the rail.

Footnotes
LATIGO was unhurried while in the three path through late turn, bid through the four path into the lane, continued with good momentum after straightening in
the lane, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and cleared late. HOLIDAY HOUSE raced in the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three
or four path, made the lead with an eighth to go, was joined soon after by the winner, was no match for that one late then while remaining clear for the place
spot. W W CANDY hopped at the start and spotted the field some five lengths, raced in the back into the lane, was in the six path through the final eighth
and gained belatedly. TIGHTROPE set the pace on a clear lead into the lane, was headed just outside the eighth pole and faded along the inside. KEEPIN
IT CLASSY chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane and tired. STORM DADDY chased the pace from the two path through
mid-turn then was empty.

Footnotes
BOCO set the pace while near the rail and under some pressure, cleared into the far turn, spurted away into the lane and was asked to the end while the
lead diminished. SIMPLY JACK was unhurried while along the inside, kept near the inside through the turn, came off the rail while gaining momentum
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished full of run. LAWMAKER raced near the inside through mid-turn, angled into the six path entering the lane and rallied
from mid-track. CHANNEL Z chased the pace from the four path through the turns when never far back, swung into the lane from the four or five path and
offered a mild gain while not passing rivals. CONNECT ME was in the two path through the turns and showed late energy inside the eighth pole. T LAW
chased the pace from the three path through the far turn then weakened in the lane. HEZMORETHANREADY saved ground into the far turn, was checked
entering the turn, dropped back then was never a threat thereafter. AMERICAN DOLLARS tight first, raced three wide through the turn, came into the lane
from the seven path and never factored. MADDON never a factor while in the four path through the turns. FAVORABLE RETURN bumped at the start,
hustled up to press the pace through the far turn then was empty. BLOWN OUT chased the pace into the far turn then was empty.

LUCKY FAVORITE prominent, inched up. UNCHALLENGED led, denied. RELENTLESS RUNNER close, needed more. IZA FAVORITE no menace.
QUEEN OFA BEACH ran off post parade, weakened. JD BAD HABITS drifted out late. MISS ROYALLY JETTIN no factor inside. BEACH DREAMER last
away, no factor. YOU KNOW ONE losing ground.
