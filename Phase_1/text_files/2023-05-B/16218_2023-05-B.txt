Footnotes
WILDWOOD RUBEN gradually angled in as he shared the early lead in hand between rivals, moved clear when let out on the bend, steadily opened up
under urging in the stretch and was kept to task until the waning yards. HIGHLY PERFECT gradually moved in to keep a clear path as he contested the
early pace, was checked solidly and lost his stride nearing the nine-sixteenths marker when his path narrowed, saved ground taking the turn, fought for
second the last furlong, slowly drifted out the final sixteenth but edged ahead for the place. ON THE MONEY RED moved to the outside after leaving the
chute, lost ground widest through the turn, battled for second in the lane but did not have enough left in the late going. SMOOTH ATTACK broke alertly, vied
for the early lead from outside, did not stay with WILDWOOD RUBEN on the turn, dueled for second in the stretch but wore down inside the last furlong.
EIGHT MAY hesitated at the start, moved toward the outside midway on the backstretch, failed to keep up on the bend, his jockey lost his riding crop upper
stretch and had little to offer the rest of the way. There was a stewards' inquiry into HIGHLY PERFECT'S loss of action midway on the backstretch but made
no change to the official order of finish after their review.

Footnotes
WEST COAST CHROME set the pace in hand, was roused leaving the turn and drew away under mild urging in the lane. UNCLE O. G. prominent just
outside WEST COAST CHROME, was no match for that one when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place.
THACKER FROMM inattentive in the gate, threw his head then bobbled slightly at the break, advanced between rivals, moved clear for third from path three
in the stretch, came up short for second but was clearly best of the others. NOBLE CREEKER in contention on the backstretch, faded from path three on the
turn and only passed between tired ones in the stretch. CELIA'S CIRCLE reluctant to load into the gate, was a factor from outside for a half mile then gave
way. WYATT SCATES well placed early began to yield from inside on the bend.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE rated between rivals early, found herself in close quarters two wide leaving the quarter pole, angled outside BEIRUT BEAUTY entering the
lane, took the advantage inside the final furlong and shook free with seventy yards left. TEMPLUNA vied for the early lead from inside, fought gamely in the
stretch but gradually wore down in the late going. BEIRUT BEAUTY moved to the outside early on, soon contested the pace, was three wide on the bend,
dueled in the lane but also did not have enough left the final sixteeth. AH LEAH advanced from inside on the turn, swung out to path four entering the
stretch and found best stride too late inside the last eighth. SUPERTRIX was a contender on the backstretch but began to yield three wide on the bend.
LOUIE P displayed early speed between foes but started to fade two wide after three furlongs.

Footnotes
TORIN broke on top, gradually angled in as he vied for the lead from outside rivals, moved ahead from just off the rail leaving the turn, was clear with a
furlong to go, started to slowly drift out after entering the last eighth but held on. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was caught in tight quarters between TIZRIK and
TORIN after the first furlong, jostled with TIZRIK approaching the nine-sixteenths marker, was steadied, altered outside TORIN, vied for the lead again into
the turn, did not stay with the latter leaving the bend, rallied from path three as the latter began to wear down and drift out in the late going, came up short
but was clearly second best. SUPER SILVER broke with the pack but soon dropped back, was an early factor from outside, did not keep up from path three
on the turn, found best stride too late between rivals but got the nod for third at the wire. TIZRIK broke inward, was hustled up from inside to contest the
pace, caught in tight quarters after the first eighth, jostled with MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, began to retreat into the bend, floated off the rail some midstretch
and could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. CITY POSITION was a factor on the backstretch but faded from just off the rail on the turn.
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN displayed early speed from outside, took the turn four wide then flattened out for the drive. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
early part of the race and the rider of MIND YOUR OWN BIZ lodged an objection claiming interference from TORIN midway on the backstretch. After their
review, the stewards disqualified TORIN and placed him second.

Footnotes
W W TRAFALGAR was hustled up to contest the early pace, gradually moved to the rail midway on the backstretch, edged ahead on the turn, responded to
steady urging in the stretch and kept SCARLET CITY at bay. SCARLET CITY was steadied briefly when his path narrowed midway on the backstretch, was
boxed in through the bend, got through two wide at the top of the lane, challenged W W TRAFALGAR inside the last furlong, never relented but did not have
enough left in the waning yards. GEMO RAIN progressed just off the rail on the turn, gradually angled out looking for a clear path leaving the bend and
rallied belatedly five wide the last eighth. SIRCORRI forwardly placed from outside, threatened three wide on the turn, exchanged bumps with EVIDENCE
leaving the bend and gradually yielded from path four. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was soon well back, fanned out behind SIRCORRI entering the lane, gradually
angled in as he lodged a mild bid and passed tired ones. EVIDENCE hustled from between horses early, prompted the pace, was two wide on the turn,
floated out some to bump SIRCORRI leaving the bend, bumped again with that one into the stretch and also began to fade. APPLICANT raced in contention
between horses on the backstretch but began to yield three wide on the bend. MADE TO FIT hesitated at the break and showed little in a wide trip. The rider
of SCARLET CITY lodged an objection alleging interference from W W TRAFALGAR midway on the backstretch. After their review, the stewards did not
uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
GO MADI GO settled outside on the backstretch, picked up her pace three wide on the bend, fanned out behind JUST A WONDER into the lane, altered out
upper stretch, bumped solidly with WAR COLORS, surged the last furlong and caught AROSE FOR LYLA at the wire. AROSE FOR LYLA settled inside,
progressed just off the rail on the turn, was blocked behind LIFE OF SATURDAYS at the top of the stretch, moved to the rail approaching the eighth pole,
took the advantage inside the final furlong but was outfinished in a game effort. THINK BLUE well placed from inside, floated out some entering the lane,
edged ahead to gain the lead, slowly yielded inside the last eighth but was clearly best of the rest. WAR COLORS raced in contention between rivals, was
four then five wide taking the turn, bumped solidly and forced out upper stretch and could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. JULIAISON was
an early factor from outside, failed to keep up on the bend, moved to the inside upper stretch and passed tired ones late. LIFE OF SATURDAYS was
hustled to set a pressured pace from inside, came off the rail some leaving the turn and gave way for the drive. JUST A WONDER pressed the early speed
from just outside but gave way in the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run. After their review, GO MADI GO was disqualified and
placed fourth for coming out into WAR COLORS upper stretch.

SHANGHAI POINT kept close from inside, altered out some trying to gain a clear path upper stretch, altered inside TIZ APPROVED with a sixteenth left and
caught the latter in the final strides. TIZ APPROVED stumbled as he broke from the gate, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside CINDY'S G MAN,
moved ahead from path three upper stretch, began to gradually drift out inside the last furlong and was outfinished. BERNIE LOMAX raced closest to the
early speed from outside, came into the lane outside TIZ APPROVED, gradually angled out to keep a clear path outside the latter deep stretch and came up
short. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY in contention early, did not keep up from path three on the bend, altered outside BERNIE LOMAX midstretch, closed well but
was too late. LONESOME DREAM broke awkwardly, was settled toward the inside, progressed just off the rail on the turn and rallied belatedly inside rivals
the final eighth. CINDY'S G MAN was hustled up between rivals at the start to vie for the lead inside TIZ APPROVED, came off the rail some into the lane
and began to yield. ALLEN hesitated at the break, was taken outside early on and showed little. SWISHAWISH chased from outside, improved position four
wide on the turn, angled in some entering the stretch, took some bad steps and quickly shortened his stride inside the last furlong, was eased and walked
off. DUST DANCER was an early factor from outside, took some bad steps into the turn, was pulled up and also walked off.
