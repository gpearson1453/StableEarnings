Footnotes
TALKIN PHAROAH was hustled to the front then moved in while going clear, came under light coaxing in the two path passing the seven-sixteenths,
controlled the action off the rail through the turn, extended the advantage with ease into upper stretch, drew off under a very mild hand ride into the final
furlong and widened to win as the rider pleased. FRISKY JIM was off slow and spotted the front couple lengths, angled out under urging outside the
five-eighths, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased in the four path going around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured
the place. HAPPY BOB broke a half-step slow then dropped back, was urged along towards the rear, moved from three to five wide going around the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. AL'S FROSTED tracked the leader down the backstretch,
chased in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two path and tired. SHAKIN THE BELLE broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside, was
caught five wide early on the turn then dropped to the four path, moved to the two path coming to the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, was
guided in behind a foe outside the furlong marker then ducked in and was no factor. OBSCURED BY CLOUDS broke a bit awkwardly but in the front half of
the field then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace, tossed his head while lugging out briefly into the turn, saved ground while asked on
that bend, turned into the stretch in the two path and had nothing left.

Footnotes
PORTFOLIO COMPANY pulled keenly under restraint three then two wide through the first turn first pulling briefly in tandem with DRIPPING GOLD, then
hooking up with NIGHT JUMPER as that rival pulled eagerly into the backstretch, eased off to tuck to the inside tracking the leader in closest aim behind
loose cover, tipped to the two path half a mile from home nudging DRIPPING GOLD three wide through the far turn, advanced on the leader between foes
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, dug in gamely to hold
safe to the finish kept to task. DAUNT coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide
for home and ran on willingly to the finish to secure the place honors. DRIPPING GOLD grew keen briefly twice through the first turn before being
successfully eased off of PORTFOLIO COMPANY midway on the turn, chased just off the inside until nudged three wide by that same rival half a mile out,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. SPACE LAUNCH tracked the front just
off the inside early on until tipped three then four wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild bid. Q F SEVENTY FIVE coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four
to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. NIGHT JUMPER established the front and showed the way into the first turn, had
PORTFOLIO COMPANY advance keenly outside seven and a half furlongs from home and was inspired to pull eagerly on his bit briefly running off as a pair
from the rest of the field before settling back down with seven furlongs to run, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths under challenge, took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to command, yielded nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late
going.

Footnotes
BROKEN SPUR broke out and forced foes out but was away fast, showed the way while well rated on the inside, responded well when set down into upper
stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held determinedly under steady urging. MR FLOWERS bumped lightly with a foe
while forced out some just after the start, was well placed down the backstretch, angled from the rail to the three path while roused near the three-eighths,
chased the winner under a drive in the stretch, came out inside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. VARIABLE COST (GB) was forced out
at the start and taken up, raced at the rear under reserve, was taken up off heels near the half-mile pole, advanced inside while roused on the turn, chased
into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. FIRE BARON broke out at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused in the
two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. GOLDEN PURCHASE made light contact with a foe shortly after the start, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn and came up empty.

ALTERNATE REALITY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was up in
the final jumps to the finish to score. WINTERS LION bumped at the start by SMOOTH FLYIN MIKE, chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, got bumped by
THUNDERIAN at the three-sixteenths as that foe came out, dug in under a drive and missed at the end. SMOOTH FLYIN MIKE broke in at the start
bumping the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn,
widened away at the five-sixteenths and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in clear to the eighth pole, then grew leg weary inside the final
seventy yards and was nailed at the end by a pair of rivals. THUNDERIAN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and came outwards bumping WINTERS LION at the three-sixteenths, ran on under a drive and was
outfinished in the late going. WARRIOR RICHARD chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. LIFE AND LIGHT coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued along the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. Please note due to a technical and / or operator error, the teletimer photo finish was
unavailable for this race and therefore the finish and all margins for the finish were provided by the chart caller.

Footnotes
UTILIZATION RATE (FR) went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace in the two path, responded well when asked for her best in
upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop while powering away coming to the sixteenth-pole
and proved much the best under steady urging. DORAL stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold in the three path, left the leader alone on the
front, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match then just held the place. MIRABELLA
bumped with a rival at the start, raced just off the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the
place while clear for the show. EMPATHY went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the two path while
roused and failed to rally. DOUBLE DREAM broke in and bumped with a foe, steadied briefly while in tight against the rail on the first turn, settled outside on
the backstretch, was roused two then three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. ZAPPERA rounded the opening bend in the two path, settled off the
pace, was roused while saving ground on the final turn and failed to respond. TRES CHIC (ARG) broke a step slow, raced in the two path on the first turn,
was reserved at the back, went around the far turn in the two path under urging, was driven three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

pair along an open rail midway on the turn and took over command narrowly with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged
clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and just lasted on the wire. VITTORIO four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and just missed at the finish. MAJORITY PARTNER coaxed from the
start, pressed the pace of HAPPY FARM from the outside five paths off the rail down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, kept on to preserve the show honors. LOST IN ROME five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
HAPPY FARM hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide hounded by MAJORITY PARTNER to the outside, yielded the front with
five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MARKET ALERT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four
wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
QUEEN PICASSO (GB) was taken under a tight hold early, stalked the pace on the outside under snug restraint, went around the turn in the two path, was
given her cue at the quarter-pole then rallied to the lead in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong and edged clear under steady
urging. AMERICAN APPLE went to the front, showed the way while in hand, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the
winner under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while just able to get the place. LADY BETH was rated on the inside, was roused near the
five-sixteenths, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, pursued the top two in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear
for the show. QUARREL stumbled two strides from the gate, was reserved at the rear, raced between foes in the two path on the turn, was roused inside the
five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SENIOR PRANK was rated on the outside, went three wide while let out on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
INFLATION ADJUSTED went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, took the lead late on
that bend, kicked clear when set down into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging.
HOLD THE SALSA bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with the same foe early, was rated under a tight hold on the inside, dropped back with five
furlongs to run, was roused while saving ground on the far turn and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. AFJAN broke in and bumped
with a foe, bumped with that same opponent early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled outside on the backstretch, was roused while inside on the
far turn, came three wide into the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. FIGHTER IN THE WIN went to the front, traveled around the
first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked while being headed late on that bend and gave way.
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS was fractious in the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was asked in the three path on the far
turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SWING LOW dropped back quickly while sluggish from the gate, saved ground on the turns and
showed little.

fighting on but was outfinished in the late stages. AUTUMN pressed the pace of the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. LAKESIDE GETAWAY coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. GRACEFUL ROSE saved ground in
pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. THREE CUPS
FULL tossed her head at the break and hit the near side stall at the start getting away last and coming under coaxing when conceding four to five lengths to
the front before settling near the rear, chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, continued in the two path into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact. BIG HAZEL chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and never menaced. GALATRONA chased along the inside bobbling a few times
down the backstretch and into the turn, got placed to a protective hold and was taken in hand and altered out near the three-eighths pole through the latter
portion of the turn to swing ten paths off the inside into upper stretch, got eased home under a protective hold to the finish, then walked off under her own
power.
