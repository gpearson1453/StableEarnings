Footnotes
DEVIL MOON dueled for the lead from outside, shook free from BOLT FROM HEAVEN in upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip at the eighth pole, then
drew off under hand urging. BOLT FROM HEAVEN dueled inside DEVIL MOON, was coaxed along through the bend, could not kick on with the winner in
upper stretch and stayed on to best the rest. SNAPP DADDY chased between rivals then jumped crossing onto the turn and got bumped while being put in
tight quarters between rivals, chased three wide into the turn, moved out to travel four deep around the bend, kept on through the lane and outkicked
CHARLIE'S GHOST for the show honors. CHARLIE'S GHOST stalked between rivals, got put in tight and had to check entering the turn, regained stride
and split foes again on the turn, chased two wide into the lane and got edged for third. CHAO PHRAYA drifted out and bumped rival crossing the dirt,
stalked along the inside leaving the backstretch, checked inside a pair of rivals into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and could not rally. MAFIA MAN
broke a step slow, chased three deep into the turn, started to weaken late on the bend and faded. COACH OTT was off a bit slow, lagged behind early,
moved to the inside, saved ground trailing into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FLATTERWITHJEWELS raced up close to the outside of the leader early, drew alongside on the far turn to fight for the lead, took over past the quarter pole,
shook free at the top of the lane and drew off. SHVERE ARBETER lost her footing briefly at the start but still came away with the others, established the
front on the inside then was taken in hand on the first turn and early backstretch to control the pace, met the bid from FLATTERWITHJEWELS on the far
turn, lost command late on the bend, could not keep up at the top of the stretch but kept on to hold the place. RENEGADE PRINCESS broke out a bit at the
start, tracked three wide early, went two wide into the far turn, angled out around the bend, came five wide into the stretch and gained the show. ROMAN
EMPRESS broke out but was quickly correctly, forwardly placed three deep early, was asked three then four wide chasing the top pair around the second
bend and could not offer the needed response. SPLICER stalked in the two path early, saved ground while dropping out of range on the far turn and
weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
MY RANSOM stalked off the inside or outside a rival, went two then three wide around the bend, tipped out to launch a rally widest in the drive, surged late
and got up in time. DEFENSOR FORTIS broke out and was quickly straightened, closest in pursuit of the leader from outside to the turn, chased two wide
around the bend, drew alongside in upper stretch and headed EDDIE'S LAST with a furlong remaining, took over soon after, inched ahead with a sixteenth
left to run and got nailed on the wire. BRONKO NAGURSKI broke inward, bobbled a bit crossing over the dirt, had to pause when the leader came over a bit
early, chased along the inside then two wide into the lane, moved out but drifted back inward then had to alter in from behind EDDIE'S LAST at the sixteenth
pole and finished willingly for a game third. EDDIE'S LAST took control early, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, headed by DEFENSOR FORTIS
at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and yielded in the final sixteenth. COMMISSIONER H broke cleanly then dropped back, lost his action
crossing back on to the turn, trailed next to the fence through the bend and was not a factor.

mile remaining, inched ahead under right and left handed urging, cleared approaching the sixteenth pole and remained strong to the line. LOOKS RARE
went up to take control on the inside, received some pressure from EVER A REBEL in the middle stages, dueled with that rival through the far turn and lost
command with at the quarter pole, stayed with the winner to midstretch then yielded and managed to save the place. RIVERSIDE bumped leaving the gate,
tracked three wide early, angled in on the far turn, moved out in the stretch and went willingly late to miss the place. EXCEL CALCULATOR got pinballed at
the start, trailed five then four wide early, advanced from outside up the backstretch to get into range, took the second turn three wide then tipped four wide
into the stretch and flattened out. STONKS stalked two wide early, angled out on the far turn and failed to threaten. SAM MALONE shifted in bumped rival
twice at the start, chased four wide on the clubhouse turn, three to four wide on the second bend and failed to menace. QUALITY CAT got crowded a bit
between rivals at the start, tucked inside off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SELL THE DREAM stalked two wide early, moved inside on the backstretch, tipped out into the lane, then drew alongside the leader and took over in upper
stretch, moved clear with a furlong remaining and held well under a drive. COURT SNORT was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried after and moved inside,
made progress on the far turn while continuing to save ground, moved off the rail in the drive while starting to rally, ran up behind the leader and had to alter
to the outside with a sixteenth to go, kept on willingly but was too late. GOLDEN AGAIN tracked from inside, lost some ground when put in tight on the
backstretch, continued along the inside then shifted off the rail on the far turn, tipped out to launch a bid three deep in upper stretch but faltered in the late
stages. BIG HOPES pulled three wide on the first turn, chased three then two wide around the second bend and lacked a bid. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS brushed
leaving the gate, cleared from inside, showed the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, lost command outside the
eighth pole and weakened. UNCONTROLLABLE brushed outer rival at the steart, trailed on the inside then two wide on the first turn, tipped three to four
wide on the far turn and failed to menace. ZZYZX stalked two then three wide early, dropped back between foes on the far turn and had little left for the
drive.

Footnotes
DEEP RIVER stalked from inside, chased behind the leader through the far turn, lacked room exiting the bend, tipped out and bumped rival entering the
stretch, split foes to gain command at the top of the stretch, quickly cleared and powered away under a drive. DONTTESTYOURLUCK settled inside,
chased in range entering the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, launched a bid in upper stretch but was no match for the winner and stayed on to hold
second. ICE STORM raced two wide near the back behind rivals then had to tip three wide on the first turn, found a some light traffic early on the
backstretch, moved closer in the middle stages, went four wide into the far turn, got fanned six wide into the lane, kept on through the drive and got edged
for the place honors. DANZ TILL TEN pulled along the inside and shifted to the two path into the first turn, continued to tug forward and went up to press the
pace from outside, lost touch with the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, re-bid three deep while getting bumped at the top of the stretch, then weakened in
the furlong grounds. SAMBA FLAVOR brushed at the start, chased three wide off the pace early, remained off the rail into the far turn, angled five wide
leaving the bend and brushed with outer rival, remained close into the final furlong then flattened out. PARS AND BIRDIES chased three then four wide
early, went three wide into the lane, altered out at the eight pole and failed to menace. NEVER SORRY was off slow to begin and trailed early, passed tired
rivals and failed to make an impact. CHIEF COUNCIL brushed leaving the gate, cleared early and crossed over to the inside, gained company to the outside
and set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, moved clear past the five-sixteenths pole, challenged again at the top of the lane, relinquished the
lead and weakened in the final furlong. STREET MOGUL stalked three then two wide early, entered the second bend four wide, angled down to the inside
and came up empty.
