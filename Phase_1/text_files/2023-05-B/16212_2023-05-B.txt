Footnotes
MYOPIC set the pace, showed the way via a loose margin down the backstretch, and held sway from chasers under driving pressure through the lane.
BAJAN RUM tracked three wide around the first turn, tucked to the fence at the half mile pole, then chased the clear leader while edging place from an outer
foe nearing the furlong grounds. CO CONSPIRATOR stalked the clear leader from the outside, chased along with an inner rival through the lane, but lost
place to that one in midstretch. PEEKACHO eased back from tight quarters between horses soon after the start, settled off of the pace along the inside,
shifted off the fence entering the lane and failed to factor. CELERITY took light contact from rivals on both sides early on, trailed, shifted to the four path
around the far turn, and moved up. ESTILO PELIGROSO failed to factor two wide. FERRYBOAT tracked along the inside, shifted out down the backstretch,
chased three wide while under urging around the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
KLIMT'S MUSE laid off of the pace in the four path into the turn, launched a rally five wide turning for home before bidding in the six path entering the lane,
drove clear in upper stretch, and held sway from an outer chaser late. NEED SOME MONEY trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane,
then outside of the clearing leader in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of that one through the final furlong, but was kept at bay late. PROUD FOOT laid close
up inside of the leading pair early, but checked in tight quarters along the rail at the eleven sixteenths pole, stalked into the turn, tipped two wide at the three
furlong pole, awaited racing room entering the lane, but remained blocked while steadying through upper stretch, tipped four wide and between horses in
the final furlong, and split foes to gain show at the sixteenth pole. SONADOR dueled for the lead two wide, led into the turn, but offered no resistance to an
outer challenge entering the lane, and weakened through the final furlong. THE CLUB tracked four wide, pressed around the turn, but was outkicked by an
outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. CENTER STAGE stalked three wide and between horses, prompted the leaders while under a drive around the
turn, but weakened. SUPER CAT LADY dueled along the inside, but was headed by her outer counterpart entering the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
ARMY KITTEN broke outwardly and bumped a rival upon leaving the gates, tracked in the five path and outside of foes, tucked three wide while improving
to a stalking position entering the turn, bid in the four path entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an inner CALLIE'S GRIT offered a
challenge, and gamely maintained a slight margin from that one through the final furlong. CALLIE'S GRIT stalked along the inside, took aim between the top
pair entering the lane, split them as an outer ARMY KITTEN forged an advantage, bid inside of that one in upper stretch, dueled thereafter, but failed to gain
even terms. TIGER TAP took a brush from an outer rival at the start, prompted outside of the leader and in the four path, sustained pressure two wide and
between horses around the turn, led in the three path entering the lane as an outer foe ranged up, but was outkicked by that one and an inner bidder in
upper stretch, yet held show thereafter. GUNS N' LILIES leaned inwardly and brushed a rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed
nearing the lane and gave way. WORDS OF PRAISE chased two wide and between horses, but faded entering the turn. GOLDEN RUNNER tracked three
wide and between horses, chased under urging around the turn and weakened through the lane. BAG LADY took a bump from an inner rival while off slow
at the start, lagged behind in the two path, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MAC'S TIME took a bump from an outer rival at the start before lightly contacting an inner foe in the aftermath, tracked three wide, ranged up entering the
far turn, bid turning for home, wrestled an advantage entering the lane, dueled thereafter as the pace-setter fought on, and tenaciously prevailed. JUDO set
the pace, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers into the far turn, got headed by MAC'S TIME entering the lane, fought on gallantly thereafter, but
narrowly missed at the wire. FREEZE POP took a light brush from an outer rival leaving the gates, pressed two wide, then from between foes around the far
turn, yielded to them entering the lane, but remained well clear of the rest. CLASSIC MARK stalked along the inside, chased the leading trio around the far
turn, but lacked a bid through the lane. CODE VIOLATION broke slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, came under urging two wide around the far
turn, and lacked a response. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, trailed two wide, but was outrun turning for home.

Footnotes
MISS ARLINGTON prompted the pace four wide, gained an advantage while well in hand approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear when let out a
notch entering the lane, and was ridden out under mild urging. CHILLED FIREBALL was away awkwardly before shifting ground inwardly, trailed to the turn,
gained in the four path around the bend, spun into the lane in the six path, and sustained her charge to edge place in the final sixteenth. PELICAN LANE
stalked in the four to five path around the turn, gained place at the three sixteenths pole while chasing the clear leader, but lost that position in the closing
stages. SWANSON LAKE laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail turning for home, slipped through to improve inside of rivals entering the lane,
tipped two wide in upper stretch and chased evenly thereafter, was pulled up in the vicinity of the thirteen-sixteenths pole in the gallop out and was vanned
off. SASSY WALKER vied for the lead inside of a trio of rivals into the turn, got headed by the eventual winner approaching the five sixteenths, and gave
way in upper stretch. SPICY ITALIAN lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SAUCY SECRET dueled
for the lead two wide and between horses, but caved at the five sixteenths pole. ISLANDINTHESTREAM tossed her head upon leaving the gates, tracked
along the inside, altered across a faltering foe's heels and to the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then made little impact. RUBY TAP sparred for the
lead three wide and between horses, but faded turning for home and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
SECRET MONEY tracked three wide, took aim on the clear leader from the four path in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth
pole, and edged ahead. NUMERO SEIS set the pace, built a clear margin approaching the turn, maintained it through midstretch as an outer SECRET
MONEY pursued, but was bested by that one in the final sixteenth. LURE'EM IN took a mild bump from an outer rival leaving the gates, settled off of the
pace in the three path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to gain show approaching the wire. DEVINE CHARGER
pursued from midpack along the inside, swung to the five path in upper stretch, grinded away to gain show nearing the furlong grounds, but was caught by
an outer rival for that position late. MASSARD laid off of the pace along the inside, spun into the lane in the three path, and stayed on between horses. ALL
THAT broke a step slow while leaning into an inner rival at the start, lacked speed three wide, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to
menace between horses. MISCHIEVOUS DOLL broke a beat slow, trailed in the two path into the turn, came into the lane in the four path, shifted outwardly
nearing midstretch, and moved up. WOODBINE WAY was last away while a bit flat-footed, lacked speed in the four path, swung to the seven path entering
the lane before moving out in midstretch, and passed tired rivals. DAISY BEE was restless in the starting gate, then raced far back along the inside and
never got involved. GOLDBLOODED stalked along the inside and weakened. OSIRIA stalked outside of the clear leader, lost place to an outer foe entering
the lane, and faltered through the final furlong. SNARK tracked two wide and between horses, but floated to the six path in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DE' ANS EIGHTY broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, stayed on while shifting to the five path in
the final furlong, surged up to the leader approaching the wire, and reached that foe at it to share the win honors. OBRIGADA tracked four wide, bid in upper
stretch, led into midstretch, inched away in the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire to dead heat for victory. YOU'RE AVOIDING ME tracked along the
inside while a bit off of the rail, tipped to the three path turning for home, bid along with an outer rival in upper stretch, vied among foes into the final furlong,
but yielded at the sixteenth pole. MS HAYLEY lacked speed in the three path, tucked to the fence turning for home, tipped off of the rail in upper stretch and
ran on. BALI DREAMIN pressed two wide, led in hand passing the three furlong pole, briefly cleared turning for home, but was headed by an outer pair at
the three sixteenths pole and gave way entering the final sixteenth. ELLIE DELI laid off of the pace in the five path and failed to menace. DRE ME LESS set
the pace along the inside, but was headed at the three furlong pole before weakening turning for home. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS was slow into stride and
never got involved from the three path. HALO OF FIRE chased three wide and between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole. SURE ENOUGH
was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY IRENE prompted the pace two wide, led between horses turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch, then met a challenge from an outer bidder in
the final sixteenth and held firm. DRIANA tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail, tipped outside of the leading trio entering the lane, rallied to
bear down on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but was fended off through the late stages. LACIE BE GOOD laid off of the pace in the four path, moved
out to the five path in midstretch, and offered a late kick to reach show at the wire. WITH THIS RING stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, kept on between horses thereafter, but was nailed at the wire for show. GREEN FAIRY laid off of the pace in the
three path and failed to threaten. LITTLE HOT MESS set the pace along the inside, got headed while inside of a pair foes approaching the five sixteenths
pole and gave way in upper stretch. YANIRA took a bump from an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear three wide and never got involved. ARMY GIRL
broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, chased four wide, but faded in the five path entering the lane. MIRUS raced at the rear in the four path and
never got involved.

Footnotes
FOREIGN RELATIONS stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, drove clear entering midstretch, and held well. LIMITED LIABILITY pursued from midpack
two wide and between horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch, rallied to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, and edged that position. ENGLISH
CONQUEROR stalked two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer rival entering the lane, got outkicked by that one in upper stretch, met bids for place
from rivals on both sides in the final furlong, but was outfinished by his outer counterpart. YAMATO broke a step slow, rated at the rear along the inside, split
foes two wide in upper stretch, knifed through tight quarters to bid for minor rewards inside of rivals in the final sixteenth, but was denied show. TIZ THE
BOMB tracked along the inside, chased three wide and between horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MOUNT RUNDLE laid off of the pace in the three
to four paths, advanced in the five path around the far turn, but leveled off in the six path in upper stretch. TIME FOR TROUBLE set the pace along the
inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders entering the lane and weakened through the final furlong. THERAPIST pursued from midpack three to four
wide and faded in the five path in upper stretch. ANOTHER MYSTERY settled at the rear two wide, spun into the lane in the five path and failed to factor.
BAY STREET MONEY saved ground off of the pace and faded.
