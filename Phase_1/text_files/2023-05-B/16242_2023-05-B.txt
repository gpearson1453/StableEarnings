Footnotes
ALTITUDE was bumped at the start by Regulation Daze, then was prominently placed racing between horses on the turn, caught Zaccheus at the eighth
pole and gradually drew clear. ZACCHEUS quickly opened a clear lead, saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner but held on well for
the place. REGULATION DAZED broke in to bump Altitude, then was forwardly placed while three-wide and finished in a mild rally. RAAJIN RIBBON saved
ground chasing the pace but lacked a response when asked. OAKDALE ROAD was bumped and pinched back at the start and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
KAHALA was allowed to settle in stride, moved up two-wide on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and won
going away. MY DAD IS THIRSTY hopped at the start, then saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally.
WESTERBERG was reserved off the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. RAMPATIOUS broke in the air to get away
behind his rivals, circled the field on the first turn to take the lead, quickly opened clear and then faltered during the drive. AFRICAN PRINCE was unhurried
early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten/. CHARLIE'S MAN dropped back early and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
RED PANTY NIGHT prompted Flyin By from along the outside and proved best in a prolonged drive. FLYIN BY saved ground setting the pressured pace,
responded when asked but was unable to resist the winner in a game try. DODROPIN saved ground stalking the pace, angled out for the drive but lacked
the needed late response. JACANA settled in the middle of the pack and went evenly. BADGER GAL was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and
weakened. DANCE LADY was off a step slow, moved up five-wide nearing the stretch and failed to threaten. NOUMEA dropped back while saving ground
and failed to menace.

CLASSIC LEAH vied for the early lead with Heart On the Run from along the inside, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole and prevailed under strong
handling. YOUR ROYAL COIL saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out three-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished
strongly. HEART ON THE RUN vied for the lead while racing two-wide, wasn't quite good enough but held on well for the show. QUEEN BREEZY was
unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. SMILING THUNDER was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing two-wide
and weakened. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS dropped back early, raced four-wide on the turn and failed to menace. KERRALIA dropped back early and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
DAREDEVIL PRINCESS was forwardly placed from the start, moved up three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, took command from Mischief Mame
entering the stretch and was ridden out to increase her advantage. TED'S CANDY GIRL was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, angled
further out during the drive and finished strongly. MISCHIEF MAME vied for the lead to the stretch and weakened. SENSUOUS KITTY prompted the issue
from along the inside but lacked a rally. CHEATER'S WALTZ was prominently placed while racing two-wide but lacked the needed late response. BOSSY
PEGASUS raced in the middle of the pack and went evenly. ZARAGOZA was not a factor while saving ground. TAMA SETS DA PACE dropped back early
and failed to menace.
