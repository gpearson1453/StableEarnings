Footnotes
LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD stalked behind the leading pair early on, smoothly tipped three wide entering the turn to bid along with an outer rival at the five
sixteenths pole, led entering the lane and drove clear in upper stretch. MALIBU SMART shifted out and brushed a rival at the start, tracked three wide, got
floated four wide by an inner LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD entering the turn, bid along with that one turning for home, but failed to keep pace after fanning to
the five path entering the lane, yet ran on to secure place. ORIGAMI GIRL laid off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, moved forward
between horses in upper stretch, bid for place inside of MALIBU SMART in midstretch, but was kept at bay by that one through the late stages. MERRILY
RUSH lacked speed while hung five wide into the turn, ranged up while being floated to the six path nearing the lane, but only managed to chase foes
before shifting inwardly in midstretch, then lacked a bid between horses. EMBRACEABLE took a brush from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide, then
between horses as outer rivals bid turning for home, and gave way in upper stretch. LUCKY PHOENIX set the pace inside of a vying rival, but weakened
inside of a trio of foes entering the lane.

Footnotes
GEWURZTRAMINER set a clear pace in the two path around the turn, met an outer challenge entering the lane, yet shook free at the three sixteenths pole
and drew off. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT chased along the inside, then stayed on to vie for place through midstretch and forged that position in the final
sixteenth. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE broke a step slow, recovered to stalk forwardly in the three path into the turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane, but was
turned away by the leader at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner rival for place thereafter, but was bested and saved show. KENNEL CLUB
broke a beat slow, lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the five path in upper stretch, and ran on through the final furlong but was too late to reach
show. INMYDREAMS laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. MIDNIGHT STORMY hopped as the gates sprung before losing balance upon
landing, yet recovered quickly, tracked in the two to three path into the turn, spun into the lane in the four path but tired thereafter. BAYTOWN
CHATTERBOX was slow early despite breaking well and got outrun.

Footnotes
WONDERFULL LADY (FR) saved ground off of the pace, briefly vacated the rail entering the lane, yet shifted back in and sustained a rail rally to bid leaving
the furlong pole, edged an advantage nearing the final sixteenth and held. MO SHIRO laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, then
in the two to three path around the far turn, fanned to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place approaching the wire. SANTA FE GOLD tugged
forwardly to reach the front entering the first turn, showed the way in the two path through quick splits as an outer rival applied pressure, drew clear of that
one in upper stretch, but met an inner challenge leaving the furlong grounds, relinquished the advantage to that one soon after, then lost place to an outer
bidder in the closing stages. EMBRACE ME saved ground far off of the pace, then sustained a chase along the fence through the lane.
KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF lacked speed two to three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and stayed on belatedly. CLOUDY BAY tracked from
midpack along the inside, took aim on the leader from the three path entering the lane, but failed to offer a bid before getting outkicked by an inner rival at
the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses through the late stages. C C CRUISE CONTROL pursued from midpack three wide, then chased in the
five path through the lane. NOMADIC PRIDE trailed along the inside, spun into the lane in the five path and surpassed a pair of tiring rivals. CHICA DE ORO
prompted the pace along the inside into the first turn, switched out to press the leader from the three path approaching the backstretch, but drifted to the four
path entering the lane and caved between horses in upper stretch. SHOPLIFTER tracked two wide but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
T LAW was jostled between horses at the start as an inner rival broke out and forced him into an outer foe, lacked speed two wide and between horses
early on, improved down the backstretch, progressed in the four path around the far turn to take aim on the leader nearing the lane, only managed to chase
that one through upper stretch, yet closed in inside the final sixteenth and gained a narrow advantage at the wire. NORTHWIND set the pace in the two
path, held sway from a pursuing T LAW through midstretch, but was worn down by that one in the closing stages and got nailed at the wire. STORM
STRATEGY pursued in midpack in the two path, split foes in the four path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show at the furlong grounds. SPUNS
SON brushed with an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside leaving the first turn, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path
nearing the lane, and stayed on to gain fourth entering the final sixteenth. MY FAVORITE UNCLE broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival
and crowded between horses at the start, raced at the rear four to three wide, spun into the lane in the six path, shifted in shorty after and moved up
between horses. NOBLE CONNECTION was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three path while forwardly placed, but
faded between horses turning for home and weakened through the lane. SCHMEAR was pinballed between horses at the start, lacked speed three wide
and between horses, got briefly rank inside the seven furlong pole, then took the far turn in the five path and made little impact. ROYAL AIR FORCE broke
through the gate pre-race, brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, tugged around the first turn before becoming rank entering the
backstretch, then chased turning for home and faded through the final furlong. MOON OVER DUBAI broke outwardly and bumped a foe while bothering
multiple others at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, tucked and saved ground around the far turn, but failed to factor.

CARBONITE pressed three wide, led leaving the three furlong pole, drew clear turning for home, and inched further away while hanging on his left lead.
LEMON DROP SHOT tracked two wide, pursued from the four to three path around the turn, and ran on mildly to gain place in the final sixteenth. BORN
FLAWLESS rushed forward after a flat-footed start, set the pace inside of a pair of pressers into the turn, got headed at the three furlong pole, sustained
chase in pursuit of the clear leader through the lane, but lost place to an outer rival late. BABY QUINN vied for the lead two wide and between horses into
the turn, failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart approaching the five sixteenths pole, and gave way between horses entering the lane. MULTI
PLATINUM stalked along the inside, chased the leaders from the three path around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LET MY PEOPLE GO saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes entering the lane, tipped to the three path to take aim outside of the top pair in
upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong and drove past that one in the final sixteenth. DIAMOND CITY dueled for the lead two
wide, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer bidder in the closing stages. AGENT PETER GRAVES dueled for the lead along the inside,
but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart in upper stretch, lost place to an outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, yet sustained his chase after
flopping back to his left lead and narrowly saved show at the wire. GREGORY'S PRIDE brushed with an outer rival at the start, then took back from between
horses soon after, laid far back along the inside around the turn, shifted out to the five path entering midstretch, and surged late to just miss reaching show.
ANGASTON stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, tipped to the three path entering the lane, but only managed to chase before fading in the
final furlong. PRIME FACTOR tracked in the three path and between horses, but gave way in the four path entering the lane. MAJOR BLUE took contact
from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked in the four path around the turn but yielded between horses. SAIL AT SUNRISE bumped an inner rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, then failed to factor along the inside. SUTHERLAND lacked speed in the four path, fanned to
the six path entering the lane and made little impact. FRIAR LAURENCE trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, then shook clear in upper stretch and drew off under driving pressure. FIRE ON TIME
prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but proved no match for her inner counterpart in upper stretch and lasted safely for place. LAST LEAF
saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on to edge show in the final sixteenth. SPIRIT WIND tracked the embattled leading pair from the three path
around the turn, but lacked progress through the lane and lost show to an inner rival late. MARISSA'S LADY raced at the rear in the four path around the
turn and never got involved.

grounds. SRI LANKA settled far back two to three wide, fanned to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole. BOPPY set the
pace in the three to two path around the first turn, then along the rail as an outer pair of rivals offered bid around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch, but
was outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds, gave way thereafter yet saved show. LADY DYNAMO raced at the rear along the inside,
shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied while altering course outside of rivals at the furlong grounds and stayed on. HOLY FOLEY tracked in the
four to five path around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn, vied in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds
and yielded between horses. BLESSING THE FLAG pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, tipped three wide in
upper stretch, but failed to menace. DIXIE SUPREME took a bump from an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, then four wide around the far
turn, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. HARMONICA tracked two wide, then outside of the leading trio around the far turn, but lacked
a bid before fading between horses. SUMMERTIME ROSE leaned against the outer half of the starting gate before bumping an outer rival upon leaving it,
then laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and failed to factor. ABBREVIATION lacked speed along the inside and made iittle impact. ROSY
TOMORROWS stalked in the four path around the first turn, bid two wide along with an outer rival around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. MAD
