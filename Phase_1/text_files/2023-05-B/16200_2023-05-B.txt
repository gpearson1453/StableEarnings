ONCE A GIANT was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, then went on even terms for command nearing the furlong
marker and slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. EGOT A POKER FACE pressed the early pace on the inside, then rated back, shifted out
leaving t he five sixteenths, made a three wide move to gain a short lead leaving the turn, but then was confronted by the winner and was outfinished by that
rival, good effort. SHANGHAI CANDY was reserved early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole to loom boldly but flattened out, bested rest. UNCLE
YUDI passed the tiring rivals. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY pressed the early pace and then vied for the lead three wide and tired. OUCH OUCH OUCH set a
pressured pace two wide early, then vied for the lead on the inside and then gave way.

GOOD SOURCE set the early pace on the inside and drew out leaving the turn, then remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. SURPRISINGLY
SWEET was settled early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled off the inside in the lane and finished well, second best. LOIS'S CAUSE was allowed
to settle three to four wide, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally to be up for the show award. COLOR FORCE stalked the pace two wide,
steadied slightly by the three eighths and came three wide into the lane and faded. MY LADY'S AUNT MA stalked the pace three wide and came four wide
into the lane and was empty. LAUGH IT OFF failed to menace. GLOSSY MADRINA lacked a rally. SHARP CATCH chased the pace on the inside and

GIUSEPPE set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then drew out leaving the turn and then maintained a safe margin to the wire under
mild urging. GOLDEN TREASURE was rated along the inside, steadied leaving the five sixteenths, then got through on the inside and angled out in the lane
and closed fast, second best. IF WE GET LUCKY pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane, bested rest. NECCO was reserved early, in traffic
nearing the furlong marker and then had a belated rally for the minor rewards. RIPKEN stumbled at the start, then was being motivated early, passed the
tiring rivals. LUCKILY LEYTON broke outwardly at the start bumping a rival, then tracked the pace in between rivals and weakened in the drive. BOB'S OUR
UNCLE was bumped hard at the start, then had a wide run on the turn and weakened. IOLA'S BLACK failed to menace. AFLEET AIRO stalked the pace
three wide and stopped. RUNAWAYTOTHEMOON chased the pace five wide and stopped.
