Footnotes
MYSTIC MALIBU gave chase through the backstretch, closed to the front two deep approaching the eighth pole and was steadily handled to draw off. ICY
STARE veered outward leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn then dug in through the lane to take second the final strides. DEVIN
ON EARTH took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, gave up the lead nearing the eighth pole then
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DEAREST M. A. was forced outward and into AVALANCHE IS COMIN then picked up the chase, raced near the rail on
the turn and ran evenly in the lane. The latter was bumped outward and into AMERICAN DREAMER leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the four path then flattened later yards. AMERICAN DREAMER was bumped outward and into NO SHARING, gave chase through
the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. NO SHARING was bumped at the break and never factored.

Footnotes
JAMMIN STILL rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled close, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even
terms, drew clear midway on the far turn and held on under steady encouragement. DUSTWHIRL WONDER settled back off the rail, started a bid
approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail into the turn but angled to the five path nearing the head of the lane, finished well to take second the
final strides and just missed the win. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced
in the three path on the far turn, was outfinished in the duel through the stretch then nipped from second the final strides. MY CANDY BIZ stalked toward the
inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. REY O REYES stalked the early pace
from the three path, closed to the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled Jammin Still from that point, but dropped back at the rail midway on the
far turn and flattened stride mid-stretch. GOT FLOFFY rated the pace inside, was met past the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but
dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. MAKE WAY rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase into the
backstretch but showed little response.

Footnotes
LET'S GO MO saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, dug in for
the lead later yards and raced clear approaching the wire. LINDA'S TAJ came away a bit awkwardly but took a quick lead while angling to the inside, came
under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, drew clear at the rail toward the head of the lane, but was met, and relented in later yards. WAY LUCKY
settled off the rail then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came
along for third later yards. WICKED SAUCY raced with the pace two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn, was
carried out into the lane and flattened stride. SWEET FACTOR settled off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn
and ran evenly in the stretch. MUNNIS PRETTY rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened
into the far turn. AWESOME LUCKYCHARM was never a factor. SUPER SWEETIE raced well back off the rail on the first turn, bore out into the backstretch
and was no factor racing wide.

OVERLY CRITICAL raced with the pace inside, dueled with the advantage past the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
drifted in the upper stretch but dug in when straightened away and raced clear mid-stretch. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in to take second later yards. FREEDOM RIDER settled in the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, steadied off the heels of PYEONG CHANG
past the eighth pole but dug in to take the nod for third under the wire. The latter raced with the pace two deep, contested at a close disadvantage leaving
the three eighths pole, was carried out past the eighth pole finished evenly but was nipped from third under the wire. CANDY INVASION saved ground just
off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SANTO settled off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and ran evenly in the stretch. STEAL THE
CASH rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane.

MY MIRACLE MAN took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, was given rein to keep the edge over Amicalola Falls leaving the three
eighths pole, came under pressure past the five sixteenths and drew off under steady handling. CHEERS FOR KITTEN had a brief early lead inside then
stalked into the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out approaching the head of the lane and dug
in to take second later yards. SULEMAN saved ground on the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came
along for third later yards. AMICALOLA FALLS raced off the rail on the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, challenged toward the seven sixteenths
pole but dropped back through the far turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR came away awkwardly and raced well off
the pace and off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SLOE GIN BIZ rounded the opening turn in the three path,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. STAVANGER showed little response through the backstretch.
Stronger Than Dex became fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
WISHING FOR SPRING gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. BLUE MOUNTAIN was hustled to the
lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested even terms two deep on the turn, drew clear into the lane but was caught in
the final yards. JACKYSINTHECASTLE chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the five path into the lane and finished well while
gaining on the top two. LET'S DO THIS chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. I
SHALLBE RELEASED gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. POWER SONDE came away a bit awkwardly then gave
chase, raced in the five path on the turn, left the turn outside and passed rivals. MICHEAUX chased, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little
in the lane. VEGAS PRINCESS pressed the pace inside, contested even terms at the rail on the turn then weakened past the eighth pole. A BLONDE
THING saved ground. MARLEESBEEBEE had a brief early lead, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the six path on the turn.
