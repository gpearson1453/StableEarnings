Footnotes
ACAMAR set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. CARSOWN had early speed, lost traction for a few strides early on, raced in range inside,
tipped two wide in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on to hold the place. CHENTI broke outwardly and bumped after the
start, saved ground off the pace and a mild rail rally. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP raced in range three wide, tipped four wide turning for home and was
one-paced through the lane. FORTHELOVEOFART failed to menace while racing two and three wide. TUMIGA raced well back two wide, went four wide
around the far turn, swung nine wide turning for home and never threatened. MAKE 'EM TAP played no factor while racing three and four wide. DOLLAR
BILL was outrun in the two path. NORFIE prompted the winner two and three wide and tired in the lane. RANSEUR chased the pace four wide and came up
empty in the lane.

Footnotes
KHOSEA tracked in the three path, loomed up around the far turn, was roused to bid from the four path into the lane, took command nearing the eighth pole,
and drew clear under right handed encouragement. LA RUSIA raced in midpack around the five path, was put to a ride into the far turn, floated out to the
seven path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS rated in the four path, tipped out to the six path and was
under coaxing around the far turn, was out in the ten path and under left handed urging entering the lane, and kept on for show. RADIANT GEM trailed in
the three path early, was driven around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and was no factor. MORNING COLORS was loose on the
lead around the four path into the backstretch, but yielded in the three path down the lane. MONEY FACTOR was unhurried in the two path early but never
menaced. SCENIC VIEW raced off the pace while under a hold around the four path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MO VANISHING broke in at the start, tracked in the five path, was cued in the four path around the far turn, bid under left handed encouragement from the
six path into the lane, took command nearing the eighth pole, drifted out passing the sixteenth, but drew clear. TWIRLING EXPRESS was fractious in the
gate, stalked in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. WILD GUESS vied for the lead
in the three path, took a narrow advantage under a hold into the backstretch, lost that advantage and was nudged along into the far turn, was in the four
path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. SOUTHERN DREAM was unhurried along the inside early, cued left handed midway around the far turn,
tipped out to the three path into the stretch, but was no factor. HEART N SOUL was fractious in the gate, set a contested pace in the two path, lost the lead
into the backside, regained the lead passing the half, was roused along the inside early around the far turn, but yielded in the stretch. DONTONIO rated in
the four path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but never threatened. MEMORIES R MAGIC chased between foes in the four path but backed up
early around the far turn.

STURDY GIRL was off a bit slowly, angled out midway down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead, rallied outside and just missed. SPONGER set a pressured pace along the rail, dueled inside through the lane and gave way
grudgingly. FIND YOUR PASSION chased the pace two wide, stayed on between foes but was outkicked. TEMERITY saved ground off the pace, was
gaining in midstretch then was blocked through the final sixteenth. KILLARGUE'S GIRL trailed in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR settled off the pace along the inside, edged closer inside around most of the far turn, tipped three wide near the quarter pole,
rallied outside and was up late. EMPIRE ATTRACTION stalked the pace two wide, took the lead leaving the five-sixteenths marker and led until deep
stretch. CATATUMBO saved ground well back, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside for the show. SWASHBUCKLE set the pace along
the rail, was headed leaving the five-sixteenths pole, resisted inside to midstretch then weakened. KINISON failed to menace while racing two wide. MY
MAN FLINT saved ground off the early pace, made a middle move between foes down the backstretch, continued to gain three wide around the far turn but
came up empty in the lane. MOST WANTED MAN trailed early, made a four wide middle move down the backstretch, chased four wide around the far turn
and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
AJAAYB raced prominently in the two path, stuck a head in front while in the three path rounding the turn, received a right handed cue from the four path
into the lane, drifted out under left handed encouragement and brush with a challenging outer rival passing the sixteenth pole, and held on. DREAM
KNIGHT raced in midpack from the seven path into the turn, circled inner foes from the six path around the turn, took aim from said position into the lane,
ran on to bid into final furlong, but was herded out slightly and brushed passing the sixteenth pole to finish in place. LUSCIOUS DANCER rated in the two
path, was ridden around the turn and swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. BERNARDO'S LEGACY stalked in the five path,
was nudged along in the three path around the turn, but was one paced while back out in the six path down the stretch. TEJOTA set the pace along the rail,
but lost the lead around the turn, and faded from the three path in the stretch. NICO'S HAVING FUN tracked in the six path but flattened down the lane.
MIDNIGHT CHAOS chased in the three path, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but was no factor. PERFECT MOON bumped with an inner foe at
the start, raced wellback in the five path but did not threaten. REDISUR trailed in the five path early and never menaced. PAPA DEL CIELO bumped with an
outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path but never threatened. DELTA RISING prompted the pace in the four path but gaveway around the
turn. AFTER AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DREAM KNIGHT AND A STEWARDS INQUIRY, AJAAYB WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST
AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS OF DREAM KNIGHT IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH COSTING A CHANCE

CHOOSE JOY broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed
determinedly and was up in the final strides. FULMINATE set a clear pace along the rail and led until deep stretch. TALKIN TIPSY stalked the pace from the
rail and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. BASKING broke inwardly and slowly, advanced four wide around the turn and had a mild
stretch gain. NIKEE KAN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B saved ground to no avail. ONE IDENTITY was bumped
repeatedly early, raced off the pace two wide and was never a threat. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY was bumped between foes soon after the start, saved
ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. WAR OF AGES tracked the pace three wide and faded through the
lane. ST. PAT'S DAY was bumped repeatedly early and made little impact while racing four and five wide. LADY FRIJOLES had speed two wide, checked
nearing the quarter pole and retreated. ARELLA STAR was bumped after the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path, loomed up in the four path early around the turn, took command and
opened up under a ride into the lane, and held sway under left handed encouragement. STARSHIP RENEGADE had his head turned and bumped with an
inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was driven from the five path turning into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. AVANT GLORY
set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, lost the lead to the winner midway around the turn, but kept on to hold show. PICKING UP PENNIES
prompted the pace in the four path, was under urging into the stretch, but faded. GANGLY trailed in the three path early and did not threaten from the seven
path down the lane. STORMY PATTERN had his head turned at the start, tracked inside but backed up around the turn.

safe under a drive. ANOTHER DUKE lacked speed, circled five wide around the turn and finished well to be clearly second best. HERCULES raced in range
three wide and churned on to gain the show. MAN ON THE MOON tracked the pace four wide, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole but tired in the lane.
WAR CROSS chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. CONFESSOR prompted the pace three wide and faltered in the lane. AMERICAN
PRINCE was up close four wide and was through after half. TRAPPEZOID vied in the two path and was done after a half. EUPHORIA STAR played no

Footnotes
WIDE WEST (IRE) pressed in the three path, took control around the turn, was roused from the four path into the lane, drifted out late, but held gamely.
HARRY TIME (IRE) stalked between foes in the three path, was put to a ride while tipping out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. DR
OSERAN had a slow start, raced wellback along the inside early, was roused midway around the turn and fanned out to the nine path into the stretch,
angled inwards into the final furlong and rallied between foes for show. PORTOFINO tracked in the four path, tipped out to the six path into the lane, drifted
out passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. MOONCAPTURE bumped with an inner foe, then an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was driven from
the four path into the lane, but was one paced. JETAROS laid off the speed in the two path, angled out around the turn and was in the eight path entering
the lane, but was no factor. EXTENDO bumped with an outer foe at the start, was hustled to lead from the two path into the turn, but faded in the stretch.
MY MAN IRA bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path early and did not threaten. COOLER KING raced off the pace in the three path
and failed to menace. UNCAPTURED STAR raced in range around the four path but had to steady into the turn, and was empty into the stretch.
