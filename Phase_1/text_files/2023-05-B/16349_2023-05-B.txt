Footnotes
PRINCESS ADALEIGH set the pace inside SECRETS TOLD to the top of the stretch, then cleared and remained strong to the wire under urging. SECRETS
TOLD pressed the winner from outside, lost touch with that rival at the three-sixteenths pole but stayed on well to prove second best. TIZ A MACHO GIRL
trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, started to ease out at the quarter pole and tipped further out into the lane, showed a mild rally
and gained the show. HOTITUDE stalked inside a pair of rivals early, bumped into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a bid. BENEDICT
CANYON stalked the top pair three deep into and around the turn and failed to respond when called upon. QUIET SECRETARY stalked between rivals,
bumped with HOTITUDE at the three-eighths pole, remained between foes in the two path to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BECKY'S DREAM (FR) pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader approaching the quarter pole, took over shortly after and inched ahead leaving
the bend, put away inner rival in upper stretch and drew away under hand urging and flagging with the crop. SHE'S MY NIECE set the pace inside a rival,
raced on even terms at the quarter pole, lost command late on the bend, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch but kept on for a clear second. KYTHIRA
tracked outside rivals early then three wide on the turn and failed to produce a bid. THEY ARE FOR SALE was reluctant to load, broke a step slow and
trailed early, passed rivals four then three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST antsy prior to the start, brushed the gate,
stalked the top pair from inside into the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend and weakened. SMOOVE OVER chased two wide leaving the
backstretch, lost his path and steadied on the turn, steered to the inside and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CLASSYMADEMOISELLE showed early speed from the rail, ceded command to the PARCO around the first turn and switched outside to stalk that rival,
applied pressure at the midway point, headed rival on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, disposed of PARCO entering the stretch, met the challenge
from RUN FOR MY HONEY entering the final furlong and drew clear late. RUN FOR MY HONEY trailed three then four wide on the first turn before moving
up close widest up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane, challenged the winner with a furlong left to run and was turned away in the final
sixteenth. HOT ROD MAMA chased two to three wide early, raced up close three deep leaving the backstretch, got put in tight between at the three-eighths
pole to lose some ground, chased two wide exiting the bend, tried to rally between the top pair but lacked room and had to alter in past the eighth pole, then
lacked the needed late punch in the deep stretch. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER was off a bit slow, settled inside, trailed two to three wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. PARCO dueled outside a rival into the first turn, cleared around the bend, pressured at the halfway point, dueled again on the far turn, lost
command at the quarter pole, stayed on to the top of the stretch then weakened.

HEIR (FR) stalked the leader from inside, coaxed around the turn and cut the corner in the stretch but failed to respond in the lane. ALPINE THUNDER
bumped in the beginning, steadied when losing his path behind TOOK CHARGE early, stalked outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and
leveled off. HEMBREE bumped leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch and moved over to the inside, steered out with a quarter mile left to run,
summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. TOOK CHARGE cleared and crossed over early, showed the way along the inside into the lane, drew away from
CHAOS THEORY in upper stretch when roused and was ridden out to the wire. CHAOS THEORY was well placed early behind and outside the pacesetter,
chased two wide through the turn, asked right and left handed in the lane but lacked the needed response and flattened to third.

WRONG TURN CUPID set the pace under pressure from outside rival, continued to show the way a bit off the rail into the drive, maintained a short lead into
deep stretch, cleared LUNATIC late and held over the late charge from TROPICANA GIRL in the closing moments. TROPICANA GIRL stalked from inside,
lost some ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied along the fence and drew alongside the winner late but ran out of time. LUNATIC
pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, hounded the winner into the final sixteenth but could not summon the needed final kick and got
outfinished for the place. DRIZELLA bumped two times at the start, stalked three deep then three wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and kept on for a
minor award. TALKATIVE GAL stalked four deep in the early going, spun four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. VEGAN shifted out and bumped
rival repeatedly at the start, chased between then in the two path on the turn and weakened. BIG BELL broke a step slow, chased along the inside and
failed to menace. ISLAND LIFE got pinballed between rivals then lost her path shortly after, trailed three then two wide around the bend and could not make
an impact. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED VEGAN FROM SIXTH TO LAST FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING
INTERFERENCE TO ISLAND LIFE AT THE START.

Footnotes
KATONAH stalked three then two wide early, coaxed along on the far turn then had to wait for room from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, tipped
three wide approaching the furlong grounds, chased FLYING DRUMMER into the final sixteen and surged past late. FLYING DRUMMER bobbled leaving
the gate but still broke near the front, went up to take the lead inside a rival, lost command at the half-mile pole, vied between into the far turn, dueled into
the lane, regained command in upper stretch, cleared inner rival midstretch but could not fend off the winner in the final strides. DIVINE ARMOR raced up
close three deep into the first turn, traveled four deep on the backstretch, asked four then three deep on the far turn, faltered in the furlong grounds but
managed to save the show. SHOW TIME stalked from along the rail, moved up to take over nearing the half-mile pole, vied with rivals into the far turn, held
a slim lead over FLYING DRUMMER leaving that bend, relinquished command in upper stretch and weakened. FINNEUS was rank early chasing two then
three wide, made progress while angling out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. MOTOWN MUSIC trailed on the inside early,
passed a tired rival on the far turn and was not a factor. COASTAL KID prompted the pace two wide early, vied three deep on the backstretch, started to
weaken with a quarter mile remaining and faded in the lane. VANZZY chased four wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped back five wide on the last turn,
eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FAST BUCK sprinted well clear early to open up on the field, showed the way along the inside through the turn, held a diminished but still comfortable lead
into the stretch, met the challenge from WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN at the eighth pole, shifted out a bit with a sixteenth to go and gamely prevailed.
WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN settled in the early going off the inside, took the turn four then three wide, made progress crossing over the dirt and into the
lane, drew alongside FAST BUCK at the eighth pole, dueled through the final furlong, got floated out a touch at the sixteenth pole and could not get by.
LOVESICK BLUES chased from inside off the pace to the stretch, launched a rally up the fence inside and drew alongside the top pair late but ran out of
time. BURNIN TURF was closest in pursuit in the early, navigated the turn three then two wide, gained on FAST BUCK across the dirt, chased the top pair
into deep stretch and had to alter out when lacking room nearing the wire. INDIAN PEAK trailed on the inside into the turn, angled out with a quarter mile
remaining, chased four wide into the lane, moved into range in upper stretch but leveled off in deep stretch. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE raced two wide near
the back into the turn, dropped back to last around the bend, came three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) broke a
step slow, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then between foes on the turn, was box in at the quarter pole, then weakened in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF MAKENA was closest in pursuit of FORBIDDEN KINGDOM off the inside early, launched a bid from outside with a quarter mile remaining, took
over into the lane, put away inner rival when asked left handed in upper stretch, urged a few times with the right hand in the final furlong and remained well
clear to the wire. C Z ROCKET was off a bit slow on the outside, gained three to four wide around the turn and moved into range, could not summon the
needed late kick to threaten the winner in the final furlong but was able to edge DESMON DOSS for the place honors. DESMOND DOSS settled early,
raced along the inside into the turn, was on the move while tipping out at the quarter pole, chased inside C Z ROCKET through the lane and was edged by
that rival for the place. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail around the bend before being
challenged at the quarter pole, overtaken by the winner into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. POSITIVITY raced near the back early, went two
wide into the turn, got blocked by MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH and checked at the three-eighths pole, angled in then back out around the bend and failed to
threaten in the lane. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH raced in range on the inside, came out on the turn and dropped back around the bend, then faded in the
stretch. HOWBEIT broke a step slow, trailed four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and made no impact.

Footnotes
PRECOCIOUS TIMES fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, stalked inside in hand then tugged forward and went between rivals in the middle stages,
remained between rivals on the far turn in the two path, tipped out in the lane and swept by the leaders quickly at the eighth pole, then won going away
under mild asking. WIRLY GIRLY took control early and moved inside, pressured by PAID IN GOLD in the middle stages, headed by that rival midway
around the far turn, dueled to upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the furlong grounds and stayed on to hold second. PAID IN GOLD
raced up close from outside early, applied pressure up the backstretch, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled to upper stretch, was overtaken by
the winner with a furlong left to run and was outkicked by WIRLY GIRLY for second. LT'S CHOICE stalked the pace from inside, coaxed behind the leaders
on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. BILLY GALLIVAN got floated out some by inner rival at the start, became a bit rank early then ran two to three
wide around the first turn, trailed two wide into the second bend them oved inside, tipped out in the lane and failed to threaten. CON SEAL AND KERRY
pulled and became rank early in the three path, chased three deep in to the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and weakened.
