Footnotes
RED LABEL allowed to sprint to the lead, was in hand on the turn, put to urging upper stretch, widened command and was kept to task to the final sixteenth.
STORMIN EL PRADO moved clear for second from inside on the turn, was no match for RED LABEL when set down for the drive, began to wear down
inside the last eighth but lasted for the place. COPPER CROSSING was settled to the back after his break, picked up his pace from inside on the turn,
fanned out to path three entering the lane, showed a willingness to run late, came up short for second but was easily best of the others. ARGYBARGY
BUCK was just off the inside on the turn, floated out to path five into the stretch and ran evenly. MIDNIGHT JOKER chased from outside, took the bend
three then four wide and had no late bid. CALL ME DROSSEL pressed RED LABEL from just outside, began to yield as he drifted out through the turn and
continued to give way for the drive.

Footnotes
READY MADE shared the early lead in hand on the backstretch, was let out some on the bend, received mild urging upper stretch and continued to
lengthen command while ridden out the last furlong. TRUIST boxed in early, advanced from inside on the turn, moved clear for second from path two upper
stretch, steadily drifted out the rest of the way but lasted for second. KEEN RESPONSE hesitated at the start, was settled outside, rallied six wide in the
stretch and caught MARY'S BOY for third. MARY'S BOY chased from between rivals, progressed two wide on the bend, swung out to path five into the
stretch, battled for third and leveled off in the late going. STAY STRONG in contention early, yielded three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive
and lacked a significant response. SERVICEMAN fractious in the gate, displayed early speed outside READY MADE but gave way the last two furlongs.

OH LA DE DA without early speed, picked up her pace from inside on the bend, waited for room leaving the turn, fanned out behind GREER CROSSING
into the lane, altered inside for a clear path upper stretch, took over with little asking inside the last eighth then drew away under confident handling. W W
VALID was hustled along to stay close early, progressed two wide on the turn, was forced out to path four into the stretch, battled outside GREER
CROSSING for the lead then for second inside the final furlong and narrowly kept second. GREER CROSSING contested the pace from outside, moved
clear on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, was challenged from outside then inside, as well, midstretch, fought for second in the late going, did
not have enough but was clearly best of the rest. ENVEY N ICE a step slow at the start, saved ground taking the turn and passed inside tired ones in the
stretch. THE SCORE IS EVEN retreated some while losing ground four then five wide on the bend and lacked a stretch bid. BOBTAIL CANETTE displayed
early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing four furlongs. GULF BENDER helped prompt the pace from outside but began to fade three wide
before finishing a half mile. PRINCESS MAE chased from outside and showed little.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR BALA shared the early lead in hand, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was asked leaving the turn then steadily pulled away with nearly
all hand urging in the lane. MON AMI FUZZIE chased from between horses, retreated three wide on the turn, swung out some for a clear path entering the
stretch and caught EMPTY HOLSTER for second late. EMPTY HOLSTER chased from inside, same off the rail some after straightening for the drive, took
over second but began to wear down in the waning yards. GHAALEB'S HONOR ran evenly in a wide trip. A MERRY HEART void of speed between rivals,
progressed two wide on the bend, moved to the rail for a clear path upper stretch, fought for third briefly then leveled off in the late going. RIGHT ON
RICHIE trailed, had the rail on the turn, fanned out some entering the lane, moved back to the rail inside the last furlong and passed a couple tired rivals.
GREAT PLAINES displayed early speed outside LOOKIN FOR BALA, did not stay with that one on the bend, floated out into the stretch and gradually
continued to yield. THE LAST FACT well placed from inside on the backstretch, began to yield between foes on the turn.

Footnotes
JULYNNE a step slow at the break, was settled well off the early speed, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, advanced along the rail through the bend,
took the lead inside NAPABIT nearing the sixteenth marker and began to draw off. NAPABIT shared the lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the
turn, floated out some entering the stretch and began to slowly wear down from midstretch. COMMISSIONER GULCH hesitated at the start, trailed running
widest, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned outside CANDY LOOKER for the stretch run, took over third inside the last eighth then leveled off.
LUTION broke outward, bumping GOLDICAT, chased from just off the inside, was steadied as she aimed for a narrow path along the rail approaching the
quarter pole, checked in tight quarters leaving that marker then passed inside tired ones in the lane. GOLDICAT bumped at the break, was hustled to
dispute the pace outside NAPABIT, did not stay with that one on the turn and flattened out for the drive. CANDY LOOKER pressed the early pace from
outside, did not keep up three wide on the bend and gave way through the stretch. GABRIELLA ATTACK prompted the early leaders but gave way between
horses before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
MISS WINDY SLEW broke in stride, showed the way in hand, was let out from inside on the bend, floated out some as she was urged leaving the turn,
widened her lead in the stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth but narrowly held back WILDWOOD BYE under steady handling. WILDWOOD
BYE advanced between rivals to press MISS WINDY SLEW from outside midway on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, was all out in the lane,
closed well but had to settle for second best. TROUBLE FINDS ME well placed from inside, found herself boxed in on the bend, fanned out behind MISS
WINDY SLEW for the stretch run, lacked the needed late kick but lasted for the show. SHEZ STUCK UP prominent from outside, did not keep up three wide
on the turn, swung out four wide into the lane and showed a willingness to run deep stretch. WITCHING forwardly placed between horses on the
backstretch, did not stay close while along the rail on the bend and lacked a significant stretch response. JERSEY GOLD appeared to make a slight lunge
from the gate, chased from outside, was just off the rail on the turn, swung out behind WILDWOOD BYE for the stretch run and made up minor ground the
final eighth. MARIA'S GIFT failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
MY MORNING GAL bumped with TRIPLE SCOUT at the break, stalked the early leader from between rivals, gradually angled in as others dropped back as
she went for the lead on the bend, moved clear into the lane, took the inside and held sway under steady handling. ORNERY ANGEL raced in the second
flight just off the inside, gained the rail on the turn, fanned out some for a clear path into the stretch and gradually edged ahead for second as she closed the
gap just outside MY MORNING GAL in the late going. TRIPLE SCOUT bumped with MY MORNING GAL at the start, raced in contention from outside, also
gradually angled in as she progressed through the bend, fought for second three wide in the lane but could not sustain her bid in the waning yards. ROCK
THE BIRDHOUSE advanced two wide on the turn, angled outside TRIPLE SCOUT for a clear path upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late.
WILDCAT BOBBIE dwelt at the start then broke inward, was slow to find her stride, lost ground staying well off the inside taking the turn, angled inside
NEXT TIME YOU WIN midstretch and also showed some late interest. HELEN MAE'S SONG broke on top but was soon prompting the pace between
horses, gradually angled in, as well, as she vied for the lead on the bend, did not stay with MY MORNING GAL leaving the turn and gave way through the
stretch. NEXT TIME YOU WIN was shuffled back from tight quarters midway on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the turn, drifted out some at the top
of the stretch and steadily faded. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN was away slowly, rushed up to the lead from inside but gave way before finishing three furlongs.
