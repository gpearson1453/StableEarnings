Footnotes
FLASHY BOY GOES broke well, pressured the winner from the outside for a half, dueled in the two path then took over midway on the turn, clear into the
lane, increased advantage through the stretch under his own courage to win ridden out. EASY EDDIE A settled off the early pace while three wide up the
backstretch, asked along midway on the turn, proved no match in the run to the wire, clearly second best. FREE FALLING NATE behind the two leaders off
the rail, crept a bit closer midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane to finish up best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. SACRED NATION
fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to late early turn, came four wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals without posing a serious
threat. TRIPLE RED ACES showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, dueled through the early part of the turn then
began to give wai, continued to weaken stretch. POWER MASTER last to leave, remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
SERMONONTHEMOUNT close from the start, moved up to duel in the two path after a half, put that rival away turning for home, steadily pulled away while
kept to p4ressure. MIAS MOONBEAM last to leave, void of early foot in trailing for six furlongs, came four to five wide into the stretch, rallied out in the strip,
nod for the place at the wire. BIG MONEY MACHINE lacked early foot, advanced into a contending position three wide late in the final turn, flattened out in
the drive, nipped for the runner up spot at the wire. MASTERLY broke on top showed the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace onto the
backstretch, responded and dueled with the winner when that challenged after a half, began to give way late in the final bend. OVERTHOUGHT settled off
the pace, lacked a closing response. GUITARZAN within striking distance early, began a steady fade before a half.

MS. CAJUN QUEEN outrun past the wire the first time in the three path, moved two wide through the first turn, launched a quick move along the rail into the
far turn, collared the leader late in that bend to that one's outside, pulled away steadily through the stretch. CZAR'S BALLERINA last to leave, void of speed
for six furlongs, raced four wide out of the final turn, rallied to finish up willingly and earn the place, not a serious threat to the winner. MADISON'S SCREEN
in the second flight toward the inside, came out into the far turn to bother a couple of outer rivals, three wide into the stretch, came out again sharply while
under a left handed crop to once again bother rivals. SKY HIGH SUSAN in the second flight while between horses, put in tight then was forced to check
when MADISION'S SCREEN came out, was going evenly through the lane when bothered by that same foe late, slowly getting to that one for the show spot
final strides. SERIOUSLY SAM another who raced in the second group, bothered on the outside into the far turn when MADISON'S SCREEN came out,
came four wide for the drive, bothered again by that same rival who was lugging out. PSEUDOSCIENCE lacked speed, continued to lag while saving
ground second turn, improved through the lane, bothered late in some traffic. SERAPE broke on top, narrowly showed the way into and through the first
turn, dueled onto the backstretch, quickly shook clear before a half, faltered when headed by the winner late in the final turn. SUGAR STAR remained back
while racing three wide. MRS. NECAISE in the second flight early, beat a steady retreat before a half. FOLLOWING CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS
OF SKY HIGH SUSAN AND SERIOUSLYT SAM AGAINST MADISION'S SCREEN FOR INTERFERENCE AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, THE LATTER
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
MULETRAIN forwardly placed, asked along while saving ground into the lane, in tight along the rail past the furlong marker, showed good determination to
be up in tight at the wire. COUNT ON RAIN dueled up front while off the inside, larger lead in the two path midway on the turn, allowed the winner the inside
upper stretch, came in slightly to tighten that foe up a furlong out, continued to lead late, missed. GOLDEN CONFUSION forwardly placed while racing three
wide, continued to press the issue into the lane, not enough in the late going. CHAHTA SIA lacked speed outside, raced four wide through the turn,
improved position out in the strip through the lane with some mild interest, no threat to the top three. LORD HELP ME off a step slow, trailed early toward
the inside, improved position inside of several foes into the lane, flattened out a bit in the late going. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN went one paced off the inside.
GLITTER STORM in mid pack, had little for the drive. UNCLE CHAN broke forwardly, dueled off the inside, began to give way midway on the turn,
continued to falter through the stretch. DIXIELAND STORMING finished early while racing well wide.

Footnotes
BRITE OUTLOOK broke sharp but outward to help tighten up a couple of outer rivals, set or forced the pace along the inside inherited a narrow advantage
late in the final turn, headed entering the stretch, dug in gamely late to narrowly prevail. GLUCKSTADT in the second flight early, bit closer along the inside
second turn, steered out three wide for the drive just behind the two leaders, lost some ground to that pair into the straight, late run outside to challenge,
missed. DONEGAL FACTOR stalked the pace while off the inside, moved inside a foe second turn to get closer, tried the winner from the outside entering
the stretch, briefly put a head in front then went flat late while between the top two at the wire. BUTLER CABIN in tight at the start, raced back early as a
result while saving ground, some belated interest inside, lacked closing punch. SIR LIAM in at the break, four wide into the first turn when off the pace,
continued off the inside, four wide again into the stretch, failed to rally. F J'S FLACO remained back in failing to menace. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT off slowly,
never a factor. TALK TO TOKEY restless in the gate, broke in, quickly straightened to duel outside the winner, continued to alternate up the backstretch, got
out in the far turn and gave way, jogged in.

Footnotes
DEALIN' STELEN allowed the pace to go early, came three wide under encouragement into the stretch, continued to chase past the furlong marker, late
push to be up in time. BAND BOSS broke on top set a soft pace along the inside, extended that advantage past the furlong marker, weakened late to be
caught by the winner, managed to save the place. GUITAR TRIBUTE settled off the pace and the inside, roused four wide into the lane, late run to annex
the show. APPLEWOOD pressed the soft fractions while off the inside, continued to race forwardly into and through upper stretch, had little left late to lose.
EAST LEX void of speed, displayed a mild amount of late interest. TAKEN BACK last to leave, trailed early, improved a bit the third quarter then flattened
out in the drive.

Footnotes
FIRST GLIMPSE closest to the off the inside, continued pursuit the middle half, challenged into the lane, dueled to the wire, drifted in carrying that foe into
the gap late under a right handed crop, narrowly prevailed. FORTUITY shook clear before a quarter in showing the way, rated in the run up the backstretch
and into the far turn, let out a notch into the lane, extended stretch duel, carried in late to miss. BUDRO TALKING lacked speed outside, dropped in a bit
turning for home when called on for run, split foes past the furlong marker and finished willingly to be closing the gap on the top two late. UNCLE FRANK
raced in mid pack and off the inside, raced under stout restraint up the backstretch, second flight into the stretch, roused when straightened for home, not
enough for the top three at the end. PEACOCK KITTEN raced off the pace while saving ground, improved by cutting the corner into the straight, flattened
out in the late going. SNIVELING within striking distance for six furlongs, came up empty for the drive. CHARLIE G back off the pace, raced in some traffic
into the far turn, came up empty for the stretch run. STRONG EAGLE four wide in the first turn when off the pace, had little left for the stretch run.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF FORTUITY AGAINST FIRST GLIMPSE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
CARLOS' BLAST with the early pace while ,between foes, dueled through the turn in the two path, shook clear entering the stretch and maintained a
daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. ASTROLOGY WONOWON vied early three wide and outside the winner, fell back off the two leaders
through the turn, continued to pursue into the stretch, could do little with the winner late, narrowly retained the second spot closest to the inside of the
second flight. ADMIRAL AFLEET in mid pack early while off the inside, four wide out of the turn, late bid for the place, missed. MEAN MEISTER with the
pace along the inside, dueled along the rail through the turn with the winner, weakened. ST PIERRE broke to the outside, lacked any early speed, failed to
menace. BASTI BLUE in tight at the start, went one paced throughout in failing to threaten. R AND R STAR was finished early, well back. D'FESTIVE CAT
in the second flight early, steadily faded, well beaten. CAME OUT KICKIN broke in to help tighten up BASTI BLUE, fell further and further back,distanced
after losing contact with the field, jogged in.
