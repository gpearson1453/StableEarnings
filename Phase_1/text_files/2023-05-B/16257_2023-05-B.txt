Footnotes
SPICYBUG was closest in pursuit from outside, bid two wide into the lane, dueled in the stretch and held a short lead over KISSED BY FIRE entering the
final sixteenth, then drew clear in the end. KISSED BY FIRE sped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn,
challenged by SPICYBUG entering the lane, dueled to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) was off slow and lagged behind early,
went outside a rival in the two path on the turn, angled four wide into the lane, moved out further in the stretch then drifted inward and was along for the
show. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE broke a step slow, chased along the inside, tipped off the fence in the drive and lacked a bid. IRISH ROSE broke a step slow,
sat off the pace, raced near the inside into the turn, two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and improved position. TIFF WITH JIMMY tracked the
pace from inside into and around the turn, remained along the fence in the lane and lacked a rally. DANCING MO was off a bit slow in the beginning,
tracked three wide into the turn, raced outside a pair of rivals around the bend, got floated out a touch at the top of the stretch and also lacked a rally.
MIZZTIFY DOLL chased in range early, rounded the bend two wide, moved out at the top of the stretch and weakened. CHROME DESSERT came away
slow, traveled near the back in the early going, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact.

MANITOWISH set the pace from inside under pressure, cleared into the turn then was pressured again midway around the bend, dueled with
CYBERVIKING while drifting out in the stretch and held gamely while brushing at the wire. CYBERVIKING pressed between rivals then outside the leader to
the turn, lost touch briefly before re-engaging midway around the bend, drifted out while dueling with MANITOWISH in the lane and was denied while
brushing on the line. BALADI got crowded and steadied early, moved inward to chase two wide into the lane, shifted to the rail early on the turn, steered
back out with a quarter mile remaining and took aim at the top pair three wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and finished a clear third. SPEIGHT
AND MALICE broke well and stalked widest early, four deep leaving the backstretch, moved into the three path around the bend then came four wide into
the drive and flattened. NEPTUNE'S STORM raced up close three deep between rivals, got crowded entering the turn, dropped back and angled to the
inside and faded.

IRISH HEATWAVE allowed to settle at the back, moved closer from inside leaving the backstretch, angled three wide and had to check between rivals
around the bend, launched a rally while drifting in and bumping rival at the eighth pole, dueled into deep stretch and dug in to edge the runner-up.
TRUMPED stalked outside a rival into the turn, took aim three then two wide on the turn, drifted out and bumped with IRISH HEATWAVE near the eight pole
while taking a narrow lead, dueled with that rival into the final sixteenth and was bested in the end. JOHNNY PODRES stalked the top pair on the inside, got
blocked behind trouble rival and checked while shifting to the two path, kept on through the lane and was along for the show. SIX FEET pressed the pace
from outside, got bumped a few times around the turn while taking over, cleared inner rival approaching the quarter pole, lost command entering the final
furlong and flattened. CHICK'S DIG IT chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and lacked a rally. LEYAS CANDY set the pace
from inside under pressure, drifted out and bumped SIX FEET a few times on the turn then became rank and had to take hold, dropped back and trailed on
the inside into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
REFOCUS dueled for the lead inside MICI'S EXPRESS early, fought with LAST CALL LONDON around the bend and into the stretch, kicked clear at the
eighth pole and drew away when asked right-handed in midstretch. LAST CALL LONDON shifted in and bumped rival at the start, went up to vie three deep
or four wide into the turn, dueled around the bend while moving into the two path, fought to upper stretch, could not keep up with REFOCUS with a furlong
left to run but was clearly second best. MICI'S EXPRESS dueled outside REFOCUS to the turn, chased the top pair two then three wide around the bend,
could not summon a rally but churned on to hold the show. LOVE THAT MONEY broke in and was quickly corrected, chased along the inside to the stretch
and could not rally. MR. DREAMCYCLE stumbled and bumped at the start, chased two then three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and failed to
menace. THIRSTY GAMBLER got knocked into inner rival leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn then lost his path inside the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled four wide around the bend and weakened. THIRSTY MOE was off slow and broke out, chased six into the turn, dropped back while moving
down to the three path around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
CONCLUDE hustled to the front and led outside FIRST PEACE before clearing and moved to the inside, showed the way to the quarter pole, challenged by
FIRST PEACE crossing the dirt, dueled through the lane maintaining a narrow lead into the final sixteenth and won the bob at the wire. FIRST PEACE
pressed from inside early then steadied briefly past the half-mile pole and switched to the outside of the pacesetter, re-engaged CONCLUDE from outside
crossing the dirt, battled through the lane and lost the bob on the line. RANSOMWARE settled outside a rival early, went between foes then angled to the
rail on the turn, steered off the rail in the furlong grounds and finished willingly for the show. MAS RAPIDO (GB) stalked two to three wide around the turn,
tipped out into the lane, shifted inward in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. VALIANCER settled inside, chased two wide into the lane and flattened.
ACQUIRED CLASS stalked four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, tipped back out crossing the dirt and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR took control early a bit off the rail while being pressured from outside, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, inched ahead from
NEXT REVOLT in upper stretch and held gamely to the wire. NEXT REVOLT pressed from outside to the far turn, headed the leader around the bend,
fought through the lane but could not summon the needed late kick to get by. PAPALE stalked two wide between rivals on the first turn, chased three wide
around the second bend, failed to threaten the top pair in the lane but finished a clear third. CLAIM OF PASSION trailed two wide early, moved out on the
backstretch, came back to the two path for the far turn and went between rivals, asked in the lane but never responded. SPEEDING STYLE broke a bit slow
on the outside, stalked three deep early, lost ground in the middle stages, continued three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and tired. HAPI
HAPI coaxed from the gate, stalked inside a pair of rivals early, lost ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the last turn, eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
STRESSED came in at the start then went up to take control early and set the pace inside DORIS MAE, shook free in upper stretch and held late. HAYLEY
LEVADE broke in, stalked the top pair from inside into the turn, drifted out and bumped rival past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane,
moved out a bit in upper stretch, drifted in and bumped rival with a sixteenth remaining, was gaining late to draw alongside the winner but ran out of time.
CRIMSON ROSE ran up on heels behind a pair of rivals early, chased three then four wide around the bend and got up for the show. NU PI LAMBDA sat off
the pace, saved ground along the rail through the turn, tipped out in the lane, got bumped by HAYLEY LEVADE at the sixteenth pole and lost the show.
WITH LOVE (GB) broke very slow and came in leaving the gate, trailed on the inside then tipped two wide on the turn, altered out and made light contact
with rival in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong but failed to threatened. DORIS MAE pressed the pace from outside to the top of the stretch then
faded. DAZZLINGDOMINIKA stalked outside a rival, took a bump from inside past the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane, got lightly
brushed before checking between runners in midstretch and flattened.
