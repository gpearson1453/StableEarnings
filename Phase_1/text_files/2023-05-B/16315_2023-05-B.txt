Footnotes
COLONEL MOORHEAD set the early pace and was clear entering the backstretch, well handled and drew off on the turn and then was roused nearing the
furlong marker and widened the advantage then was eased up late to prove much the best. TRIPLE A. PLUS tracked the pace on the inside and saved
ground throughout, ridden along on the turn but could not keep pace with the winner, but won the battle for the place award. CHARGING LION stalked the
early pace and then chased the winner on the turn two wide but proved no match for that rival, outfinished for the place award. THE GREAT CASBY was
settled on the inside and had no response. SAMARONTI was settled and three wide on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FIERCE AND STRONG was allowed to settle early three to four wide, made a three wide move on the turn and drew off smartly in the lane to prove much
the best under strong handling, sharp. WARRIOR'S CAUSE set the early pressured pace two wide, then drew clear on the backstretch and dropped to the
inside, then was headed leaving the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while stating on to be clearly second best. BARN SWALLOW chased the
pace and made a mild bid on the inside on the turn but weakened, bested rest. SYLVIA I AM chased the pace three wide and weakened. HE AROSE
passed the tiring rivals. QUINCY ADAMS was settled back on the inside and failed to menace. DAGDA pressed the early pace on the inside, three wide on
the backstretch while chasing the pace and retreated. JEALOUS RED was fractious in the gate, checked shortly after the start and then was not a factor.

get up with a hundred yards to go and edged clear, driving. WILL TAKE ROSES set the early pace while unchallenged, then drew out on the turn and was
three wide into the lane, drifted out by the furlong marker and then was shifted in to challenge rival closing on the inside but was caught, second best.
