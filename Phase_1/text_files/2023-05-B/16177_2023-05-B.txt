Footnotes
Z'S GUITAR void of early foot after being last away, continued to lag well back into the turn, came four wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up
in time. GOT ME A CHRYSLER forwardly placed, vied three wide midway on the turn, dueled into the lane in the two path, shook clear past the furlong
marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. HEZA SEXY ZONG moved up along the inside to challenge before a quarter, dueled inside the
runner up into the lane, gradually weakened to prove no match for the top two, saved the show. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT in mid pack while racing outside,
was four wide midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane. PARTY LITTLE BOY broke well, raced within striking distance early, second flight in the
turn, had little for the drive. BLEEP BLEEP bobbled and broke out, was righted soon after, showed the way out of the chute, allowed a rival up inside before
a quarter, vied into the turn, stopped late in the bend, jogged in. UNCLE HUTCH finished early, also was well back at the end, jogged in.

Footnotes
IN THE ARCH in the second flight up the backstretch well off the inside, three wide into the turn, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, briskly
roused with a right handed crop to draw clear soon after, continued to steadily increase that advantage under continued right handed pressure. SMOOTH
COLLIERY back off the pace while inside the winner and between horses, shifted out a bit late in the turn, finished willingly to be well clear of the others, no
threat to the winner. BUNKIE'S SONG dueled up front in the two path, finished up best of the rest. CRUSADER EXPRESS within striking distance early
along the inside, fell back while continuing to save ground turn, came in the two path for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. HOME
BASE alternated up front closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. CLEAR HUMOR last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

FINAL QUEST broke out but was prominent from the start while off the inside, three wide bid while between foes late in the turn, kicked well clear the final
furlong under steady handling. GATOR PROUD back off the pace and the rail, ranged up to challenge four wide and outside the winner turning for home,
proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. SWEET VIDALIA closest to the early leader just off the inside, moved to challenge outside that one
and inside the winner by midway on the bend, chased the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked late for the place. STORM BREACH last to leave,
continued to trail in the run up the backstretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN broke alertly, soon
sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch along the inside, vied through the turn while remaining closest to the inside, faltered entering the stretch.
BEYOND D'ORO in the second flight early, began to back up after a half.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S ANGUS with the pace from the start, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, asked along midway on that bend, showed the way into the
lane. TAP IRON FIST pushed in and lightly bumped at the break, lacked speed, began to advance second turn, waited briefly approaching the furlong
grounds split foes, finished willingly to be clear for the place. CALIFORNIA BELLE broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, behind the pace well out in the
course first turn, continued outside, four wide through the second bend, made a bid for the runner up position past the furlong marker, not enough for that
spot, edged clear of the others. BLACK ACE within striking distance early, continued to race within contention, chased the winner upper stretch, flattened
out to lose a couple of positions the final furslong. SWEETASBAILY fell well back to trail the opening quarter, continued well back the middle half mile,
improved position through the straight with some belated interest, no real threat. HOT GOLDEN GIRL broke out top, narrowly set the pace, began to
gradually weakened when headed by the winner in the second turn. SANGIOVESE pushed in at the start to lightly bump with the runner up, settled in mid
pack, had little for the drive. PERIPHERAL VISION was finished early, well back. BATTLE OF WITS was always outrun.

Footnotes
GEAUX SUGAR pushed in at the break to bump MOURVEDRE, was straightened, took over into the turn off the inside, shook clear when straightened for
home, enough left to hold off the runner up late. MOURVEDRE in tight at bumped at the break, lacked speed, came five wide for the drive, set down, late
surge to finish willingly while too late. KIT KAT KIDD settled in the second flight early in the two path, steered out into lane, along for the show, not a serious
threat to the top two. CUSTOM PRAYER broke in, was straightened to race within striking distance, lacked the needed closing response. A'DEBRIS
pressed the issue from the three path, had little for the drive. D T'S DREAM lacked speed, came four wide and inside the winner exiting the turn, failed to
muster a rally.

Footnotes
OURPERFECTPRINCE with the pace from the start along the inside, asked along to keep position along the rail turn, put a head in front when straightened
for home, long drive, found more late to prevail in game fashion. BEAUDEAN with the pace outside, held a narrow advantage three wide late in the turn,
continued to battle past the furlong marker and held on stubbornly to the end. SAUCY ARGUMENT off the early pace out in the strip, moved closer in the
four path turn, vied past the furlong marker while widest of the first flight, not enough for the top two late. MIDNIGHT CROWN behind the leaders, continued
to race behind a wall of horses late in the turn, clear while between foes for the drive, came up empty. BOSS MAN ZONG lacked early foot outside, came
five wide out of the turn, lacked the needed closing response as well. TENSAS ALL OURS last to leave, raced back, also lacked a bid. MIDGE'S TIME vied
up front while between rivals for a half and gave way.

MONEY WELL SPENT mid pack inside, continued to track the leaders under patient handling while saving some ground second turn, shifted out in upper
straight, asked, full of run late to win going away. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY forwardly placed while off the inside, continued close while three wide far turn,
challenged three wide into the stretch, proved no match for the winner, game for the place. MISS JANA last away, void of speed, moved inside, slipped
through along the rail turning for home, improved position. LUTIE MO lacked speed, four wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane, also bettered
position while too late. BE A BANDIT dueled up front off the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage in the two path through the final turn and into the
lane, faltered final furlong. JERSEY HOTTIE broke alertly, set or forced the pace along the inside, also weakened in the late going. ANGELA'S CELERITY
in mid pack while off the inside, continued in the main body second turn, failed to respond in the drive. MY LITTLE JEN shuffled back at the start, moved
out, four wide first turn, remained back. GEORGIA DAWN stopped after a half, fell well back, jogged in.

Footnotes
STEAL IT BACK last out of the chute, moved closer while saving ground through the turn, in traffic, split foes late to challenge, proved narrowly best in a
gutty effort. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST forwardly placed well out in the strip up the backstretch while between horses, four wide into the turn, three wide
exiting, lost some ground to the leader, battled back to challenge late while widest of the first flight, missed. FLIT N FLOT TIME with the pace while three
wide and also between foes, battled into the lane, continued to equal terms with the leader past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the top two
while between that pair late. BIG BOSS MAN with the pace along the inside, held a narrow advantage into the lane and past the furlong marker, weakened
late. MY BOOK with the first flight while widest, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, tired through the lane. CAEUS IN PASADENA lacked speed, swung
out to be five wide and widest into the lane, improved slightly while not a threat. TOO MUCH CROWN last away, remained back in failing to threat.
SOURNOIS set or forced the pace while between foes for five furlongs, gave way. COUNTERFEIT vied early while four wide and between foes, began a
steady fade before a half.
