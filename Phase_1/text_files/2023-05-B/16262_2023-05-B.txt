down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival entering the lane, was quickly collared by BROKE AN BROKEN and briefly
overtaken, but battled back gamely to prevail following a stretch long battle. BROKE AN BROKEN away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch

Footnotes
JOSE JOSE away alertly while breaking inwards in the opening strides before asserting himself on the lead in the run to the first turn, controlled the pace in
the run down the backstretch while well in hand, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, and widened his margin over the final furlong under
confident handling. BAK TO LIBERTY was fractious prior to the start, and was pushed in slightly in the opening strides, but quickly recovered and tracked
the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to track the pacesetter into the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on that foe
nearing the final turn, but finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. CAIRO CRUSADER broke sharply while breaking inwards
in the opening strides, tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
willingly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. MAGIC ROAD stalked the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two out
from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive. TAPITS CHOICE steadied when pushed in at the start, saved ground
while in a stalking position entering the first turn, but steadied off heels midway through the turn, saved ground throughout, but failed to make a late impact.
UNION MAN tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, dropped back approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
FREESTYLE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of VIVA CON WOW entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the
run down the backside and into the final turn, took command entering the turn, and repelled a strong bid by FANNY BAY ALI to prevail. FANNY BAY ALI
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, pulled her way into a tracking trip four wide in the run to the final turn, continued
strongly through the turn and collared the leader entering the lane, and just missed following a stretch long battle. ARUNDEL CASTLE settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, split rivals two wide leaving the turn,
and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. ELLAMEISTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid three
wide entering the final turn, and continued on gamely through the stretch while improving her position. VIVA CON WOW rushed up along the rail to vie for
the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with her pace rival
entering the turn, and faded over the final furlong. LICORICE was fractious prior to the start, but broke sharply and tracked the leaders entering the first turn
while exchanging bumps with CHI CHI'S SONG, held a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. CHI CHI'S SONG hit the
gate at the start, and scrambled in the opening strides, held a tracking position in the run to the first turn, and exchanged bumps with LICORICE entering the
turn, maintained a tracking trip into the backstretch, but began to weaken midway to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
VALUABLE COWBOY broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, but was all out to fend off the late bid by TIZ VICIOUS and LAUGH WITH ME to prevail. TIZ
VICIOUS tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush three wide
in deep stretch to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME away well and tracked the leader into the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, tipped off the rail in mid stretch and closed with a rush from between rivals in the closing strides to just miss. DRILLER stalked the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly from along the inside in the
stretch drive. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly along the rail entering
the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the lane. JUST MAKE BELIEVE away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while
racing three out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late going. ARCH PRINCE unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late, while unable to mount a serious late bid. BABY GRAND was fractious prior
to the start, and unprepared as the gates opened to get away poorly, was always well back and never a factor. Following the race the stewards conducted
an inquiry into the start. After review it was deemed that BABY GRAND was not afforded a fair start, and declared this horse a non starter.
