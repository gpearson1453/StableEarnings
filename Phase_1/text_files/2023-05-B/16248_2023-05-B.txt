Footnotes
CARBON STRYKER raced up the rail shortly away from the gate to duel with the pacesetter into the turn, shook that one off turning for home, opened a
clear advantage in mid-stretch and finished determinedly to the wire to hold the late closer safe. YANKEE INDIAN settled off the leaders in the early going,
circled five wide and closed well on the far outside to be gaining through the lane in a good effort. FLIP THE COIN JAN reserved near the rear of the field,
rallied in upper stretch splitting horses to be closing ground late in the drive. SALADO prompted the pace from three wide through the turn under constant
urging and lacked a response for the stretch run. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR rushed to the early lead, was collared by the winner nearing the turn, dueled to
upper stretch and gave way late. GREYSTOKE taken in hand shortly from the gate, raced a little erratically briefly brushing the rail and dropped back as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
BARSINVIEW broke alertly to take the lead, controlled a well measured pace throughout, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and was never seriously
threatened. LOOPY DUDE prompted the pace the entire way, failed to gain on the winner but finished willingly to be second best. MORO'S BULL CREEK
stalked the pace from four wide to loom up turning for home and finished evenly through the lane to hold the show. IMPOVERISHED saved ground along
the fence, cut the corner and rallied mildly in the lane. SON OF PREACHERMAN was slow early to trail the field and swung well wide in the stretch while
making a mild late rally. XANDER S prominently placed from three wide in the early going and steadily faded. FEW WORDS went evenly never posing a
threat. YOU EFF OH lunged at the start, was gathered up to make up ground in the turn after spotting the field at the break and gave way turning for home.

stretch and be up in time. KENTUCKY ICE was rated on the backstretch while stalking the pace from the two path, was moving up on the far turn to duel for
the lead down the lane but was out finished by an outer rival in the end. RANSAM PAYNTER set the pace from the first turn and into the second, then was
challenged for the lead by an outer rival in the home and gave way in the end and was best for third. MICKEY GOLDMILL was bumped at the start, then
gained ground steadily down the backstretch and into the far turn while three wide, angled to the two path to rally but came up evenly. PROJECTION
tracked the pace from the inside, was urging strongly on the far turn to rally in the late stretch but came up empty. OFF TO THE RACES stalked the pace
while three wide, was moving up on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up empty. DIXIE MOONSHINE trailed behind the field then bid on the far turn
and passed tiring foes. WILD WING bumped foe at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, then faded and was no threat. LO PROFILE settled

Footnotes
SKY ROCKER broke inward to brush GOLD MEMORIES at the start, settled into a duel on the lead from three wide in the first turn, continued to press the
pace to the far turn, took command when called upon shaking off the speed rivals, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and was not seriously
challenged to the wire in a well managed ride. BLOOD ORANGE taken in hand to be near the back of the field early, steadily picked up rivals down the
backside, circled five wide at the quarter pole and finished well to be a clear second best. GOLD MEMORIES crowded leaving the gate bumping rivals, was
reserved off the pace to the far turn, waited to commence his rally turning for home, angled out following the runner-up and made steady gains down the
lane. LA VALEDORA sped to the lead from between horses in the first turn, continued to duel for three-quarters of a mile and weakened in the stretch.
THEHUNKSCLASSYLADY taken well in hand to be mid-pack early on, dropped back down the backside losing position and made a mild rally coming
home. JULIE'S PASSION slow early to be at the back for the first half mile and made late gains passing tiring rivals. SHACK IT TO ME well placed from
between horses to track the leaders in striking position through the second turn and failed to respond when called upon for the drive. S S TURBINIA dueled
from the fence on the pace for a half mile, backed out of the duel down the backside and flattened out. NOMOROTHAT raced four wide in the first turn,
moved up into contention down the backside and came up empty after five-eighths of a mile. ALONG CAME THUNDER raced headstrong into the first turn
trying to get out from between rivals, dropped back entering the far turn and was never a factor.

CLASSIC RICK was well rated along the inside, then rallied in mid stretch and closed with a rush to prove best in the end. SECRET TAVERN lead the way
into the turn, was confronted for the lead heading into the lane but kick clear of that rival and was closing grudgingly but was out finished in the end.
ROUGHNECK angled in towards the rail to track the pace from the inside, then rally in the early stretch and fired late to be up for third position. CAJUN
CYCLONE bid from in the middle of the pack while four wide, then rallied in the early stretch to close well in the end just missing the show position. VINO
BIANCO saved ground to no avail and passed tiring foes in the end. OVER PAID chased the pace from the inside under a hard drive, then came out five
wide to rally in the upper stretch but came up empty. JANET'S BROTHER pressed the pace into the turn while two wide, then flattened out in late stretch.
LOUDERMILK pressed the pace while three wide,then confronted the leader on the turn but was used up and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
SUPERCENTS started a step slow to trail early, reserved well off pace to the turn, made up ground through the turn, split horses coming for home and
closed with a rush to be up in time. MISCHIEF ANGEL stalked the pace from three wide, rallied to take command at the head of the lane, opened a clear
advantage but failed to hold off the late closer in a good effort. LEPRECHAUN CHARM tracked the leaders from between horses through the turn, angled
out to the six path and finished well to gain the show. TALKATIVE reserved of the leaders down the backside, mounted a four wide rally turning for home,
carried out to the seven path down the stretch and gained ground to the wire. TEQUILA EMPIRE rated near the rear of the field early and made a steady
mild advance throughout. DAPHNE'S FIRE sped off to a clear lead the first three-eighths, challenged entering the turn, responded well to upper stretch and
weakened late in the lane. SIGNE well placed up the fence, made a threatening rally midway on the turn and flattened out coming home. TRUEBLUEGIRL
slow early to trail the field to the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in the stretch. VALLEY VERDE pressed the pace for the first half mile, kept on to the
top of the lane and tired in the drive. HATZILU IVRIT broke sharply to be briefly in front, settled to a tracking position from wide down the backstretch and
gave way in the turn to fade to last.

for the lead with an inner rival on the far turn, took command in the early stretch, was confronted by another rival in late stretch, menaced gamely but was
out finished in the end. MORO TRENDSETTER was in a long drive while chasing the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn,
angled out four wide and closed gamely for the show prize in the end. KING ARTHUR RIDGE raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, was urging
