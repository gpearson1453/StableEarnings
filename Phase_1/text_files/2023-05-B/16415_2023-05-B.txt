Footnotes
JOHN'S ROCK pressed the pace two wide while racing in the four path, assumed the lead entering the far turn, drifted to the middle of the racetrack in
upper stretch and won under strong handling. OAKS HONEY never far back, moved closer three wide on the far turn and finished second best. FAT DADDY
unhurried early, loomed boldly two wide into the stretch then was outfinished for second. LAZARUS PROJECT trailed early, advanced in the five path into
the far turn then leveled off. DISCLOSURE failed to menace. FIRST CITIZEN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, dropped to the rail, set the pace
for five and one half furlongs then weakened.

Footnotes
ANIMO ROBERTO unhurried for five furlongs, closed ground three wide through the far turn and into the stretch, was struck twice with a right handed whip
before the furlong marker and got up in the final strides under a strong hand ride. MARCH MAGIC settled in a stalking position outside, surged two wide on
the far turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing the top of the stretch, matched strides to the wire and just missed hanging on. PLAYING BALL broke in
front, set the pace for six furlongs, dueled the balance of the trip and was outfinished in a game effort. CASUAL ATTIRE allowed to settle, moved up along
the inside into the stretch then leveled off. THE GOSPEL OF MARK was no factor. SWEET JILL'S JACK pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn
then gave way. ATILANO'S THUNDER broke slowly, rushed to contention, pressed the pace three wide and was through after a half. MUSIC GEM hit the
gate, broke in tangle causing his rider to lose his irons, lost contact with his field and was distanced. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
RELISH THE RIDE allowed to settle, began to close ground in the four path into the stretch, lacked racing room, altered course six wide nearing the furlong
marker and got up in the final strides. EXONERATED PREZ never far back, rallied five wide into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker then
couldn't handle the winner. THE COACHMAN battled for the lead two wide into the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. UNCLE KEVIN trailed into
the stretch and found his best stride late outside. MUTINY stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly four wide and was outfinished. QUIET AMIGO
dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then weakened late. FIRST SONG failed to menace.
