SAILOR CHOW was off a step slow at the start then remained settled off the clear top pair, made a move and advanced into contention late on the turn,
swung three to four wide into the lane, took the lead approaching the eighth pole and finished clear. NASTY EXAGGERATOR was allowed to settle off the
early pace, swung four wide into the lane, responded willingly when called upon and produced a strong finish. FASCINATED vied inside of ROCK CITY
ROCKET for the early lead racing well clear of the rest, continued to battle around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane, weakened but
came back on to capture show. ROCK CITY ROCKET vied outside of FASCINATED for the early lead and continued to match strides around the turn,
shook free to slight edge in upper stretch then was no match when the winner took over approaching the eighth pole. CAPTAIN DON raced off the clear top
two leaders, saved ground around the turn, shifted out three wide and failed to rally.

HER NAME WAS LOLA tracked the pace near the inside in early stages, angled out and circled up four wide to engage rivals for the lead near the quarter
pole, battled for the lead heading into the lane, dueled for command with TRUE EMOTION in the final sixteenth, dug in gamely under firm handling and
nipped foe for the win. TRUE EMOTION was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up to challenge for command late on the turn, battled
for the lead into the lane, gained a slight edge past the furlong marker, fought on with HER NAME WAS LOLA in deep stretch, fought back gamely and got
nipped on the wire. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY led the way in opening stages and continued to lead the way entering the turn, took on the challenge from a trio
of pursuers near the quarter pole, fought back along the inside to the eighth pole, flattened off the top duo and just lasted for show. LOVE AMPLIFIED raced
in contention just off the top pair, crept up three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, continued in striking distance in upper stretch then
flattened out and got edged for show.

Footnotes
HACKER set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead with ELIOT NESS near the quarter pole, shook free entering the stretch, repelled
challengers down the lane and finished clear under a drive. ELIOT NESS applied pace pressure to HACKER through early stages, dueled with eventual
winner around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane, but never gave up and stayed on to secure place. NEW STRIPE rated off the top
duo in early stages, edged closer along the rail around the turn, cut the corner and advanced into contention then ran on evenly in the final sixteenth. GIANT
GAMBLE chased the top pair into the turn, swung four wide into the lane and failed to kick on. GOD'S PICK raced off the early pace, hustled along five wide
into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HUNK OF A HIT was off very slowly at the start and spotted the field seven lengths, trailed in the back and was
never involved.

Footnotes
SOLE SURVIVOR sat back off the early pace, moved up into contention midway around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, advanced to challenge
HIGGAM for the lead, dug in under firm handling and edged away in deep stretch. HIGGAM set the pace in early stages and held firm around the turn, took
on the challenge from SOLE SURVIVOR in the final furlong, fought back but lacked a closing kick. QUARTERNIGHT raced off the early pace, saved ground
around the turn, roused forward along the inside in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but sustained bid and finished well clear over the rest.
SULLY'S BARRON tracked the leader in early stages, hustled along two wide around the turn then faded in the lane. LET'S ROCK N ROLL was forwardly
placed into the turn, chased up close three wide then retreated in the lane. SPIRITED DREAM trailed throughout. BILLY WHO raced in range midway
around the turn, ran up on the heels of LETS ROCK N ROLL near the quarter pole, stumbled, lost the rider, ran around loose until caught by the outrider
and walked off. STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE QUARTER POLE AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
CRYPTO MO sped to the lead at the start and quickly opened up to clear command around the first turn, widened advantage up the backstretch, remained
well clear over the rest of the field while still unasked around the far turn, remained unchallenged through the lane and kept to task under a hand ride. GP'S
AMAZING GRACE raced four wide entering the first turn and sat off the early pace, picked up the tempo around the far turn, swung into action four wide
entering the lane, was no match for clear winner but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. STONECOLD STUNNER trailed in early stages,
saved ground entering the far turn then shifted out three wide entering the lane, showed interest and captured a share. WAR MUSIC stalked the clear
pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled along two to three wide around the far turn, stayed on into the lane and got edged for show. FROSTED DIAMOND
was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, roused for more in upper stretch but had no response. SASSY AIN'T I tracked
the clear pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled up two to three wide around the far turn and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
OPPOSITION was off to a good start and engaged the top pair for the lead in opening stages, battled on with HANDSOME STRANGER into the stretch run,
dug in gamely under firm handling, edged ahead to a slim lead at the eighth pole, widened to a clear advantage then held late under a drive. WILY WADE
dueled between rivals for the lead in early stages, continued to battle between foes heading into the turn, edged back and let the top pair go mid-way around
the turn, launched a three wide rebid in upper stretch, had more left in the tank, kicked in and closed on the winner. HANDSOME STRANGER dueled inside
a duo through early stages then continued to battle for command with OPPOSITION into the lane, fought back gamely from the inside, could not move on
with the eventual winner past the eighth pole and gaveway grudgingly in the final sixteenth. EDGY LOVER raced off the top trio in early stages, hustled
along two wide around the turn, angled three to four wide for the drive, showed interest but needed more for impact. LETS ROCK N STROLL raced off the
pace, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ONE SOCK BILLY raced off the embattled trio up the backstretch, was ridden along
the inside around the turn and failed to kick on in the lane. TAIL OF SAMSON raced near the back, swung six wide into the lane and had no response.
