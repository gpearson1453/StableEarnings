Footnotes
SAINT KENNEDY broke sharp, settled off of the pace and stalked from the five path, rated patiently until given the cue at the five sixteenths pole, edged
further out into the seven path and launched a bid, battled with and inside foe, matched strides clear down the stretch and got up for the win just in time.
MARY JACK stalked the pace setter from the three path, shifted out into the four path at the half mile pole, started to gain ground in the turn, had control of
the race at the five sixteenth pole, was challenged by an outside rival in the upper stretch, battled down the lane but came up short and had to settle for
second place. WENDY WILECAT was off slow, steadied early on, saved ground while racing inside of another horse, made a mild bid late, up for third.
SUFFRAGETTE wide trip, no rally. BEAUTIFULANDWILD had and awkward start and settled along the rail mid pack, she maintained that position but was
never really involved. ROYAL BONUS showed early speed and took the lead while racing along the rail, controlled the pace until the three eighths pole,
where she was challenged by two outside rivals, battled briefly in the upper stretch but gave way at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
LILLIE DELL broke sharp and took advantage of her post position, took the early lead and attended the pace, gained ground and gained momentum and
built up her lead the further she went and was uncontested winner. SUMMER LIGHTNING settled off the pace on the inside, was asked at the three eighths
pole where she responded and started to gain ground, closed the gap between her an d the eventual winner, shifted out at the quarter pole into the six path,
chased the winner to the wire but was second best today. LA SMOOCHIE raced from off the pace, stayed near the fence and saved ground through out,
was able to gain ground moving up along the rail in the turn and finished well. BLUEBIRD SING shuffled back early, shifted into the three path and saved
ground while finding her stride, found room on the rail and advanced along the fence past the three eighths pole and into the stretch, drifted out into the
seven path in mid stretch but closed well. FOLLOW THE SAINT was off a bit slow, angled down into the three path, raced at her own pace until after the half
mile pole where she launched a long bid gaining ground and closing, had clear running room on the rail and saved ground as she entered the stretch,
closed well but to no avail today. ALYS EPISODE raced in the second tier three wide while she was stalking the pace, was well placed while moving into the
lane but tired mid stretch. STILL OF THE NIGHT was well off the pace early while racing in the three path, maintained position and showed little. SUZY
DOLL'S READY raced three wide in the middle of the field, was in contention at the seven sixteenth marker, drifted out in the turn. DERBY DAY LASSIE
stalked the early leaders, raced three wide, launched a bid then faltered.

TURN ON THE MAGIC raced from off the pace in the two path, advanced at the half mile pole with pressure from two outside foes, challenged for the lead
at the five sixteenth pole, was matching strides with the early leaders at the quarter pole in the four path, took the lead by the sixteenth pole and edged clear
of the rest for the win. OKUDAH took the lead while being rated along the rail, was joined after the half by outside rivals, was challenged for the lead at the
seven sixteenths pole and battled into the stretch, where he gave way and settled for second. TEMPRANO was well off the pace early, smartly saved
ground while racing on the rail, gained momentum with every stride, closed well and was up for third. EGO raced just off the pace, moved along side of
leading rivals at the half, maintained position through the turn, was in contention at the quarter pole then faded late. EUROEXIT raced off the pace, drew
next to the early leaders while in between horses at the half, then gave way.

stretch and closing, cleared the rest by the sixteenth pole and drew off for the win. HUSHED COURT ROOM stalked from the four path, launched a bid at
the three eighths pole, drew along side of the early leader at the quarter pole, battled and faltered late. MY ALIBI raced from well off the pace and was
unhurried early on, settled along the rail and saved ground, was put in contention at the five sixteenth pole, angled out into the five path in the stretch, was
gaining ground with every stride while closing fast but ran out of racing room and settled for third today. Raced a game race though. CHROME SAVAGE
raced off the pace, saved ground, made one run, closed well. ROYA was off the pace early, launched a mild bid racing in the six path, was in contention at
the top of the lane but to no avail. DEROUTANTE raced from off the pace in the five path launched a mild bid at the three eighths pole, but made no impact.
WATCH THIS MUNNY had early speed and willing took the lead, attended to the pace into the stretch, then tired. FADED MEMORIES raced mid pack while
saving ground, moved into contention up the fence after the half, had to slightly check going into the tun and was no factor after that.

Footnotes
SHARP CHARLIE broke sharp, took the rail and lead the way, was the uncontested winner. BANKROLL stalked the leader from the three path, followed
around the track and was second best today. GILDERSLEEVE raced from well off the pace, made one run gaining ground with each stride, saved ground
on the rail early then shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and closed down the lane well getting up third. CHROMPTON was racing in the middle of the
pack at first, was five wide, was asked at he half, gained ground while still being wide through the turn and mildly closed in the stretch.
HEREWECOMETOGETYOU was off slow and made little impact. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE showed brief speed then faded. BRIMESTONE KID was no
threat. MAGIC LIGHTNING was no menace. MY HEAVY SON was never involved. SOUTH AL SPARKY race to no avail.

Footnotes
SISTER SEEK went wire to wire. ATHENAIS was well off the pace early, started gaining ground and momentum at the half, saved ground and closed down
the lane with a vengeance but just missed, ran a game second. CHARTREUSE raced from mid pack, launched a mild bid and closed well getting up for
third. REGAL STANCE was far back ea, never hurried, was put into the race at the quarter pole closed well. HIGH DONNA stalked the early leaders, and
faded. MO WANNA GO vied for the lead, set the pace and tire. MONTASTICAL raced even and tired late. REAUX BINA showed little. OLD SCHOOL
FLASH was never involved.
