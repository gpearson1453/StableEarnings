Footnotes
CENTAVO tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, gained to take the lead in the five path into the stretch then dropped in
while moving clear and drew away under steady urging. NORGAY bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the outside, vied in the three path on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then lost touch with the winner and proved no match while well clear for the place. PRINCE OF JOY prompted the
pace on the inside, took a short lead near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path while inside of a rival on the turn, lost the advantage outside the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch then angled out while tiring and capitulated but earned the show. VOLIERO bumped with an opponent at
the start, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.
PRAYER BOOK came inward just after the start, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, turned into
the stretch in the two path and also faltered.

Footnotes
HEY THERE stumbled at the start crashing into RICELLE, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into
upper stretch and seized command from the embattled top pair with three-sixteenths to go, went clear under firm hand ride before being geared down in the
late stages. JET SET JULIET broke out at the start bumping HANDLE THE TRUTH, vied briefly from the two path before easing off to chase along the
inside, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. AERON WARRIOR
coaxed from the gate, vied early on from the three path before emerging to duel three then two wide with OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS to the outside, tucked to
the two path through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch roused for the drive, yielded the front after having a narrow command at the
three-sixteenths and kept on to preserve the show honors. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS vied from the five path early on before dueling with AERON WARRIOR
to her inside, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took brief sole command swinging four wide into upper stretch
before being headed straightened away, then weakened in the final furlong. SAVE GRACE coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. HANDLE THE
TRUTH got bumped at the start by JET SET JULIET and conceded two lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. RICELLE got bumped solidly at the start in behind AERON WARRIOR when
HEY THERE stumbled to her outside and recovered inwards into her, chased six to seven paths off the rail down the backstretch before going five wide
through the turn coaxed along from midway, cornered six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DARK VECTOR stalked the leading duo on the outside, ranged up four wide to make a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, took the lead at the three-eighths
then shook clear at the five-sixteenths, was shaken up a bit while extending the advantage into upper stretch and widened while completely geared down to
win handily. VENGE was coaxed along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, gained inside to make a bid at the
seven-sixteenths pole, passed the three-eighths on even terms for the lead, lost touch with the winner late on the bend and proved no match while clear for
the place. AMERICAN KNOW HOW leaned in at the start then was hustled, set a joint pace on the inside of a foe while taken in hand, vied in the two path
on the turn, passed the three-eighths between foes then dropped back and tired while best of the rest. GOLDEN PURCHASE brushed with a rival after the
start, settled under some urging, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. SOMAMA BEACH brushed with a foe just after the start, set a joint pace
on the outside, vied in the three path early on the turn, dropped back inside the seven-sixteenths and faltered then was eased but walked off.

CONSTITUTIONLAWYER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide, tipped out nudging his way four wide against LUNI SIMA at that station placed
to urging, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch being floated out slightly by the leader, rallied to take command a furlong from home brushing with
FILM STAR, dug in dueling to the finish and gamely held sway by a head to the wire. FILM STAR broke in at the start bumping COMPLETE AGENDA,
raced three wide briefly before tipping out to chase from the five path, advanced on the leader and tucked four wide at the nine-sixteenths, applied pressure
to the front taking command with five-sixteenths to run, swung five to six wide into upper stretch under threat and floated his main danger out slightly, dug in
and brushed with that rival when headed for the front a furlong out, fought on gamely dueling to the finish but was ultimately denied to the end. COMPLETE
AGENDA stumbled at the start and was bumped by FILM STAR, who broke inwards, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
cornered four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LUNI SIMA four paths off the inside briefly, chased six then five wide down the backstretch
before tucking four wide into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and was nudged five wide at that station by CONSTITUTIONLAWYER,
went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. OGLETHORPE showed the way in hand four then three wide coming under pressure at the nine-sixteenths,
came under coaxing half a mile from home, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

BUSINESS MODEL dropped back under urging early then settled at the rear, started the turn in the three path, shifted out to the six path continuing around
the turn, rallied outside under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought determinedly outside of
the runner-up to the finish and got up under strong handling. BACK RING LUCK was asked for some speed leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the
outside, took a short lead in the three to four path on the turn, inched clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed crop into
upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, dug in under threat from the runner-up into the final sixteenth, drifted out some late and
was denied. MILTON THE MONSTER was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, was roused at the half-mile pole, chased four to five wide through
the turn, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. LAFITTE'S FLEET prompted the pace between foes, led narrowly passing
the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. TWO THIRTY FIVE settled towards the back, moved from the
rail to the two path while roused on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. THINKABOUTIT went to the front, showed
the way under coaxing, vied inside while headed on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. BLACK BELT settled just off the pace, moved from
the two path to the four path while asked on the turn, dropped back five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FANCY JOKE was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, shook clear at the
five-sixteenths pole, came out some while set down into upper stretch, extended the lead under a drive into the final furlong and maintained a safe
advantage under strong urging. CLOVER STREET moved out while settling off the pace, was roused while three then four wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. MISS STONES pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn,
dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved inward into upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of the winner to the finish and lost the place while able to get the
show. RED MOON was urged along off the pace, fell well back late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and improved position with late
energy. REIGNING CHICK dropped back while climbing some early, raced inside to the two path on the turn and gained in the stretch but missed the
superfecta. FANCY FELINE was moving her head around at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear, went four wide on
the turn and gained in the stretch but failed to threaten. TRY IT AGAIN chased the pace on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and retreated.
SONG PARODY was hustled from the start then chased the pace, angled in near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
AWESOME NATIVE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch,
rallied and leaned out on BREW PUB who attempted to keep him hemmed inside when FOOLISH GHOST drifted out in front in the vicinity of the eighth
pole, took command a sixteenth from home, then dug in and inched away to the finish. BREW PUB chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, had the aforementioned foe lean outwards and attempted to hem him in behind the drifting leader
nearing the eighth pole and absorbed a bump because of it, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate,
chased two to three wide lightly coaxed along from the get go, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to be on near even terms
for command a sixteenth out, couldn't match the top pair late while keeping on to preserve the show honors. FOOLISH GHOST coaxed from the start,
showed the way through swift splits four then three wide down the backstretch and into the turn, tucked to the two path midway and then widened away
through to the quarter pole when swinging five wide for home, dug in under a drive drifting out near the eighth pole before being corrected, got overwhelmed
by a trio with a sixteenth to go and weakened in the late stages. BAR FOURTEEN chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. HORN OF PLENTY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Trainer's Objection by the trainer of BREW PUB alleging
interference against AWESOME NATIVE. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result stood prior to the race being declared official.

three-eighths, shook clear under urging outside the quarter-pole, drew away under a drive into the final furlong then was completely geared down while
much the best. KRYSTALHEIR settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn and willingly earned the place while no match for the winner. FOXY
CARA was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, checked just inside the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the stretch, gained on the
eased up winner in the stretch and missed the place while clear for the show. UNHOLY was reluctant to load, raced on the outside under urging, went five
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. JESSICA'S RIDE was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and came up empty.
SPLASHY chased the pace on the outside from third position, went four then three wide on the turn and tired. SHE'S A NINE went to the front, showed the
way on the inside, was asked under threat on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off. NORTH
END LADY was urged along off the pace, dropped back two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
