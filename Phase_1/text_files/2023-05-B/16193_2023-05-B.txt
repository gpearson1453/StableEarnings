Footnotes
HOT PATOOTIE forwardly placed outside, took over in the three path turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, slight drift, held the runner up safe late
while under brisk handling. KATIE'S C forwardly placed for almost four furlongs inside, fell back a bit late in the turn, moved to the outside for the drive,
closing the gap on the winner late. DARING DARIAN in the second flight outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, moved in then steered
back out to the three path entering the stretch, roused, narrowly up for the show while between horses at the wire, not a threat to the top two. JUST
ANOTHER WIN also in the second group, two path into the lane, one paced through the lane to narrowly miss the show. A P HUMOR behind the leaders,
steered out to be four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick to also narrowly miss the third spot. ANIME DAY took command soon after the start,
showed the way into the turn, faltered in the drive. MAVE RUNNER rank, took up at the start to spot the field several lengths, was never involved.

Footnotes
BILOXI in mid pack in the run up the backstretch while well wide, four wide bid in the turn, clear into the lane, steadily increased that advantage under
steady handling to prove clearly best. TARAASHOQ void of speed, raced four wide and behind the leader through the turn, reached closest to that one
inside the furlong marker while drifting in,no late gain, well clear of the others. MO CREDO behind the early pace off the inside, moved to briefly challenged
three wide and inside the winner midway on the turn, saw that progress stall into the lane, up late for the show while not a threat to the top pair. ZAICI broke
through the gate prior to the start, reloaded in good order, broke in good order, clear out of the chute, continued to show the way into the turn, began to
weaken by late in the bend when headed by the winner. CHICKEN TRUCK underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, checked up when bothered at the start
to be last away, continued to lack speed turn, improved position while not a serious threat. TRADER PRICE made little impact in failing to menace.
GOLDUSTER closest to the early leader off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. VIKING LEGACY forwardly placed n the run up the backstretch,
challenged between horses in the turn then gave way in the drive. ZULTAN broke out, bothered CHICKEN TRUCK, raced in mid pack briefly, finished
before a half.

Footnotes
TDZ CORRIENDA STAR put a head in front before a quarter from between horses, vied through the turn while closest to the inside of the first flight, pulled
away through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. GYPSY JACKPOT with the early pace while outside the winner, battled with that one
through the turn, proved no match in the drive, edged clear for the place. GLAMOROUS STAR off the early pace well wide up the backstretch, advanced
into a contending position four down to three wide turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker in proving no match, outkicked late for the runner up
position. PENNIES FOR PAULLA in mid pack outside, raced four wide through the turn, went evenly down the lane in lacking a closing response. TAKING
PICTURES void of speed while wide, five path through most of the turn, failed to muster a rally. SUNSET FLASH prompted the early pace, fell back through
the turn and had little for the drive. MARDI GRAS GORMLEY last to leave, lacked speed while a bit slow to settle, was not a factor. ELLA'S BABY broke
back, moved briefly up to mid pack then was finished before a half.

Footnotes
WOODS N WATER unhurried early, crept closer in the second flight into the far turn, asked three wide midway on that bend, challenged on the outside
entering the stretch, kicked clear then held the runner up safe late. PLAY MO forwardly placed off the inside, continued to race in a challenging position
second turn, shifted to the far outside nearing the furlong marker, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE broke alertly,
clear into the first turn just off the inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, vied into the stretch closest to the inside, could not
match the top two the final furlong, saved the show. COSMIC TRAIN lacked speed off the inside, bothered in the far turn in traffic,moved out a bit to be four
wide into the lane, improved position. IZZY'S BABY BOY prompted the early pace, pressed that leader the middle half, vied between foes and inside the
winner into the lane then began to weaken. M AND M'S CUSTOM settled off the early pace in the second flight off the inside, checked up in some traffic far
turn, fell back and did not recover. NORTHERNREFLECTION broke back, lacked speed, bothered far turn in traffic, failed to muster a rally after recovering.
GET THEM JUSTIN in mid pack for a half, fell back and did not menace. BALLINONABUDJET was never a factor. VENN steadied at the start to race back
early, improved with a middle move the third quarter, failed to sustain that advance and then gave way in the drive while in some traffic.

Footnotes
MICHAEL'S BAD BOY within striking distance from the start outside, moved closer and challenged four wide into the far turn, showed the way into the
stretch, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under brisk handling. FORGED IN STEEL never far back while in the three path,
challenged inside the winner far turn, fell back off that one into and through upper stretch, coming again late while staying clear for the place. JOEY'S GAME
in the second flight while toward the inside, asked along midway on the second turn, steered out four wide into the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the
top pair late. BIG BROTHER lacked speed off the rail, moved into a striking position four wide turning for home, flattened out through the stretch. WHEELS
TURNING broke back, lacked speed well wide, five to six wide through the final turn, improved position while too late. CLEVER PRINCE settled off the
pace, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. UNBRIDLED PULPIT fell back after breaking with the field, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals while never a threat. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT last to leave, trailed most of the way and was never a factor. DEMON HUNTER set or forced the pace
closest to the inside for six furlongs and gave way. CALLEN FEELS GOOD also with the pace, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch off the inside
and also faltered when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
MY PAL SWEET broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch while closest to the inside of the first flight and
while rating kindly, shook clear when straightened for home, held the the next two safe under a right handed crop. NO YIELD last away, raced back, five to
six wide when beginning to rally second turn, continued willingly down the lane to be closing the gap on the winner and hold sway for the place. ZIPPY
TOGA void of speed toward the inside, saved some ground through the second turn, improved position down the lane when clear. MOTANAAFER also
allowed the pace to go early, five wide into the lane when improving, drifted out and flattened out the final furlong. FLYING CAROLINA forwardly placed
along the inside, continued inside far turn, boxed in late in that bend, went evenly through the lane when clear for the drive. SWEET PRESENT settled in
mid pack, lacked response drive. CHILI RED four wide in the first turn, continued forward and outside, weakened through the stretch. ALL TOGETHER
chased the winner early, vied briefly with that one the middle half and gave way.

Footnotes
TENSAS BERTIE behind the pace in the three path and under light restraint up the backstretch, moved out a bit and ranged up five wide to a challenging
position turn, took over into the lane, larger advantage with less than a sixteenth to run, enough left to hold off the runner up. GRACE HAZEL prompted the
early leader off the rail, shuffled back in traffic and three wide turn, asked four wide into the lane, coming again late. MISS ST. CLAIRE in the second flight
out in the strip, moved to the front while four wide and inside the winner in the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, could not last, saved the show.
PORTO DEL ACE back off the pace well wide, five wide into the turn behind the winner, followed that one into the lane, staged a mild rally without posing a
serious threat. STARSHIP NOLA last to leave, trailed early in lacking any early foot, improved position with some belated interest. TONI'S M sprinted clear
after the start, set the pace toward the inside, continued to vie into the stretch while confronted, weakened the final furlong. SHE'S WAYNE'S remained back
in failing to menace. CALCITE closest to the early leader toward the inside, stopped after a half. HALO'S SONG was never involved, far back, jogged in.

GRUNT broke sharp and took command, showed the way up the backstretch comfortably in hand, continued to set the pace turn, cruised home under a
steady hand ride to win ridden out. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. in mid pack early, moved closer into the stretch three wide and on the outside, could do little
with the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the second spot. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS forwardly placed while outside the winner, lacked a closing punch
for that one, outkicked for the place. HOME VISIT chased the winner from along the inside for a half and began to tire. BIND FAITH last to leave, never
menaced. SADIE'S LIGHT finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
THE FIVE B'S forwardly up the backstretch in the three path, advanced out of the turn to challenge nearing the furlong marker, put a head in front, dug in
late when confronted by the runner up from the outside to narrowly prevai. IN DETAIL broke back, lacked speed in mid pack off the inside, came four wide
for the drive outside the winner, challenged that one late to narrowly miss. G E H GIANTS WAY broke well, cleared early to set the pace inside, continued to
hold the advantage turn and into the lane, offered some resistance to the winner when confronted by that one entering the stretch then proved no match for
that one or the runner up, comfortably finished well in front of the others. PALANTE fell back after the start, continued to lack speed, improved inside of
several rivals while three wide into the lane, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. TUCKER THE GRUMP also lacked any early foot, came four to five wide
out of the turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. CORN SOUP within striking distance in the early going, had little left for the stretch run.
LET HIM DO last away, raced well back, picked off some tiring rivals without menacing. IDE LIKE HAWAII fell back to trial, five wide out of the turn, passed
tiring rivals, no real threat. CATINANDSCATIN mid pack, tired through the lane. JACKIE MOON pressed the pace outside, gave way. D W STRONG
forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch.
