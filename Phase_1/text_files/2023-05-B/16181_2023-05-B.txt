Footnotes
MONTREUX stalked the very early pace, moved up to press the leader through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more after straightening in the lane
and quickly drew off. SIR RONALDO off to an alert start suddenly opening at least two lengths soon after the start, was joined by the winner before the first
call, continued with a short lead into the lane, was no match for the top one inside the eighth pole and settled for second best. BARN STORMER chased the
pace from the three path through the turn and never was a threat while clear for the show spot. INFINITY'S WARRIOR raced in the three or four path
through the turn and lacked a response. PABLO'S SUN was in the four path to the rail through the turn and never was a factor. INEEDRELIEF was outrun
while near the rail through the turn.

Footnotes
AMERICANA ANNA was void of speed while in the two path, moved off the inside after the half mile pole, gained momentum into the turn while in the five
path, swung into the lane from the six or seven path and methodically reeled in the leaders. GOLDEN HEIST chased the dueling leaders down the
backstretch, bid three wide into the turn, continued three wide into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, was still the leader inside the sixteenth
pole then was outfinished by the winner. TOURASTAR vied for the lead from the outset while near the rail, continued on the lead into the lane, yielded to the
runner-up inside the eighth pole but stayed on well to save the show spot. LITTLE GRAY FLOWER saved ground through the far turn when never far back
and was slowly gaining through the lane while moving off the inside. BIRDSOFAFEATHER raced near the rail through the turn when near the inside,
continued in the three path through the lane and showed late interest. PRETTY HEART saved ground through the turn and into the lane, came off the rail
inside the eighth pole but lacked a finishing kick. PAT'S PALACE was in tight early and steadied to the back, raced near the back through the far turn, came
into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. EMERSON'S DREAM moved into the turn from the four path when being asked for more, continued
in the four path into the lane and faded. DESIRED LEGACY pressed the pace three wide into the backstretch, chased the pace into the far turn then faded.
TAMARAC LADY vied for the lead two with into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.

eighth pole, was clearing inside the sixteenth pole when run down by the winner. RITAAN was two wide into the lane, moved closer to the inside for the
drive and could not go with the top two while turning in a good effort. SPRING LILACS was in the three path through the first turn, raced two wide through
the far turn and into the lane and moved up while never a threat. CALL ME TONI trailed early while off the inside, moved through the far turn while four wide,
came into the lane as a threat then flattened. ANCIENT RELIC was steadied moving into the backstretch, raced off the inside into the far turn, was four wide
through the turn and into the lane, continued in the five path when put in tight and steadied near the eighth pole then re-engaged to move up a couple.
DIXIE SUPREME saved ground through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and weakened. ASPEN chased the pace while two wide through the
far turn then weakened. WHO RUNS THE WORLD set the pace while under pressure into the lane then gave way. VAGARIES (IRE) was three wide
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, was put in tight near the eighth pole, took up and settled back. FLAT OUT FREDA chased the pace
while three wide into the far turn and was done near the quarter pole. BRIC A BRAC ducked out at the start and lost rider, ran the raced behind the field

Footnotes
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL pressed the early pace outside of a rival, bid at the half-mile mark, went clear in the stretch and drew off under steady urging.
LOUDER THAN WORDS raced five wide around the first turn, bid at the five-eighths pole, then pressed the leader at the three-eighths pole, chased that
one down the stretch and proved the best of the rest. QUICK AND EASY stalked the pace in the three path before fading in the stretch. TRAFALGAR
SHORE stalked the pace inside before giving way on the far turn. BOTOX KATIE stalked the pace between foes, faded, then passed tired rivals. MISS LUV
SHACK led inside, then faded on the far turn. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was not a factor. GET N TIPSY bid three wide at the three-eighths pole, then faltered.

Footnotes
SASSY KATIE stalked the leader from the three path through late turn, bid into the lane from the three path, caught the leader outside the eighth pole and
drove past. CRICKENBERGER was in tight and jostled at the start, raced off the pace into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, loomed a serious threat
straightening in the lane then could not keep up with the winner while second best. SIGNATURE STREET chased the pace along the inside through the
turn, cut the corner into the lane, lacked the needed closing response and just saved the show spot. JACK'S SUMMER raced near the inside through the far
turn, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain. BAND OF ROSES set the pace from the two path then gave way near the eighth pole.
PANTALONES ENFUEGO trailed through the far turn, angled into the four path for the drive and never was a factor. SHES MY TREASURE chased the
pace from the three path through the turns and tired in the lane. ADDICTED TO LOVE was in the four path through late turn and never was a factor.
