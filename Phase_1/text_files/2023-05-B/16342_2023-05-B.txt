Footnotes
BIG POWER RED was off a bit slow, was rated while racing three wide and stalking the early leaders, launched a bid at the half mile pole and drew beside
an inside rival, these two matched strides and collared the original leader at the five sixteenth pole, chased a new leader down the stretch, collared that foe
at the sixteenth marker and drew away for a game win. PROMISING SHOES saved ground by racing on the fence, was tucked in behind the early pace
setters, stayed in contention on the rail until the stretch, launched a late bid and closed with a good turn of foot and was up in time for second. MEDITATE
broke sharp and took back, raced three wide while being mid pack, followed another foe and advanced at the half, edged out a bit, continued to gain ground
while racing eight wide, circled through the turn, hit the stretch in the eight path and closed but did not have enough today. TWITTY CITY stalked from the
two path, was pressured by an outside contender, was joined at the half mile pole by the outside contender, matched strides with this rival into the second
turn, this set then advanced and over came the early leader, drew ahead at the quarter pole, showed the way home briefly before being collared by a late
closing foe then gave way. D TOWN BABY was behind horsed in the two path, tugged early and was in between, steadied into the first turn, settled and
raced along the rail but was never involved after that. JOEBOY vied for the lead, attended the pace while saving ground on the rail, was pressured by
outside attackers after the three eighths pole, then tired in the lane.

Footnotes
PRISSY JADEN vied for the lead, decided to settle just off the pace and stalk the determined early leader, raced three wide and challenged for the lead at
the half mile pole, drew beside the leader, matched strides with this rival past the five sixteenth pole and into the stretch, took command at the quarter pole
and drew off putting more than three lengths in between her and the rest of the field for a commanding win. MISS ARKANSAS was mid pack early while
racing four wide, was keen early and resisted rating, pulled beside and in between other rivals, tried to drift out in the second turn, finally made it into the
stretch and was on point, set aim on the leader, closed with a huge turn of foot but didn't have enough to catch the winner and was second best. CAT B
CAUSE was rated off the pace while racing in the four path, was pressured after the half mile pole by outside avengers, pulled in front of the attackers and
maintained position through out the rest of the race. DAISY DE ORO vied for the early lead, raced on the rail while setting the fractions, was over come by
the eventual winner at the five sixteenth pole and gave way in the stretch. BAILEY'S CHARM had an awkward start, settled along the rail off the pace,
advanced at the half and was in contention by the three eights pole launched a mild closing bid. PENNIE'S MAGIC raced five wide while rating off the pace,
was asked at the half and improved position, gave way late. EMMYLOU SQUALL showed little. DR. WOODS MIRACLE was never involved.

Footnotes
MUNNINGS CATSLE stalked the early leader from the two path, advanced to join the leader at the half mile pole, shook this rival by the quarter pole and
started to pull away, then was threatened by a deep closed near the wire but held on. MR. CROMWELL was a bit slow at the start, raced two wide while in
between foes, advanced at the half mile pole into the second tier and drew beside another rival to the outside, chased the pace in a set, shook outside rival
by the quarter pole, passed the original early leader, was closing fast but did not have enough today. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE was sent from the one post
position to take the lead, saved ground by racing on the rail, was pressured by an outside rival by the half mile pole, matched strides with this foe through
the turn, was still in contention at the quarter pole but couldn't sustain the bid and settled for third. FLOWER CAT was five, in between horses, and mid pack
after the break, surged into the second tier and along the outside of another foe, matched strides in a set, was encouraged with the crop at the five
sixteenth, drifted out a tad bit in the stretch while tiring. STORMIN SUNDAY raced seven wide, was mid pack early on and made no impact.
LIFEASWEKNOWIT saved ground but showed little. BARNEY'S PASSION was off a bit slow and was no menace.

BOYFRIEND MATERIAL rated off the pace in the three path, was pressured by outside attackers, moved up in between horses and drew beside the early
leaders, was asked for more after the quarter pole and responded willingly, shook outside rival and drew away for a game win. CHAPEL BARN was off a bit
slow, was angled out into the six path, rushed up along the outside of the field, was pushed to pass the second tie of horses and challenge for the lead at
the five sixteenth pole, had the lead for a few strides by the quarter pole but was never out of danger, and had to battle down the lane with BOYFRIEND
MATERIAL and weakened. PINKY RING BLING raced off the pace on the rail, put in a mild bid. YOUNG TUSCAN vied, led, raced in a set, was pressured
by outside rivals, and put in between horses and stopped. HIGH CRUISE had no impact. TWO DOT raced in between horses early but showed little.

TIZ SWEET CANDY settled into the middle of the field and raced on the rail, was allowed to find her stride, was given the cue at the half mile pole and
started to gain ground, angled out leaving the turn and was six wide racing down the lane, closed with a big turn of foot and determination, was kept on
point, continued to respond well with every stride, ran down the leaders in the last few jumps and got up in time for a game win. LUNCH LADY showed and
used her natural speed to race to the lead put some distance in between herself and the rest of the field, raced along the rail, willingly maintained her lead
until the last few jumps and got caught late. TWO HANDS FULL raced in between horses three wide, closed rapidly just missed. SWEET N SALTY was off
the pace, saved ground racing on the rail, chased the early pace setter but to no avail. PHARME'S PHINALE made no impact. CORONA DEL MAR flashed
speed early, stalked the leader, raced in the three path then stopped in the stretch. CALYPSO STREET was off a touch slow, saved ground and raced on
the rail until the five sixteenths pole, angled wide entering the upper stretch closed with a mild bid. BEAUCLAIRE was never involved. BONJOOR

Footnotes
CHROME RUN raced mid pack from the two path, moved out at he half and improved position racing four and five wide, circled on the out side closed well
down the lane and got up in time with a game win. MONEYSTRIKE showed early speed, took the lead, set the fractions and saved ground by racing on the
rail, was kept to task but was caught late and just missed. MR LEO AND JOSE was mid pack and racing four wide, was pressured by outside foes and
raced in between, closed but did not have enough today. ROCKALL stalked the pace while being two wide, raced n company in the second tier, was
pressured by outside attackers and faltered. TAPIT TWICE was off slow, made a mild bid. THINKINGNDRINKING showed brief speed then flattened out.
HUMOR ME PLEASE made no impact. ROYAL DE BE was no menace. EMPYREAL SHADOW trailed.
