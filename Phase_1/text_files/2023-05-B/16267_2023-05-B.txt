Footnotes
WHONEW raced three wide in range in early stages, swung three to four wide into the lane, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and kicked
clear. RING BEARER tracked the leader along the inside into the turn, hustled up along the rail heading into the lane, steadily edged up closer, took over
the lead from tiring HUEY DUEY then got outkicked by the winner. HUEY DUEY broke on top , cleared and crossed over to the inside shortly after the start,
settled nicely on top and held a comfortable lead around the turn, came two to three wide into the lane and asked for more, fought on until the sixteenth pole
then got overtaken by the top two finishers. DANCIN ROCKET raced two in contention in early stages, came under a ride two wide entering the lane and
responded evenly. LAMELO lacked speed and raced in the back, swung three to four wide into the lane, angled in a couple paths and lacked a rally.
FITZEA raced off the second flight around the turn, swung four to five wide into the lane and had no response.

SHEMEANSBIZNESS was forwardly placed in opening stages and stalked the leader into the turn, hustled up two wide entering the lane, responded
willingly under pressure and finished going away. DAMASCUS GATE sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, continued
clear on top around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, got overtaken by the winner in the final furlong and held place. RAISIN RAISIN raced in
contention off the top two leaders, hustled along three wide into the drive, roused forward into closer contention and dug in to capture show. OLIVE OYL
raced in range between rivals in the early going, hustled up leaving the turn, drifted out five wide entering the lane, ran on and got nipped for show. KAYLA
was not too far back in early stages and saved ground along the inside, angled out leaving the turn, sustained a four wide bid in the lane and just missed
show.

CLASSIC BET settles nicely and stalked the leaders up the backstretch, tracked three wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane responded
willingly when called upon, kicked in gear and finished going away. HERITAGE PARK dueled inside of CHICAGO CHROME up the backstretch, battled on
around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, fought on to the furlong marker but was no match when the winner took over. CHICAGO CHROME dueled
outside of HERITAGE PARK in early stages, continued to battle around the turn, could not match strides for the lead in upper stretch but stayed on for a
share. TOO LATE was forwardly placed entering the turn, made a bid for command near the quarter pole, continued in range to the furlong marker then
flattened out. HOLIDAY TICKET raced off the early pace, saved ground along the inside, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and gained on show. HUNKA
BURNING LOVE raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and never threatened.

EXPLOSIVE PRIDE dueled outside of CONSTITUTION DAY up the backstretch and battled on around the turn, shook free to a slim lead at the head of the
lane, dug in on top under a drive, responded gamely and kicked clear. SKYFLYER was a step slow at the start and angled inside, tracked the top two
leaders into the turn, saved ground turning for home, roused forward along the rail and dug in to capture place. CONSTITUTION DAY dueled inside of
EXPLOSIVE PRIDE for the early lead, continued to battle for command around the turn, could not maintain equal strides with the eventual winner past
upper stretch but continued to put in effort then weakened late. SPEEDBAYOU raced off the top trio, hustled along three wide into the lane, angled inside
near the eighth pole and stayed on with some interest.

Footnotes
JAVISTHA was well placed racing off the embattled top flight in early stages, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied
along the outside and finished going away. LITTLE ROCKER dueled four deep for the early lead and battled on around the turn, continued in striking
distance a furlong out then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. GARBO SPEAKS vied three deep for the early lead, battled on and held a slight
edge at the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and weakened to show. REINA DEL SUR was well reserved racing the back, cut the corner
entering the lane, responded when called upon and improved late. CHEER UP vied two wide between rivals up the backstretch, fought on around the turn
then faded in the lane. TROPINKA dueled inside off a trio of rivals up the backstretch, continued to match strides around the turn, could not kick on at the
head of the lane and steadily faded.

Footnotes
GRAVES MILL ROAD raced four wide around the first turn then settled nicely not too far off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide late on the far
turn, swung three to four wide into the lane, responded when called up and drew clear in late stages. HIDE THE DEMON vied for the early lead along the
inside, shook free to clear command mid-way up the backstretch, remained the clear leader around the far turn, stayed on with response but got overtaken
late. IRISH VALOR raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and cleared a share. POP'S BISCUIT tracked the pace along the inside, roused
along the rail turning for home, advanced into closer contention in upper stretch then evened out late. OPTIMISTIC VALOR vied for the early lead then
edged back midway up the backstretch, remained in contention around the far turn then retreated. POKER PLAY stalked the pace along the outside and
came up empty late on the far turn. HIGHER AUTHORITY dropped to last after the half and had no response.

Footnotes
BLAZE AWAY N HIDE stalked the leader along the inside up the backstretch, was patiently ridden awaiting room around the far turn, continued in tight
quarters along the rail, slipped through along the rail near the eighth pole, dug in under a drive, gained command and edged away. BOSSY MOMENT was
allowed to settle off the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo three to four wide late on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, kicked in gear under
firm handling, rallied and got up for place. MY GOLDEN DAY tracked the pace three wide up the backstretch, loomed up three wide near the quarter pole,
briefly vied for command mid-stretch then gave way grudgingly. ANGEL'S MELODY took command shortly after the start and set the pace up the
backstretch, continued to hold a slim lead over challengers at the quarter pole, came 2wd into the lane, fought back when confronted by rail running winner
then weakened near the final sixteenth. SAMIRA stalked the early leaders, moved up two wide near the lead at the quarter pole, sustained response into the
lane then gave way in the final furlong. KELA'S TURN raced near midpack in the early going, was ridden along two wide around the turn, failed to advance
and weakened in the lane. JUST LIKE TRISTA was a step sluggish away from the gate and continued in the back, continued off the pace, swung five wide
into the lane and never menaced. REBEL RISING raced off the pace, hustled along five wide into the lane and had no response.
