Footnotes
THE WINE STEWARD was unsettled in the gate then broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail while patiently handled
going around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then accelerated through a rail opening while remaining on his inside lead into upper stretch, swapped
to the proper lead while drawing even with the pacesetter inside the three-sixteenths, took the advantage coming to the furlong marker, kicked clear while
kept to the task with some flagging of a left-handed crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best to win handily with his ears
pricked. KHADULLAH broke well then was sent hard, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was roused near the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive approaching the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. EL GRANDE O
was bumped at the start then taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped back into the kickback while taking short strides late on the backstretch and
early on the turn, rounded the bend in the two path while leveling out some, turned into upper stretch under a drive and was along for the show.
LONCHURA was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied four then three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, remained
on her inside lead in the drive and tired. GRAM was hustled from the start, showed speed between foes then dropped back nearing the half-mile pole, went
three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. SWEPT broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along on
the outside, went five wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
KANNON FIRE just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, advanced through the far turn latching on SARATOGA GAZE midway, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out and drifted out under left handed encouragement and crosses with the left rein only, forced
PEGS A. K. GIRL to pause and alter course a sixteenth out, continued coming out to the finish and held safe to prevail. PEGS A. K. GIRL tracked the pace
along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied offering up a mild kick and had KANNON FIRE drift out
directly in front nearing the sixteenth pole and was paused and altered inwards losing about a half length of momentum and latched on the winner near the
finish while along clear for the place honors. SARATOGA GAZE showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors.
WESTERN LANE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved
position to the finish. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a bid swinging four wide
into upper stretch, then flattened out in the drive. FROSTY INVASION chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, came up empty. DUCKPHAT chased along the inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and trailed. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the trainer of PEGS A. K. GIRL alleging
interference from KANNON FIRE in the stretch. After review, it was deemed that KANNON FIRE had not interfered with PEGS A. K. GIRL and the result
was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official. Please note a head on shot of the starting gate was unavailable in the replays so any possible
trouble at the start was unable to be viewed.

Footnotes
BOURBON'S HOPE showed speed then dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, pursued the pacesetter into upper
stretch, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, shook clear inside that marker and drew away under steady urging. ENSIGN PARKER showed
good speed on the outside then moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, dictated terms around
that bend, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and proved
no match while well clear for the place. STORM SHOOTER was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and tired
while best of the rest. BRUNATE had his head turned some at the start and was last to commence, raced off the pace under urging, went four then five wide
on the turn and failed to threaten. MERCHANTS OF COOL lost his left hind shoe during the warm-up and ran for purse-money only, came away a bit
awkwardly, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BASTET settled off the pace,
was roused while inside on the turn and retreated. STAR ATTITUDE was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and was no factor. MERCHANTS OF COOL RACED FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY DUE TO LOSING HIS LEFT-HIND SHOE DURING THE
WARM-UP. MERCHANTS OF COOL DISQUALIFIED PER ADMC PROGRAM RULES FOR POSITIVE TEST, CASE 2023-00520.

Footnotes
VIRTUAL REALITY broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide jostling a bit with MS. SOLVEIG to her outside before that rival
began to nudge her inside culminating with being nudged to the rail with nine-sixteenths to go, got taken in hand and eased back noticeably at the half mile
pole tipping out three then four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths as MS. SOLVEIG tipped out three wide in front at that station, swung five wide
into upper stretch under a drive, dug in and rallied through the final furlong surging late to get up in the last jumps to the finish. RISK FREE dueled from the
four path down the backstretch with UNDOUBTEDLY to her inside, tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three then two wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command three-sixteenths from home, dug in under a drive and was nailed in the final strides to the
wire. MS. SOLVEIG five then four wide in pursuit, jostled lightly with VIRTUAL REALITY five furlongs out before tucking inwards nudging that rival to the
inside with nine-sixteenths remaining, had that foe back out and got around in behind and tipped out three wide at the three-eighths forcing that foe four
wide, got placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to secure the show honors.
UNDOUBTEDLY hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path down the backstretch with RISK FREE to the outside, tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the
late stages. BUTTER CAKE broke slow and grew detached when out-sprinted in the early going, tucked to chase along the inside, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response. TOWER BRIDGE chased climbing a bit from the kick back while four
wide down the backstretch and then reached out greenly tucking to the two path through the turn coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
DRAKON was urged along on the outside, moved from the two path to the four path going around the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to
get the lead inside the furlong marker and prevailed under good handling. DISARMED bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage into the stretch, fought on well to the finish but missed while narrowly able to
get the place. BIG VENEZUELA bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled, tracked the pace under restraint while given cover, was removed from cover
near the five-eighths pole, stalked three wide on the turn, gained to take a short lead in the four path into upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead
under a drive into the final furlong, kept on well to the finish and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD was
last to commence, settled off the pace, bobbled inside the nine-sixteenths, traveled three to four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch,
chased between horses while behind a foe into the final furlong, lugged in some in the process, found clear space in front in the final sixteenth, continued
under extra right-rein pressure and finished willingly to just miss the show. KING MOONRACER settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, shifted
five wide outside the quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch, gained outside under a drive into the final furlong and also finished willingly but missed the
superfecta. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE took an awkward stride near the three-quarter pole then was taken up, went around the turn in the two path, was asked
at the quarter-pole, chased behind foes but with a small gap in front in upper stretch, had that seam tighten near the eighth-pole, lacked clear space in front
while chasing under moderate encouragement to the finish and missed the minor awards. SONIC SPEED was hustled from the gate then settled off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved into a good striking range before the furlong marker but lacked the needed kick.
BRICCO dropped back then settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
TURNSANDCONDITIONS settled near the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the leaders in the
drive and lacked the needed kick. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the three-eighths on
even terms for the lead, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.

Footnotes
TONAL IMPACT broke out at the start then was corrected and hustled, settled off the pace, strode forward outside the five-eighths, moved from the rail to
the two path on the turn, was roused at the three-eighths, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside to get the lead outside the furlong marker
then kicked clear and proved much the best while eased up in the final sixteenth. CURBSTONE broke out and hit the gate then brushed with a foe, went to
the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear inside the three-quarter pole, vied inside while challenged on the turn, battled under a
drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner then drifted out late while just able to hold the place.
GALT brushed with a foe at the start, prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back some outside the five-eighths, chased four wide into the turn, made a
bid while moving to the three path under urging near the seven-sixteenths, fought under a drive in upper stretch and also proved no match for the winner
then drifted out some late and just missed the place. BACK RING LUCK settled on the outside, was roused while five then four wide on the turn, chased five
wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SYSTEMIC CHANGE brushed with foes at the start, pressed the pace between horses, dropped back with six
furlongs to run and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
HUSH OF A STORM coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through moderate splits, cut the corner roused into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and held well to the finish kept to task. BARRAGE settled just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CATCH THAT PARTY was away
last at the break when off to a troubled start conceding five to six lengths while under hustling, saved ground at the tail of the field early on, tipped two then
three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish closing stoutly on
the outside with good courage to be along for the show honors. AGENT CREED tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the last major share. GHOST GIANT tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SUNDAESWITHSANDY lunged at
the break, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally.
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened. FRANK'S
ART tracked the front from just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
BATTLE SCARS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. K P ALL
SYSTEMS GO tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide at the head of the stretch, tired.
Please note a head on shot of the starting gate was unavailable in the replays so any possible trouble at the start was unable to be detailed in the
comments.

came out three wide and bumped a foe near the five-sixteenths, rallied to make a bid into the stretch, fought with rivals to near the eighth-pole, dueled inside
of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. ORANGE FREEZE was taken under a tight hold while four wide on the first
turn, raced on the outside under reserve, moved closer while shifting from three to five wide on the far turn, gained to make a bid into the stretch, fought with
two foes until near the furlong marker, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. KARA PARA dropped
back in the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch,
chased the top two in the drive and finished with good courage for the show. LEM ME DRINK saved ground going around the opening bend, bobbled near
the seven-eighths, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked once straightened for the drive, pursued the leaders while off the rail
in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES broke out but came out in front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the
quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back outside the furlong marker and gave way. DENIECE OF DEGRACE went five then four wide on
the first turn, settled towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the far turn and lacked the needed response. MY JUNE BUG was backed
out of the gate and reloaded then hustled from the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on
the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. DERWIN'S PAYNTER was off a step slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at the
rear, went three to five wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. WAR MUSEUM was taken under a tight hold in the three path on the first turn then rated
off the pace, went three wide early on the far turn then was bumped four wide around the five-sixteenths, dropped back five wide into the stretch and had
nothing left. MIDNIGHT EMPRESS was fractious in the gate, went five wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside without cover, came
