Footnotes
MAGIC MULE , nudged to the front and secured the inside, set a rated pace while handling some pressure from ABUELO PAPS, responded when put to
firm asking soon into the lane, opened up pressure in mid stretch then was confidently handled the final seventy yards. BRILLIANT ICE broke inward a bit
and brushed with a rival, raced between rivals and in range past the three eighths, altered out for room in upper stretch, straightened to be about four wide
and finished well. MANOLITO , three deep near the half mile marker, chased outside a rival nearing the lane but lacked a serious finish. ABUELO PAPS
moved up leaving the five eighths and engaged the winner from his outside, pressed the pace to about the quarter pole, failed to go on leaving the three
sixteenths and faded. REMEMBERING WILBUR lost ground four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, pursued five wide into the stretch and gave way.
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , brushed at the start, gained a forward spot early along the rail and rated along, lacked a punch when called upon in upper stretch
and gave way. PRIDE OF PAYTON hopped at the break and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SAGRADA RAY set the pace along the inner rail, was pressed on the backstretch and around the far turn, asserted himself turning for home and drew off
while kept to his business. BODE LYNX saved ground on the turns while stalking the pace, remained near the rail through the stretch and gained the place.
SUPER E , along the inner rail around the first turn, trailed down the backstretch, swung to the eight path at the head of the stretch and rallied outside foes.
SOUTHPAW MIKE prompted the pace outside the winner and gradually weakened in the drive. SEVILLE ROW , between horses on the far turn, swung to
the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. CALLOWAY PEAK chased the pace racing between horses down the backstretch, moved to the four path in
upper stretch and gave way. NICKY BEAR , three wide the first turn, was in the five path entering the stretch and was weakened. HELLMAN lacked speed,
swung to the seven path at the head of the lane, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
KRISTINACHRYSALIS was hustled clear early, set the pace towards the rail, came two wide into the lane, wandered outward from some left handed asks
then held sway. KELLAN was taken to rate soon after the break, raced in hand behind a rival leaving the far turn, angled out and was put to pressure mid
turn, came four to five wide for the drive, advanced widest outside rivals near mid stretch, was kept straight with left handed encouragement and finished
strong. TINA TINA TINA stalked the winner three wide, shifted four wide chasing into the lane and kept on willingly to bridge the gap. BUCKIN' GREAT
drifted in a bit at the break and brushed with a rival, corrected and moved to contention, prompted the pace outside winner, was under hard chase leaving
mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. JUST THE THING rated off foes nearing the turn then dropped in to secure the rail, stayed inside into the stretch
and churned on. HATEFUL , three wide, was pushed along past the five sixteenths but failed to muster up a serious run. FAMILY GAL saved ground leaving
the far turn and failed to menace. SHE'S FANTASTIC , brushed at the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RENEGADE , bumped and checked sharply soon after the break, regrouped and was able to secure an inside spot while settling, angled five
wide gathering momentum into the stretch, leveled off to a strong stride outside rivals nearing mid stretch, kept on under left handed asks to take over in
deep stretch and drew clear. PAY ZONE cleared in hand and dropped in towards the rail to set a rated pace, came under a ride soon into the lane,
remained clear past mid stretch, weakened late and just saved the place. O'CONNER SUNSET , bumped and steadied soon after the start, raced in mid
pack off the rail, took closer order four wide into the lane, shifted wider near mid stretch and rallied. S S SINATRA prompted the pace two to three wide, was
under pressure pursuing past mid stretch but came up empty. SUPER ACCELERATE , three to four wide outside rivals, chased to mid stretch then faded a
bit late. DISPUTED CLAIM was forced out some at the break then drifted further, corrected to chase inside a pair of rivals, was under a hard ride into the
stretch and faded. CALMING STORM bore in after hesitating at the break, raced well back leaving the far turn, raced removed from the rail in the drive and
lacked a serious punch. RUNAHOLIC broke outward, was sent up early, chased between rivals around the turn and weakened. RUN BUCKY RUN was
shuffled back soon after the start and failed to menace. GREAT COCKTAIL , wide and off the pace, was outrun.

Footnotes
ALOGON chased the pace, advanced in the two path leaving the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and drove clear. ZYRAMID broke alertly and
immediately sprinted clear, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, was challenged in mid stretch and was not
quite good enough. DOCTOR JEFF , three deep leaving the turn, was in striking position in upper stretch and only offered a mild gain in the drive. MOMOS
lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. PYRON , well positioned in the three path turning for home,
drifted in near the eighth pole and failed to rally. CYNERGY'S STAR , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, was not a factor
and swung wide in upper stretch. LIVE FIRE hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened through the stretch. POWER BACK , outrun, swung wide
turning for home. POMPOUS PRINCE , no factor, dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
DAREDAVITE broke inward, recovered and rated forwardly towards the inside, sat patiently past the five sixteenths, worked through a seam in upper
stretch, kept grinding under strong handling past the furlong grounds, forged to command inside a pair of runners in deep stretch then held firm. THE
THINKER settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out taking closer order past the five sixteenths, straightened to be six wide in upper stretch,
closed outside rivals to take command in mid stretch, dueled late and continued well. JONES FALLS lost ground four wide around both turns while in range,
angled five wide into the lane, bid to challenge soon after, battled between runners inside the sixteenth pole and kept on with effort. THRUSTER broke
slowly, dropped in towards the rail heading to the first turn, settled well back, shifted out for the drive and offered a mild kick. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE , three
wide both turns while prompting the pace, chased between rivals into the lane, remained a presence to mid stretch then faded. MERCURY TEN vied along
the rail for nearly six furlongs, was under asking trying to keep pace in upper stretch then gave way. OROCOVIX disputed the pace two wide outside
MERCURY TEN, briefly went clear after six furlongs, could not withstand pressure from both sides nearing mid stretch and weakened. DON BERNARDO
bobbled at the break, raced wide and failed to menace.
