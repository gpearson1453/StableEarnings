Footnotes
RACHELS SONG set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. GRAND BIRDIE raced in range three and four wide, could not keep pace with the
winner but stayed to be clearly second best. GREY PRINCESS steadied entering the first turn, raced in range in the two path, lacked the needed rally but
outfinished a foe for the show. QUEEN DEYMAR prompted the winner in the three path and faded through the lane. YANKEE STORM had her head turned
at the start, checked not long after, saved ground and never threatened. MOON ROSE raced off the early pace four wide, angled in down the backstretch
and had no response. MOONTAP was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
CROSS HASTE chased in the four path, ranged up from the five path around the turn, took the lead in the four path at the top of the lane, drifted out after a
left handed cue while opening up passing the eighth pole, but was corrected and driven out. GUN MAESTRO got brushed by an inner rival at the start,
stalked in the three path, stuck a head in front midway around the turn, but was overtaken by an outer foe in upper stretch, and held place. CAMP DADDY
was prompted along inside, under right handed urging while tipping out around the turn, was in the six path entering the stretch, and was one paced for
show. PAPA KATZ trailed in the four path, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, but was no factor. BIRD WILDCAT broke out and brushed an outer
foe, rated in the five path early but did not threaten. CARABINERO set the pace in the two path but yielded into the stretch. BIG BUCKSALOT raced off the
pace in the two path but never menaced.

Footnotes
FORTUNA BELLE set the pace in the two path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in the lane and widened under a drive. SPLURGE
prompted the winner in the three path, could not materially gain on that foe in the lane but kept on well to hold the place. EILAT came in early and bumped
FOREVER UNCAPTURED into SECRET OF SARATOGA, stalked the pace in the four path, angled to the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly.
FOREVER UNCAPTURED was bumped between foes early, raced off the pace three wide and had a mild stretch rally. UNCAPTURED SKEET played no
factor while racing three wide. ALLONS lacked speed inside, angled three wide turning for home and never threatened. MO RISSA had early speed inside
and steadily faded. SECRET OF SARATOGA was bumped early, chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH AND DISQUALIFIED EILAT FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR
INTERFERING WITH FOREVER UNCAPTURED.

Footnotes
SWOONATRA set an open pace while shifting inside into the backstretch, was under confident handling into the far turn, shaken up passing the quarter and
was in the two path at the top of the lane, dug in under steady encouragement, brushed with an outer foe late, but held on. KIZZY travelled in the five path
around the first turn and tracked in the three path down the backside, was roused to bid around the far turn, ran on and sustained that bid from the four path
into the stretch, brushed with the inner leader in deep stretch, and hung to place. CHARGE ACCOUNT settled in midpack along the inside, steadied passing
the three eighths pole, tipped out and was ridden between foes from the three path rounding the far turn, was under right handed urging into the stretch,
drifted out into the final furlong and kept on for show. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) rated in the three path, was nudged along in the four path rounding the far
turn, was cued from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. FRENCH FRANC (FR) chased in the four path, received right handed cues around the
far turn, tipped out to the six path into the lane, but was no factor. STELLARATOR was unhurried in the two path, stymied early around the far turn, and did
not threaten from around the four path in the stretch. FUNNY ENOUGH bobbled at the start, trailed around the three path early, advanced between foes into
the far turn, but weakened from the two path down the lane. CECIL'S ANGEL stalked in the two path, but backed up early around the far turn, and was
eased thru the stretch.

Footnotes
JET WINGS set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out under left-handed urging in the final sixteenth pole and held clear. ETERNAL FLAME raced off the
pace four and five wide and finished well widest to gain the place. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR chased the pace three wide and was one-paced through the
lane. WHEATSHEAF stalked the pace from the rail and was outfinished for the minor awards. ON JET HEIR had his head turned at the start, raced four
wide in midpack and went evenly. RARE JEWEL was devoid of speed, angled three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and rallied belatedly.
CAPTURETHELAUGHTER raced in range inside and lacked a rally. COURAGEOUS COPPER chased the winner two wide and faded through the final
furlong. GUNMAN played no factor while racing two wide. JOYFUL SURPRISE failed to menace while racing five wide. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH was
outrun inside.

Footnotes
CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) raced closest to the runaway pacesetter while saving ground, tipped two wide midway around the far turn, seized command
in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. COCO raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner but
kept on to gain the place late. DRUM ROLL sprinted clear at the rail, was collared in upper stretch and lost second late. R ROSE' ALL DAY was bumped at
the start, saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. SHE'S SO BEARRISH was bumped between foes at
the start and in tight through the opening sixteenth, saved ground in range and faded in the lane. CLOUD STORAGE broke inwardly and bumped foes at the
start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced two wide around the far turn but failed to sustain in the lane. ARMONIA trailed inside.

Footnotes
I BELIEVE IN MAGIC set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside approaching the quarter, opened up into the lane, and was driven out under
right handed encouragement. MISS UCRANIA started slowly, raced wellback in the four path, was roused midway around the turn, floated out to the seven
path into the stretch, and kept on for place. VIVA LA RED raced off the pace in the six path into the turn, circled inner foes from the four path around the
turn, took aim from the five path at the top of the lane, but evened out for show. GREAT ANALOGY tracked in the three path, was under right handed urging
turning into the lane, but flattened. HOPE OVER FEAR stalked inside, was ridden hard around the turn, but was stymied nearing the quarter, and tired from
the four path down the stretch. UPSTREET raced up close in the four path but gaveway from the three path into the lane. FUNTASTICA had a rank start,
trailed from the seven path into the turn and never menaced. HERE'S PERFECTION stumbled at the start, rated in the two path but was empty entering the
stretch.

MILLENNIUM CONDO tracked the pace two and three wide, tipped four wide turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over near the
sixteenth pole and powered clear. DUNKLE raced off the early pace four wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid four deep rounding the far turn,
took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth marker and settled for second best. DOC BALLARD saved ground off the early pace,
advanced four wide around the far turn and ran on outside to gain the show. BLUE SOLDIER stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes midway around
the far turn, vied to midstretch then weakened. CHIEF ROCKA set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, fought on to
midstretch then tired late. FINLANDIAS NEAT failed to menace while racing two wide. ALWAYS GOLDEN was up close inside and retreated after six
furlongs. ONCE UPON A DREAM played no factor while racing three wide. SKY KATZ steadied at the start and was outrun inside. FREDDIE'S FIRE had
