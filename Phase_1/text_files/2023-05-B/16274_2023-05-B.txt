briefly regained the top spot once the leader pulled up then could not hold the winner safe. MY GOOD FORTUNE was unhurried while trailing the field into
the lane then gained energy late to be well clear for the show spot. BLUSHING BELLE raced in the three path into the far turn, bid three wide through the far

Footnotes
PRINCE SHIM set the pace while under pressure into the far turn, cleared in mid-turn, remained clear into the lane then widened through the final eighth.
SECRETO DE AMORE stalked the winner from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane, could not gain on the winner but stayed on to be well
clear of the next rival. SUNSIGN trailed for half while near the inside, came off the rail entering the far turn, continued in the three path through late turn,
came into the lane from the five path and moved up while not a threat. HITCHPIN raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three
path and moved up while not a threat. STARLITE RUN saved ground through the turn and into the lane and tired. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE was in the two
path through the turn when never far back, was asked for more into the turn, continued as a contender into the lane and faded. AMELIA'S MACHO was in
the three path through the turn when never far back then was done in mid-turn. MR NEGATIVITY pressed the winner two wide through mid-turn then was
empty nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MISS GOODBAR stalked the pace inside, was steadied at the quarter pole, rallied through the stretch inside and was clear at the wire under steady
handling. MORNING ANGEL was unrushed early, rallied and circled the field five wide on the turn, dueled late and yielded at the wire. ONLY TIME was
clear early, dueled outside of a rival and then was no match late. HAPPY SAILS pressed the early pace and was through early. PACIFIC GROVE stalked
the early pace, bore out at the three-quarters pole, stalked the pace inside, bid and took the lead around the turn, then faltered in the drive. THIS
MASQUERADE saved ground, then passed tired foes. C C'S WORLD was not a factor. HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL was bumped on the first turn.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE WARRIOR chased the pace from the four path into the turn, bid three wide in late turn, gained the lead straightening in the lane, widened to the
sixteenth pole and geared down. BIG CITY HEAT chased the pace from the two path into the lane, was in the three path with aim on the leader, could not
gain on that one but finished clear for the place spot. LUCKIES JOY pressed the pace while two wide through the turn, gained the lead into the lane while
moving closer to the inside then could not sustain the effort. STAR REVIEW raced in mid-pack while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the three or four path and finished evenly. GO FOREVER was in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the five path
and lacked the needed response. ALL READY was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, moved up a couple of
positions inside the eighth pole and was not persevered with late while lacking clear running room. PHILIP SNOW raced near the rail through the turn when
towards the back, came into the lane from the two path and never was a factor. PURSUANT was along the inside throughout and never made an impact.
MIGHTY QUIEN was outrun near the rail. SECOND TO NO ONE vied for the early lead, continued close up into late turn then was suddenly done.

Footnotes
CHARCOAL was unrushed early, rallied at the three-eighths pole, circled five wide into the stretch, rallied and was in time under steady handling. NOBODY
LISTENS stumbled at the start, led inside, was clear in the stretch, then was caught. SHIMMER ME TIMBERS pressed the pace outside of the leader, then
had no late bid. OCEANIC took back early, stumbled switching leads near the three-eighths pole, shifted seven wide near the eighth pole and rallied
strongly. SPYCRAFT vied between rivals, was squeezed back at the nine-sixteenths pole, raced inside and bid at the eighth pole, then faltered in the drive.
CREATIVE CREDIT stalked the pace in the four path, then faded in the drive.
