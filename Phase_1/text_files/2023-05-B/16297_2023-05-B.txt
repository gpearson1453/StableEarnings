Footnotes
MOSES WATER went to the front to set a pressured pace, was challenged around the final turn and down the stretch but dug in and held off the outside
challenge to prove best. NET WORTH raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from between horses going into the final turn then engaged
the leader and dueled down the stretch to be a game second. MUD BUG was unhurried down the backstretch, made a five wide bid at the five sixteenths
pole to rally but was not enough. MY SLICK NICK was within striking distance while saving ground and finished evenly. CAN'T STOP MAXEY hit the gate
when leaving and broke outward then was hustled forward but went four wide around the first turn and down the backstretch and weakened on the final turn.
CHASING STORMS was off the pace from three wide to the quarter pole and gave way. SPEIGHTY SENSE prompted the pace from the two path down the
backstretch then was steadied around the three furlong pole, fell back and never regained action.

ROAD PARTY went to an unchallenged lead and inched away on the final turn to prove much the best. LOGSTRADAMUS raced near the back to the first
turn then moved between horse at the half pole to press the pace but was no match for the winner. HAZEDNCONFUSED was unhurried around the first turn
then moved between horses around the three eighths pole then saved ground around the final turn and flattened out. NO LOVE FOR JUBA raced near the
back around the first turn then made a mild four wide bid on the backstretch and finished evenly. REATA'S CASTLE was hustled early to be forwardly
placed to the three eighths pole and faded. BLUE N GOLD remained back. ACASHA'S INTUITION tracked the leaders from the inside to the three furlong
pole then took a bad step, was pulled up and vanned off.

SHOWTHEMONEYHONEY was hustled away from the gate to be off the pace through the turn then moved to challenge the leader and was forced out in
upper stretch but kept on and drew clear. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL was away alertly to have the speed through the turn then floated out to mid track but
couldn't fend off the outside rival but held the place. LOCKDOWN VANNA raced in the middle of the pack around the turn then made a two wide bid in
upper stretch and gave a late surged but missed the place. PRETTY CASTLE raced near the back to the turn then went three wide in upper stretch to make
a late bid to improve position. S S CASINO GIRL had good early speed then tracked the leaders through the turn but was out finished. BELIEVE I CAN
saved ground then moved up the rail into the stretch but was empty. OK EMILY was not a threat. JADE SKYE had no speed and was never a factor.

STRONG WILLED tracked the leader to the final turn then engaged at the quarter pole and matched strides through the stretch and cleared late. LOVE OF
GRACE was allowed to settle to the final turn then made a four wide bid for a late run and was up for the place. TRUE FLIRT went to an unchallenged lead
to the top of the stretch then dueled to the final sixteenths and tired. SNEAKY LYNK broke in sharply at the start then raced in the middle of the pack around
the first turn then made a rail bid but had to check slightly at the five sixteenths pole, made a rebid but was too late. LUCKY BOP stalked the pace from the
two path around the final turn then angled out to four wide at the sixteenths pole but had no late bid. IHEARTRAINACOMN was off the pace on the inside to
the quarter pole and faded. FRENCHIES GOLD was steadied at the start when forced in then remained back. AMELIA'S DREAM was off slow and was
never a threat. PATTI BLUE EYES was steadied at the start when forced in then raced rank around the first turn but was not a factor.

Footnotes
SCOOTSCOOT was hustled to a clear lead around the first turn then inched away on the final turn and won going away. BUBBA G was away alertly then
tracked the leader down the backstretch and made a mild bid on the final turn but was no match for the winner. BET ON BITZ raced in the middle of the
pack down the backstretch then moved out to four wide in the stretch for a late bid and was up for the show. ADARA was forwardly placed on the inside and
failed to menace. BARB'S PRIDE broke outward at the start then rushed up to prompt the pace down the backstretch and gave way. ANGELUS DIAMOND
raced near the back and failed to menace. GORUN had no speed and passed tiring ones. CHERRYS CROSS saved ground to no avail.
NOTIMELIKEPRESENT was off slow and race wide throughout and was never a threat.
