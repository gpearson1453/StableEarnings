after the start, chased outside then passed fading rivals. MR. NORMANDY lacked speed and was never in contention. FREEDOM LIVES flashed speed in
the two path then stopped abruptly.

FINALLY CAPTURED stalked the pacesetter, collared the leader into the stretch and drew away while geared down late. LIBERTY FOR ALL hustled to a
clear inside on the turn, was hooked into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. UPFOR PAROLE chased wide off the pace and lacked a solid rally.
HOLY MOLY MOSES moved within striking range inside and was never a factor. UPTOWN SHOES flashed speed down the backstretch and began fading
on the turn. CARRICKMACROSS dropped back early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WHITE LILACS controlled the pace, widened with little coaxing in the stretch and coasted home while ridden out. DISTORTED VIEW was taken out into the
first turn then advanced inside for the place. MY MASTERPIECE broke alertly and forced the pace then weakened in the stretch. I LOVE MAGEL moved
very wide into the first turn then was never a factor. LA NEBLINA dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. MISS ALEX raced off the leaders inside and
was finished by the final turn. MISQUILLO trailed for half a mile and was never in contention. IYIYI chased in midpack then weakened steadily. CASH ON
FIRST stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

KISS FOR LUCK broke sluggishly, rushed to the front, moved inside, edged clear and stayed safe driving. MII AMO went after the pacesetter on the turn
and continued gamely to the wire. ONE EYED JACKIE broker slowly, made a strong wide move on the turn and finished willingly. BETSY IS THE GAL
forced the pace outside then on the rail and faded at the quarter pole. DIVINE MAGIC trailed early inside, moved wide on the turn and was no menace.
WILD CREATION flashed speed inside, was taken up at the far turn and faltered. CARMELIA unseated her rider and ran off in the post parade and was
ordered scratched.

PURRFECT MISTRESS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over into the stretch., drew away and remained safe. TWIRLING WIND lacked
speed along the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. TONALA trailed far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. SWEET LILLY
FACTUM settled off the pace, lacked a bid and flattened out in the stretch. MAZAL EIGHTEEN quickly sprinted clear, led to the stretch and faltered.
WITHOUT A VIEW dropped back inside and was always outrun. DON'T TELL FRANKIE was urged just off the pacesetter briefly and stopped before half a

CAJUN COUSIN dueled outside throughout in heated battle and won head bob at the wire following a long drive. LEAN ON E set a pressured pace inside,
battled all the way and lost the head bob in a game effort. FAST INTENTIONS advanced inside on the turn, moved wide in the stretch with a strong rally.
ASSUME CONTROL saved ground, moved briefly closer on the turn then weakened. VALERIE FIRST dropped back early and was never in contention.
BEYOND A MILLION chased off the leaders three wide and stopped after half a mile. SUMMARY JUDGMENT raced close up for half a mile, stopped and

Footnotes
WIZKY'S ON THE BAY well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid inside in the stretch and drew off under steady handling. ICONIC LEGACY lacked speed
inside then closed strongly narrowing the gap. QUICK RETURN dropped back outside then finished well too late. PALM ISLAND earned a narrow
advantage inside, vied through the turn and tired. MIDLANER stalked the pace three wide, moved wider in the stretch and flattened out. COMMISSIONER
G lagged far behind then narrowed the gap without menacing. BUFFALO SHUFFLE alternated for the lead outside to the stretch and gave way.

repelled challenges and continued gamely. BRINDISI raced off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. MORE THAN A DANCE save
ground off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. GAMBLING TZAR settled far behind then closed well outside in the stretch. ESOR bid to the front after
quarter mile, widened after half mile then tired. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN far behind early, moved inside then lacked a closing bid. PANADERO lagged far
behind then was never in contention. STRAWBERRY CONE was taken up into the first turn then was never a factor. OUR MARK STEVEN dropped back
