Footnotes
FREE SMOKE tracked in the four path, circled inner foes around the turn and bid from the five path into the lane, stuck a head in front passing the eighth
pole, and held gamely under left hand encouragement. YEAGER set a contested pace in the three path, brushed with an outer foe passing the three-eighths
pole and was coaxed from the two path early around the turn, was in the three path at the top of the stretch, dug in but narrowly lost the lead going into the
final furlong, fought on inside of the winner, but could not get back up to finish with place. MR. RHODIUM chased between foes in the three path, was cued
right handed while swinging out to the six path into the lane, and ran on for show. LAST SHIFT stalked inside, was short of room approaching the quarter,
but one paced from the two path down the stretch. BALTIC MULE had an awkward start, trailed in the four path early, and never threatened. CHAPLIN
pressed in the four path, brushed with an inner foe passing the three-eighths pole, was under right handed urging turning into the lane, but yielded.

Footnotes
BONNIE SANDRA stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, bid nearing the quarter pole, vied to midstretch then drew off under a drive. TROTTING
GEAR set the pace in the two path, led to midstretch and was clearly second best late. QUICKSTYLE chased the top two from the inside, lacked the needed
rally but easily bested the rest. SUBTLE SENORITA raced in range three wide and lacked a closing bid. LADY BOURBON was outrun inside. GRATIA was
bumped repeatedly early and never reached contention. APPLE LOVER was bumped repeatedly early, raced two wide in midpack and was through after a
half.

Footnotes
QUINCY CAFE prompted the pace in the three path, took control midway around the turn, opened up from the four path into the lane, began to shorten
stride in the final sixteenth, but held safe under right handed urging. COPPERMASTER rated inside, shifted out under a drive around the turn and was in the
eight path at the top of the stretch, and ran on between foes for place. ENGLISH BOB brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was
ridden around the turn and floated out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on between rivals for show. HEXAGON raced wellback in the six path into
the turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and finished evenly. D COLDEST brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, bid
under rousing around the turn, but faded from the six path in the stretch. CAJUN HOPE chased in the two path but weakened down the lane. GRAND
ROCK set the pace inside but gaveway around the turn.

KARTANO was off a bit slowly, saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, seized
command near sixteenth pole and drew clear while ridden out. CASHIER CHECK settled off the early pace while racing three wide, bid three deep rounding
the far turn, took the lead in midstretch but was no match for the winner late. NOVGOROD THE GREAT set the pace along the rail, yielded in midstretch
and kept on to save the show. LIGHT FURY saved ground off the pace, made progress in the two path rounding the far turn but weakened in the lane. INDY
LYON raced off the pace four wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. VLADISLAV failed to menace while racing four and five wide.
CHARLES CHROME prompted the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
EMBER was slowly away, rated in the three path into the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path into the stretch,
and rallied past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth to win. NOTARY SOJAC set the pace in the three path, was roused early around the far turn,
tipped out to the four path into the stretch, stayed on and opened slightly into the final furlong, but was caught in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place.
BROOKLYN DREAMS trailed in the four path, angled to the rail into the far turn, was under right handed urging while tipping out to the four path into the
lane, angled further out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. ENZO'S WORLD stalked in the four path, bid around the far turn,
received right handed cues while in the six path at the top of the lane, but flattened. ROCK THE WEEKEND tracked in the five path, was under right handed
urging around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, but did not threaten. IMPETUOUS SOUL settled off the pace in the two path, was
driven around the far turn, but faded in the stretch.

SOPHIA'S STORM stalked the pace three and four wide, took over in upper stretch, dug in inside of MILES OF SMILES when that foe reached even terms
leaving the sixteenth pole and held on left-handed urging. MILES OF SMILES raced off the pace four and five wide, closed outside, reached even terms
outside of the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but was denied. AWESOME ANNMARIE vied inside of DOVE IN CHARGE for three furlongs, angled three
wide near the quarter pole, re-bid between foes turning for home but was no match for the top two in the final furlong. RAIN chased the pace two wide and
lacked a closing bid. DOVE IN CHARGE vied two wide, drew clear midway around the turn, led to upper stretch and tired. DUDESFIRSTDARLING

Footnotes
MAX K. O. was unhurried in the four path early, advanced between rivals into the far turn, was roused while ranging up and took aim from the four path into
the stretch, and ran on to nail an inner foe on the wire to win. SARATOGA FLASH brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, took the
lead under a nudge around the far turn, was cued right handed while still in the three path entering the lane, stayed on into the final furlong, but was nailed
on the wire by an outer foe to finish with place honors. ME AND MR. C brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked inside, was driven around the far turn
and angled out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) travelled in the six path around the first turn, chased in
the four path down the backside, tipped back out to the six path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. CANDY TYCOON brushed with an outer foe at
the start, trailed in the two path, was under coaxing while fanning out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. FREDO brushed with an inner foe
at the start, then bumped with another inner foe early into the first turn, set the pace in the two path, lost the lead around the far turn, and faded from the
three path down the stretch. GRAND DAVID bumped with an outer foe, checked, and drifted out to the five path early into the first turn, dropped off the pace
while in the three path down the backside, and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SILARDI set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, opened up from back in the two path into the lane, and held safe. ADIOS
ASHER was prompted along in the three path, driven from the four path into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. RICHY raced up close in the four
path, was ridden along and bid in the three path around the turn, floated out to the six path entering the lane, and kept on but was outfinished by an inner
rival to show. EXECUTIVE SEARCH brushed with an outer foe after the start, chased inside, tipped out around the turn and was in the seven path at the top
of the stretch, but finished evenly. POINT LIAM raced wellback in the four path and did not factor from the five path down the lane. UNSOCIABLE brushed
with an inner foe after the start, tracked in the five path, was in the six path entering the lane, but faded. VIVA VICTORY trailed throughout around the two
path.
