Footnotes
CHEETS tracked the embattled duo through early stages, picked up the pace late on the turn, roused forward three to four wide, took command near the
furlong marker and finished going away. RAYS BIG DREAM applied pace pressure to the leader into the turn, dueled for the lead heading into the lane,
began to edge away nearing the eighth pole but was no match when the winner swept by. NATIVE HELLRAISER was unhurried up the backstretch, saved
ground then swung three wide into the lane and gathered a share. SPANISH KISS raced two to three wide near mid-range, cut the corner entering the lane
and needed more for late impact. HE'S A SHOWBOAT set a pressured pace, vied for the lead into upper stretch then came up tired a furlong out. DAY
MONEY broke sharp and outward at the start, tracked the pace up the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane and failed to rally. STROLLN WITH STELA
raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
SWEET HOLINESS tracked the top pair into the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, set sights on the leader, accelerated down the lane and
got up in time. GRANDMA BELLE set the pace in early stages, continued to hold clear around the turn, widened command in upper stretch then got caught
in final strides. CANARY NATION raced just off midpack, saved ground around the turn, was no match for the clear top pair but sustained a steady bid and
captured a share. RELENTLESS ROCKET saved ground through early stages, ranged up closer late on the turn, hustled up two to three wide and just
missed show. MOMMA MULE sat back in early stages, hustled along two to three wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally for impact. FANCY HILL was
forwardly placed racing just off the leader, sustained bid into upper stretch then came up tired. I GOT A NAME bobbled then got bumped at the start, raced
midrange in early stages, hustled along four to five wide into upper stretch and had no response. MRS. MACOMBER raced in the back throughout.

BAYSHORE FOXES was forwardly placed into the turn, moved up to challenge rival near the quarter pole, briefly matched strides then cleared command
just past upper stretch, edged away under a drive and held firm. WINZE raced in the back through early stages, ranged up into contention three to four wide
late on the turn, moved up closer, ran on three then two wide, held in GRAYDAWN DAY and secured place. GRAYDAWN DAY tracked the pace along the
inside, raced up close but lacked racing room around the turn and continued without a clear path into final stages. ELI'S GIRL raced off the early pace,,
swung four wide into the lane and needed more for serious impact. FABULOSITY set the pace with the winner not far behind, met bid at the quarter pole,
briefly matched strides then tired in the drive.

ELLLL E rated off the top trio up the backstretch, picked up the tempo three to four wide, edged closer late on the turn, responded under right handed
encouragement, finished determinedly and got up in final stride. OURPEPPERMINTCANDY vied inside a duo shortly after the start, continued to battle with
STARGAZER around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, continued to put in a good effort but got wore down in final stride. BE SINCERE was unhurried
and settled in or near the back, roused into closer contention late on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, steadily made up ground and finished well clear
over the rest. STARGRAZER vied for the early lead racing outside of OURPEPPERMINTCANDY, continued to battle for command around the turn, could
not match strides in upper stretch and steadily faded. KAMEA saved ground racing off the early pace, cut the corner entering the lane and had no response.
SONG OF PRAISE steadied in opening stages and lost momentum, moved up into contention, weakened two wide around the turn and continued to falter in
the lane. MY FOUR POINT OH vied three wide for the early and came up empty mid-way around the turn. HAPPY STROLL failed to move into contention.

ALYANAABI sped to the lead in opening stages and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch with GEM COLLECTION not far
behind, repelled bids around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened to a commanding advantage and kept to task. BACKGATE RED settled
in the back up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, angled three wide at the head of the lane and produced a solid finish. ITWASTHISBIG
tracked the pace through early stages, picked up the tempo three wide mid-way around the far turn, brushed slightly with rival in upper stretch, sustained a
steady bid and cleared the rest. INESPERADO rated off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and failed to respond. GO FOR IT stalked the early
leaders then edged up closer along the inside of the eventual winner near the half mile marker, sustained bid around the far turn then came up empty. GEM
COLLECTION was forwardly placed racing just off the leader the retreated entering the lane.

got through entering the head of the lane, took command and finished going away. JUSTICE ONCE was reserved up the backstretch, saved ground around

edged up cllser to engage rivals midway up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the turn, could not match strides entering the lane but stayed on for
a share. TAP THE BRAKES raced four to five wide entering the first turn, settled off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and just missed show.
EVIL KNIEVEL raced off the early pace, bid up five wide near the quarter pole, ran on but needed more for serious impact. FREDDY J raced in range near
midpack, hustled along two to three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. LATE FOR LUNCH vied two wide for the lead up the backstretch, battled

MADETHEDEAN'SLIST broke out and bumped with rivals at the start, rated along the inside in early stages, saved ground then angled out leaving the turn,
kicked in gear at the head of the lane, rallied determinedly three wide and just missed. FRANKLYGREAT took a solid bump at the start, lacked speed and
raced in the back, swung four wide into the lane and had a mild improve. TEMPLE CITY RUN broke in at the start and raced in early contention, tracked up

sharply and dropped back, stayed on briefly then weakened in the lane. MACH SWEDE bumped with rival at the start, raced off the pace, swung five wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. ESPE'S GUY showed response in early stages then began to falter around the turn. TAP ON BY was forwardly placed in the
