ATHENA BEACH set the pace early on the inside while clear and well handled, then drew out mid way on the turn, but then was challenged by ONE MORE
KELLY by the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch and held off that rival to prove best under strong handling. ONE MORE KELLY was rated along two
wide, then was ridden along on the turn and advanced to the inside of HASHTAG LUCKY, then shifted out and made a three wide bid on the leader and
loomed boldly leaving the turn but failed to get by in the lane, hung while being clearly second best. HASHTAG LUCKY shifted off the inside into the first
turn, stalked the pace three wide and weakened on the turn, tired in the drive, bested rest. ELEGANT TASTE was settled three wide and tired.
LANFRANKOPHILE was taken back and crossed over to the inside and saved ground and had no response and was eased through the lane.

leaving the turn, then was headed by the furlong marker and could not go with the winner, second best. BRODIX was allowed to settle three wide, made a
four wide bid on the turn and into the lane but flattened out, bested rest. NEON SIGN tracked the pace along the inside and saved ground on the turn and
weakened. FREEDOM'S START passed the tiring rivals. MIZZEN MONEY was bumped at the start, then had a wide journey and had no rally.
