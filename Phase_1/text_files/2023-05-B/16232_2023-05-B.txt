ADD IT ALL UP was allowed to settle three wide through early stages, roused five wide into the lane, rallied along the outside, dug in gamely and edged
away late. IVY ABAD GIRL tracked the top duo entering the turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, dug in gamely, took a slim lead then got
outkicked by the winner in final stages. CENTERFOLD vied outside of rival entering the turn, continued to battle for the lead a furlong out then ultimately
gave way. BARBED WIRE was unhurried through the early going, saved ground along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and lacked a
needed rally. SHELBY TO was not too far back in leaving the backstretch, swung four wide into the lane and never threatened. REMITTANCE SENT dueled
inside of CENTERFOLD up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then tired in the lane.

gained the lead at the head of the lane, stayed on gamely and held firm. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED vied for the lead in early stages, lost command when the
winner took command along the rail turning for home, lost the lead but never gave up and ran on. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE tracked in contention then flattened
around the turn, hustled along two wide into the stretch run and gathered a share. GINGER RULES was unhurried in the back, cut the corner entering the
lane and lacked a rally. TAKE ME UP BRADY raced up close two to three wide in early stages, continued in contention around the turn then tired in the

RAINBOW SUREBET dueled for the lead shortly after the start, battled on with OPALINE around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, sustained response
under a drive and held clear. JERI DAWN was allowed to settle off the early pace, given cue near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into the lane,
rallied along the outside and gained determinedly on the winner. OPALINE broke out at the start then quickly became engaged for the lead, battled for
command with RAINBOW SUREBET around the turn, could not match strides with in upper stretch but ran on and held a share. GO GO GO raced near
midpack in the early going, hustled up three wide around the turn, angled in a path in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick for impact. LITTLE MORE
LOVE raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted two wide for the drive and failed to rally. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE showed response in
early stages then gave way.

Footnotes
SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR set a pressured pace through the backstretch, edged ahead to a clearer lead around the far turn, continued to lead the way in
the final furlong, got confronted by IMPECCABILITY in final stages, fought back gamely and prevailed. IMPECCABILITY was reserved racing in the back,
continued well off the pace around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, advanced into contention then switched to the outside of the leader, reached
equal terms in final strides, dug in and just missed. RUNNINGFORCASH pressed the pace along the outside through early stages, continued in pursuit of
the leader around the far turn, was no late match for the top pair but finished well clear for a share. RUDIANO rated off the early pace, hustled along four
wide around the far turn, stayed in the same path into the lane and lacked a rally. UXMAL pressed the pace up the backstretch, began to flatten around the
far turn then faded through the lane. GRAPHENE CASSOCK raced in range tracking the early leaders, failed to advance under pressure around the final
turn and retreated in the lane. PRINCE OF EARL raced three to four wide and had no response.

UNCASHED raced on top under some pressure in opening stages then edged away to a clear advantage, continued on top still unasked around the turn,
saved ground entering the lane, was ridden out briefly in the upper stretch then settled in hand and geared down late. OCEAN OF STORMS was allowed to
settle off the early pace, hustled up three to four wide entering the lane, was no match for the pulling away winner but produced a solid finish. KYANDI sat
off the pace in early stages, swung four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest for a share. ARIZONA ANDREW was forwardly
placed up the backstretch, began to flatten out around the turn and faded in the lane. CALL ME ICE MAN was forwardly placed while the closest pursuer of
the early leader, sustained bid for the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive.

WOBBERJOD dueled inside of a duo up the backstretch and around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and shook free on top, continued with
response under firm handling and held clear. MEGATAP dueled between rivals in the opening quarter and continued to battle around the turn, could not
match strides with the winner at the head of the lane but stayed on with good response and finished second best. UNCAPTURED SKY raced in the second
slight entering the turn, launched a three wide bid in upper stretch, shifted out wider in the final furlong and finished with response. SISAWAY NOW tracked
the embattled trio leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, angled two wide for the drive and evened out. PENETRATOR steadied sharply in
the opening quarter and dropped back, saved ground around the turn, made a brief move up the inside in upper stretch then flattened out. MAHOMES raced
in the second flight entering the turn, was ridden along three to four wide going by the quarter pole, drifted five wide into the lane and gave way. COWBOY
CASANOVA dueled three deep for the lead in the opening quarter, battled on around the turn then tired in the lane.
