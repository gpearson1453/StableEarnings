Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT controlled the pace along the inside, showed the way around the far turn and into the stretch, responded well when put to right then
left handed urging in the lane and stayed clear to the wire. COALINGA ROAD stalked the leader from inside through both turns, roused at the quarter pole,
moved off the rail and put to right handed urging in the lane but had to settle for second best. CARMELITA'S MAN took a bump from inner rival at the start,
angled to the inside early while trailing, inched closer two then three wide around the far turn, moved out in the lane and was along for the show. BANG
FOR YOUR BUCK bobbled and bumped outer rival leaving the gate, pulled early and went three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, chased two wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. NONE ABOVE THE LAW raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, continued to give chase in the two path through
the far turn and into the stretch and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TIZZ A GOOD THING bobbled slightly but still came away quickest, chased the top pair outside a rival into the turn, roused three wide around the bend,
challenged between foes in deep stretch and won the bob at the wire. CALIFORNIA TIGER chased two wide into the turn, steadied early off heels early on
the bend, waited for room past the quarter pole, shifted to the inside and launched a bid up the fence inside outer trio, took a brief lead approaching the wire
but lost the bob to the winner. MR. DISRESPECTFUL dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away inner foe leaving the
bend, battled with GYPSY TEARS before vying between rivals late and yielded grudgingly. GYPSY TEARS was off slow to begin, chased off the rail at the
back, went three wide into the turn then drifted to the four path before being corrected early on the turn, rallied four deep into the stretch, dueled with MR.
DISRESPECTFUL into the final furlong, then vied four deep late and was outkicked. EL REY DORADO broke a step slow, chased under coaxing off the
pace early, raced along the rail then tipped three wide around the bend, churned on through the lane but failed to threaten. GRAND TIGER stumbled leaving
the gate, went up to duel from inside, fought to the quarter pole before losing contact with the leaders into the lane and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BIG BET JAFINSAFA was off slow in the beginning, trailed near the inside, moved closer in the middle stages, closed in three to four wide around the turn,
came five wide into the stretch, drew alongside SHIP AND SCAM and took over past the eighth pole and maintained a short margin over that rival to the
wire. SHIP AND SCAM traveled two wide off the pace early, moved into range up the backstretch, angled out and launched a bid four wide leaving the far
turn, took over in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner past the eighth pole but stayed on gamely to the wire. CAROL'S COMIC was prominent early
three deep into the first turn then chased three wide around the bend, inched closer up the backstretch before launching a bid two wide into the far turn,
dueled into the stretch, could not keep up into the final furlong, flattened in the late stages but managed to hold third. AUSTONIAN hustled from the gate
and went up to vie for the lead with rivals into the first turn, kicked clear around the bend, pressured on the far turn and dueled into the lane, relinquished the
lead at the top of the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WHISKEY VISION stumbled leaving the gate, moved to the rail while off the pace, went two
wide into the far turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. THE BIG CHEESEOLA chased four deep into the first turn then
remained outside rivals in the four path around the bend, rounded the far turn three then two wide and weakened in the lane. RIGHT TURN brushed the
gate, raced up close then chased two wide around the first turn, dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM controlled the pace from inside, pressured by BIG SWITCH at the three-eighths pole, turned away that rival midway around the
bend, put to right handed urging entering the final furlong while still clear, drifted out while challenged by ROSE MADDOX in the final sixteenth and held
gamely. ROSE MADDOX stalked the pacesetter from the rail through both turns, tipped out entering the stretch, drew alongside the winner in deep stretch
but could not get by. SHOCKING GREY settled inside, swung approaching the stretch and came four wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and gained
the show. BIG SWITCH was closet in the two path early, bid outside the winner at the three-eighths pole, failed to sustain the challenge past the
five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the lane and flattened. WARRENS CANDY GIRL was moving around just before the gates opened and came
away a step slow, traveled outside a rival in the two path at the back in the early going, chased two to three wide on the far turn, found the rail in the lane
and could not rally. TAMING THE TIGRESS lifted then stumbled in the beginning, became rank when taken hold of early and continued to fight the rider on
clubhouse turn, raced in range two wide into the second bend, got floated five wide entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CEILING CRUSHER cleared early and was guided to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch under pressure from CHISMOSA, maintained command
into the far turn, shook free past the five-sixteenths pole, opened up when asked left-handed in upper stretch, widened through the final furlong and coasted
in late. TOM'S REGRET stumbled slightly at the start but still came away with the field, stalked along the rail then bumped CHISMOSA on the first turn,
moved off the rail around the bend then dropped back off the pace, driven two wide into the lane and rallied to edge CHISMOSA for the place. CHISMOSA
got bumped by TOM'S REGRET stalked in the two path on the first turn then drew alongside CEILING CRUSHER around the bend, pressed up the
backstretch and into the far turn, failed to kick on with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, flattened in the final furlong and lost second. CAROLE
LOMBARD chased two wide at the back early, saved ground through the far turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
GOLDEN MICROPHONE vied three deep early then dueled outside SQUARE FUN into and around the turn, cleared while drifting out in upper stretch and
held safely while drifting in late. MAGIC GAME was off slow and bumped with outer rival, tracked along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, tipped out
and bumped with rival in upper stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong and proved second best. STRANGE ADDICTION was off slow in the
beginning, made progress from inside early then pulled between from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths pole, chased a bit off the rail or
between rivals on the turn then inside into the lane, moved out in the stretch and gained the show. RUFF RIDE sat off the pace, saved ground on the rail
through the turn, moved out in upper stretch then angled out further in the final sixteenth and earned a minor award. SQUARE FUN vied for the lead
between rivals then dueled along the rail into and around the turn, fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. SIT LOOK AND HOPE
broke a step slow, went up to vie for the lead from inside then ceded command to the top pair, chased along the rail then two wide into the drive, shifted in to
bump inner rival in upper stretch and weakened after. BENSTER was off slow and bumped at the start, traveled in mid-pack off the rail, went three deep
around the turn and lacked a rally. HEAVENLY KISSES bobbled twice leaving the gate, trailed off the rail up the backstretch, went two then three wide on
the turn and was never a factor. MI JITANA tracked outside a rival into the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and faded.

BUS BUZZ dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead early on the turn before clearing at the quarter pole, then drew off when asked right-handed.
ROOKIE MISTAKE stalked the top pair up the backstretch, chased three then four wide around the bend, finished willingly through the lane but could not
threaten the winner. SEATTLE BREAKOUT chased inside a pair of rivals while off the rail at the back, started to climb at the half-mile pole and dropped
back to last, angled to the inside for the turn, steered out with a furlong remaining and gained the show. SMUGGLER'S RUN chased between rivals at the
back early, four to five wide around the turn and failed to menace. EL DIABLO ROJO chased three deep off the pace, went four wide into the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and was not a factor. TAPATIO LEO showed early speed then dueled outside BUS BUZZ, fought to the five-sixteenths then could not
keep up approaching the quarter pole and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
OLD PAL broke a step slow, settled inside near the back, lightly coaxed around the far turn while continued to save ground, rallied inside rivals midstretch
and proved best late. CLOUSEAU set the pace along the inside, met the bid from TOM AND JAZZY on the far turn, dueled into the lane, moved clear again
in upper stretch, challenged from both sides entering the final sixteenth and got outkicked by the winner. BOSS SULLY stalked inside early then became
rank before settling down before crossing the finish line for the first time, chased the top pair along the rail then two wide on the far turn, tipped out into the
lane, bid three deep nearing the sixteenth pole and got outkicked by the top pair. BE PUNCTUAL broke slow and came out in the beginning, pulled to a
forward position then tracked in the two path early, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, entered the stretch four wide and lacked a late bid.
UPWARD MOBILITY was reserved outside a rival or in the two path, spun three wide into the lane, angled out in the drive and failed to threaten. TOM AND
JAZZY was closest in pursuit two wide early, drew alongside the leader on the far turn, dueled into the lane, could not kick outside the eighth pole, lost his
path midstretch and weakened. HACKING IT UP broke well then dropped back early, raced three deep into the clubhouse turn then angled over to the rail,
tipped two wide leaving the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON tracked out of range off the inside, closed in around the turn and range up three deep past the quarter pole, took over into the lane,
kicked clear under light coaxing and padded the margin without ever being asked for his best. TIGRE DI SLUGO chased at the back on the inside into the
turn, moved off the rail around the bend and came three wide into the lane, failed to make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly
second best. BRICKYARD RIDE chased early then went up to duel inside SUNRISE JOURNEY for the lead, fought along the rail through the turn, could not
keep pace with the winner at the top of the lane, faded out of contention but managed to edge SUNRISE JOURY for the show honors. SUNRISE JOURNEY
stepped the front early then dueled outside of BRICKYARD RIDE, vied between rivals leaving the turn, was no match for THE CHOSEN VRON in upper
stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was edged for third.

Footnotes
TROPICAL TERROR unhurried in the beginning and steered to the two path, traveled outside a rival into the far turn, moved out around the bend and
angled five wide into the stretch, rallied widest in the lane and got up late. WORSE READ SANCHEZ settled along the rail, advanced from inside through
the far turn and was closest in pursuit approaching the top of the stretch, tipped two wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader past the eighth pole, took
over with a sixteenth to go but was run down by the winner late. MOBOU was reserved in the early going racing outside a rival into the first turn, had to
steady when WORKDAY moved inward at the three-quarter pole, chased three wide into the far turn, moved out to exit that bend five wide, rallied between
foes in the lane and almost got up for second. FORGIVING SPIRIT bobbled and took a bump from outside at the start, showed speed three deep before
clearing and angling over to the inside prior to the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace in-hand, showed the way through the far turn and into the stretch, led
clear to the eighth pole, challenged after crossing that marker, relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the place and show.
SHORTMAN was off slow and lost his path at the start, trailed three wide into the first turn then angled inside a rival to find the rail around the bend,
continued at the back into the far turn, advanced while saving ground around the bend, drew closer to take aim into the final furlong but lacked room at the
sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. ATOMIC DROP stalked from inside, angled three then four wide on the far turn but flattened in the late
stages. WORKDAY broke in and bumped rival, tracked three wide into the first turn then shifted into the two path, got blocked behind a rival on the far turn,
angled out and came four wide into the drive and weakened. STAY IN THE GAME pulled early while up close between rival then stalked in the two path,
was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, started to weaken and lose positions between rivals at the quarter pole and faded down the lane.
