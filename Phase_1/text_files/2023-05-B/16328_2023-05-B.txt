Footnotes
GUANA CAY bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked from the two path, aimed between the top pair around the far turn, bid two wide entering the
lane, struck the front in the five path approaching midstretch and edged away. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE stuttered a stride at the start, trailed early on, gained in
the four path around the far turn to take aim turning for home, but only managed to chase the bidding GUANA CAY through the final furlong and gained
place late. MUSIC AMORE bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed nearing midstretch and gave way late.
HASHTAG WINNER laid off of the pace in the three to five path and made little impact. KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked in the three path, but weakened
between horses turning for home, went wrong in upper stretch, was pulled up passing the three sixteenths pole and vanned off.

Footnotes
BALI DREAMIN dueled for the lead inside of MAGNA MASSA, drew clear of that foe turning for home, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but
tired in the final furlong while hanging on her left lead yet lasted safely. MAGNA MASSA dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but failed to
keep pace turning for home, yet kept on in the final furlong to offer a bid as the leader tired, but did not have enough to reel her in. BALL GOWN broke on
top, but stumbled soon after the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, and stayed on to gain show from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. SOCIAL
MANDATE tracked in the four path, but drifted to the eight path nearing the lane, yet ran on thereafter. SHIP IT stalked in the three path, but lacked the
needed kick in upper stretch before giving way in the final furlong. MONOCACY never got involved from the two path. PUGLIA trailed around the turn and
got outrun. COEXIST lacked speed in the three path, then was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
EASY RED broke slowly and laid far back early on, advanced in the five path around the turn, sustained a charge in the seven path while hanging on her left
lead and requiring correction from lugging inwardly, changed over once within striking range in the final sixteenth, surged surged late to narrowly prevail at
the wire. LUXURIATE broke inwardly, pressed two wide into the turn, chased the clear leader from the five path in upper stretch, bid as that one faltered
entering the final furlong, drove clear soon after but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. LIAM'S MESSAGE leaned outwardly at the start, pursued
from midpack in the four path, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for minor placings entering the final sixteenth along with an outer rival,
but was outkicked by that one and gained show at the wire. LOU ANNA lost position at the half mile pole after being green between horses, settled far back
along the inside, rallied up the fence to vie for place entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked and got nailed at the wire for show. LUCKY LESSON laid
off of the pace in the three path and stayed on between horses. ANORIA was hesitant to load, tracked inside of rivals while a bit off of the rail, then gave
way three wide and between horses in midstretch. WRECK IT RUBY stalked three wide, spun into the lane in the five path, but faded between horses in
upper stretch. PRINCESS MITOLE shied from an outer rival at the start, rushed forward to set the pace along the inside, drew clear while entering the lane
in the three path, but weakened in midstretch, got headed at the furlong grounds and readily stopped. NOSHUGFORPOP took light contact from an inner
rival at the start, trailed in the four path, then altered course outwardly at the sixteenth pole while outrun.

FIFTY CENT DOLLARS set the pace, met a pair of outer challenges around the far turn, got headed by his most immediate rival entering the lane, yet
regained the advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear. JUST CALL RAY stalked in the two path, bid along with an outer rival around the far turn,
led narrowly entering the lane, but relinquished the lead once again to the early-pace setter passing the furlong pole and was second best. BEAR OAK
trailed, ranged up outside of the other pair in hopes of bidding around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
QUARIA COMET broke a step slow, laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, tipped five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong
grounds and drove clear. HAPPY SOUL stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, spun into the lane four wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival while
attempting a bid in midstretch, then kept on to gain place in the final sixteenth. BOUT TIME tracked in the two path, but encountered traffic in the three path
in upper stretch, remained hemmed in before tipping out entering the final sixteenth, and reached show from between horses in the shadow of the wire.
NOTA BENE lacked speed four wide, fanned six wide entering the lane, and stayed on through the final furlong but missed reaching show. LOVE AND
MONEY pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led in upper stretch, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and faded. SOUPER
MUNNINGS saved ground in midpack around the turn, but retreated to the rear entering the lane, encountered traffic in upper stretch and failed to menace.
SHARP HERO was away a bit slow,, trailed two wide, but was blocked behind rivals through upper stretch, steadied hard entering midstretch, then altered
course outwardly but failed to make an impact. GET THE CANDY broke on top and crossed over early on, set the pace along the inside, but was headed by
an outer vying rival in upper stretch and faded through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ROYAL TAKE CHARGE stalked along the inside, tipped three wide entering the backstretch, bid entering the far turn, assumed command nearing the lane,
drew off thereafter and was kept to task through the final furlong. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) stalked two wide, bid along with an outer rival into the far turn, but
proved no match for that one nearing the lane and staved off an outer bidder for place late. MUSIC STREET trailed, improved along the rail around the far
turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place in the final sixteenth but was denied that position. MAMBO KITTEN laid off of the
pace along the inside, came under urging in the three path around the far turn, got floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to factor. JUMP INTO
THE FIRE set the pace along the inside, was reined in entering the backstretch, got headed by a pair of outer bidders at the three furlong pole and
weakened through the lane. LISETTE pursued the top flight from the three path and faded in the four path around the far turn.

Footnotes
HER LADYSHIP set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by an outer pair entering the far turn, stalked around that bend, rebid inside of the
leader in upper stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds and held from an outer bidder late. FOREVER AFTER ALL took a bump from an inner
rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path while inside of rivals around the first turn, took closer order along the fence leaving the five furlong
pole, tracked while buried and awaiting racing room around the far turn, but was shuffled back nearing the lane, sustained chasing stride entering it, altered
course three wide for clear sailing at the furlong grounds, but did not have enough to reel in the leader late. INSENSITIVE prompted outside of the pace
setter and from the three path, led as an outer rival pressed around the far turn, but was headed by the re-bidding early-pace setter in upper stretch, chased
that foe along with an outer rival into the final furlong, but lost place late. LADY SAMARITAN broke a step slow, tracked two wide and between horses, then
three wide around the far turn, but only managed to chase the leading group home while lacking a bid. CORSINI broke a step slow, laid off of the pace while
hung in the five path, ranged up outside of rivals around the far turn, but shifted ground inwardly in upper stretch and flattened out. DOMINA tracked along
the inside, vacated the rail down the backstretch, pursued two wide and between horses into the far turn, but gave way. TOFFEE stumbled and bumped an
outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, pressed the leader around the far turn, but yielded nearing the lane, then
steadied when put to crowded quarters in upper stretch and weakened. LUCKY ANA bobbled slightly upon leaving the gates, raced at the rear in the four
path and between horses around the first turn, checked back nearing the backstretch, then trailed and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
THREE TECHNIQUE tracked four wide into the turn, ranged up turning for home, took aim while floated to the five path entering the lane, bid in upper
stretch sparking a duel, then sparred through the final furlong and prevailed. KUPUNA bobbled a bit at the start, vied two wide, pressed before gaining an
advantage at the three furlong pole, shifted to the four path while meeting an outer challenge entering the lane, dueled gamely with that foe through the final
furlong, but was bested. BRITAIN'S KITTEN laid off of the pace in the three path and ran on to gain show late. MAJOR FED tracked behind the leaders and
from the two path, but only managed to chase the embattled leading pair through upper stretch before losing show in the final sixteenth. SANTOS DUMONT
set the pace inside of an outer presser, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole and weakened entering the lane. NATIVE THUNDER tracked in the
three path, chased between horses around the turn and weakened at the quarter pole. PERFECT FLIGHT trailed in the five path and never got involved.

Footnotes
JERSEY PEARL stalked three wide, then two wide turning for home, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, sustained stride to bid in the final
sixteenth as that one tired and edged ahead late. ALVA STARR set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer rival in upper stretch, but met that foe's
challenge late and gave in. ERVADEAN bobbled a bit at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, chased three wide turning for home, then gained
show at the furlong grounds and was best of the rest. CHARRIERE tracked along the inside, but only managed to chase into midstretch before fading.
ZAPPLE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to menace while missing fourth. TAMMY TAP TAP TAP bobbled before veering
outwardly at the start, tracked four wide, but faded through the lane. FOGO ISLAND trailed in the four path and failed to factor. BOBBIE SOX pressed two
wide and between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
MISS YEARWOOD settled far back two wide, gained five wide around the far turn, sustained a rally to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled leaving that station
and edged ahead in the final sixteenth. LOVELY PRINCESS tracked in the three to two paths, ranged up three wide around the far turn to bid entering the
lane, led in upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, but was bested. SPARKLE BLUE bumped with an inner rival before
being jostled between horses at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, fanned six wide in upper stretch and rallied for a minor share. TALBEYAH
(IRE) bumped with an outer rival at the start, rated far back in the two path, but was blocked in upper stretch before steadying behind a faltering foe at the
three sixteenths pole, then surged between horses to gain a minor placing late. UNDER ONE SKY pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked behind
the leaders from the two path around the far turn, but only managed to chase between horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. VIBURNUM shifted
inwardly at the start, tracked in the four to three path, pursued four wide around the far turn while inching closer, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper
stretch and chased from there. QUALITY STAR saved ground off of the pace, vacated the rail in midstretch and ran on mildly. LADY ARSINOE trailed,
swung outwardly entering the lane and surpassed tiring rivals. I'M SO SORRY pursued from midpack two to three wide, shifted four wide entering the lane
and failed to factor. EXIT SOUL sped clear entering the first turn, vied with an outer rival down the backstretch, but weakened in upper stretch. IMPLOSION
broke a step slow before bumping an inner rival at the start, then lacked speed in the four path and was done early. SINFILTRE stalked two wide, vied down
the backstretch, but weakened between horses entering the lane and was bumped by a trailing rival while faltering in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MULLIKIN set the pace in the two path, then cruised away under firm wraps. CUSP stalked in the three path, sparred with an inner rival for place while no
match for the leader and edged that position a sixteenth from home. SPACE chased along the inside, dueled for place through midstretch, but yielded
entering the final sixteenth. PILOTE COMETE bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, lacked speed in the three path, rallied between horses entering the
lane, but leveled off after bumping with an outer rival at the furlong grounds. PADDINGTON gained five wide around the turn, but shifted inwardly while
flattening out in upper stretch before bumping with an inner rival at the furlong pole. TESTIMONY TIME chased in the four path, but faded once put to tight
quarters between horses in upper stretch. MAFIA took a solid bump from an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace while hung six wide around the turn
and made little impact. DE LA CALLES hopped while off a step slow, trailed and failed to factor. BAYOU SPIRIT was keen to place whilst midpack in the two
path and weakened.
