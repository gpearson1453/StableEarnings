Footnotes
RIVER IN EGYPT bobbled slightly upon leaving the gates, tracked along the inside, saved ground in pursuit of the leaders around the far turn, offered a rail
bid approaching midstretch, led in the final furlong and edged away. REGIMENTAL broke half a beat slow, trailed while keen just off of the inside into the
first turn, tugged closer while between horses in the three path down the backstretch, tracked in the four path around the far turn, took aim outside of the
leaders entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rail bidder in the final furlong. DIVINING STONE vied along the inside into the first
turn before switching course outside of his outer counterpart around the first turn, pressed in the three path down the backstretch, gained an advantage at
the half mile pole, led in the two path around the far turn as an outer rival sustained pressure, but was outkicked by a bidder on either side in midstretch,
gave way in the final furlong, yet held show. REPREHEND broke a step slow and was last away, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path
around the first turn, bid outside of the new leader and from the three path around the far turn, vied turning for home, but yielded between horses in upper
stretch. CRONUS raced at the rear in the four path, but failed to respond to urging in the five path around the far turn and played no factor. BON BUENO set
the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer rival at the half mile pole, faltered between horses entering the far turn, then was jogged home while
distanced before walking off.

Footnotes
GO OTTO GO leaned in slightly at the start before bobbling half a stride soon after, engaged the early leader from the outside approaching the turn, gained
an advantage entering it, inched clear while well in hand leaving the five sixteenths marker, drew off with good energy when let out in upper stretch, then
was put to wraps with the deal sealed in the final sixteenth. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased the pace setters from
the three path around the turn, ranged up turning for home, but quickly failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, yet remained clear of show
through the final furlong. LIBERAL ARTS broke a step slow while last away, trailed in the two path, split rivals while launching a rally in the five path in
midstretch, and sustained a charge while shifting inwardly to gain show from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. FIFTH AVENUE hopped and bumped the
inner half of the gate at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths gained show at the furlong grounds, but lost that position to an inner rival in
the closing stages. BERNIN HOT was a bit fractious loading, then propped at the start, lacked speed in the five to four path into the turn, then made little
impact in the six path through the final furlong. SUGA STEVE broke through the starting gate pre-race, jogged for a quarter mile before reloading without
further incident, broke sharply and cleared early on, met an outer challenge approaching the turn, got headed entering it, sustained inside pressure before
giving way at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the final furlong. CASSIUS bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked behind the leading
pair from the two path, spun for home between horses, then faded through the final furlong. TECHNE balked loading, then became fractious in the starting
gate, lacked speed in the four path, and was outrun turning for home.

Footnotes
LUNA MOTH vied along the inside into the first turn, backed off around that bend, chased entering the backstretch, took aim three wide entering the lane,
ranged up to bid in midstretch, and edged clear. WINDY BAY set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook clear of her in
upper stretch, but failed to resist LUNA MOTH's challenge at the furlong grounds before remaining clear of the rest. EAST SHORE broke through the gate
pre-race, stalked forwardly in the three path, vied outside of the leader around the far turn, but gave way to that rival and an outer bidder in upper stretch.
PRANA steadied while briefly rank behind foes entering the first turn, settled into stride to track two wide, chased the leading pair from the four path around
the far turn, failed to match bidding strides with an inner rival nearing the lane, and failed to menace thereafter. INDY AGAIN checked slightly behind a rank
rival entering the first turn, then failed to factor from the three path. BYZANTINE broke a step slow before taking back between horses at the start, but was
outrun along the inside thereafter.

Footnotes
SPRINKLEHEAD shifted inwardly upon leaving the gates, set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer pressure approaching the five sixteenths
pole, then drew further away through the lane under driving urging. PAID IN FULL pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace with
that one while pulling away from the rest turning for home, and was second best. BEOCCA took a bump from an inner rival before steadying out of crowded
quarters in the opening stages, laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced to show outside of a pair of rivals approaching the five sixteenths pole, and
was best of the rest. RONITHELIMODRIVER broke a step slow, lagged behind the rest in the three path early on, advanced past tiring rivals in the four to
five paths around the far turn to gain a minor placing entering the lane, and failed to threaten thereafter. WRITEITONTHEICE was bumped by an outer foe
into an inner rival before being pinched between horses soon after the start, and made little impact from the two path. OUT OF ALCATRAZ transferred
contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the two to three path, but faded around the far turn. UNSTOPPABLE ME
bumped an outer rival at the start, got rank behind foes entering the first turn, settled into tracking stride around that bend, then weakened under urging
around the far turn. SHAZIER was herded into an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path, but weakened in the two path around the far turn.

Footnotes
GALLANT GUY set the pace a bit off of the inner railing, maintained a loose margin down the backstretch, met an outer challenge from MARKET
ANALYSIS entering the lane, sparred gamely while clinging to an advantage through midstretch, and held firm. MARKET ANALYSIS stalked two wide, bid
entering the lane, dueled through midstretch, but was turned away late. WHISPER NOT (GB) got rank passing the wire for the first time, pulled along the
inside while behind the leaders before settling into stalking stride approaching the backstretch, pursued comfortably from the pocket around the far turn, but
lacked a rail seam inside of the leading pair in upper stretch, altered course outside of them approaching midstretch, but lacked progress in the final furlong
and only managed to chase them home. EASY TIME tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, but
lacked a bid. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK laid off of the pace in the two path, moved up in the four to five path entering the lane, but leveled off. FLAGS UP
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LEGAL ATTACK (GB) trailed along the inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick
while put to tight quarters between horses nearing midstretch. EDITORIAL COMMENT (ARG) tugged subtly while reigned in to allow an outer pair to go
forward passing the wire for the first time, tracked in midpack three wide, but faded between horses nearing the lane.

Footnotes
UPSTRIKER set the pace along the inside, inched clear from chasing rivals in upper stretch and held sway from an outer pursuer late. JUNIOR BUG trailed,
gained five wide while circling inner rivals turning for home, sustained his grinding charge while slowing closing in on the clear leader in the final furlong,
attempted a late bid, but was kept at bay. TETSU lacked speed in the two path, spun into the lane four wide and ran on between horses. DOUBLY
BLESSED pursued from behind the main group into the turn, gained four wide and along with an outer rival turning for home to enter the lane within striking
range of the leader, but failed to keep pace while flattening out in upper stretch, then got outkicked for place by his outer counterpart at the furlong grounds
and tired. TEST PILOT stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane, but faded through the final furlong. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT was last away,
tracked three wide and outside of rivals, but was outmoved by outer rivals while giving way enteringthe lane. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS chased while forward
two wide and between horses, but faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
NON VIOLENCE tracked in the three path, gained place while ranging closer in the four path turning for home, sustained a bid for the lead approaching
midstretch, struck the front leaving the furlong grounds, and drove clear. CANCEL THIS bobbled outwardly a bit upon leaving the starting gates, tugged
clear early on, showed the way in the two path around the bend, met an outer challenge in upper stretch, got headed by that one at the furlong grounds, and
remained well clear of place. DAWNY laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and ran on to gain show late. FINE
COTTON pursued from midpack along the inside, gained show from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, but was caught by an outer rival approaching
the wire. CODE FOR SUCCESS nudged the inner half of the gate while off awkwardly and a step slow, trailed in the three path, altered course outwardly to
the seven path at the three sixteenths pole, and moved up in the final furlong. BEAUXS ARTES bobbled slightly leaving the gates while off a step slow,
chased the clear leader from the two path, got outmoved for place turning for home, and weakened between horses through the lane. THREE TIPSY CHIX
lacked speed in the four to five path, and faded once floated to the seven path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WAR CAMPAIGN stalked while traveling well in the bit along the inside, loomed a danger behind the leaders around the far turn, offered a rail bid entering
the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway safely thereafter. CREATIVE MINISTER settled off of the pace in the three path, tracked the top flight
from the four path around the far turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes in the final furlong, and gained place in the late stages.
COOKE CREEK set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the inner rail, got headed by a rail bidder entering the lane, maintained place while
in pursuit of that one into deep stretch, but was outfinished by an outer rival late. SEARCH ENGINE pressed outside of the leader while kept in the three
path by that foe, vied around the far turn, then between horses entering the lane, but yielded leaving the furlong grounds. COMMANDPERFORMANCE
tracked in the four path, pressed under urging around the far turn, but gave way between horses at the furlong pole. TRIDENT HIT laid off of the pace along
the inside, pursued in the two to three path while between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. TRAFALGAR pursued from midpack in the two
path, tracked between horses around the far turn, but faded entering the lane. ICARUS broke slowly, trailed along the inside, moved out of last approaching
the far turn, but failed to threaten before weakening through the final furlong. TARTUFO lacked speed in the two to three path, but was shuffled back behind
rivals to trail the field entering the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but was outrun thereafter. GILDED AGE broke a step slow, lacked speed
in the three to four paths, and tired.
