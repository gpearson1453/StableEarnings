Footnotes
LIZZIES GIRL stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid from along the inside entering
the final turn, quickly overtook ANAAMY from along the rail entering the lane, and quickly drew off while being ridden out in the late stages. ANAAMY away
alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of SKY FACTOR entering the first turn, forced the pace from the outside of that rival in the run down the
backside, quickly took control entering the final turn, drifted off the rail leaving the turn and was quickly overtaken by LIZZIES GIRL, and was no match for
that foe late while proving clearly second best. VALERIE VALESKI away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, maintained her position into the final turn while racing three wide, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. DONE THAT
was off a step slow, and trailed the filed into the first turn while saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering the final
turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. SKY FACTOR broke sharply and vied for the lead from the inside of ANAAMY
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final
turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
JUST MISTY was off a step slow, and steadied briefly off heels, but recovered quickly and split rivals to duel for the lead from the outside of GROOVY GIRL
entering the first turn, assumed command entering the backstretch and controlled the pace through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late
while being kept to task. TEXAS HUMOR away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for the place. GROOVY GIRL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, dropped into a tracking trip while shifting off the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the drive and just failed to hold the place. ROSE OF TEXAS stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail,
continued three wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DANCING WITH LIL away well, and stalked the early
pace while racing three wide entering the backside, began to drop back midway to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

FINDING WAYS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. GOOD BYE PUTIN settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and continued gamely from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the
final strides. MR. QUALITY away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid two wide
entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to just miss the place. MORETHANSOULTITLE away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide while chasing the pacesetter into the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while
unable to hold his position. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER unhurried early and trailed the field into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a

PRETTY ARIA away alertly and raced to a narrow lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch,
rallied along the inside of pace rival LASTING LIGHT entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and held QUEEN OF ATTITUDE safely at
bay late to prevail. QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was off a step slow and trailed the compact field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, began to
advance from along the inside midway down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove
clearly second best. LASTING LIGHT broke sharply and pressed the leader two wide entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide into the
final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. KICK UP
THE DUST away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing along the inside, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. SILK STILETTOS stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the
rail, trailed the field into the final turn, and needed more when called upon.

ACCORDINGLY trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
steadily four wide in the drive to get up in the final strides. ROAD CLOSURE was off a step slow, and rushed up three wide entering the first turn while
chasing the dueling leaders, assumed command mid way down the backside, and held a clear advantage into the final turn, maintained his advantage into
the stretch, but tired late while unable to hold. WICKED NIGHT away well and was sent hard early to vie for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, dropped into a tracking trip midway down the backstretch and into the final turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished determinedly three wide in
the drive to just miss. GROOVIN' IS BAK broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide from between rivals approaching the wire. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT was fractious prior to the start, was away
alertly and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, was unable to match strides with his pace rival in the run to the final
turn, and had little to offer late.

PERFECT PENNY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed
determinedly four wide in deep stretch to get up in the closing strides. LILSISTERLEE broke sharply and raced to the lead while saving ground along the
inside entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable
to hold off PERFECT PENNY late, while proving clearly second best. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive to prove easily best of the rest.
OKANAGAN GOLD stalked the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two
wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late threat. HARBOUR STORM away alertly, and settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
while racing a bit rank into the first turn, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late. CLASSY LEGACY settled at the back of
the pack while racing three wide entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BACK SHACK away alertly and set a contested pace from just off the rail entering the backstretch, took control midway down the backside, increased his
advantage through the final turn, and widened that margin in the lane to prove best. KLIMTOGLORY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, was shuffled back midway down the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in
deep stretch to get up for the place. GREYTOGO broke sharply and tracking the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. Y VEE R away well and
pressed the pace five wide entering the first turn, continued four out from the rail in the run down the backside while prompting the pace, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive. LOGICAL AL settled well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the
backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the stretch drive. CAB SAV dueled for the lead
three wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, checked briefly when put in tight quarters midway down the backside, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to mount a late bid. BETTER TONE unhurried early while settling at the back of the field entering
the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and failed to make his presence felt late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. RIMFIRE
pressed the pace four wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, steadied when pinched between
rivals leaving the turn, and was unable to muster up a late response. Following the running of this race there were two jockey claims of foul. The rider of
RIMFIRE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of Y VEE R for alleged interference leaving the final turn, and the rider of CAB SAV lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of BACK SHACK for alleged interference midway down the backstretch. After review, both claims of foul were disallowed and no change
was made to the original order of finish.
