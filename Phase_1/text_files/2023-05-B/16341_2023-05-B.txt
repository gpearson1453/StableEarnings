MINDSHARE led along the inside, drifted out into the two and three path on the turn, continued clear into the lane and held safely. SHARP WARNING
stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three deep in the lane and outkicked rival for second. ELUSIVE
VIRTUE tracked pace two wide on the turn, continued two wide on the turn, battled for second in the lane and outkicked by outside rival. COJO stayed along
the rail throughout and failed to threaten. ROUGH RIDE pressed pace two wide on the backstretch, angled to rail when rival drifted out, launched bid along
the inside, took a bad step and pulled up in the final sixteenth, and was vanned off. POTENTE ALBA away cleanly, awkward step mid backstretch and was
eased.

even effort. ELDAAFIRST DARK bumped/in tight early. GALENANA came in/multiple bumps early. SR IACOCCA bumped/bothered start, steadied late.
STEWARDS INQUIRY, The Stewards conducted an inquiry following the running of the sixth race for a review of two incidents, both incidents involving the
#6 Galenana (Ruben Lozano- sixth) and #5 SR Iacocca (Henry Lopez, who finished seventh). The first incident took place at the start when #6 Galenana
broke in sharply and made contact with #5 SR Iacocca causing the latter to check and lose ground. The second incident taking place near the 1/16th pole of
the 300 yard event, when #6 Galenana veered out sharply in front of #5 Sr Iacocca forcing the latter to take up, lose momentum and the opportunity of a
better placing. The Stewards decided unanimously to disqualify #6 Galenana from sixth to seventh.
