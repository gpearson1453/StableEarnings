Footnotes
SMOKY TOPAZ in the second fight outside, began to advance on the leader second turn, reeled that rival in entering the stretch, gained the advantage,
clear late, lasted. PAYDAY TOO bothered slightly at the break, trailed well back for six furlongs, belated rally off the inside, getting to the winner late. DUKE
OF BLUE RIDGE broke in but alertly, cleared into the first turn while a bit slow to settle, continued to show the way onto the backstretch, extended that
advantage before a half, continued to hold a sizable advantage far turn, offered little resistance to the winner upper stretch, faltered when headed. MATH
MAN lacked early foot along with the winner, came on the outside for the drive, failed to muster a rally in passing only a single tiring rival. SCREENPLAY
chased the leader from along the inside, had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
SPECIAL OPERATOR brush at the start, raced back off the pace, ranged up four wide to challenge midway on the turn, floated out five wide into the
stretch, roused, closed with good resolve to be up in time. TEXAS TURBINE brushed at the start, in the second flight early off the inside, closer three wide
into the turn, vied between foes into the stretch, took over, clear inside the furlong marker, nailed in the final strides. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY behind the
early pace inside, continued behind horses early in the turn, steered out four wide late in the bend, lacked the needed closing punch to test the top two, well
clear of the others. BYATHREAD last to leave, lacked speed, waited midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane when clear. FREEWHEELER broke
out and on top, cleared to the inside, vied through the turn then faltered in the drive. JANET'S DEVIL broke through the gge and ran off a short distance,
reloaded, broke with the field, prompted the issue up the backstretch off the inside, bid between horses turn, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S HARVEST fractious prestart heading to the gate, broke well, soon clear, rated in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, plenty left through
the lane to maintain daylight to the wire. RED OCTOBER raced in mid pack off the inside, between horses far turn, came three wide for the drive, finished
willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late. NEPHI moved up to race closest to the winner first turn, continued to pursue that one the middle half, had
little for that rival in the drive, caught for the runner up spot. TACTICAL VISION went one paced throughout along the inside. STEP ON IT broke in the air,
raced well back off the pace, four wide into the lane when making a mild advance, lacked a closing kick. ASTERN BANKER settled off the pace and the
inside, also lacked a closing bid. SIMPLY WOW fell back to trail after the start and never menaced. G'S LAW in mid pack into the first turn, was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
MAGEEZ off a step slow, trailed for five furlongs, swung five wide out of the second turn when advanced, finished willingly to be up down the middle of the
strip. MUFFIN NUTS pressed the early leader from the outside, joined that one before a half, showed the way into the far turn, larger advantage into the
stretch, responded when challenged by the winner inside the furlong grounds, proved stubborn to the end. COACH KENNY within striking distance, tried the
runner up from the outside turning for home, failed to sustain that effort to the wire. NO PEDIGREE broke on top, early pace inside, dueled backstretch, fell
back, moved out, steadied late second turn, three wide into the lane, had little left. FREEDOMFI settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the
second turn, lacked a closing kick. COOL INDIVIDUAL was finished after four furlongs.

Footnotes
SHEZ OUR ARCH closest to the two leaders through the first turn and onto the backstretch, patiently handled into the far turn, asked along with some
encouragement soon after, came three wide for the drive, engaged the leader inside the furlong grounds, wore that rival down to edge clear late under
steady handling. RIPTIDE ROSE broke well from the outside, cleared to the rail early in the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, put that rival away to be
clear again upper straight, responded and gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late, held the place. ABSOLUTELY in mid pack, off the inside into the
lane, dropped to the rail, made a bid for the runner up spot but did not have enough. PLANTS AND BIRDS last away, lacked early foot, roused on the
outside turning for home, managed a mild rally to improve position. TOLATETOOWAIT went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response.
SARATOGA PASODOBLE moved out into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch in the two path, began to weaken final turn. RAISE THE PRAISE broke
back, trailed most of the way and never menaced. STAR FASHION broke back, was also not involved.

Footnotes
RYAN'S GRACE pressed the soft early pace, vied between foes up the backstretch, dueled into the lane, continued to alternate past the furlong marker, dug
in late to narrowly prevail in a game effort. THROUGH THE CRACKS vied four wide through the first turn, vied through the second, dueled outside the
winner the length of the stretch, narrowly missed. EASY ACT void of speed for five furlongs, began to move closer while four wide late in the second turn,
roused, shifted out widest soon after, rallied to be slowly getting to the top two late. AUNT JANA settled off the pace and the inside, closer second turn,
lacked a further meaningful bid down the lane. OVERLY SWEET fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag far turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while never a threat. SARATOGA KAREN away best of all, forwardly placed early through some soft fractions, began a steady fade before a half. ROSIE
SPRIT away in good order, set a soft early pace while a bit keen, vied up the backstretch then gave way readily in the second turn.

TOUCHDOWN JOE broke on top, showed the way into the first turn under a hold, set a soft set of fractions along the inside, continued to show the way into
the lane, drifted out, held late under firm handling. SCORING DRIVE behind the pace inside, came in the two path for the drive, closest to the winner with a
bid a sixteenth out, not enough for the winner late while edging clear for the place. MARTINIZED prompted the winner off the inside early, joined that one
after a half, dueled through the final turn and began to weaken into the stretch, narrowly lasted for the show. CHEERFOR MSHAWISH within striking
distance while three wide through the first turn, maintained contact with the leaders into the far bend, dropped inside, asked, one paced to the wire in lacking
a closing punch. BATTLE OF WILL forwardly placed early inside, fell back while continuing to save ground, lacked a response in the drive. SARAH'S
VISION broke in to bother inner rivals, lacked speed, three wide, improved slightly, never dangerous. HOLIDAY DIAMOND pushed in then was forced to
steady by SARAH'S VISION at the break, remained back in lacking a rally. YOUR TIME'S COMING also bothered at the break, checked up, trailed early as
a result, moved up to mid pack before a half, gave way into lane. HENNING four wide when with the main body first turn, continued outside, four wide into
the far bend, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY DREAMER within striking distance early outside, moved closer while four wide through the turn, lost ground to the leader well outside that one into
the lane, late surge to be up in the final strides. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE also within contact of the early leader, closer with the winner inside that one turn,
also lost ground to fall back off the leader upper stretch, late push to be up for the place at the wire between horses. LUMINOUS FLIGHT broke on top,
showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued to show the way turn, clear again when straightened for home, could not last while inside the top two
at the wire. COPPER MOON closest to the leader early, fell back inside, saved ground through the turn, continued inside and lacked a closing kick.
CINCY'S ANNA lacked speed early inside, moved out, came 4w into lane, made little impact in the run to the wire. DIXIE FARMER stumbled at the start,
recovered and was used to move up into a forward position, closest turn between foes, gave way in the stretch. BYE BYE BIG BABY last away, trailed
throughout to show little.

Footnotes
TALENTS HOT DEAL away in good order, quickly sprinted clear, held a daylight advantage through the turn when given a bit of a breather, enough left late
to withstand the runner up. SHOTGUN ANNIE fell back after the start, four wide into the lane, finished willingly late to be getting the winner late. CHARMING
KAT lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground turn, closer past midstretch, closed the gap a bit on the winner late while outkicked for the
second spot. MINT JULIUS lacked speed, three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, pinched back a furlong out, finished up evenly after recovering.
SEEMYVALENTINE broke alertly, chased the winner up the backstretch, weakened in the drive. MALLORY UNBRIDLED in the second flight outside, was
tiring nearing midstretch when she lugged in shutting off MINT JULIUS, continued to weaken to the wire. LA LOLA was finished early, trailed home.
