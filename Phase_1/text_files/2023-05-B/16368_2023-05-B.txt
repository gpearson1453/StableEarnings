along the inner rail through the stretch, took command under brisk urging in mid stretch then drew off. DON'T TELL DEREN stumbled at the break, was kept
in the three path entering the first turn, moved to the outside entering the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch,
advanced to mid stretch then weakened. ANATH stumbled at the break, chased the pace outside GRASS CUTTER to mid stretch and weakened. GRASS
CUTTER assumed the early lead, saved ground the far turn, drifted out turning for home and tired in mid stretch.

Footnotes
NIBBLES , bumped at the break, raced three deep prompting near the five eighths, moved to engage soon after, dueled around the final turn, wrested
command in upper stretch, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, drifted in and switched over to her left lead then was fully extended to prevail.
ISABELLA'S GLORY settled inside, was lightly steadied near the far turn, checked sharply approaching the quarter pole, regrouped to edge up towards the
rail in upper stretch, came out for the final furlong and closed gamely. HOT CHOICE settled off the pace, took closer order around the final turn, advanced
between runners leaving mid stretch and kept on willingly to the inside of foes approaching the wire. MISSAWLET saved ground while forwardly placed but
was very difficult to settle through the opening five sixteenths, lodged a rail bid after a half, rated off the leaders leaving the far turn, came out to range up in
mid stretch but flattened out late. WATER WITCH , under a snug hold early while off the inside, came six wide for the drive and closed steadily. BAD
TEMPER , three wide heading to the half mile marker, failed to respond. SHE'LL MAKE WAVES took over early, drifted out nearing the first turn, guided
back down to set the pace, was joined from both sides after a half, emerged in a duel to the inside of the winner around the final turn, stayed on to mid
stretch then weakened. FOX FORCE FIVE , bumped at the break, raced four wide stalking the early pace, drafted in some nearing the far turn, failed to kick
on past the five sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
CAN THE QUEEN , bumped at the break, took command soon after and set a rated but pressured pace in about the two path, edged clear around the turn
and was nicely handled on the front end, remained nursed to about mid stretch, responded to right handed asks through the final sixteenth and held firm.
WHISPURRING KITTEN prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, saw that one get away a bit around the turn, remained three wide with pursuit
into the stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch and stayed gamely to narrowly save the place. CAN'T BUY LOVE , four wide most of the trip, finished up
gamely and just missed second. HOLLYWOOD WALK drifted in slightly at the break and bumped with the winner, steadied briefly before recovering, rushed
up inside heading to the turn, stalked around the turn, remained inside chasing past mid stretch but came up empty late. COCONUT CAKE settled off the
pace and off the inside, came four to five wide for the drive but could only muster up a mild kick. FUHGEDDABOUDIT , two wide with pursuit, failed to kick
on in upper stretch and faded.

MY FLICKER prompted the pace in the two path between horses around the turn, sprinted clear in mid stretch and lasted. BRZINA chased the pace four
deep around the turn, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and slowly gained outside the winner to must miss. MIT MAZEL , carried out a bit at the break,
was five deep leaving the backstretch, moved to the inner rail mid way on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and passed tired horses.
PROPER ATTIRE hugged the inner rail, dueled to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. AWESOME VIEW , in the three path between horses around
the turn, prompted the pace and weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
BATTLEBUS drafted in towards the rail nearing the turn and rated just off the dueling leaders, tipped out entering the lane, closed determinedly under right
handed asks, drew alongside LUCCI in deep stretch and edged ahead in the final jumps. LUCCI took over between rivals after a furlong then secured the
rail into the turn, set a pressured pace under some rating, shook clear leaving mid stretch, wandered outward through the final sixteenth, battled valiantly
once collared and just missed. BOURBON AND ICE rated off the early pace while saving ground, angled seven wide for the drive and closed well.
FLASHINTHENIGHT broke slowly, raced two to three wide outside a rival mid turn, shifted five to six wide entering the lane, moved up past mid stretch but
was outfinished. LOVE YOU MUCH settled back off the pace while saving ground, worked outward for the final furlong and closed belatedly. I GOT A ROCK
disputed the pace outside LUCCI, stayed on well to about the sixteenth pole then weakened late. ZIGGY MON , three wide stalking the duel, was pushed
along four wide in upper stretch, remained a presence to about mid stretch then gave way. VALMONT rated in mid pack early while saving ground, was
under asking along the rail into the lane but came up empty. JIMMY THE KID rated two wide outside a rival into the turn, raced between runners nearing the
lane and faded. WICKED MAD broke a step slow, trailed three wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN , in range of the dueling leaders, edged up between rivals mid turn, shifted out four wide into the lane, closed in under left handed
asks, took over leaving mid stretch, got in a bit near the sixteenth pole, cleared late then was lasted over CHEERS FOR KITTEN. CHEERS FOR KITTEN
had speed inside rivals then rated back off the leaders nearing the turn, stalked inside mid turn, altered out for a clear run leaving mid stretch and finished
gamely. INSIDE STUNT dueled outside a rival, held a tenuous advantage in mid stretch, battled inside the winner nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way
grudgingly. CLASS WIZARD steadied at the break, settled inside, steadied again near the the the three eighths, moved off the rail around the turn, swung
out well wide past the three sixteenths and rallied. TOWN OF GOLD , two wide around the turn, worked outward in the lane and had belated action. ZEN
MASTER , off the pace while two wide, angled out in mid stretch but lacked a bid. SMITTEN ENOUGH dueled towards the rail, kept on past mid stretch,
steadied when in a bit close near the sixteenth pole and faded. E. P. MILTON broke a step slow, raced off the pace while four wide near the quarter pole,
swung out very wide and failed to deliver a serious kick. SHELLY ISLAND saved ground in mid pack, was pushed along mid turn and failed to respond.
BRION , three deep forcing the pace heading to the turn, drifted out some around the turn and faltered.
