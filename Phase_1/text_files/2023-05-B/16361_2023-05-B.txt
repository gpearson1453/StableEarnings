handling. TIZWOW stalked the early going three deep, raced three to four wide around the far turn and got up for the place position late. TEA WITH LEMON
was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, made a steady advance towards the leaders through the far turn while racing near the inside and
flattened out in the drive while racing two to three wide. SOVIET STANDARD dropped back early to race off the early pace, raced from the outside in the
stretch run, improved position but had not for the top trio. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN stalked the pace along the inside and faded. CHAD'S FLASH chased the
early going three deep from the outside of rivals and gave way in the drive.

ARCH FLYER tracked the early leader from the outside racing two deep, challenged for the lead nearing the eighth pole and finished well to get up under
strong encouragement racing four to three wide. MI CRESCENDO was off the early going, raced from the far outside in the stretch run and closed in well
late. COUGER raced along the inside around the far turn, was four wide between rivals in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. AUNT STELLA
was off slowly, chased the pace from the inside and raced evenly late. FOGGY KITTEN showed good early foot from the inside and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. RANK AND FILE was void of early speed, raced three to four wide and had no late rally. TAP N TWINE chased from the outside, raced five
wide through the upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SHARP AZ NAILS dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and proved best to get up under strong handling. TAHOE RUN dueled for the early
leader while racing near the rail and kept on gamely to the wire. GONE AGAIN stalked the early duel and kept on in the drive while racing three to four wide.
LARRY THE POET broke sharply to the inside, rushed a bit early from the inside, raced from the inside around the far turn and raced evenly late with no
closing run. SHARP STICK raced off the early pace, was four to five wide in the lane and showed late interest. MAMAS FIRE was off a step slow, raced
near the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the lane and had no late rally. ARMAVIR was unhurried early on, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. RUSSIAN STANDARD was off slowly, saved ground and never threatened.
