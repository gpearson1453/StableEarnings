Footnotes
MILTON STREET settled off the pace in the opening quarter, given cue to pick up the tempo entering the turn, roused forward into closer contention, dug in
three to four wide in upper stretch, gained command past the furlong marker and finished going away. TWIRLING CHIEF was well reserved racing in the
back through early stages, continued well off the pace around the turn, cut the corner and given cue entering the lane, responded willingly, roused forward
into close contention but could not move on with the winner. LURCH raced off the early pace, hustled up three to four wide around the turn, sustained a
steady bid down the lane and cleared the rest. JUST JOHNNY raced up close running through the backstretch, flattened out around the turn, dropped back
then passed a couple faders. PRAIRIE WOLF took over the lead midway up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, got collared by the winner past the
furlong marker and had nothing left in reserve. CATALE led the way to the mid-way point up the backstretch then conceded position to PRAIRIE WOLF,
remained forwardly placed around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
BILLY YANK raced three wide entering the first turn, rated off the top trio up the backstretch, loomed up boldly near the quarter pole, hustled along three
wide into the drive, took command approaching the eight pole, edged ahead and held late. SWEET DYNASTY was off a step slow and saved ground
around the first turn, was unhurried and allowed to settle in the back of the pack, picked up the tempo entering the far turn, circled up four wide near the
quarter pole, roused forward into slower contention, sustained a steady bid and was getting to the winner late. SKYLINE led the way around the first turn,
set the pace up the backstretch and continued to hold off challengers around the far turn, got collared by the eventual winner approaching the eighth pole
but ran on and finished well clear over the rest. BRILLIANT COLORS stalked the leader to the far turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch then
retreated. CALLE DE BOYD tracked the pace along the inside in early stages, cut the corner entering the lane, had no response and steadily faded.

SAVAGE was allowed to settle off the top flight in the opening quarter, let out a notch and quickly advanced to challenge for the lead midway around the
turn, given cue three wide in upper stretch, responded willingly and kicked clear. GRAND DESIGN tracked the inside, was a bit tight along the rail and had
to await a clear path around the turn, cut the corner and got clear at the head of the lane, roused forward to contend for the lead, failed to be a match when
the winner took over but stayed on and finished clearly second best. ESKENFORIT was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, got shuffled back a bit
nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, showed interest and closed for show. ASK FOR BODE raced in contention three to four wide,
moved up to challenge for the lead midway around the turn, dueled into upper stretch then weakened and got caught for show. MARQUEE THUNDER set
the pace up the backstretch, took on a duo of challengers midway around the turn, dueled into upper stretch then faded.

ASSET BASIS slightly steadied going around the first turn, taken in hand under slight restraint and rated just off the early leaders, let out a notch leaving the
backstretch, advanced to challenge for the lead midway around the turn, came under a drive three wide in upper stretch, briefly vied with rival at the eighth
pole then took command and kicked clear. CONTRABANDISTA tracked the pace in early stages, edged up closer along the rail near the half mile marker,
vied for the lead around the far turn, dug in gamely a furlong out then failed to kick on with the winner and had to settle for second best. SUPER CINDY held
a slim lead in early stages then dueled up the backstretch, continued to battled gamely into upper stretch then had nothing left in reserve past the furlong
marker. PIZZA CHARLIE pressed the pace in opening stages then dueled up the backstretch with SUPER CINDY, weakened entering the far turn, came out
wider for the drive and failed to threaten. HALLOW POINT raced in range through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn and failed to
move on. CODE ONE raced up close, dueled three wide around the far turn and tired in the drive.

ADDABABY broke sharply from the outside and cleared the lead then quickly came under pressure from inside running MY FIRING LINE, vied up the
backstretch then shook free and held clear around the turn, drifted out wide entering the lane, briefly came back under pressure from MY FIRING LINE then
shook off rival, cleared command and finished going away under confident handling. MY FIRING LINE applied pace pressure to ADDABABY up the
backstretch, could not match strides with rival entering the turn, stayed on with response, cut the corner turning for home, took advantage of ADDABABY
drifting wide entering the head of the lane, briefly moved back into contention for the lead but was no match when the winner angled back in a few paths and
kicked clear. SWEET STROLL raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and finished well clear over the rest. CAN'T MAKE ME was off a step
slow at the start and continued off the early pace, hustled along five wide into the lane and failed to make a late impact. FIREBAUGH saved ground through
early stages, hustled up into the lane and failed to move on. STREAKIN' EASY raced three to four wide off the pace and failed to move into contention.
FARRAH FOWLER showed response in early stages then came up empty and steadily retreated. MOLLY BYE O chased the top two leaders up the
backstretch, could not sustain bid around the turn and steadily faltered.
