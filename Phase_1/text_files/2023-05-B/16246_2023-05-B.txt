Footnotes
SIERRA HOTEL was well placed early while saving ground, tipped out to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, then went on even terms with the front
runner and then drew clear to prove best under mild urging to prove best. VITALE was bumped and forced wide into the first turn, then pressed the pace
four wide and made a three wide bid to take over leaving the half mile marker, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn and proved no match for that
rival, while staying on for the place award. DYNABLUE was bumped and checked into the first turn, then settled and tracked the pace, saved ground on the
far turn, then tipped off the rail in the lane and finished willingly to just miss the place award. IOYA AGAIN was void of early speed, came seven wide into
the lane and had a late rally. BAKENEKO was bumped after the start, rated two wide in traffic, then checked leaving by the quarter pole, then finished
evenly. MALIGATOR was settled five wide and came six wide into the lane and had no late kick. WHERE'D THE DAY GO chased the early pace five wide
and was four wide on the far turn and weakened. DRAMATIC KITTEN was off slowly and then bumped at the start, reserved early and lacked a rally. MOVE
ON OVER was reserved early and failed to menace. BOURBON DELIGHT got out into the first turn, then was corrected and set a pressured pace to the
inside of a rival and then stopped after a half mile.

BEHAVIN MYSELF was away alertly to set the pace while well clear, widened the margin down the backstretch, then remained well clear to the wire while
being ridden out. NOT VERY GENTLE was reserved four wide, came five wide into the lane and rallied well for the place award. GAGOOTS was reserved
early on the inside, advanced on the turn and eased off the inside nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and needed a stretch bid while
losing the place award. PISTOL BOX was four wide into the first turn, settled back on the outside, then passed the tiring rivals. KRAMDEN was settled three
wide early, two wide on the turn and weakened. IRISH MAJOR was settled back on the inside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ALEBRIJE was well rated two wide on the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane to make bid, hit the front nearing the sixteenths and then held on
late to prove best under a drive. BORN AGAIN GEORGE was allowed to settle early, came wide into the lane and closed fast late. TAPIT SAM bobbled at
the start, reserved early, angled out in the lane and rallied well late. DEVIL'S RULE tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn and
lugged in when clear by the furlong marker, then faded late. MUD ISLAND pressed the eaqrly pace and then made a bid to take a short lead on the turn but
weakened in the lane. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally. D'FEVER chased the pace on the inside and weakened.
KING TITO bumped at the start, set a pressured pace and then dueled for the lead on the inside, angled off the inside in the lane while dropping back.

Footnotes
OEUVRE stumbled at the start but quickly recovered, advanced to stalk the pace by the half mile marker, made a three wide bid to take over on the tjurn
while in hand, then drew off leaving the turn and proved much the best while being wrapped up. RONAN was settled early, saved ground on the turn and
then finished well on the inside, second best. WHITE LIES was settled early and two wide on the turn, three wide into the lane and lacked the needed bid,
bested rest. COWGIRL FRANKIE was off slowly, far back early, swung out wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the minor rewards.
ISABELLACANNETELLA pressed the early pace on the inside, was bumped by the half mile maker, then fell off the pace and shifted off the inside on the
turn three wide and weakened. WAY TOO SMARTE was settled three wide, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. CAT ATTACK was away alertly
and set a pressured pace two wide, then dropped to the inside entering the turn and then retreated in the drive.

OUT OF DEDUCTIONS was allowed to settle early, made a five wide bid leaving the turn and drew off in the lane to prove much the best, ridden out. ALL
CHOKED UP set the pace while clear, two wide into the lane, then drifted in when straightened but corrected quickly, then proved to be no match for the
winner while staying on for the place award. ELECTRIC CHARGE was settled back early, saved ground on the turn, cut corner leaving the turn, angled out
in the lane and was along for the show award late. MO TIME AT ALL was settled early, advanced two to three wide on the turn and came four wide into the
lane and weakened, lost show award late. AQUACAT was rated along and saved ground on the turn, shifted out and came three wide into the lane but was
empty. MINING CAMP tracked the pace on the inside, then was in tight leaving the turn and faded. CHERRY ORCHARD was reserved early, two wide on
the turn and had no rally. SMILING STORMY was void of early speed and lacked a rally. ICE VORTEX was reserved two wide and failed to respond.
THREE ROUGH SHODS was settled back two wide and not a factor. Rider on number five MINING CAMP filed OBJECTION against number six ALL
