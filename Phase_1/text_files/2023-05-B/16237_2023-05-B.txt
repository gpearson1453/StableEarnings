TUFF ATTACK prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded under left handed urging to gain a narrow lead in the final stages and proved best
while fully extended. JOHNNY U away alertly, set a pressured pace inside the winner until deep stretch, dug in gamely but just missed hanging on.
REINSURE with the second flight two wide, angled to the five path entering the stretch then went evenly. KING RICHIE with the second flight inside, failed
to respond. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE had good early speed then faded. BULLION trailed.

RIPLEY EFFECT trailed around the clubhouse turn, moved up steadily circling her field, rallied through deep stretch under left handed urging and got up in
the final strides. UNESCORTED chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, angled back in two
wide near the furlong marker, came back on and got up for second. UNDERCOVER LADY broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, opened a clear lead
before the furlong marker and was outfinished in the final stages. PLAYFUL SUMMER chased the pace two wide then along the inside through the stretch
and went evenly. MAY BEAU failed to menace. CONDUTTORE close up early, was through after a half. INDY LITES had brief speed.

AUJARA rushed to contention along the rail, got through to make the lead on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under a strong hand ride to win
as much the best while going away. DIVA POWER away alertly, set the pace off the rail into the turn then was no match for the winner while well clear for
second. BOX STEP raced outside and went evenly. CHLOES ANGEL unhurried early, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then leveled off.
RAINBOW SHIP chased the pace three then two wide and weakened in the stretch. BOOGIE BOOGEE had brief speed. JETTIN PEGASUS was no factor.
DANCIN' ROSIE was through early.
