Footnotes
MISS CHARLIE GRAS broke alertly, dueled in the run up the backstretch off the inside, continued to duel turn, roused left handed approaching the furlong
grounds, drove clear then held the runner up safe late under continued firm hanling. SUNSHINE STAR in the second flight early along the inside, steered
out when straightened for home, finished willingly to be well clear for the second spot. ALLSTAR MAGIC lacked speed, two path into the lane, improved into
the lane in the two path, up for the show. MILA'S KAT in the second flight off the inside, came up empty for the drive. RESPOSADO last away, trailed most
of the in failing to menace. ENOUGH HEART moved up to duel inside the winner, raced on equal terms with that one through the turn and into the stretch
then gave way.

Footnotes
MISS G G in the second group while racing off the inside, continued on the outside into the straight when called on for some run, responded well to win
going away while remaining out in the course. COOL HOT CHIC maintained inside position in dueling up the backstraight closest to the inside, continued to
alternate for the advantage through the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, proved no match for
the winner late, went wrong after the wire, vanned off. JUST A WIN lacked early speed off the inside, moved toward the rail early in the turn, two path into
the lane, lodged a late rally from between horses while too late for the top pair. HIGH ARABIAN outrun for three furlongs while four wide through the turn,
also displayed some late energy while widest, not enough for the show. CRYPTO BRAVE went one paced throughout, lacked a closing punch. CHERRY
STAR second flight inside, came out a bit to be in the two path entering the stretch, had little for the run to the wire. FUNKYLITTLESHACK dueled up front in
the two path, gave way. SPLITTING ACES always outrun.

MARDI GRAS ALARM took control after the start, continued to show the way up the backstretch in the two path, edged clear into the turn, shrugged off a
second foe into the lane, drew out steadily through the lane while kept to pressure. ANGEL AND ME last away along the inside, trailed early, steered out to
be four wide when beginning to advance late turn, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. CALIFORNIA CALI back off the early and the inside, began
an early advance late backstretch, reached closest to the winner late in the turn, flattened out in the drive to be caught for the runner up position. JULIO
CHOICE back off the early pace, advanced from between foes into the stretch, also saw progress stall the final furlong. MDA RUN ADDRESS behind the
pace but within striking distance early, came up empty for the drive. RESPECT ALL dueled up front inside the winner early, began a steady retreat before
three furlongs.

Footnotes
LE GRIFFON with the pace from the start inside, narrowly showed the way onto the backstretch, allowed a rival the inside late backstretch, vied between
rivals through the second turn and into the lane, edged clear inside the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. FIRST CLASS HARLOW
four wide into the first turn, continued outside in mid pack up the backstretch, four wide through the second bend, rallied down the middle of the course,
finished willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late, clear of the others. BOLT FROM ABOVE lacked early foot toward the inside, saved ground
through the second turn, switched out for room nearing the furlong grounds, up late for the show, not a threat to the top pair. FREE RAMBLING MAN
forwardly placed for a half, advanced and lodged an early rail bid with four furlongs to run, vied through the second bend hugging the rail, weakened in the
drive. SONYA KNOWS BETTER pressed the winner from the outside, vied the middle half, held a narrow advantage in the second turn, also faltered in the
drive. MARVINS' POSSE four wide in the first turn, stalked the lead pack the middle half, had little left for the stretch run as well. HE GOTS TO GO
remained back in failing to menace. COMPUTERIZED was finished early, far back.

upper stretch then proved no match, narrowly gained the nod for the place. RICKY BOBBY five wide through the first turn, raced forwardly up the
backstretch, challenged three wide second turn and put a head in front, also raced on equal terms with the winner into the stretch, fell back, coming again
for the runner up spot to miss. FATHER RED pressed the runner up off the inside, vied between horses through the second bend and began to weaken.
SILENT POWER went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. GUITARTUITION PLZZ broke back, failed to menace. ASHAAB last to leave,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while also not a threat. SEEHOSS finished early, failed to menace. GOLDEN QUALITY forwardly placed in the early going,
began a steady retreat after half.

Footnotes
FIRE VISION with the pace from the start, vied three wide into the turn, put a head in front by late in the bend, clear when straightened for home, just
enough left to contain the runner up at the wire. AVIE J last away, trailed while patiently handled, began to move on her courage late in the turn, swung six
wide into the lane, finished willingly to be rapidly closing the gap on the winner late. RUN AWAY SAMARI within striking distance up the backstretch, chased
the the leaders into the stretch, had little for the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. DEBBO one paced to to three wide through the turn,
lacked a winning kick. NICELY UNIFIED in mid pack along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, came up empty the final furlong as well.
NATURALBORNSENDER in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, failed to muster a rally. LA VIE EN ROUGE broke back and failed to make an
impact. TROSKA lacked speed, failed to muster a closing response. MARINA took control just after the start, dueled up front inside the winner through much
of the turn then began to give way. REQUITE THE EFFORT in mid pack early, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

PACIFICISLANDTIME behind the early leaders through the first turn toward the inside, continued to be outrun up the backstretch, swung out widest exiting
the final turn, finished with good mettle to be up in a well timed ride. OAK HILL LG last to leave, trailed early as a result, pulled while three wide and between
foes onto the backstretch, moved up to take control before a half, showed the way into and through the second turn, edged clear a furlong out, could not
contain the winner. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT four wide with within striking distance first turn, remained forward, pressed through the final bend and then chased
the runner up past the furlong marker, had little more while comfortably finishing in front of the other two. FLASHING ANGELBABY set or forced the pace
along the inside, weakened. HALF AGAIN pressed the issue in the two path for six furlongs, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
START WELL void of speed in trailing early, moved out, four wide through the turn, asked along late in the bend, closed with good energy to be in time.
SHE'S MY PRIORITY forwardly placed off the inside out of the chute, chased the leader through the turn, reeled that one in with less than a furlong
remaining, led late, could not contain the winner. BETISON broke sharp, was clear out of the gate, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the
turn, shortened inside the furlong grounds, caught in the late going. BEYOND D'ORO in the second flight off the inside, raced three wide through the turn,
lacked a closing response. LAKE RUNNER in mid pack outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, angled in toward the rail, went evenly
to the wire. STORM BREACH lacked speed, failed to menace. CAJUN SHOTS remained back and did not threaten. KASEN'S SISTER chased the early
leader up the backstretch, began to back up before a half.
