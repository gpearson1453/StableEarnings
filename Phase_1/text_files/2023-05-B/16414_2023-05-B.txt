EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the
task. PAPA JIMMY well placed and off the rail, angled in to save ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and closed well for the place.
EXTRA MEDIUM rated back early, angled out through the turn, came widest into the stretch, closed willingly and held the show. ORAZIO well placed and
outside, looped three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the show. CAPTAIN MAD JACK broke out at
the start, was well placed between rivals, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

GOING UP sprinted to a clear lead quickly, increased his margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. UNCLE KENNY broke
sharply from the gate and tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room
and closed well for the place. A BIT OF CAPTAIN well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and closed for the show. LATE NIGHT LIVING sent from the gate, saved ground on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch
and got up for a share. GRUMPY BROOKSIE never far back, looped three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then drifted in and
weakened. ANOTHERDAYOFWORK was never involved.

SUPER GREMLIN well placed and off the rail, angled in into the turn to save ground, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a
steady gain and drove clear late. KENJI'S EMPIRE eased to the lead down the backstretch, shook clear through the turn, then was no match for the winner
late, while clearly best of the rest. GOVERNOR ATWOOD led in the early going, stalked the pace to the turn, held position three wide through the turn, then
faded into the stretch. TWELVETWO dropped back in the early going, angled in and saved ground through the turn, then could not gain in the stretch.

DON'T MAKE ME BEG set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then lasted under steady pressure. SWEET MOOCHIE unhurried,
angled in to the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ABBEY'S
SNOW WHITE tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and evened out. THISAINTJUMPSTREET mid
pack and inside, held position on the two path through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and ran evenly the final furlong. TIZ PROMISING RVF
allowed to settle, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then drifted in and had a mild gain. KEYPIT vied for the early
lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. LIGHT HEARTED broke through the gate pre start, broke sharply to
gain an early lead then dropped back quickly.

through inside into the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place. LENTEN ROSE rated outside, moved up three wide through the
second turn to gain a short lead, then weakened late and held the show. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL never far back, held position three wide through the second
turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then drifted in and could not gain. LADY LANA set the pace off the rail and faded through the second turn.
