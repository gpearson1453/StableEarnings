IRISH VICTORY set the pace off the rail, shook clear through the turn, then drifted out and drew off in the stretch, then held under steady pressure. SHEER
ALICE (GB) stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out and came three wide into the lane, then drifted out and lacked the
needed late kick. SHE'D RATHER DANCE broke sharply and steadied back into the turn, held position on the two path, came widest into the stretch and
flattened out. ANIPPE never far back, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
HOP A LONG broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, then could not gain in the lane. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE

the needed late kick and settled for the place. YES IT'S ERIE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, made a steady gain in the lane, angled in
late for clear racing room and got up for the show. LADY MARVEL set the pace off the rail, shook clear through the turn, drew off, then weakened the final
sixteenth and held a share. ODD GAL unhurried early, looped three wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and ran evenly. EMERALD

Footnotes
WINGS OF A SONG well placed and inside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out, made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. OMIKAMI rated back early, was allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, then closed fast and edged for the place. VACCINA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then
drew off in the stretch, weakened late and held the show. SAILOR'S SALUTE unhurried early, looped two and three wide through the second turn, came
three wide into the stretch and flattened out. STRAIGHT MADNESS never far back, lost some ground through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.
MACRELLETTA well placed and outside pulling, faded three wide through the second turn.

GREG'S HONOR well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
then made a steady gain and drew off the final sixteenth. ROUND OF APPLAUSE rated close up, gained a striking position on the two path through the
second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. T REX allowed to settle,
moved up and angled out through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and held the show.
RICHARD HOOTY unhurried, saved ground through the turns, angled five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed for a share. STRASBOURG
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. LIVEFORTHESONG allowed to settle,

Footnotes
LISA MARIE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, was boxed into the stretch, waited, angled four wide and split foes, then
made a steady gain, edged ahead and held under steady pressure. PRETTY FLATTERING unhurried, moved up three wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL broke out at the start, looped up three and four wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. INVESTMENT INCOME well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. SUMTING RIGHT pulled to the lead in the early going, increased her margin down the backstretch,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and was outfinished for a share. STORMIN MELLY brushed at the start, saved
ground through the turns, angled out into the stretch and improved position. FAMILY BAND steadied from a drifting rival into the first turn, was rated back
through the turn, then gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. SGT
RECKLESS USMC drifted out into the first turn, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded in
the drive.
