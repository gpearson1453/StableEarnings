Footnotes
UNBOWED dueled outside of HUEY DUEY for the early lead, continued to battle around the turn, dug in gamely two wide, shook free nearing mid-stretch
and finished going away. LOUD BOY tracked the embattled top pair into the turn, roused three to four wide entering the lane, sustained response under
pressure and secured second best. MEET GEORGE JETSON raced in the last flight in the early going then given cue to pick up the pace around the turn,
steadily advanced closer, sustained bid down the lane and produced a solid finish. HUEY DUEY dueled inside of UNBOWED in opening stages and
continued to battle into upper stretch, got collared past the furlong marker and steadily faded. ALL IN GOOD TIME tracked the top flight up the backstretch
and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, remained in contention to the furlong marker then came up empty. DOUBLE NUMBERS
got bumped a bit at the start and raced in the last flight, continued in the rear and saved ground around the turn and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
A GIRL LIKE ME was allowed to settled off the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo midway around the turn, given cue four wide entering the lane,
responded willingly, accelerated to the front a furlong out and drew off to an easy score. QUEEN CORDELIA raced four wide just off the embattled trio,
roused forward and took a clear lead approaching the three eighths pole, opened up to clear command, got overtaken near the eighth pole by the winner
and stayed on for second best. UNUNDERSTANDABLE was off a step slow at the start and continued in the back, saved ground early then shifted out
leaving the turn, swung four wide into the lane, responded under pressure and finished clear for show. DIXIE PENNY dueled inside a duo for the early lead,
got overtaken by QUEEN CORDELLA entering the turn, stayed on with response into the lane then came up empty near mid-stretch. FIREY EMBLEM
dueled between rivals for the early lead, steadied sharply nearing the three eighths pole, lost all momentum and gave way. AUNT NADINE dueled three
deep for the lead up the backstretch, stayed on around the turn then retreated in the drive.

ITS A WRAP took over a clear lead heading into the first turn and set the uncontested pace, remained well clear still unleashed around the far turn, swung
two wide into the lane, came under some light rousing, had plenty of kick left in reserve and remained unchallenged. HARD ATTACK was unhurried and
allowed to settle in the back, began to pick up the pace late on the backstretch, edged closer along the inside around the far turn, angled out two to three
wide for the drive, sustained a solid bid but was no match for clear winner. BUMPERDOO rated off the early pace, hustled up three wide around the far turn,
sustained bid down the lane and finished well clear over the rest. LIGHTNING STRUCK stalked the pacesetter along the inside in early stages then came
up empty entering the far turn. TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked the clear pacesetter up the backstretch, ran on two wide around the far turn then emptied out in the
lane.

KID BIZ tracked the pace through early stages, made a move midway around the turn, dug in four deep in upper stretch, responded gamely, kicked in gear,

caught in final stride. KYLIES HOPE set the pace by a comfortable margin through early stages, lost the lead to RUDY TOOTY late on the turn, stayed on
with response through the lane and finisihed well clear over the rest. THE AWFUL TRUTH raced off gthe early pace, hustled along two wide in upper stretch

SAY IT NICELY rated off the top pair through early stages, crept closer three wide late on the turn, came three to four wide into the lane, roused forward
when called upon, briefly matched strides with REDNECKERTHANYOU then edged away. REDNECKERTHANYOU set a pressured pace through the
backstretch and held a slim lead around the turn, roused for more turning for home, responded, cleared command then came under attack from SAY IN
NICELY near mid-stretch, fought back but could not move on with the winner in depp stretch. WARRIOR'S RUN was allowed to settle off the early pace,
picked up the tempo midway around the turn, swung three wide into the lane, sustained response and cleared a share. ALL OVER OLIVER applied pace
pressure to REDNECKERTHANYOU through the backstretch and remained up close around the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way.
STORMIN' J. J. raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane and had no response. NIGHT TERROR raced off the
pace, urged two wide around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
GERARD dueled on the inside from the onset, continued to match strides with a compact field around the turn, cut the corner and fought on along the rail,
dug in gamely under firm handling and refused to be denied. AXTON vied three wide for the early lead, battled on between foes down the lane, dug in under
firm handling but could not get by the game winner. KYANDI raced just off the embattled leaders then moved up five wide midway around the turn, dueled
three deep down the lane, raced in striking distance but lacked the needed kick to get by. MOJITO vied four wide for the early lead, weakened out of duel
mid-way around the turn and failed to regain in the lane. LEA ME BE raced just off the early leaders, moved up four wide to engage rivals near the three
eighths pole, dueled around the turn then tired in the drive. HALO MOON dueled for the early lead then came up empty around the turn.

Footnotes
ROCKIN THE DAD BOD was well placed sitting just off the embattled pair up the backstretch, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead near the
quarter pole, could not match strides with HOOKED ON DREAMS at the head of the lane but remained game in pursuit, shifted out wider when teh leader
drifted a couple paths at the eighth pole, dug in under firm handling and got up in final strides. HOOKED ON DREAMS quickly advanced along the inside in
opening strides to challenge for the lead, vied with CR INSTA GATOR up the backstretch and continued to battle into the turn, cut the corner and shook free
entering the lane, continued on top under firm left handed pressure, drifted out wider at the eighth pole and got caught in final strides. LEAPIN TY MAN
rated off the top pair up the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the turn, came three wide into the lane, shifted to the inside a furlong out, moved up
into close contention then finished evenly in final stages. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted out wider
at the head of the lane, showed response in late stages and just missed show. UNCLE SINGH was unhurried in the opening quarter, hustled up four wide
and gained closer contention late on the turn, moved up into range mid-stretch then lacked closing response. C R INSTA GATOR vied outside of HOOKED
ON DREAMS up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then came up tired in the drive. AMERICAN POSSE dwelt at the start and trailed throughout.
