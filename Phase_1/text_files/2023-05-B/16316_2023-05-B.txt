Footnotes
NEVER COAST prompted the pace outside MASTER OOGWAY to mid stretch, put his nose in front near the eighth pole then drove clear. VAX A NATION ,
well back under rating early, was behind horses entering the far turn, swung to the six path at the head of the stretch and closed late outside rivals.
ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE raced along the inner rail while stalking the pace down the backstretch and around the turn, eased out to the three path in mid
stretch and lacked the necessary rally in an even performance. MASTER OOGWAY set the pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened the final
furlong. EMOTIONAL RESCUE , three wide both turns, failed to menace. IMAGINE IT , taken to the inner rail approaching the first turn, saved ground on
that turn, raced between horses on the far turn and lacked a rally. ELUSIVE , along the inner rail most of the race, failed to rally. FIXITWITHFORWARD ,
four deep the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and
gave way. SUCCEED , checked in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the backstretch, was not a factor. THE LAST JUMPSTART , three wide the first
turn, was well positioned on the far turn and faltered. DEPUTY DONNIE lunged at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
THE LAST SCIP rated four wide and not too far off of a contested pace, shifted out to be about five wide into the lane, closed in under solid asking, took
command with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear. HERE AND NOFURTHER dove inside nearing the half mile marker, eased out and edged up
between runners approaching the quarter pole, shifted out to pursue in upper stretch, drop back in a bit to advance between horses leaving mid stretch and
kept on gamely to gain the place. STREET HUSTLE vied three wide between runners heading to the turn, emerged in a battle outside HIS ROYAL G
leaving the three eighths, gained a short lead in upper stretch then wandered out, was corrected with right handed asks, held a clear advantage past the
eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. MISS YOU AJAX saved ground and off the dueling leaders, stayed towards the inside in the drive and churned on to
bridge the gap. I ONCE STOOD ALONE , off the pace three wide, worked outward in the lane and kept on with interest. HIS ROYAL G , two wide holding a
slim lead between runners early, battled to the inside of STREET HUSTLE from the far turn to the head of the lane, failed to match strides near mid stretch
and faded late. SHEER ELEMENT broke sluggishly, saved ground to upper stretch, eased out and offered a mild run. HE ROLLS disputed the pace inside
runners to the half mile pole, chased around the turn then gave way through the drive. EL TOLU was shuffled back from between rivals after a furlong,
dropped well back, raced two to three wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. SCORCHED BY FIRE , wide, was not a factor. AWESOME STEPHEN ,
four deep pressing the pace into the turn, pursued four wide around the turn then faltered in upper stretch.

LIBRARYOFCONGRESS lacked speed, raced four wide on the far turn, drifted in when taking command in mid stretch and drew off under steady handling.
QUALITY ART , a forward factor along the inner rail, eased out to the two path at the head of the stretch and finished willingly inside horses. PIETRELCINA
bore out leaving the starting gate, was four wide on the far turn and offered a slight rally. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER , snugly rated down the backstretch,
raced inside horse turning for home, swung outside in mid stretch and passed tired foes. SNEAKING SUSPICION lacked speed, worked between horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. ZEVON , carried out at the start, was kept wide, raced four wide turning for home and failed to rally in an even effort.
RECTOR , three wide both turns, chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. SILK PRINCE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and
gave way the final furlong. HAY CHIEF , no factor, was four wide the far turn. NORTHERN RYE chased the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn and
gave way. SNIP THE ROSES faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
ESPERANNNA broke on top then rated kindly outside VIKING QUEEN as the field moved into the backstretch, took closer order in hand nearing the far
turn, engaged the leader soon after, dueled on a short lead leaving the five sixteenths, kept on under right handed asks inside the furlong grounds, switched
over to her left lead with about a sixteenth remaining and held firm. VIKING QUEEN vied inside the winner early then cleared into the backstretch, set the
pace towards the rail, dug in when joined around the far turn, sparred from there and kept on valiantly to the wire. LOVE IS STRONG settled towards the
rail, was under pressure leaving the far turn, eased off the inside in upper stretch and churned on to the inside of CONGRESS HALL and gained the show.
CONGRESS HALL tracked inside, angled three to four wide for the drive and gave way. CAGED PIXIE stalked off the inside, failed to kick on under urging
leaving the far turn and retreated. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL lost ground four wide, edged up into the far turn and set her sights on the embattled leaders,
chased four wide to the head of the lane then tired.

Footnotes
TOSS A COIN broke a step slow, regrouped to edge up nearing the wire the first time and angled in, rated along saving ground through the backstretch run,
eased out for room leaving the far turn, ranged up four wide into the lane to loom, took over from HEARTBURN nearing mid stretch, kicked clear under a
drive leaving the sixteenth pole and held firm. PROPER STORM hopped at the break and was away last, settled outside a rival, worked between runners
advancing to the five sixteenths, angled five wide for the drive and rallied. HEARTBURN disputed the pace to the inside of POET IN MY HEART, took over
from that one around the far turn, braced for challenges in upper stretch, battled past the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly. BLUEBERRY PIE rated
close up while two wide, steadied in close quarters when racing between foes near the five sixteenths, recovered to edge back up nearing the eighth pole,
shifted out and churned on. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , brushed at the break, settled off the pace while three wide, angled six wide for the drive, made a bit of
a run in mid stretch then flattened out. OSA rated inside, eased out near the three sixteenths but failed to seriously respond. QUEEN TAPITURE , forwardly
placed while saving ground, was coaxed along inside rivals leaving the three eighths, checked when in tight nearing the quarter pole and came up empty.
FEMINISTA , three wide stalking the pace, chased outside rivals leaving the far turn, remained a presence to upper stretch then gave way. DULINI , three
wide between rivals leaving the far turn, faded. POET IN MY HEART vied three then two wide outside HEARTBURN, ceded command to that one nearing
the far turn, forced the issue leaving the three eighths then tired.

STREET TOUGH disputed the pace outside GOTTS GOT IT, went clear and drifted in approaching the sixteenth pole then dug in tenaciously late.
CAPTAIN WOODROW broke awkwardly, was four deep leaving the backstretch, angled in mid way on the turn, swung back to the four path in upper stretch
and rallied between horses. UNDER THE OVERPASS lunged at the break, raced in the two path on the turn, split foes and angled out in mid stretch then
closed gamely. GOTTS GOT IT showed speed, hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch, weakened and was steadied behind the winner
approaching the sixteenth pole. WINE COLLECTOR , three wide around the turn, chased the pace and failed to rally. WYSOQUIET stumbled at the break,
saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. MALIBU SLEW hopped at the break, was five deep leaving the turn and gave way. An objection by the
rider of GOTTS GOT IT against the winner for alleged interference inside the eighth pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
SHASTA STAR rated off the pace while about two wide, shifted in and moved up near the quarter pole, came back out and responded to left handed asks
past the three sixteenths, sustained under solid hand urging, forged through between rivals to take over late and was edging away at the wire.
THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) showed solid speed then rated off LA FAMILIA as that one cleared leaving the far turn, shifted out and closed in four wide in
upper stretch, kicked clear a furlong out, was joined from her inside by the winner and gave way grudgingly. LADY JEAN saved ground, eased out to
advance past mid stretch then was out kicked inside foes. MUNDLE OF JOY , bumped at the break, recovered and stalked the pace, angled five wide for
the drive, ranged up in mid stretch then faded. A GIRL NAMED JAC saved ground, eased out in the drive but lacked a solid run. LA FAMILIA rushed up
outside a rival and took over into the turn, cleared and dropped in to set the pace, was collared in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong.
GOLD TIME VIXEN failed to menace. CINQUE AMORE , in a bit tight at the break, raced between rivals mid turn and gave way. TRIKKI NIKKI , three deep
into the turn, angled six to seven wide in upper stretch and weakened.

DOC ROCK saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased outside in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside LUV YA BYE BYE, was floated
out by that one and got up approaching the finish. LUV YA BYE BYE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace in hand around the turn, opened up into the
stretch, drifted out in the drive and gave way grudgingly. OBOY lacked speed, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied mildly. MIZWARRIOR broke
awkwardly, circled the turn three wide while chasing the pace and gave way. A THOUSAND IDOLS bore out at the break, disputed the pace two wide to the
stretch and gave way. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS was outrun.
