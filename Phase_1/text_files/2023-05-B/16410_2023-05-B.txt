NOT VERY GENTLE was unhurried early, moved up along the outside on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch, angled in nearing the eighth pole and
was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. BEHAVIN MYSELF vied for the lead with Blurt from along the inside for five furlongs, then opened a clear
lead, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and was unable to resist the winner late but held on well for the place. PISTOL BOX dropped well back early,
was four-wide entering the stretch and gained his best stride too late. CHRISTMAS PRESENT saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled
out to be three-wide entering the stretch and went evenly. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR saved ground while being reserved off the pace and lacked a rally
when called upon. BLURT vied for the lead from along the outside for five furlongs and tired.

KATIE M'LADY set the early pace racing in hand, responded when asked and maintained a safe advantage. KATHAAN was reserved off the pace, moved
up two-wide nearing the quarter pole while splitting rivals, angled in for the drive and finished fast. RUSSIAN MAFIA was unhurried early, moved up strongly
four-wide on the turn, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out late. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide
into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. TIMELESS ROSE prompted the pace while racing two-wide but lacked the needed late response. MORRIE'S
JOY settled in the middle of the pack while racing along the inside, steadied in tight entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) saved ground setting the pace under pressure, opened clear entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. LONG TALL
WOMAN was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. FIRST KITTEN was forwardly placed
from the start while three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole, but was unable to sustain her rally. SAMARITA was in tight early from between horses
near the rear of the field, moved forward when clear, then had to steady nearing the three-eighths pole while drifting out slightly and was gaining ground late
after finding room. I LUV THIS BAR prompted the early place while two-wide and weakened. DOCS SEVEN was unhurried early while racing four-wide,
came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BETHY was prominently placed early along the inside and gave way. THE JOCKY OF SAMARITA
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST LONG TALL WOMAN, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER
OF FINISH.

Footnotes
VERRAZANOINTHESKY saved ground stalked the pace, angled on three-wide to launch his bid nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth
pole and won drawing clear. SANTINO'S FANTASY dueled with Sunday Mischief for the lead from along the outside, responded when asked but was no
match for the winner in a game effort. CHIEF MYSTIQUE was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
UNCLE DICK saved ground while being unhurried, drifted out during the drive and improved his position. SUNDAY MISCHIEF dueled for the lead from
along the inside to the stretch and tired. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE dropped back early and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
FIT TO FLY set the pace racing in hand while slightly removed from the rail and drew clear when asked. HURTS SO GOOD prompted the pace from along
the outside, was unable to stay with the winner late but held on well for the place. BLOW TORCH saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride and
finished in a mild rally. CYCLONE ATTACK bumped early with Tee Burns, then raced three-wide and was gaining slightly late. TWIRLING ROSES reserved
off the early pace, was in tight along the inside nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out for room and finished willingly. BALADINE settled in the middle of
the pack early, was in tight nearing the five-sixteenths pole between horses and went evenly. RACARINO raced three-wide on the turn and failed to
menace. TEE BURNS bumped with Cyclone Attack shortly after the start, then raced five-wide on the turn and was not a factor. FEVER NATION came
six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

LUNARCHY saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win with something left. EVIE JEAN chased the winner throughout, could not reach that
one but held on well for the place. MISS MIA was off a step slow, then moved forward along the inside on the turn, steadied in traffic nearing the
three-eighths pole, angled out for room and finished willingly. SANGFROID saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the
drive and was making up ground late. BUNNY SHINE was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened. HURRYUPANDBYE was
unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. HOLY STAR gave way after showing brief speed. VELVET SEASON was off
slow then failed to menace and was eased up on late. C V CHARISMATIC was off slow, then dropped far back and was distanced.

GUN RUSH bobbled at the start, then saved ground setting the pace under pressure and drew clear late. HIGH BROW was unhurried early, moved up
two-wide splitting rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly. DRIVEN ONE prompted the
pace while two-wide, dropped back slightly nearing the eighth pole, then responded to come back and earn the show. C F V RED NOVA was closed up
early racing along the inside, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out. BUREAU
was prominently placed early while three-wide and weakened. PATH TO SUCCESS settled in te middle of the pace, came three-wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. THRILL RIDE was forwardly placed to near the stretch but lacked a rally. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN dropped back early and was not a

Footnotes
WANDA STRONG was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, found room to split rivals nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear.
COWGIRL FRANKIE was off a step slow, then reserved off the early pace, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. SUMMER DAY was in tight
crossing the wire the first time, then settled in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. QUILTING PARTY moved up along the inside on
the turn, then lacked room from the three-eighths pole to the eighth pole, angled out late and finished willingly. ROMANTIC ATTACK saved ground early,
lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out to be four-wide and was unable to seriously threaten. SUMMER BELLE chased the early pace and
weakened during the drive. CAT ROYALE saved ground while being forwardly placed but tired during the drive. FROSTED ECLAIR sprinted clear early,
saved ground setting the pace and gave way readily when headed.
