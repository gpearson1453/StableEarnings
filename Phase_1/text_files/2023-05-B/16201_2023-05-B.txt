Footnotes
JUULSTONE , snugly rated inside horses on the first turn and into the far turn, eased off the rail near the three eighths pole, moved to the four path turning
for home, gained the lead in mid stretch and drove clear. BATTLE OF NORMANDY lacked speed, raced inside horses on the backstretch, eased out a bit
on the far turn, floated five wide turning for home, remained on his left lead until well inside the sixteenth pole and rallied. EVAN HARLAN sprinted clear
soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged by the winner in mid stretch and gradually weakened late. AWESOME MAN bumped
with ICE COLD FROSTY at the start, alertly taken to the inner rail approaching the first turn, remained along the rails on the turns, moved out in upper
stretch and rallied between horses. PROWLING TIGER , squeezed back soon after the break, raced inside horses to the far turn, angled wide entering the
stretch and rallied mildly. TWIST 'N TWIRL , steadied and rank approaching the first turn, stalked the pace along the inner rail down the backstretch and
weakened through the stretch. MONJID , steadied when shuffled back shortly after the start, chased the pace outside EVAN HARLAN and gave way the
final furlong. BENNY HAVENS , five deep on the far turn, weakened. THE HAPPY GIANT raced inside horses most of the trip and was not a factor. TIZ A
GIANT , three wide both turns, gave way. ICE COLD FROSTY bumped with AWESOME MAN at the start, raced three wide the first turn and was not a
factor. COLLECTION DAY , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
CEES GET DEGREES drifted out at the break but quickly established command, set a rated pace two wide while handling some outside pressure, drifted
three wide entering the lane, edged away after being corrected with right handed asks, was kept to a solid drive to about the sixteenth marker then held firm
while steadily hand ridden late. SAFFA'S DAY drafted back off the early pace and saved some ground, was under pressure two wide past the five
sixteenths, worked between runners into the lane, kept on with an advance to the inside of RUGGS and grabbed second in the final yards. RUGGS
prompted the early pace three wide and between rivals, gave hard pursuit four wide from the head of the lane but hung late. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , four
wide outside rivals forcing the issue, came five wide for the drive, remained in range under a strong drive past the eighth pole but faded late. HUNTER JOE ,
a bit reluctant to load, was backed into the gate, gained a forward spot inside early on, stayed in touch under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths then
gave way nearing mid stretch.

Footnotes
CAROLINE KRYSTYNA accelerated to the early lead, was well off the inner rail around the turn and was kept to her business in the drive. CAROLINA
HIDEAWAY lacked speed, worked between horses on the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and closed outside horses. UP FOR IT , rated
inside horses down the backstretch, swung outside in upper stretch, was well placed in mid stretch and flattened out. WATCH THIS BIRDIE , rated between
horses leaving the backstretch, failed to menace and passed tired horses. SOUPER TROPICAL , taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and failed to rally. LADY WILDCAT (IRE) , four deep around the turn, gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM took over early and set the pace under a light hold and slightly off the inside, handled outside pressure from FALCONET through
the backstretch run, got the better of that one while shoved along past the five sixteenths, dug in when confronted by MISTY VEIL in upper stretch, kept on
under left handed encouragement leaving the eighth pole then proved resolute from there while solidly hand ridden the final seventy yards. MISTY VEIL lost
ground four wide while forwardly placed, edged closer leaving the far turn, emerged in a battle outside the winner heading to mid stretch, fought on but was
kept at bay. LE DA VIDA (CHI) rated off heels while saving ground into the backstretch, was guided off the inside nearing the half mile marker, chased three
deep past the the three eighths, swung out five wide for the drive, remained on her left lead and closed steadily. FALCONET prompted the pace three wide
outside the winner, was pushed along between runners past the five sixteenths, failed to go on with the leaders entering the lane, altered in and gave way
through the final furlong. BUTTERBEAN stumbled outward at the break, recovered and moved up to stalk, saved ground through the backstretch run while
in range, was put to a strong ride pursuing the leaders past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch into the stretch and retreated. MISTY MAUVE , in range
while off the inside, gave chase between runners leaving the far turn, failed to kick on approaching the lane then dropped back.

Footnotes
ROSES FOR DEBRA hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, moved up between horses approaching the eighth pole,
closed strongly outside ABOVE THE LIMIT, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and eagerly drew off. ABOVE THE LIMIT sped to the early lead, set
the pace slightly off the rail on the turn, was still clear in mid stretch, failed to hold off the winner and switched to her left lead late. LAUGH AND PLAY , a
forward factor along the rail down the backstretch, remained along the rail there after and lacked the needed rally in an even effort. AMERICAN STARLET
chased the pace between horses down the backstretch, checked in close quarters entering the turn, raced inside rivals in the stretch and showed a mild,
late gain. GASTOWN BABE chased the pace outside horses around the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and gave way. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER , no
factor, swung very wide in upper stretch. STILL MY BABE was outrun. GOLDEN CAN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in upper
stretch. RESPECTFULLY , unhurried early, was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROYAL WHISPER broke a step slow, edged up off the inside then angled out and soundly bumped with CONTINENTALCONGRES heading to the turn,
cruised up four then three wide and engaged the leader past the five sixteenths, put a head in front in upper stretch, shook clear under a drive leaving mid
stretch, drifted out a bit in deep stretch exchanging a brush with FRECCIA D'ARGETNTO and prevailed. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO , with the pace three deep,
saw the winner roll by nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to have a clear run in upper stretch, gamely came back on through the final furlong, drew
alongside in deep stretch, brushed with the winner and just couldn't reel that one in. BETCHA BY GOLLY set a pressured pace between rivals, brushed with
AND WHISTLE entering the turn, maintained command to the quarter pole, was headed in upper stretch, fought on to the inside of the winner past the
furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. ITALIAN DRESSING rated off the pace, swung wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. LIQUIDATOR , three
wide off the pace, raced between runners nearing the lane, shifted in through the drive but came up empty. CONTINENTALCONGRES trailed early while off
the inside, was soundly bumped by the winner when that one angled out for room nearing the turn, regrouped to chase off the inside, came four wide for the
drive but lacked a rally. AND WHISTLE disputed the early pace inside a pair of rivals, brushed with BETCHA BY GOLLY entering the turn, failed to keep
pace past the five sixteenths and faltered.

pace, eased out in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and rallied. SHADOW SPHINX , rated inside horses down the backstretch, eased off the rail near the
three eighths pole, worked between rivals and rallied. CHULAINN lacked speed, raced near the inner rail most of the trip and rallied. B DETERMINED
lacked speed, raced between horses in upper stretch, moved outside in mid stretch and rallied late. CANNON'S ROAR , never far back, raced three wide on
the far turn then came up empty. ENCOURAGE , three wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. SARANAC (FR) , no factor, was very
wide in the stretch. TOM HAGEN , rank behind horses entering the first turn, was not a factor. KING'S HONOR (IRE) chased the pace, bid for the lead
outside the winner leaving the far turn then gave way. BOB MARCO was outrun. CLINT MAROON (GB) chased the pace outside and gave way.

Footnotes
FORT WARREN rated off the clear leader while saving ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn, took closer order inside rivals in upper stretch, was
guided outward for room leaving mid stretch, closed determinedly under strong handling, forged past JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY in deep stretch and won
going away. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY quickly went clear, set a strong pace under a light hold and removed from the rail, remained well clear into the
stretch, was set down past the three sixteenths, continued with effort but could not withstand the winner's charge. HELDISH , three to four wide with pursuit,
ranged up a bit near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain through the final sixteenth. CLOUD MUSIC stalked the pace three wide, was under asking
between rivals in upper stretch, lacked a kick in mid stretch and faded. CONTEMPT hopped slightly at the break and was off a beat slow, edged up past the
five eighths then steadied out of a tight spot nearing the turn, shifted in for the drive and churned on. INDYBOUND , off the pace and off the inside, failed to
menace.

TRAIN TO ARTEMUS hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path inside the three sixteenths pole, brushed with CAN THE QUEEN
approaching the eighth pole, took command outside SPICY MARG approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SPICY MARG , taken to the inner rail
mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gave way grudgingly. SPUN GLASS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn,
moved out a bit in upper stretch and rallied. THUNDERING CREED bumped CAN THE QUEEN when bearing in at the break, saved ground on the turn,
remained along the rail in the stretch and had a slight rally. WHISKEY AND RYE , checked in tight quarters along the inner rail about a sixteenth of a mile
after the start, saved ground on the turn, swung very wide in upper stretch and raced evenly. CAN THE QUEEN , bumped by THUNDERING CREED
leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside SPICY MARG, brushed with the winner in mid stretch and gave way late. HER WORLD (IRE) , three
deep chasing the pace around the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch, faltered in the drive and was eased late. LEMOS CUNHA lacked speed and
was no factor. QUEEN SHEBA , three wide on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
MAPLE LEAF MEL edged up three deep in hand and put a head in front leaving the five eighths, dropped in a path then cleared away from KEY OF LIFE
leaving the far turn, was confidently handled around the turn and into the lane, spurted away under some nudges past the furlong grounds then was ridden
with the utmost of confidence through the final sixteenth. TOPSY drafted back off the early pace, pursued outside a rival leaving the five sixteenths, swung
five wide for the drive and finished strong. L STREET LADY broke a step slow, saved ground and firmly handled to cut the corner leaving the far turn,
remained inside into the stretch, eased out in mid stretch, advanced between rivals and continued on willingly to the wire. AFTERNOON TEA had speed
between runners then was rated back off the leaders heading to the half mile marker, stalked three wide around the turn, shifted out wider for the drive,
failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. KEY OF LIFE bobbled at the break but quickly recovered to hold a brief lead, prompted the pace inside the
winner to the turn, was under a hustling ride to keep position into the stretch, saw the winner get away in mid stretch then weakened through the final
seventy yards. BOUND BY DESTINY , off a bit slow, raced well back while three wide, shifted in and came up empty.

Footnotes
RATTLE N ROLL broke a touch slow then was content to be settled off the pace and off the inside, gathered momentum leaving the far turn, circled four
wide progressing into the stretch, drew alongside SPEED BIAS in mid stretch, dueled under some left handed asks and got the perfect bob at the wire.
SPEED BIAS grabbed command between rivals when passing the wire the first time, set a rated pace just off the inside while being shadowed mid way
through the backstretch, moved away into the far turn, maintained command under asking as rivals closed in nearing the lane, dug in when confronted in
mid stretch, battled valiantly inside the winner from there but lost the nose bob. CLAPTON settled three wide and in the clear early on, gained between
runners while coaxed along past the quarter pole, shifted in for the final furlong and churned on to nab the show. KEYSTONE FIELD prompted the pace
outside SPEED BIAS, saw that one get away a bit into the far turn, came back on a bit while under asking past the five sixteenths, continued hard pursuit to
mid stretch then faded late. KUCHAR , towards the inside stalking the pace, was shoved along chasing inside rivals past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch
in upper stretch and gave way. LAW PROFESSOR stumbled at the break, regrouped and edged up off the inside into the first turn, tracked outside a rival,
shifted four wide for the drive and gave way. ARMANDO R bobbled slightly at the break, lagged back and never got involved.

Footnotes
TAXED , in the two path the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch while in the three path, circled the far turn, eased out four wide approaching
the stretch, switched to her left lead in upper stretch, advanced outside the leader, seized command near the sixteenth pole, switched to her right lead and
eagerly drew off while kept to task. HOOSIER PHILLY brushed with MERLAZZA soon after the break, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner
rail, failed to hold off the winner in the drive and finished gamely. FAIZA drifted in bumping BALPOOL at the start, was three wide the first turn, remained in
the three path down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, had aim on the lead turning for home and gave way in the drive. BALPOOL
bobbled and was bumped leaving the starting gate, steadied soon after, raced in the three path between rivals turning for home and had a mild, late gain.
MERLAZZA brushed with HOOSIER PHILLY leaving the starting gate, was keen three wide the first turn, chased the pace in the two path down the
backstretch and weakened through the stretch. CATS INTHE TIMBER lacked speed, was outside horses down the backstretch, moved to the five path
leaving the far turn and failed to threaten. TOWHEAD , no factor, was four wide entering the stretch. COMPARATIVE , checked in tight quarters soon after
the break, hugged the inner rail the far turn and weakened. SACRED WISH , taken up in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the backstretch,
recovered to stalk the pace while saving ground, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
S. MUFFIN sped clear soon after the start, set a solid pace under rating while two wide, responded when set down inside the three sixteenths and
maintained a comfortable advantage while kept to task. COVERT KAT saved ground, edged up to the inside of rivals while coaxed along past the five
sixteenths, continued inside through the drive and finished well to bridge the gap. SURPRISE HELLO had speed and stalked the winner three wide,
wandered outward under pressure through the final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. CERTAIN , three wide between runners leaving the far turn, worked
outward past the sixteenth pole and kept on with interest to gain. THEOLOVESAWINNER drifted in at the break, raced between runners mid turn, edged up
slightly near mid stretch then flattened out. FUN NOTION broke slowly, raced well back into and around the turn, swung out very wide and closed belatedly.
MISSION MAN was squeezed back soon after the break, raced far back into the turn, saved ground through the drive and churned on. THUNDERHOUSE,
lightly steadied leaving the far turn, shifted towards the inside and faded. HIALEAH NATIVE was outrun. GETTIN'DOWNONIT broke slowly, raced four to six
wide and failed to menace. GREAT CALL failed to keep pace. HIT THE JACKPOT flashed speed, raced three deep mid turn and faltered.
