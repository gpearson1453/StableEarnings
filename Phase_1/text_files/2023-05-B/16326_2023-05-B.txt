Footnotes
CHOCOLATEICECREAM bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, saved ground around the first bend, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to
move up coming around the far turn and gained ground throughout the stretch to get up for the win late. JUST BLAZE saved ground around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late. N. K. ROCKET MAN fought his rider slightly while racing in the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and
around the second bend and was caught late. FEEDING FRENZY raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the
far turn and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening. CARMENOOTZ raced in the four path early, tracked the leader up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. IMA HARLEY TOO bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far bend still in the two path and was
empty from there. MISHKO raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
bend and tired in the lane.

MISS MAC MAC led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best. MIZ CALI raced off the
pace on the inside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the bend and gained ground mildly in the stretch while proving to be no match for
the winner. ALLOTROPE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while
finishing evenly. HIGHLY CREATIVE chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the two path
and faded in the lane. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no
bid. BEVERLY DREAMING trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
KING NATE raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the four path around the far
bend, launched a bold bid entering the stretch and kicked clear late. THICK HAZE bumped mildly with CLUB MESQUITE headed into the first turn, tracked
the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the rail coming around the far bend, took the lead in upper stretch and was collared late.
CIBERTRUCK raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second bend still in
the three path and finished evenly. GOPHER GOLD bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, raced off the pace in the three path through the
opening half mile, saved ground around the second turn and showed no kick. CLUB MESQUITE bumped slightly with THICK HAZE while racing in the two
path around the first bend, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the lane.
MEET JOE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, gave
way while saving ground around the second bend and tired further in the lane.

SIR STERLING dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire.
YO DAWG raced off the pace on the inside early, swung out to the five path for the run around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground
late. ROSES BY LIAM stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and chased the winner home in
the lane. SILVER DASH tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the three path and was
outkicked in the stertch. MIDNIGHT ROYAL raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly while
never threatening. NORTH ARM BAY trailed the field early, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY
dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. COLOR ME LEGENDARY raced off
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and made no bid. SAM SEZ chased the leader between horses through
the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the three path and tired in the lane. SCATAMARAN tracked the pace setter between horses up the
backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired from there.
