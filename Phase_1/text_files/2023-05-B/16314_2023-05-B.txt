Footnotes
TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS raced in the middle of the pack to the second turn then steadily advanced to the final turn, made a rail bid entering the stretch to
take the lead in the final sixteenth and held on. STRONG HEART stalked the pace from three or four wide to the backstretch then moved up to press the
pace from the two path and fought gamely in the drive to be a game second. ROCKY DICE tracked the leaders to the top of the stretch then moved out to
four wide for a late run but was not enough but was up for the show. GANDHI'S ORION was hustled along to prompt the pace then took the lead at the half
pole and was headed at the three sixteenths pole but gave way grudgingly. CAIRO BOOGIE raced in the middle of the pack to the three eighths pole then
launched a four wide bid but lacked the late response in the stretch. WICKOSITY was unhurried through the final turn and passed tiring rivals. FRONT
PORCH saved ground to no avail. AMERICAN ROCKY was allowed to settle and remained back. SIENTE EL AMOR was away alertly to set a pressured
pace to the half pole and slowly retreated.

then prompted the pace, bumped with J. WICK GOING into the turn and lost action, made a rebid going three wide in upper stretch to re-engage the leader
at the eighth pole and was a game third. J. WICK was hustled up the rail to take the lead then bumped with NEEDNOEXPLANATION going into the turn and
kept on, then was headed at the eighth pole and tired. DRUNK TEXT was away alertly then tracked the leaders to the turn, was brushed by ONE CANDY

COMPANY CLOWN was hustled early then chased the leader to mid stretch and split horses to make a late surge for the win. MR TINGLES sprinted to a
clear lead but was caught in the final jumps. BLACK CANDY was off the pace in the three path then moved up on the turn and fought gamely.
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN chased the field to the turn then moved up from two wide on the turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch to improve position.
LOADED SNIPER was close up early while saving ground but was not a factor. KUKULKAN tracked the leaders while racing widest of all.

stretch and drew clear. RED HOT TODDY went to the front to set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch when headed by outside rival and proved to be
second best. MONKEY WRENCH stalked the pace from the three path then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to be up for the show. HILLBILLY
ROCK roused away from the gate to press the pace to the quarter pole and gave way. NICE BUT NAUGHTY raced near the back around the first turn then
advanced up the backstretch and improved position. PINNACLE REEF was off the pace on the inside but never made a serious bid. FELICIAS CASTLE

Footnotes
GLADRIEL went to the lead to set all the pace and was kept to task in the stretch drive. FLAT DISCOUNT was off the pace down the backstretch then made
a bid on the final turn but couldn't catch the winner. SOMEBODY LOVES ME was unhurried down the backstretch then made a late inside bid in the stretch
to be up for the show. DROPKICK QUEEN tracked the leader from the three path then made a mild bid on the final turn but had no kick in the drive.
GRACE'S SECRET raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground but was not a threat. MYGIDGETMARIE stumbled badly at the start, trailed the field
to the first turn then moved up from three wide on the backstretch but had no rally. GOLDEN SWEETS pressed the pace from the two path to the three
eighths pole and dropped back. MISS FUSSY PANTS stalked the pace to the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
BLACK PANDA was off the pace around the turn then made a four wide bid in upper stretch, drifted in at the sixteenths pole but kept on and drew clear late.
FORTES was off a step slow then rushed to contention and saved ground around the turn, split horses in final yards to be up for the place. INCLUDE THE
BEAST was off the pace on the inside then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to make a run but had to alter path at the sixteenth pole but was able to
save the show. LITTLE BIT OF THAT sprinted to the lead then shared command around the turn but was out finished in the drive. CAPTAIN SAM was
hustled along to share the command around the turn and was out kicked in the drive. HOT CAROL chased the leaders but was not a threat. UNLOCK was
forwardly placed in the early stages then made a three wide bid on the turn but had no late kick. SHENANDOAH CAT had no speed and was not a factor.
RED PRIESTESS had no speed and was outrun. A TRAINER OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE TRAINER OF INCLUDE THE BEAST CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST BLACK PANDA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS
DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
