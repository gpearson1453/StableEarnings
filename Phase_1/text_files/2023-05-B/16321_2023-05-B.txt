Footnotes
SOUL OF A WARRIOR stalked the top pair up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane, moved out while rallying to catch the drifting leader, drew
alongside that rival past the sixteenth pole and got up in time. UNJOKABLE dueled for command outside a rival, shook free at the top of the lane, drifted out
under left-handed urging through the lane, led clear into deep stretch and got nailed in the final moments. SIDE BY SIDE hopped at the start, sat off the
pace early off the inside, angled in for the turn, summoned a mild rally up the fence and gained the show. COLLECTMYTHOUGHTS dueled inside
UNJOKABLE into and around the turn, could not keep up with that rival into the lane, stayed on through the final furlong and got edged for the show honors.
LIL TOWN SIS tracked along the inside into the turn, moved out and exited the bend four wide, drifted out in the lane and kept on while unable to threaten.
SWEET MOTHER MARY chased from off the pace, went four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, wanted to go outside LIL TOWN SIS then altered
back inward in upper stretch and could not rally. PRINCESS MAGIC broke out then was hard to ride up the backstretch, trailed three then two wide on the
turn and failed to menace.

ROSE BARTON (IRE) cleared quickly and crossed over, set the pace in hand early, showed the way to the stretch, felt pressure entering the final furlong
but responded well to inch away from rivals. SLAM DIEGO broke a bit awkwardly at the start, moved inside at the back then outside a rival, rounded the far
turn three deep and took aim three wide into the stretch, loomed from outside with a furlong left to run but was held at bay by the winner. PRECIOUS BABY
brushed the gate to break in a bit, rated along the inside early, coaxed along the far turn while continuing to save ground, steered out in the lane and.
NORAH'S PRINCESS got put in a bit tight by the leader prior to the first turn then stalked outside a rival, chased two wide into the lane, took aim into the
furlong grounds but flattened out.

chased the leader two wide around the bend, pressed from outside at the halfway point, took over into the far turn, dueled in the two path while inside
SMART MO around the far turn and relinquished command approaching the quarter pole, fought back gamely through the lane but could not get by the
winner. DAZZLEMESILVER vied between foes early then took a stalking position from inside on the clubhouse turn, chased two wide leaving the
backstretch, angled out on the final turn and came five wide into the lane, drifted out in the stretch and flattened out but finished a clear third. FINDING

in hand, was pressured at the half-mile pole, lost command into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and tired. NOBEL GARY vied four deep into the
first turn then chased three wide into the backstretch, started to fade through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and was not persevered with.

pole, dueled through the deep stretch and bested the runner-up. GOOD BOO JOO dueled for the lead from inside into the first turn then cleared
approaching the backstretch, showed the way from inside to the stretch, met the challenge from AWESOME TAYLOR with a furlong remaining, dueled
through the final sixteenth and yielded grudgingly. PEPPERMINT FLIRT settled inside, chased two wide into the far turn, angled inside weakening rival
around the bend, steered out in the lane and finished willingly for a clear third. BACK ON THE STREET tracked two wide outside a rival early, remained two
wide into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. TA TA FOR NOW was off slow to begin, lagged behind on the inside,
made progress two wide then three deep on the far turn but leveled off in the stretch. SWEET HELLO dueled briefly into the first turn outside a rival then
chased the leader two wide into the backstretch, started to weaken when asked on the second bend, trailed into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
GHAZAALY broke well then chased along the inside, was keen laving the first turn, moved up inside the leader briefly at the midway point then lost ground
into the turn, bid from outside at the eighth pole and drove clear. DESERVEDLY sped to the front and led a bit off the rail early, shoed the way two wide up
the backstretch, angled over the rail for the far turn, took pressure from SOUL OF MIDNIGHT then moved clear approaching the quarter pole, challenged by
GHAZAALY with a furlong left to run, was overtaken by that rival in midstretch and stayed on to prove second best. CLOONEY trailed on the inside through
both turns, showed a mild rally in the lane, drifted in a bit and had to be corrected at the sixteenth pole while earning the show honors. TRUSTY RUSTY
chased two wide off the pace, moved into range on the backstretch, went between foes on the far turn then three wide into the stretch and could not rally.
SOUL OF MIDNIGHT chased three wide early, put in a mild bid two wide with three furlongs remaining, could not sustain the challenge nearing the quarter
pole and weakened in the furlong grounds. TIZ TOK chased four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, three deep on the second bend, entered the lane
four wide and failed to rally. FIREMAN DAN chased four wide early, remained wide while four deep on the second bend, drifted out at the top of the lane
and weakened.

Footnotes
PLEASE FOCUS set the pace with rival applying pressure to the outside, cleared at the quarter pole, continued clear to midstretch, then held gamely over
closing rivals from both sides. WESTWARD LOOK broke a step slow, forwardly placed early three deep, chased three wide into the lane, challenged in the
final sixteenth but could not get by. BARSABAS bumped with inner rival early, trailed on the inside to the lane, angled out in upper stretch, steered inside the
top pair in the final sixteenth, surged but was too late. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) stalked between foes then two wide, got put in a bit tight at the five-sixteenths
pole, tipped out at the top of the stretch, chased behind WESTWARD LOOK then finished willingly outside that rival to pick up a minor piece four deep on
the line. SQUARE CAT got bumped shortly after the start, raced off the pace then ran up on heels early, took the turn three then four wide, tipped widest in
the drive and kept on while needing to find more late. INCH stalked four deep into the turn, remained wide into the lane and faltered in the late stages. LAW
ABIDING pressed the pace from outside, lost touch around the turn and chased two wide into the lane and weakened. THUNDERHEART stalked the pace
from inside, cut the corner into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MADIHA broke inward, pulled on the inside and had to steady around the first turn, chased the top pair through the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, bid
three deep and took over approaching the sixteenth and lasted in the final moments. SUNSHINE BABE bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide early,
roused at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out with a quarter mile remaining and came five into the stretch, rallied through the lane and got up at the wire.
BIG CLARE lost her path at the start when ROSIE FORECAST came over, traveled three deep near the back around the clubhouse turn, found some traffic
behind rivals at the three-eighths pole, dove down to the inside, tipped out in the lane, finished willingly and gained the show. GHOSTEM broke inward then
was coaxed to the front, dueled from inside into the first turn then was put in a bit tight around the bend, switched out and was keen to go on, drew
alongside and dueled up the backstretch, held a short lead while battling around the far turn and into the lane, fought to midstretch then flattened in the late
stages. ROSIE FORECAST shifted inward at the start, dueled for the lead outside a rival into the first turn, cleared briefly and moved inside around the
bend, re-engaged by GHOSTEM up the backstretch, lost command but continued to duel around the far turn and into the lane, then weakened in deep
stretch. SHEZMISBEHAVING bumped leaving the gate, settled at the back on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn,
angled seven wide exiting the turn and failed to threaten. GOLDEN TEMPER stalked two to three wide early, stayed off the rail through the far turn, moved
out into the lane and lacked further response. DENDERA was rank early three then four wide, went three wide into the far turn, angled six wide leaving the
far turn and weakened.
