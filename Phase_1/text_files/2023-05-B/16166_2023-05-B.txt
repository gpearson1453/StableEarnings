Footnotes
NEOKING was unhurried while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole, was
running up on rivals in mid-track, altered in sharply in deep stretch and was up in time. HINDOSTAIN FALLS drifted out start, chased the leader from the two
path into the lane, was still on in deep stretch when passed by the winner late. BREAKOUT STAR bumped and lost his path when rivals pinched in, raced
well back through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the four path and finished willingly. SMALL SAILOR bid from the three path
through late turn, came into the lane from the six path, looked menacing with an eighth to go then hung late. GUS GUS stepped out at the start, raced in the
three path through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild gain. PRINCE OF PENNIES hustled off to a clear lead down the backstretch and through the
turn, continued to be clear into the lane then gave way. LIL BRAT was well back while in the two path through the turn and never factored. FULL MAG was
ridden hard into the turn while along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL broke sharply, led inside and held sway under steady urging. TRULY QUALITY was jostled at the start, rallied five wide at the quarter
pole and missed. QUIET RIDE stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, then lacked racing room late along the rail and steadied slightly. GHOST
COAST pressed the pace in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. SON OF THUNDER stalked the pace in the two path, racing evenly. WINSTON
WOLF pressed the pace four wide before giving way in the stretch. BEE WELL raced in the three path, angled to the rail at the eighth pole but lacked a late
bid. DUBAI AND BACK (IRE) was off awkwardly. MIDNIGHT CHANNEL saved ground to no avail. GJALLARHORN was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOOD FOREVER was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, caught the leaders approaching the sixteenth pole and
edged up. ZAPPINIT was checked along the rail nearing the half-mile pole, dropped back into the turn, raced in the two or three path through the turn,
angled into the six path into the lane and rallied from mid-track. SPOTONJUSTICE pressed the early pace while two wide, settled off the three rival duel
through the turn, chased that group into the lane, lost his path to the winner entering the lane, steadied behind rivals entering the lane, continued to look for
running room to inside the sixteenth pole then offered a late gain. BUTCH'S BEST set the early pace, was joined by two rivals into the turn, dueled with
those from the inside into the lane, was still a serious contender nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished by the top ones. CABOOSE vied for the lead
three wide through the turn and into the lane, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole then weakened late. SOLAR POWER was brushed at the start and
settled back, raced in the three path into the lane, raced in the five path through the final eighth and showed late interest. ROCK THE RED raced near the
inside into the lane, moved to the rail inside the eighth pole and never was a threat. FRUITCAKE never a factor while in the three path into the lane.
BRUSTER JUSTICE vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn, gained a short lead in late turn then faded through the lane. LOOKING GOOD
LEWIS was outrun while racing in the six path through the lane. STANDOUTJUSTICE was outrun while near the rail.

Footnotes
GIGANTE set the pace at once, was clear into the first turn, continued to lead while under pressure from the outside, repelled challenger into the lane,
cleared with a sixteenth to go then was all out to last. WADSWORTH trailed through the far turn while in the two path, angled into the seven path into the
lane then finished with a rush to just miss from mid-track. DUDE N COLORADO (GB) pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, bid into the lane, had
aim with an eighth to go but could not keep up. OCEAN POINTE raced in the three path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane and stayed
on well to be best of the rest. DUNEDIN was steadied into the first turn, raced along the inside through the turns and into the lane, was steadied along the
rail near the eighth pole when losing path then never factored thereafter. MIDNIGHT RISING raced in the two path through the turn and lacked a bid.
WORTHINGTON stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, continued in the four path through the turn then tired. CURLY LARRY AND
MO chased inside through the turn and tired. MOON CAT raced four wide through the far turn and never was a factor.
