Footnotes
MALIBU SECRET tracked the top pair three wide while rated kindly at the half, cruised outside to the lead entering the stretch and drew away without urging
for a dominant victory. RACE FOR PINKS settled inside watching the frontrunner down the back straight, was on hold behind the contesting threesome the
turn, angled out three wide at the quarter pole and closed in to be a non threatening runner up at the wire. STORMY SOUL threw his head and broke out at
the beginning, tracked the pacesetter in the early stages, bid between rivals for the lead at the three eighths marker, continued in between horses battling
upfront with three sixteenths to go and finished up evenly holding onto the show award in the end. DE ONLY SOLUTION led this short field down the
backside, was headed running inside at the three furlong marker, fought on briefly and gave way with they turned for home. RACING IN THE RAIN settled
near the rear running outside of foes with a half remaining, was coaxed for more two wide midway on the turn, floated out five wide at the top of the lane and
offered little run in the final furlong. TALL WATER broke in and was brushed at the start, trailed in the beginning down the backstretch, saved ground
through the turn making little headway and could not get interested driving to the wire.

Footnotes
HEAR ME KNOCKING had a good position four wide outside watching the top pair at the half, was nudged midpoint on the turn to go after the frontrunner
and determinedly wore down the rival through the lane to get up in deep stretch. P. S. RISING STAR battled inside for the lead at the half, put away the
early speed rival with three furlongs remaining, stubbornly held the lead at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. SECRET
SUNSHINE settled in the two path with runners on either side in the beginning, was ridden midway on the turn making some gain, shifted five wide in upper
stretch and found some more energy late to hold for the show award. LOADED MISTRESS travelled near the rear down the backstretch, took closer order
to challengers inside through the turn, advanced three wide between horses at the eighth pole and put in a good late surge to get up for a minor role.
GYPSY MAGIC was situated in the the middle of the pack in the early going, was asked with three eighths left saving ground on the turn, turned for home in
range running on the rail for a small share and levelled out in the final furlong. PRIVILEGED was fighting for the lead outside down the backside, while
between runners was put in a drive to keep up at the three furlong marker and retreated in the four path in mid stretch. SHE'S SO COLD settled in midfield
three wide outside runners down the backstretch, made little impression widest in the three path on the turn and was never a factor to the wire. IVICTORY
was away slowly, trailed and lost all chance when missing the break.

Footnotes
EGBERT J broke inwardly, settled toward the back racing off the rail, began to advance late on the turn, altered inside a rival coming to the top of the stretch
for clear sailing, steadily gained and edged past late. UNIFIED FRONT bumped with a rival at the start then was urged forward, tracked in behind the
leading pair, came out for room at the top of the stretch, ground on steadily slowly gaining on the leader, was carried out by that one late and edged past for
place. MOUNTAIN SOUND was coaxed forward to attend the pace inside, took charge outside the three-eighths, drifted out a bit turning for home, drifted
out more so in late stretch under left-handed urging and was outfinished. MARALINGA bumped with a foe at the start, settled at the rear near inside, shifted
out to be five wide coming past the quarter pole and advancing on the leaders, evened out in the drive but improved position. CRIMSON NIGHTS stalked in
behind the leaders, raced between foes three to four deep on the turn, came out a bit for the stretch run, failed to rally. GRACE ON THE GREEN was a bit
reluctant to load, raced outside foes mid-division, went four to five wide, failed to threaten. WHAT'S MY NAME forced the pace from outside, came up
empty.

Footnotes
RUN FOR THE HILLS broke out at the start, was content sitting comfortably behind the pacesetter on the turn, found clear running room in the two path in
upper stretch, took control with an eighth remaining and was drawing away when crossing the finish line. GAYELETTE was on the rail near the back of the
field in the early going, saved ground stalking inside on the turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch run and found her best stride late getting up for
the place share right at the wire. I'M INTO MISCHIEF took command from the break, was headed around the turn, put away that early challenge to brace for
the closers in upper stretch, fought on gamely inside until the furlong marker and faded late losing the place share at the wire. WITCH HAZEL broke inwards
to start, had a good spot outside tracking the top pair through the turn, was four wide to offer a bid straightening out for the drive and evened out in the final
eighth. SHEBATOWN was steadied mildly inside the three quarter marker to trail, could see the field running on the turn, angled out widest in the six path
turning for home and passed tired foes in mid stretch. IMPETUOUS MOLLY was under a snug hold five deep down the backside near the rear, stalked two
wide in the third flight on the turn, shifted to the four path for the drive and had no finish to offer. ROYAL BLUSH engaged two off the fence at the nine
sixteenths marker, contested outside for the front throughout the turn, gave way in the three path at the top of the lane and retreated between foes in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA led from the onset, set the fractions with mild pressure through the turn, edged away with a furlong to go and was kept to the task late
to win comfortably at the line. OLYMPIC FENCER settled just back of the frontrunning winner in the three path down the back straight, continued to chase
the pacesetter on the turn, loomed the only challenger in upper stretch but could not pose a threat running to the wire. MURDER HORNET had a nice
tracking position inside at the half, shifted out to the four path to start a rally at the quarter marker and could not make any headway in the four path through
the stretch. ITS A BIRDIE pressed the pacesetter two wide on the turn, gave up the chase with two furlongs left to go between runners and retreated in mid
stretch. HALO STYLE settled in midfield just off the rail at the half, was three wide when ridden for more midpoint on the turn, angled out to the five path at
the top of the lane and passed weary ones in the stretch. PICTUREDAY JESSICA travelled near the rear in the beginning, offered a mild turn of foot at the
three eighth marker and levelled out in upper stretch. MY GIRL HOOTER was void of early speed to trail down the backside, advanced on the rail running
through the turn, was in with a chance for a small share on the fence in upper stretch and stalled at the furlong pole. LADY IN RED settled four deep in
midfield down the backstretch, lost touch with the pack running four wide nearing the quarter pole and was not persevered with finishing to the line.

Footnotes
GOOGLY EYES angled in tracking the dueling leaders from inside, tipped out while advancing willingly leaving the turn, was four wide at the top of the
stretch making a bid, moved just clear and asked for a bit more by mid-stretch, held. JAB was unhurried at the rear, switched outside foes and began to
advance early on the turn, continued passing rivals coming into upper stretch seven wide and gained steadily on the winner but was too late. SOUPER
SINCLAIR stalked just off the dueling leaders outside going three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five deep, drifted in a bit late and got the
nod for show over WELL ACTUALLY, who was just a bit reluctant to load, broke well then eased back off the leaders racing near but just off the rail
mid-pack, took closer order coming to the top of the stretch racing two to three deep, moved out four wide in upper stretch seeking room then back inside
the leader and eventual winner, ran on but missed third. TOTALLY IN CHARGE saved ground inside through the turn racing well off the leaders but
beginning to pick it up late on the turn, came out in the stretch and kicked on well late but had too much to do, was vanned off. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was
urged at the break but lacking early speed, raced off the pace near the inside, came out three to four wide for the drive and ran on evenly. MEET THE
SOPRANO raced mid-pack three to four wide through the turn coming six deep into upper stretch and ran on evenly. INDIAN MUSIC bumped a rival at the
start, forced the pace outside dueling two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. BIG GINGER broke alertly, dueled inside, weakened. SHARP AZA
RAINBOW was bumped at the break and never near enough to threaten. FAST'N SEXY made no impression racing toward the back.

Footnotes
ABOVE PAR pulled away from the pack to be the clear leader at the four furlong marker, set the pace uncontested through the turn, opened up some at the
three sixteenths marker and had enough in reserve to hold safe at the wire. DESTINIQUE sat inside watching the frontrunning winner set the fractions in the
early stages, loomed the only threat four wide in the stretch drive and determinedly fought on down the lane but could not make any gain to the finish. IMA
BEAST tracked three wide with a half remaining, was ridden midpoint on the turn, began to pick up the pace five wide at the top of the stretch and closed
well to finish a non threatening third. FOXY LADY was situated near the front just off the rail down the backside, made little progress on the top two when
roused midway on the turn and evenly finished up holding on for a minor role in the end. JILLI MARIE broke out in the beginning to trail early, advanced on
the rail though the turn and showed some late interest passing stragglers on the fence to the finish line. OHEAVENS was situated four wide in midfield down
the backstretch, kept up with with rivals on the turn and was one paced outside to the finish. HELLO FRIENDS had to tap on the brakes avoiding steadying
runners nearing the three furlong pole, lost momentum, regrouped to offer a good finish between horses passing many through the stretch. GIZMO'S B F F
travelled on the inside in the middle of the pack at the half, was steadied hard nearing the three furlong marker, lost action and could not recover to make
any impression to the wire. TAKOTA broke in at the start, tracked between runners in the two path down the backside, was in with a chance for a small
share at the top of the lane and weakened with runners on either side at the eighth pole. LOIS LEN settled in the middle of the pack three wide between
foes at the half, was taken a hold of when inside rival was steadied nearing the three furlong marker, was shuffled back some and was a non factor
afterwards. SILENT GUROO had a rough start, in tight on the break then steadied at the nine sixteenth pole to trail, travelled five wide on the turn, continued
outside widest in upper stretch and could not get involved running to the wire.

Footnotes
PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) travelled in mid pack on the rail in the beginning, was on hold inside even being steadied for a touch nearing the three eighths
marker, found a seam four wide in upper stretch, burst through splitting rivals and drew off in the final sixteenth. AMAZIN QUEEN was slow into stride
trailing the field down the backside, continued at the back on the turn, angled out the eight path straightening out for the drive and was full of run widest
down the lane to be second best. NOW IS A BREEZE set the pace in the early going, set soft fractions on the turn, was collared in mid stretch outside and
stubbornly battled on holding for the show award. SHE MAKES A POINT hounded the pace in the early going, was in the mix three wide between rivals at
the top of the lane , battled in upper stretch and tired late losing the show photo in the end. PIONEER'S EDGE had a good spot three wide tracking the top
pair on the turn, was ridden for more three furlongs from the prize, bid four wide turning for home and faded in the late stages of the race. ERASMO'S GIRL
sat on the rail watching the top pair on the turn, had a clear path turning for home but could not offer a finish when the running started in mid stretch.
BOUDICA travelled in the middle of the pack three wide outside of horses on the turn, angled out to be seven wide for the stretch run and could not make
any impact running to the wire. TRISH THE DISH was situated in the two path keeping close eyes on the leading duo down the backstretch, could not match
strides with fellow competitors though the turn and empty for the drive to the line. GABBY SQUARED was allowed to settle near the rear down the backside,
shifted out to the nine path in the stretch and had no finish to give running to the line.

Footnotes
TRICK AND TREAT was coaxed forward from the break, appeared to duck in and steadied slightly at the gap, recovered well enough to track from inside
the second flight, came out in upper stretch, edged past the leader late to prevail. MISS WATERLOO moved forward to force the pace, moved clear inside
coming to the three-eighths, came off the fence turning for home, led till very late and kept on to save the place. ANITA MARGARITA raced outside the
second flight going four then five wide on the turn, gained steadily but one-paced in the stretch and missed second. SENSATIONAL SARAH bumped lightly
with a rival at the start, stalked from between runners three to four deep into the turn, was held up just briefly when in tight nearing the five-sixteenths,
moved out six wide for the drive, gained late. SILENT TRIBUTE stalked just off the leader three to four wide, lost ground on that rival into the turn, was
ridden along outside the quarter pole, closed well but was outkicked. BE LIKE LEIGH was fractious at the gate, settled toward the back outside racing about
three wide on the turn, came out a bit turning for home then was guided nearer inside, rallied strongly but too late. NEOLITHIC NATION tracked mid-pack
racing inside, saved ground before coming out at the top of the stretch within striking distance but evened out. SPEEDY JOHNY settled off the pace, fanned
eight wide into the stretch, gained some but needed more. BLONDE DYNAMO settled well back racing inside, angled six wide turning for home, evened out
in the lane. NAVY BLUE ANGEL was bumped at the start, angled in early racing nearer but off the rail, fanned seven wide into the stretch, made no bid.
TACHYON SPEED had forward position between runners in the second flight early, was niggled along leaving the backstretch but steadily dropped back,
moved to the rail past the quarter pole, failed to rally. LONHRO'S GIZMO was forwardly-positioned between runners amongst the early leaders, steadily
retreated.
