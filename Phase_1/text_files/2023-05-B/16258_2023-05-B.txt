Footnotes
PINEY BLUFF was unhurried early and trailed inside, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and drew clear late. KING
BRYCE dropped inside into the first turn, settled off the pace while saving ground, shifted out for the drive, bid willingly, was outclosed and finished second
best. ILOVEHER raced mid pack, advanced outside along the backstretch, assumed command and drew off on the turn for a clear lead, faltered late and
lost position. LEA COSTA ME settled off the pace, rallied into the turn, led briefly and stopped. CLASSY MONEY saved ground, angled out at the top of the
stretch, had nothing left and lacked a bid. EL OCHO was outrun in an even effort. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL set the pace with a clear lead, tired into the second
turn and stopped. TOO HOT FOR YOU broke out, rallied into the turn, tired and gave way.

Footnotes
GUY IN THE SKY vied between horses, inched away entering the stretch and just lasted. STABILITY swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly and was
outnodded to just miss at the wire. SERPICO R S S dueled inside, fell back entering the stretch, went evenly late and held safely for show. WILL TO PAR
dueled three across, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. E. Z. PAPA broke out, was never far off the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a
bid. FUSAICHI WILDCAT failed to respond in an inside trip. ENDALE ARCH was not a factor. GEEBEESBIGBOY showed little in an even effort. SHAME
ON ZCUINTLE showed little.

HOORAY AUSTIN assumed command on the backstretch, drew off on the turn and was ridden out. GODDARD was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn
and got up for place while no match for the winner. NUMEROLOGIST stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid six wide, had little left
and settled for show. CLAVICHORD was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. CITYONTHENILE led around the first
turn, pressed the pace to the second turn and tired. SILVERBULLITBADGER stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. SPINNING BLACK
lagged while racing outside, lacked a bid and was not a threat. NORTHERN QUEST was fractious in the gate, was outrun and showed little.

the second turn, fell back and held for place. HENNESSY LOOKER RF veered in at the start, vied two across to the second turn, inched clear and was
outclosed. COMING ABSTRACTION was carried out entering the first turn, raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. WEALTH N HEALTH
stalked the pace, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. ARTFUL CRITIC stalked the pace, flattened out and dropped back. SIXTH GEAR dwelt at the
start, raced far back early and improved position. MAXIMUM BULL was taken wide into the first turn and was not a factor. DANJERUS STORM was pushed
in at the start, raced mid pack inside, tired and was not urged late. GRIFTER lost his rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change

steady effort and improved positon. EAST RAND raced mid pack, offered a mild bid and came up empty. K P AIM HIGH broke in and bumped at the start,
stalked the pace and tired into the final turn. LIMONITE vied two across, tired into the final turn and gave way. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP broke out and
bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. BAROSSA was not a factor. ELLIOT bumped and was squeezed at the start and outrun.

VERMEIL saved ground, bid inside on the turn, angled out, closed through traffic and got up in the final strides. MACHO QUEEN was hustled along to set a
pressured pace, inched clear along the backstretch, led late and was caught. UPDIP advanced around the second turn, surged late and was gaining
ground. SHE HAD A SECRET stalked the pace, bid inside and hung late. MORATTA was void of early speed, finished well and improved position.
MIDNIGHT DARE was not a factor. SAGANAKI pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out. CANDIED JOULE was never far back, went five wide
on the turn, weakened and faded. QUEEN MYSTIC vied two across, fell back along the backstretch and gave way on the turn. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE was
