Footnotes
LUSMA broke in a bit at the start and crowded EL CANELO, was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path into
the turn, inched closer to CORAL CAT in upper stretch, drew to even terms with that rival inside of the furlong marker, dueled to deep stretch, took a narrow
lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly held on in the final stages to prevail. CORAL CAT broke sharply and showed speed to dictate terms in
the early stages, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, came under pressure from LUSMA in upper stretch, met that bid at the furlong marker, dueled to
deep stretch, lost the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and was gamely bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest. HALO RANDO chased the
decent early pace into the turn, was a bit green and hard to place along the bend, swung three wide for the drive, raced on the left lead in the stretch, could
not impact the top two in the final stages and ran on to secure third. TWELVE VOLT broke out at the start, lacked early speed, swung two wide into the
stretch, ran evenly in the drive and was outfinished for third. EL CANELO crowded at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase from the second flight
into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, chased the leaders into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. DADS DREAM raced close to the decent
early pace while outside of rivals, lost ground while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SPUN BEAUTIFUL sent to establish the early lead, showed the way to the turn, set solid fractions while well handled through the bend, drew to a clear at
mid-stretch while kept to moderate urging, kept to task to deep stretch and drew away in the final stages. TORREY'S GIRL bobbled at the start and was off
a step slowly, chased from the rear into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, was coaxed along two wide into the drive, could not make headway on
the winner in the stretch and ran on to be second best. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly, ceded the early lead to SPUN BEAUTIFUL and stalked that
rival through solid early fractions, came three wide into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker, ran evenly in the final stages and was outfinished,
while clear of the rest for third. TIZ A TIGER chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace
in the drive and gave way. SMILING SALSA chased the solid early pace, raced three wide into the turn, shifted in leaving the quarter marker, was coaxed
two wide into the stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
STEIN'S GIRL took back off of the solid early pace, tracked the leading pair through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, was asked for run
two wide at the top of the lane, improved position nearing the furlong pole, responded to steady urging in the drive, closed fast inside of the
sixteenth-marker, caught SPANISH CHANNEL in deep stretch and kept to task in the end to prevail. SPANISH CHANNEL drifted in at the break and
bothered DANGEROUS ILLUSION, showed early speed and dictated terms into the first turn, ceded the lead to FANTASTIC SECRET into the backstretch
run and stalked that rival through decent fractions to the half-mile marker, chased the pacesetter to the quarter pole, loomed in upper stretch and assumed
command nearing the furlong marker, was all out approaching the sixteenth-pole, could not hold off STEIN'S GIRL in deep stretch and just held for second
at the finish. DANGEROUS ILLUSION was bothered by SPANISH CHANNEL at the start, took up and was away slowly, was unhurried while saving ground
through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the quarter pole, was full of run approaching mid-stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker,
split foes at the sixteenth-pole, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for second at the wire. FANTASTIC SECRET forwardly placed in the early
running, contested the pace with SPANISH CHANNEL then assumed command into the backstretch run, set solid fractions while on a clear lead into the far
turn, extended the lead heading to the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, battled with SPANISH CHANNEL to the furlong pole, could not
keep pace in deep stretch and weakened. CALIFORNIA GIGI settled off of the early pace, was caught four wide into the first turn then raced in the three
path into the backstretch run, tracked the solid fractions to the half-mile marker, lost ground while two then three wide along the far turn, re-rallied in the
stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but was unable to impact the top three. MOONSHINE CAT allowed to settle in the early running, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, was steered three wide into the far turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, was gaining
in the final stages but was unable to threaten. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED
THAT SPANISH CHANNEL IMPEDED DANGEROUS ILLUSION LEAVING THE BREAK, COSTING DANGEROUS ILLUSION THE OPPORTUNITY OF A
BETTER PLACING AND UNANIMOUSLY RULED THAT SPANISH CHANNEL BE DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR
INTERFERENCE.

BOLD DAUGHTER settled off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn and came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position
heading to the half-mile marker, was coaxed three then four wide along the second turn, advanced and came within aim at mid-stretch, confronted
FINNLEY'S KITTEN nearing the sixteenth-marker, drifted in under firm hand urging in deep stretch, bumped FINNLEY'S KITTEN and surged in the final
strides to prevail. FINNLEY'S KITTEN broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, ceded the lead to LYINATTHEBAR into the first turn and stalked
that rival through moderate fractions into the backstretch run, attended to the pace into the far turn, was roused two wide heading to the quarter marker,
assumed command at the top of the lane, was set down at mid-stretch, switched to the left lead inside of the furlong pole, was confronted by BOLD
DAUGHTER nearing the sixteenth-pole, battled against that rival to deep stretch, was bumped and forced in a path by the drifting BOLD DAUGHTER and
was outfinished in the final strides, while just holding for second. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY settled just off of the early pace, raced three wide along the first
turn, maintained her position through the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the second turn, came in a bit tight and waited for racing room
approaching the top of the stretch, angled three wide for the drive, closed willingly in the stretch and just missed for second at the finish. ELA CALIMERA
MOU unhurried in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run, was steered four wide into the far turn, made a steady gain to the quarter
marker, was roused five wide into the stretch, continued to gain heading to mid-stretch, lacked a final response in the drive and was outkicked.
LYINATTHEBAR forwardly placed in the early running, assumed command into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, showed
the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. KOKO'S MOM settled off of
the early pace while not far back, improved position on the backstretch run while saving ground, continued her rail trip along the far turn, ran evenly into the
stretch and did not produce a late rally.

Footnotes
DOS VICIOS was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate fractions into the backstretch run, attended to the pace to the half-mile pole,
advanced to confront NEVER HAD I EVER at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, had the lead
cut into a bit in the final stages but kept to task in deep stretch and held safely for the win. EFFECTIVE GIG was unhurried early on, saved ground while
trailing through the backstretch run, was steered three then four wide along the second turn, swung widest into the drive, chased DOS VICIOS to
mid-stretch, was able to cut into that rival's margin in deep stretch but could not reel him in and was outfinished, while holding well in the end for second.
WILD BILLY D lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early pace and raced between rivals into the first turn, was never far back
through the backstretch run, continued to run between foes into the second turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground heading
to mid-stretch, re-rallied in the final stages but was outclosed by EFFECTIVE GIG and missed for second. SNAKE ISLAND settled just off of the early pace
while not far back, stalked the moderate fractions from a ground saving position through the backstretch run, advanced along the rail on the second turn,
was outrun into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. EXTRA INNINGS hopped leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the early pace while
three deep on the first turn, advanced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid
into the stretch and gave way. NEVER HAD I EVER broke alertly and dictated terms in the early going, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run,
came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the far turn and tired in the stretch drive.

LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS broke alertly, showed good early speed and dueled for pace duties into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out fast
fractions to the quarter pole, drifted out to the three path in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds, kept to task to deep stretch, was fully
extended in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. AMANOFMYSTATURE tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, saved ground
while advancing on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker, rallied in the late stages, came within aim of
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS in the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. IMPLICITLY allowed to settle in the early running,
advanced three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, continued to gain ground to mid-stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker while
widest, shifted in in deep stretch, could not reel in the top two in the final stages and was up in time to secure third. OBVIOUS forwardly placed in the early
running, stalked the fast pace from a two wide path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong pole, was outkicked in the final stages
and was outfinished for third. HAY JUAN was prominent in the early running, pressed the quick pace to the turn, drifted out on the bend and lost ground
approaching the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and lacked a late rally. DEALERS HAND chased the quick early
pace, lost position while two wide on the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, was gaining late but did not threaten. MR. CLUTCH chased the
fast early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground and lacked a late response. FULLY LOADED broke in the air at the start, spotted the field in the
early stages and trailed to the turn, showed late interest in the stretch and made up ground in the final furlong but did not factor.

Footnotes
CHAOKOON tracked the fast early pace from the inside, improved position along the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, loomed at the furlong
marker, overtook BRONZE ONE nearing the sixteenth-pole and drove clear in the late stages. BRONZE ONE sent to show early speed, dictated terms to
the turn and opened to a clear lead heading to the bend, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, felt pressure from CHAOKOON nearing the
furlong pole, was overtaken approaching the sixteenth-marker and could not keep pace with the winner in the late stages while besting the rest. WEE
BEASTIE chased from the second flight in the early going, saved ground to the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, was not able to impact the
top two and finished evenly in the drive while holding for third at the finish. ONE LITTLE INDIAN off slowly leaving the start, lacked early speed heading to
the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, improved position at mid-stretch, was gaining in the final stages and missed for third. ONE BIG SMILE broke
out at the start and crowded ANTICIPATED, chased the fast early pace, raced outside of rivals along the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was outrun
to the furlong pole and lacked a late rally. ANTICIPATED was crowded at the start by ONE BIG SMILE and was away slowly, trailed in the early running,
saved ground to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch. CASH'S CAT chased the fast early pace, lost position on the turn while two wide,
came three wide into the stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GAME TIME broke well, assumed command into the first turn, was well handled while setting comfortable fractions through the first half mile, maintained the
lead through the far turn, responded to intermittent urging down the late and was widening at the finish. COUSIN RICHIE was keen to run on early but did
not fight the rider, tracked GAME TIME down the backstretch and through the far turn, was put into a drive passing the quarter pole, came into the stretch on
the wrong lead, and had trouble changing leads throughout the stretch run but held on well for second. PRINCE ABU DHABI lagged at the back of the
compact field through the early stages slipped through an opening on the rail heading into the far turn, made a nice run through the turn to get into
contention, swung out to the three path for the stretch run, had trouble changing leads down the stretch but still ran on well to just miss second.
PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) broke best but ceded the lead to GAME TIME into the clubhouse turn, was content to track from the middle of the field to the
far turn, lost some ground as the pace quickened then ran on well but was unable to improve. PASSARANDO raced two wide into the first turn, was being
asked to stay close to the pace down the backstretch, responded when put into a drive with about three furlongs to run and maintained the run but was
unable to threaten.

Footnotes
LIVERMORE HEAT raced mid-pack through the first quarter while being prompted to keep up, made a clean run in the two path through the turn, got a
dream run turning for home and finished strongly under strong handling despite racing on the wrong lead through much of the stretch run. MOTOWN
CLASSIC broke best, ceded the lead but raced up close while three wide, was put into a drive from the three-eighths, swung four wide into the stretch and
finished up well enough to gain the place. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY broke well, attended the early pace just behind the lone pacesetter, moved up to engage
passing the quarter pole with MOTOWN CLASSIC also challenging to the outside and LIVERMORE HEAT to the inside, held a brief lead at the top of the
stretch but was outfinished. LUCKY RAPPER devoid of early speed, raced well behind for a half mile, responded to strong urging down the lane and was
gaining ground in the end. NOTCH hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, lagged behind the field down the backstretch, came under a hard ride
before the half mile marker, kept to task and advanced position in the late stages. EASTER COMMAND broke out at the start, tracked from well behind the
early pace, held position to the turn then had nothing left for the stretch run. ANOTHER STRIKE broke in a tangle then was sent to the front once righted,
was left alone on the lead to the turn while setting solid fractions, was challenged at the head of the stretch and gave way readily.
