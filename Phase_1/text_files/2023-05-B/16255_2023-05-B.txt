Footnotes
CAESARTHERULER sped to the lead at the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace with HEZA WILD RIDE not far behind up the
backstretch, remained the leader around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened to a commanding margin a furlong out then held late over
fast gaining runner up. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was unhurried in early stages and raced in the back, began to edge a bit closer late on the far turn,
hustled along three to four wide into the lane, rallied strongly along the outside and just missed. MINISTRY OF ART settled nicely off the top pair up the
backstretch, asked to pick up the tempo midway around the far turn, hustled along three wide into the drive and held a share. BOTTOMLESS raced off the
early pace, hustled up two wide late on the far turn, angled out wider in the drive and lacked a needed rally. HEZA WILD RIDE was forwardly placed racing
just off the eventual winner up the backstretch, given cue to go after the leader midway around the far turn, had no kick left in reserve and steadily
weakened in the lane. MY BOBBY MCGEE raced off the pace, saved ground entering the lane and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
DREAMINONTHENILE pressed the pace up the backstretch then advanced to the lead entering the turn, held clear two wide entering upper stretch,
widened to a commanding margin a furlong out and kept to task. LAVENDER LIL was unhurried in opening stages and raced in the back, picked up the
tempo along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner and advanced into contention, sustained a steady bid and finished clearly second best. DIAMOND OF
EKATI rated off the top two flights late on the backstretch, hustled up four wide approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane and secured a
share. BIT A BAD NEWS raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. RISKY WHISKY tracked the top pair near
the inside in early stages, got in traffic midway around the turn, steadied sharply approaching the quarter pole and gaveway. NAUTICAL MISS raced in
contention up the backstretch, made a move near the quarter pole, gained position but failed to sustain bid into the lane. KAYLOR set a pressured pace up
the backstretch, got headed entering the turn and steadily faltered.

SLUSHY tracked the leader in early stages and hustled up around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, took command mid-way through the stretch run
and finished going away. JAZZ BRUNCH sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, turned two wide into
the drive, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch, stayed on and finished clearly second best. NOSTALGIA raced in contention through early stages,
hustled along two to three wide entering the lane, flattened off the top pair and just lasted for show. XCARET lacked speed in the early going, hustled along
around the turn, shifted out wider for the drive, showed late interest and just missed show. UNHERDOF was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace,

TIME MACHINE set a pressured pace holding a slim lead along the inside, edged away to clearer command around the turn, held clear a furlong out and
kept to task. OCEAN RIDE was a step slow at the start and hustled up into closer contention, settled well placed tracking the top flight up the backstretch,
came under a ride nearing the quarter pole, sustained bid under firm handling in the stretch run and produced a solid finish. RICKEY B pressed the pace
three wide in early stages, continued to chase after the leader entering the lane, stayed on and cleared the rest. OURBESTFRIEND D L applied pace
pressure to the eventual winner in early stages, saved ground along the rail around the turn then weakened in the lane. AMERICAIN JOEY raced in the
back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
KINGSWOOD set a pressured pace in early stages, edged away and repelled rivals around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, pulled away to clear
command and kept to task. UNREAL tracked the pace along the inside, sustained bid into the lane, was no match for clear winner but dug in and captured
place. ABUNDANT was not too far back in early stages, hustled up two wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and got edged for place. LUCKY
DUDE was a bit keen in early stages and tugged up the backstretch, advanced into close contention midway around the turn, ran on into the lane and hot
edged out for runner up spots. GOLDEN LUNA applied pace pressure in early stages, chased after the eventual winner around the turn then faded in the
lane. GABRIEL'S LEGEND trailed in early stages and never reached contention. IMPRESSOR got pinched back at the start and tracked not too far off the
early pace, continued to chase in range around the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
TOPPER T took over the lead shortly after the start and settled nicely on top up the backstretch, continued with the clear advantage still unasked around the
turn, saved ground entering the lane, responded gamely when roused for more, widened to a commanding margin and kept clear under steady pressure.
BASIC CHANCE rated off the pace in early stages, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, was no match for clear winner but dug in
gamely to capture place. OUR LAST CHANCE broke sharply from the outside then conceded position to TOPPER T, tracked rival up the backstretch,
hustled up around the turn, dug in three deep under firm encouragement and just missed place. SIR WALLY WALLY tracked the top trio through early
stages, given cue two wide entering the lane, raced in contention for the runner up spot then weakened in the final sixteenth. WOKE UP IN LOVE raced off
the pace, swung five wide into the lane and lacked needed rally. MINECRAFT MANIAC raced in or near the back, came two wide into the lane and never
menaced. TIN BADGE was forwardly placed along the inside in early stages, stayed on around the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
JAYSKER tracked the top pair up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane, dug in determinedly and got by
the leader late. JUSTA STREAK advanced along the inside after opening stages to engage rival for the early lead, battled on around the turn, shook free
turning for home, held clear a furlong out then got edged out in final strides. ALLEN'S ROCKET raced four wide off the top trio midway around the turn,
hustled up into the lane, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for a share. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced along the rail in a compact field in early stages,
saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and needed more for late impact. TOSKA'S RULER briefly led the way then took on the
challenge of JUSTA STREAK after opening stages, dueled outside of rival around the turn then weakened in the lane. CHINLEE raced near midpack
through middle stages, saved ground around the turn and failed to rally in the lane. WAR RON raced three wide in close contention in early stages, flattened
around the turn and lacked a rally in the lane. SHIPS ON FIRE raced off the pace, came two wide into the lane and never threatened.
