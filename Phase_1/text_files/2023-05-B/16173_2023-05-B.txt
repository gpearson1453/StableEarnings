Footnotes
SOULSTONE tracked leader to the half, drew clear to the far turn, stayed on gamely in the final furlong to stay clear under good handling. BACK UP
GHOST no hurry from third spot to the turn, rallied on the wrong lead from the quarter pole to eighth pole to pull even with the winner but could not match
strides with the winner and settled for the place spot while clearly best of the rest. JOEZINE never menaced while far back for show spot in the stretch run.
SAINT SISTA was anxious behind gate and reluctant to load, showed good speed to half but folded from that point.

CAPPY HOUR bit tardy start, trailed to the half, moved up steadily and cleared in the late stages. LUCKYINKENTUCKY four wide into first turn, good
position backstretch, no match. FULCO chased leader to the half but weakened in the stretch for show. THIS ILL DEFEND raced along evenly inside to far
turn, in tight backed out evenly. KING'S MISCHIEF quick to the front, pace to far turn, gave way readily in stretch. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX never factored
throughout.

angled out while mildly late. HONKY TONK HERO inside run to far turn, angled out stretch with good energy late. ALL ABOUT CROGE verty rank from the
gate, settled down to secure the rail to the far turn, split horses in the stretch stretch and finished up with good energy. SAN MARCO CITY had trouble from
the gate then never factored while under pressure and urged on with no response from the far turn to the finish. GOLDEN TEXT tracked to pair to the half
with nothing left and dropped back steadily from the quarter pole. The 8th race was hand timed due to a malfunction with the timing system at Belterra Park
on Thursday May 18th.
