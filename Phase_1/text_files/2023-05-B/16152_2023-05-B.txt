Footnotes
DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT unhurried early, closed with a rush in the six path through deep stretch under a hand ride and got up in the final strides. SUGAR
LOVES IT sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set the pace under pressure early, shook well clear when put to right handed urging entering the stretch
and just missed hanging on. MAP TO MY HEART bumped soon after the start, pressured the winner two wide into the turn then faded in the stretch. DEE'S
KY WILDCAT hopped at the start then bumped a few strides later, trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. OH EYE SEE close up along the inside
early, lacked the needed response. WICKED REESE stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. JUPITER ECLIPSE was no factor.

Footnotes
STONE COLD CAT unhurried early, closed willingly through the stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. JUDGE HEAD vied for the lead
three wide, loomed boldly in the six path near mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner. CLASSIC MO away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide, drifted
to the five path entering the stretch, dug in gamely but was outfinished. SPIN DOCTOR stalked the pace four wide, surged in the seven path in upper stretch
and was outfinished. DEER CREEK ROAD trailed early, swung wide and closed some ground late. REANIMATE had good early sped along the inside then
failed to respond. MUSTANG WILLIE was no factor. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA bobbled a few strides out of the gate, pressed the early pace along the rail and
was through after a half. PLATE IT UP was outrun.

MY PINK BUNNY TALE away alertly, set all the pace, turned back a strong bid from HERE COMES DOLLY in upper stretch and proved best under strong
handling. HERE COMES DOLLY never far back, surged three wide through the turn, drew on even terms for the lead outside the winner before the furlong
marker then was denied while well clear for second. DOMINUS O'S ME saved ground and finished well clear for third. LADYBUGGIN chased the pace two
wide into the turn then weakened. AUGMENTING ASSETS trailed outside and passed tiring rivals. PENNY'S TREASURE rushed to contention along the
rail before a quarter, had speed for a half then was used up. SEE YA SISTA was no factor.

RENO TOUCH stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted three wide near the quarter pole, rallied to make the lead at the furlong marker and
prevailed under mild urging. INCESSANT dueled for the lead along the inside until deep stretch then finished second best and returned bleeding from the
nostrils. MAMBO DANCER battled for the lead two wide into the stretch and faded late. MAGICGIRL unhurried early, found her best stride late between
horses. SPECIAL BEACH with the second flight two wide, went evenly. CHARGINA was no factor. BLUSHING BETTY offered a mild bid along the rail into
the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
PULPIT'S PURRFECT stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. COMMAND STRIKE
sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
PASSIONFORTREASURE trailed into the turn then closed fast along the rail through deep stretch. LIONISTIC pressed the pace two wide into the stretch
then was outfinished. PURITY with the second flight two wide, dropped inside on the turn then faded. SCATERRA with the second flight inside, weakened
on the turn. VACATION SECRET was no factor.
