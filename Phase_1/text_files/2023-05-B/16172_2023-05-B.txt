Footnotes
ACCEL ROSE got bumped at the start by GERMANY JAYVO breaking outwards, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking briefly
three wide at the nine-sixteenths and then to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch
and was leaned on and carried in to the two path before getting bumped at the three-sixteenths by HERECOMES SCARLETT, dug in under a drive between
foes steadily gaining to the finish to be up in the final jumps to the wire. BALENTINA dueled from the two path with GEORGIE'S LADIES to her outside,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and took to the inside briefly straightened away,
dug in under threat from a pair and clung to command until collared in the final strides to the finish. HERECOMES SCARLETT four then three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away leaning on ACCEL ROSE and bumping
that rival to the two path at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive outside a pair through the final furlong before ultimately being repelled in the late
stages while clear for the show honors. WELCOMETOMYWORLD stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping GERMANY JAYVO against
ACCEL ROSE, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GERMANY
JAYVO broke out at the start bumping with ACCEL ROSE then got bumped by WELCOMETOMYWORLD, who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased
just off the inside, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. GEORGIE'S LADIES dueled three then two wide with BALENTINA to her inside,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch shaken off and folded. AKIVA hard to load prior to the start, chased
five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased to the finish.

Footnotes
DONTBELATE was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, gained to make a bid near the quarter-pole, took over into
upper stretch then shook clear, drew away into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead while drifting out late and was much the best.
CARIBBEAN (AUS) settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out some under a
left-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker and was along for the place. MUSICAL HEART stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the
leader in the three path on the turn, took a slim advantage at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. FOREVER WICKED dropped back after the start then was urged along towards the rear, went around
most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROYAL REALM broke a bit slow, settled off
the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. AMERICAN LINCOLN was urged along at the rear, went three wide for most of the
turn then moved to the four path, came five wide into the stretch then shifted a bit further out and was no factor. MISTER WINSTON tossed his head at the
start but broke with the field, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back under urging while along the rail on the turn and retreated. SWIFT TAP went to
the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
GYPSY JANIE two to three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front from the seven-sixteenths taking command with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide
into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, drew clear under a drive to prevail. VALLARAND prompted the pace of REDZILLA from the outside in
the two path, advanced to take over command with nine-sixteenths to go and showed the way coming under growing pressure herself midway on the turn,
yielded the front at the five-sixteenths and swung three to four wide into upper stretch before tipping to the five path straightened away, then ran on to chase
the winner home safe for the place honors. GRINGOTTS bobbled at the break, raced three wide early on until forced to steady and alter out when impeded
five and a half furlongs from home by TWICE SMITTEN and lost about a length of position, continued four to five wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. TWICE SMITTEN coaxed from the
gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked three wide with five and a half furlongs to go impeding GRINGOTTS and forcing that
foe to steady and alter out losing about a length of momentum and ground, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch
and weakened. KEEN DANCER five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing midway on the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CARLY HUSTLE three wide early,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing tipped to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. TRADE SECRET chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. REDZILLA
coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed showing the way along the inside under pressure from VALLARAND to the outside, got headed by that rival with
nine-sixteenths to run and retreated readily through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MISS KRISTY broke a bit awkwardly but with the field, saved ground around the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, came under urging in the two path on
the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then bumped with a foe while gaining around the three-sixteenths, rallied into the final furlong, closed strongly to
get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. LOST LUGGAGE was bumped at the start and forced out, rounded the
opening bend in the three path, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased outside in the drive
and finished willingly for the place. ANILEATE made light contact with foes at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was
asked in the two path on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, led until outside the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and lost the place while able to get the show. JOEYBIGNOSE bumped with a rival at the start, went two to three wide on
the first turn, settled towards the front, moved closer inside the five-eighths pole, made an outside bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened.
ROSEMARY POTATOES saved ground on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, moved closer inside the five-eighths then made a bid while
off the rail with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, led into the stretch then lost the advantage to the runner-up, dropped back into the final
furlong and tired. INTO TOURING came out at the start and bumped lightly with a foe, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved to the two
path late on that bend, gained four wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position under a drive into the final furlong but lacked the needed
response and came up empty. IRONY bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was
roused while three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HEARTBURN was forced out at the start, traveled
four wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, angled in inside the five-eighths pole, saved ground while given her cue on the far turn, turned
into the stretch in the two path then bumped with the winner and came up empty. CHAMPAGNE POETRY bumped with a rival at the start, sped clear in the
two path on the first turn, showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied inside under urging on the far turn and gave
way.

Footnotes
SOLIB three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out,
then edged away to the finish kept to task. MADDIE'S GRACE chased three to four wide advancing on the leader midway on the turn before being put to
coaxing when taking command at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair to the outside and was collared
a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. BELLA PRINCIPESSA three to four wide in pursuit, offered up a bid through the latter portion of the turn
and was let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive loosely between foes a furlong out, kept on to secure the show honors
clear of the rest. BUSTIN BULLET two to three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. UP HER
SLEEVE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three
wide for home, offered no response. RUM RUNNER READY chased along the inside patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch then weakened through to the finish. GAME THEORY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and offered no kick. LOLA FLO veered out at the start, showed the way showing speed for the opening half
mile, got displaced from command at the five-sixteenths and backed away quickly before taking the two path into upper stretch, then folded in the stretch.
PERFECT SENORITA veered out at the start filling the space left vacant by LOLA FLO, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs
from home, went three wide into upper stretch and tired.

FIRELINE came inward while off a half-step slow, established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths then angled three wide, gained to make a bid outside of the leader into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop inside the
three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop while reaching even terms outside the sixteenth-pole, gained a narrow advantage into the final sixteenth
and proved best under good handling. TOUGH STREET went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the tempo in the two path on
the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, was given one pop of a left-handed crop under threat
outside the furlong marker then switched to a right-handed crop, lost the advantage into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place.
VIENNA CODE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened while
clearly best of the rest. LAY THE GROUNDWORK settled on the inside, tugged on the bit some near the five-eighths, shifted out over heels at the
nine-sixteenths, moved from the two path to the four path near the seven-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the stretch and came up empty. TONED UP
was last into stride, settled at the rear, angled in near the three-quarter pole, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. AMITY ISLAND was
hustled from the gate then coaxed along just off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, was urged four then five wide on the turn and retreated.

SYNTHESIS got bumped at the start by THREE TWO ZONE, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
advanced and swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge taking command a furlong out, was in the midst of being shown the stick to the
right side nearing the sixteenth marker when the rider lost the handle on it while edging away to the finish kept to task. GUN IT pressed the pace of
FOLLOWING SEA from the outside four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, advanced to knock heads through
the bend coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over the front and swung four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared at the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. FOLLOWING SEA established the front and showed
the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from GUN IT to the outside through swift splits, got engaged in head to head combat near the midway
point on the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and went three then two wide straightened away into
upper stretch, dug in under a light drive and weakened to the finish. CHESTERTOWN chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three
wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. THREE TWO ZONE broke in at the
start bumping SYNTHESIS, chased just off the inside briefly until tucked inside five furlongs out, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three
wide at the head of the stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
REGAL REALM prompted the pace while well out in the course, vied in the four then three path on the turn, took over when set down into upper stretch,
shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held determinedly under strong
urging. MISS CAROL ANN (IRE) was rated just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn, was asked after turning into the stretch,
chased behind the leader into the final furlong then moved out from behind that foe and narrowly earned the place. BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE) was well placed
just off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, chased outside under a drive in the stretch and was
out-kicked then just missed the place while able to get the show. BREEZE EASY (GB) was taken under a snug hold early then rated off the pace, dropped
back outside the five-eighths then bobbled nearing the five-eighths marker, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, chased the
winner in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the last spot in the superfecta. MRS. GREEN went to the front, showed the way down
the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. MISCHIEVOUS DREAM settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. SAIL BY settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also
lacked the needed response. WONKA settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. IN MY
OPINION was urged early then settled at the back, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
QUEENS OVER THREES steadied at the start in behind GOTHAM GRAY who broke inwards taking over her lane, chased along the inside from mid pack,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, tipped out straightened away, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge inside
the final furlong and was just up over a pair of rivals on the wire. GOTHAM GRAY broke in at the start forcing QUEENS OVER THREES to steady off her
heels, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch and then took to the
two path straightened away, dug in under a drive steadily gaining on the leader, was just in the midst of taking command steps from the finish when nosed
out herself and just missed on the line. DANCE WITH ME BABE showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under threat clinging stubbornly to command, then got nailed in the final jumps by a pair of foes and was forced to settle for the show honors.
PAUCILOQUENT chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, closed well to the finish. GIGGLING
GHOST chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, ran on through to the wire. APRIL FIRST five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly to the end. PUREST PERFORMANCE struck the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and was outfinished in the late stages. MY CARA MIA MINE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through
the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DREAMING OF CARLI got bumped at
the start by GRACEFULNESS, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide, got let out swinging five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact. MARY KATHERINE three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no response.
MIZZ ME four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GRACEFULNESS broke
in at the start bumping DREAMING OF CARLI, chased five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and never
threatened.
