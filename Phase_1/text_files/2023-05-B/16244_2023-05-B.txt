Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside and held gamely in the stretch drive under all out pressure. ALL chased
the early pace near the inside, moved up while continuing to race near the rail past the quarter pole, angled three wide through the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. BOUNDFORJAMAICA chased the early going, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled in to race near the rail and moved
up late. CAT BANDIT coaxed along throughout and had not enough in the drive while racing four deep. JAYCEE was coaxed along two wide, drifted out a
path heading into the lane and gave way in the drive. COASTAL STARLITE broke awkwardly, raced near the back early and lacked a bid.

PERFECT STORIES settled off the early going, advanced through the far turn from the inside and finished strongly to get up under strong encouragement
while racing near the rail. HOT RAGEOUS stalked the top pair, raced near the inside past the five sixteenths pole, swung five to six wide into the upper
stretch and finished gamely to the wire. MUCHA WOMAN was quick to begin to set the early pace was clear into the upper stretch and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. CAROLINA MIA chased the early leader while being coaxed along, was injured near the eighth pole, was pulled up and had to be vanned
off.

HARBOR SKY was off a step slow, recovered quickly to take command from the inside, raced well clear near the eighth pole and kept on strongly to the
wire under steady handling. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE was off a step slow, raced near the inside through the far turn, angled to race four wide through the
upper stretch but was no match for the winner. SASQUATCH RIDE raced near the back of the pack early on, was floated out at the quarter marker, came
six wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position. DAD BOD prompted the early leader two deep and weakened in the stretch drive.
TRABIESO AVELITO settled off the early going, raced near the inside and lacked a bid.

EM N HOLL'S FIESTA was rated early on under a firm hold, asked through the far turn and got up late under strong handling while racing near the rail.
CARMEL BY THE SEA tracked the early leader racing two deep, led near the ei/8ghth pole and missed in a game effort. MISS BELLIMBUSTO settled off
the early going, challenged three wide near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. MASTERY KAT was unhurried early on, raced three to four
wide and had not enough in the drive. JUST A LITTLE LUCK showed good early foot, drifted a bit past the seven eighths pole, led down the backstretch and
tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
BLUE SILVER showed good early foot to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear late under steady pressure. STRAIT OF GEORGIA hard to place
while rank early, chased through the far turn and couldn't cut into the leader to finish second best racing two to three wide. CORAZON DE LUCIA was off a
step slow, settled near the back early on, advanced through the far turn and improved position while racing three to four deep. WAY TOO HOT raced mid
pack early, steadied while in tight quarters entering the backstretch run, lacked room in upper stretch, moved up three wide between rivals in the drive and
had not enough. MOVIETIME settled early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, altered nearing the eighth pole and raced evenly late with no
closing bid. SILENT BULLET stalked the pace and faded while racing two wide. SMUGGLER'S COVE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
AIRKITA was coaxed along four wide from the outside of foes, dug in late and edged up clear under strong handling. A PERFECT PATH pressed the early
pace raced three wide and kept on willingly to the wire. CALIGRAPHY vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way grudgingly late. FLYING SYLVIA
was off a step slow, raced near the inside through the upper stretch and raced evenly late. JACQUELINE COCHRAN was off slowly, raced near the back of
the pack early, raced three to four deep and gained ground late. CAUSEWAY GIRL broke through the gate pre-race, was a bit reluctant to load, raced mid
pack early on, was four deep into the upper stretch and had no late solid bid. DARCEES DARLING was off slowly, trailed early and lacked a bid. DON'S
DAYNA pressed the early pace between and faded.
