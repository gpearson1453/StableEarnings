back/angled out quarter pole probably best. STRONG PROFILE broke tardy, rushed between horses to the turn, game effort. VIVI BRASS pressed leader to
turn, shuffled back turn, re-rallied from rail. SWEET TORI PAT tried to keep up from between horses to the turn, faltered back. ONE MORE SISTER tried to
keep up from inside to the turn, gave way readily. ARAGON saved ground early, steadied along inside, angled out and rushed to the turn and gave way
readily in the stretch run.
