MAKEITORBREAKIT broke sharply and settled off the clear leader while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to close the gap on the
pacesetter approaching the final turn, quickly swept to the lead leaving the final turn, and held EYE BE SEEING YOU safely at bay late to prove best. EYE
BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pacesetter while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn,
and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. DEBATABLE was off a step slow and trailed the field into the backstretch, rallied five
wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and closed determinedly seven wide in the drive while gaining late. GWEN away well, but settled well
off the quick early pace entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. MONTE away alertly and
sprinted to a clear lead in the opening strides, continued in the run down the backstretch on a long lead, began to shorten stride entering the final turn, was
quickly overtaken leaving the turn, and had nothing left for the drive.

BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide entering the
lane, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove best. REMEMBERTHEALAMO broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but battled gamely one out from the rail in
the lane, before drifting out nearing the wire and bumping with ROLLIE'S SPIRIT, and finished on even terms with that foe. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT away well and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the
drive while getting bumped late, and finished on even terms with REMEMBERTHEALAMO. THERE GOES MY HERO away alertly and tracked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive.
ATOMIC HAZE settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn,
tipped four wide entering the stretch, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CHAMPIOSA settled off the early leaders while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, was asked to keep up in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

APPELLANT settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled his way into a stalking position entering the
second turn, began to advance one out from the rail midway down the backside, tipped three wide to launch his bid entering the final turn, assumed control
entering the lane, and drew clear in the drive under confident handling. GORKY PARK settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through
the stretch the first time, moved into a stalking trip entering the second turn, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two
wide in the drive to hold the place. MCMURPHY broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the lane the first time while saving ground at the rail,
dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, rallied from just off the rail through the turn, and closed with late interest three wide in the drive to garner a
share. DON WITH THE WIND away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of AVE'S IN COMMAND entering the first turn, continued to force the
issue through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and faded in the late
stages. AVE'S IN COMMAND away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the final turn, was

FLORIDA GATOR settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, tipped
outside leaving the turn, and closed with a rush four wide in the drive to prove best. SMART LAD stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while
racing just out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed gamely five wide in the drive to get up for the place. SIR
BREGOVIC away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering the backstretch, continued to battle two wide from between rivals for the lead entering
the final turn, put away his pace rivals entering the stretch, and gave way grudgingly late while proving best of the rest. FOREIGN PROTOCOL away well
and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final
turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and finished two wide in the drive. SLEW'S BAK broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace
while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing along the
rail in the drive. BOLD ARCH stumbled badly in the opening strides to get away poorly, rushed up three wide entering the first turn and forced the issue
three wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, struggled to keep up leaving the turn, and faded in the late stages.

INDYETTA away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, took a narrow
advantage into the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. SHESBOURBONONICE broke sharply, but was allowed to settle well back of the
contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped four wide
entering the lane, and closed willingly while drifting in late to get up for the place. B C CHU CHU tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, loomed a danger while racing three wide entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner in the lane, battled gamely to
garner a share. LENT ME TWENTY tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. SWEET AS HONEY raced rank in the opening strides, and trailed the field into the backstretch, rallied
two wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. STAR FINALITY away well and dueled for the lead from the
outside of INDYETTA entering the first turn, continued to force the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into the stretch run, in particular to SHESBOURBAONONICE, after review there was
no change to the original order of finish.
