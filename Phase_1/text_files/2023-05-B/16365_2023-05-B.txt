Footnotes
WHY WAIT showed early natural speed as she was the first out of the gates, was quickly challenged for the lead by an inside rival, rated off the pace in
hands in a stalking position, was given her head and asked after the half, responded willingly and took command, led the rest of the way, was slightly
challenged by a closing foe, kept on task, and pulled away for a game win. TDZ WHAT A DEAL was racing in the second tier on the outside in the three
path, stalked the early pace, angled further out in the turn, was six and seven wide in the stretch. closed but struggled to switch leads and was second best
today. MY ROYAL PRINCESS was off a step slow, was allowed to find her stride while saving ground, was gaining ground by the half, shifted out into the
five path and started to close in on the early pace, continued to gain ground and build momentum through the turn and into the stretch, was widest in the
lane and was pushed out even further by an inside drifting foe, but closed well and ran a decent third. ASPIRATIONAL made no impact. SAVANNAH'S
HERE was sent out of the one post position and pushed to gain the early lead, briefly led but was under constant pressure from an outside rival, stayed on
the rail through out, gave way late. BEAUTIFULGUATEMALA raced off the pace from the two path in the second tier, was in contention early but faded late.

Footnotes
DRAG MALIBU was the speed of the race, broke sharp and quickly took the lead and the rail, was one in front right away and willingly maintained that
position gate to wire. Much the best. THE BOYZ PRIORITY was in between horses and mid pack the first few jumps out of the gate, vied for the lead,
decided to stalk the early leader in the four path, stalked in that position into the stretch, was asked and encouraged, responded and chased the eventual
winner to the wire and earned second place honors. STRUTTIN APRIORITY raced from the inside along the rail, was mid pack early on, was allowed to
race at his pace until the half mile pole, inched out at the quarter pole and closed six wide down the lane with a mild bid. SUPER INTENSE was five wide
and racing on the outside in the middle of the field, advanced and improved position after the half mile pole, raced five wide in the stretch but didn't have
enough today. DIESEL FUEL raced widest of all and made no impact. PUNTO RAFFA VOLO had brief speed early, was racing five wide but showed little.
PIKACHU never involved. ROCKIN TAMIM trailed.

Footnotes
BITSY PERFECTMATCH settled into the middle of the field after the break while racing in the five path, raced in hands until the half mile pole, was given
her cue and willingly passed rivals on the outside and took command, happily continued through the lane and was an easy winner today. LUYV raced out of
the one post position, found her stride quickly, advanced up the rail behind horses, had pressure on her out side, stayed tucked in the pocket along the rail
and waited for racing room, seized the opportunity and gamely passed through a hole before it closed up, accelerated into the stretch and closed up the rail,
ran a bit green in deep stretch, didn't catch the winner this time but ran a game race and earned a well deserved second. LITTLE Z was off the pace was far
back, raced from the four path through out, moved at the half but did have enough. BOSTON MILLIE brief speed, raced three wide, challenged from the
outside, had the lead forr a few strides then faltered. JENNYSBIGBABY showed little. AFLEET CHARLENE had an awkward start, raced off the pace, made
no impacat. HOLIDAY FLOWERS was never involved.

Footnotes
TRACK SMART was racing along the rail mid pack after the break, saved ground, shifted out a the half mile marker, launched bid, circled, was four wide
into the stretch, was determined and encouraged, kept closing in on the leader, gaining ground with each stride, was a few strides from the wire, was
gathered up in a strong hand ride, pushed on, was able to get up for the lead in the last stride. Strong finish, hard earned win. GLENN'S JUMPER showed
his speed and easily took the lead, raced from the outside, angled into the rail briefly putting one of his foes on alert, continued into the stretch and raced
along the rail, was almost an uncontested winner but was caught by a fast closing outside rival and just missed. TRIPPER JOHN stalked the early pace from
the two path, was just off the leader along the inside, had to steady when the eventual winner dropped down to gain better positioning, continued to drift out
and was never involved after that. YES BAB off slow, saved ground. PLATINUM EQUITY showed little. PER RULING #25065 FROM THE LOUISIANA
RACING COMMISSION, TRACK SMART WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
OH MY ACHING ARCH raced two wide, behind the early leaders, was patiently waiting for the cue, edged out at the quarter pole, improved position while
racing six wide into the stretch, drew along the side of the early leaders at the sixteenth pole, was asked, responded with an explosive turn of foot and drew
away willingly. HUDSON'S TURN was well off the pace, raced along the rail, saved ground throughout, advanced up the rail, and closed well. PAYNT
BATTLE showed speed, stalked the leader from the outside in the four path, challenged for the lead at the three eighths pole, briefly took the lead in the
stretch after the quarter pole, and tired late. DUDE DROP KID was off a touch slow, raced two wide and was never involved. BIGTIME TEGRIDY flashed
early speed and raced along the rail and tired late. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY vied for the lead, led with constant pressure to the inside of him and tired.

ONE MORE BABY raced behind the front runners in the three path, edged out after the half, challenged from the outside at the three eighths pole, engaged
in a three way battle into the furlong ground, shook the last contender and was up for the win. SHANKINSTINE went to the lead willingly along the rail, set
the pace from within himself, was pressured through out by outside challengers, was joined by pressuring rivals, was in a three way battle all the way until
the sixteenth pole, dug in for a few more strides before tiring. PLENTY OF CENTS vied for the lead from the four path early, settled right off of the early
pace setter, inched down into the two path, advanced up next to the pace setter and was joined by another rival to his outside, engaged in a three way
battle that ran from the three eighths pole all the way to the furlong ground, where PLENT OF CENTS gave way. MORO LEGEND raced behind horse in a
stalking position from the two path, was pressured by an outside foe and folded. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE missed the break and had little impact.
THIRSTY WIND trailed. COUNTRY CUT was no menace.

Footnotes
BIRDIE CALL stalked from the outside in the two path, launched a bid near the sixteenth pole, took command late and was up for the win. CLAIRE JUNE
raced off the pace mid pack, from the two path, angled out a bit into the three path, advanced along the outside, closing ground, cleared the rest of the field
except the eventual winner by the quarter pole, chased the leader through out and settled for second. HONORARY GUEST was settled in hands off the
pace while racing two wide, improved position at the half mile pole, but sis not have enough. TAY TAY'S BABY stalked the early pace while racing along the
rail, angled out five side in the stretch but to no avail. C. C. HARBOR trailed early and improved slightly while closing. SAVVY SHIPMAN was no factor.
SULWE raced from the three path mid pack and had little impact. COLD NIGHT AIR vied for the early lead, attended the pace, saved ground, faltered late.
