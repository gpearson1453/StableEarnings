Footnotes
IT FACTOR tracked the pace early, took over command near the quarter pole, was in the four path into the lane and drew clear late in the stretch under a
steady drive. DONTMESSWITHJAMMER was steadied back a bit early on, chased the pace, made a bid nearing the lane, was in the five path into the lane
and no match for the winner late in the stretch run. WEST COASTER chased the pace early, swung into the six path entering the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but flattened out late in the drive. DELANEY'S GRACE set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run.
STELLAR NOVA broke out at the start, stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. SAIDAR was never a threat.
WRITTEN CONSENT was steadied into the first turn from the inside and never a factor thereafter. D'ORO FOREVER was bumped at the start and was
through after a half.
