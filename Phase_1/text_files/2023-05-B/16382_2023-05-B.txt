Footnotes
BUTTONWOOD TREE broke alertly and was hustled to establish the early lead, was well handled through the backstretch run while setting decent
fractions, drew to a clear lead approaching the top of the lane, drew off in the stretch run, kept to task while a bit green in the final stages and remained clear
to the wire. START THEM UP tracked the decent early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, raced two then three wide along the second
turn, could not keep pace with BUTTONWOOD TREE in upper stretch, drifted in a bit and bumped COOPERKLIMT at mid-stretch, battled that rival for
second into deep stretch and won the nod on the wire for place. COOPERKLIMT settled in the second flight, raced two wide into the backstretch run,
slipped to the rail heading to the far turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, could not keep pace with BUTTONWOOD TREE in the drive, was bumped by
START THEM UP and came in a bit tight at the furlong pole, battled START THEM UP to the wire for second and just missed for that position, while clear in
the end for third. LIBERTY WOLF stalked the decent pace, lost ground to BUTTONWOOD TREE on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. STRAMA
took back off of the decent early pace, maintained a three wide path to the second turn and did not factor in the drive. FANTASTIC DREAM hopped leaving
the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground and did not threaten.

WOUND UP sent leaving the break, showed good early speed and dictated terms into the turn, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, drew to a
clear lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to task to deep stretch and was ridden out in the final stages to be much the best. SONOFAFINCH broke alertly,
took back to track the quick pace into the turn, gained ground while outside of rivals on the turn, chased WOUND UP into upper stretch, was no match for
the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. COUNT ASHER chased the quick early pace from the rail, gained ground approaching the quarter marker,
could not keep pace in the stretch, weakened in deep stretch and just held for third. GOOD FOCUS chased from the rear in the early stages, improved
position two wide on the turn, angled four wide for the drive, lacked a response in the stretch and just missed for third. EL BERRINCHES showed speed and
was prominent in the early running, pressed the fast pace into the turn, kept close attendance to WOUND UP along the bend, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) rated nicely off of the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn, was steered three wide into the backstretch run,
improved position at the half-mile marker and was well placed into the second turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker,
gained command at the sixteenth-marker, found more in the final stages and edged away to prevail. HOUSE OF LORDS was allowed to settle, improved
position along the backstretch run, was roused three wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages, could not reel in the winner
in deep stretch and won the nod for second in a blanket finish for the minor awards. ROBIE was forwardly placed in the early running, prompted the decent
pace into the backstretch run, kept attendance to FAR WEST into the second turn, advanced to confront FAR WEST at the quarter marker, battled for the
lead with that rival into upper stretch, dueled with FAR WEST to mid-stretch, was engaged by BLACK CASPIAN inside of the furlong pole, could not match
strides with the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker, was just edged for second on the line and just held for third. FAR WEST sent to establish the early
lead, set a decent pace into the backstretch run, was well handled while showing the way to the half-mile marker, came under pressure nearing the quarter
marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, battled from the rail into deep stretch, grudgingly gave way in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor
awards. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) settled just off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, was well placed to the half-mile
marker, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, made a mild gain into upper stretch, waited for racing room inside of the three-sixteenths pole, was
boxed in approaching mid-stretch, shifted out and found room heading to the sixteenth-marker but could not muster the needed late response. LOOKIN
FOR REVENGE took back off of the decent early pace, maintained a rail trip into the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn, was able
to make up ground in the stretch drive but did not threaten.

Footnotes
ASANO'S BACK was a step slow to begin, roused three wide on the turn with about three furlongs to run, found best stride late and won going away.
NAUGHTY NIKO pressed the pace from the two path, moved to challenge WICKLOW HILLS approaching the quarter pole, got the better of that rival with a
furlong to go but could not hold off the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. WICKLOW HILLS broke alertly, seized the early lead, set a measured
pace with NAUGHTY NIKO in close pursuit, answered when challenged by that rival passing the quarter pole then weakened in deep stretch and held safely
for third. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE took up slightly when WICKLOW HILLS came over just after the break, was keen to go on but held up behind horses,
raced in the rear while not far back, checked again going into the turn and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
DULCE EMMA rated kindly from the second flight in the early stages, was well placed while two wide between runners on the turn, was roused three wide
into the stretch, advanced and came within aim at the furlong grounds, responded to steady urging and rallied in deep stretch, surged in the final strides and
won the nod on the wire to prevail. MARILYN'S SMILE was allowed to settle in the early running, improved position two wide on the turn, came in tight and
waited for racing room in upper stretch, dove to the rail inside of the furlong marker, vied for the lead in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while
holding for the place. DENIM IN GOLD was prominent in the early stages, stalked REDSTWIRLINGDANCER into the turn then dueled with that rival to the
quarter marker while between runners, was given her cue in upper stretch and took command at the furlong pole, was confronted by DULCE EMMA nearing
the sixteenth-marker, met that bid to deep stretch but could not keep pace in the final strides and was just edged out for the win and place. QUEEN
MOLOTOV was bumped at the start by LA VIKINA then in turn bumped BLUSHING BAY and was off a step slowly, rushed up in the early going and tracked
the fast pace outside of rivals into the turn, was hard to place on the turn and drifted to the four path along the bend, recovered and was coaxed four wide
into the stretch, lost position heading to mid-stretch, re-rallied in the final stages but was not able to impact the leaders at the finish. LA VIKINA broke in at
the start and bumped QUEEN MOLOTOV, chased the fast early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and was gaining
in the final stages. LAGATHA tracked the fast early pace from the inside, advanced along the turn, waited for racing room in upper stretch, found room
inside of the furlong pole but could not muster the needed late response. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke sharply, showed good early speed and dictated
terms into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. BLUSHING BAY
was bumped by QUEEN MOLOTOV at the start and was away slowly, spotted the field in the early running, raced two wide into the stretch, closed willingly
in the drive but was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY broke alertly, raced close to the early pace while three deep into the first turn, prompted the decent fractions through the
backstretch run, confronted MASTERING at the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch with RIO KING, responded to urging at mid-stretch and
took command into the final furlong, kept to task to deep stretch and held safely in a drive at the end to prevail. AMERICAN FARMER was forwardly placed
into the first turn, stalked the pace between runners then took back into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile pole, came in a bit tight
entering the second turn and was shuffled back while two wide nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
marker, closed willingly in the final stages and was up in the final strides to secure the place. TRIPOLI well placed in the early stages, settled just off of the
pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the second turn, advanced at the quarter pole, continued that steady bid while
saving ground into the stretch, did not offer a final kick in deep stretch and just missed for the place while just holding for the show at the wire. RIO KING
settled just off of the early pace, was steered three wide along the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile
pole, gained ground three deep at the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch with I'MGONNABESOMEBODY, continued to battle to mid-stretch,
lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outclosed for the minor awards. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) unhurried in the early running, saved ground
into the first turn then shifted to the two path into the backstretch, was not far back approaching the half-mile pole, raced three wide between runners into
the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch, mounted a mild late rally but needed more. MASTERING prominent in the early running, assumed
command into the first turn, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was confronted by I'MGONNABESOMEBODY at the quarter
marker, could not keep pace into upper stretch and faded in the final stages. ROYAL 'N RANDO allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back,
raced three wide into the backstretch run, was steered outside of rivals into the far turn, was asked for run five wide into the stretch and gave way.

RESPOND broke well and was content to sit just off the pacesetting pair down the backstretch was set down approaching the quarter pole, responded to
strong handling down the stretch got up just in time. SILENT SUNDAY broke a little awkwardly, quickly recovered and won the scramble for the early lead
with ZOOKEEPER pressing the issue just behind to the outside, angled to the two path before the turn, had something left when ZOOKEEPER mounted a
serious challenge turning for home, the rider dropped the crop before the furlong marker, ran on gamely but lost the photo in a super effort. COLONEL
VARGO outrun a bit after the break, made up the ground through the turn, was thwarted in an attempt to swing wide into the stretch then dove the rail, ran
on well but came up short. ZOOKEEPER sat just off the pacesetting SILENT SUNDAY, went after the lead just past the quarter pole, battled on under heavy
pressure then weakened in the final furlong. MR. FIGHTER vied for the early lead then backed off the pace before the half, lost the rail position going into
the turn, swung out through the turn, lost ground and was unable to recover. EDDIE CROSSWIRE stumbled slightly at the start then quickly caught up with
the field, began to lose ground after a furlong, attempted to rally through the turn but drifted out then was not persevered with down the lane.
