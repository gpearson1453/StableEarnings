Footnotes
SADDLE UP was away well to bid from the inside into the turn, was moving up to duel for the lead in early stretch, then kicked clear and kept on to prove
best. TOO INTIMIDATING lead the way into the turn while two wide, was confronted for the lead entering the stretch then was out kicked by the inner rival
and was best for place. SPECIAL MEMORY chased the pace while two wide, was urging on the turn while three wide to rally in the stretch but came up
empty. HE'S CHARMING chased the pace from the inside into the turn, came out four wide to bid in the lane but needed more.

Footnotes
EMILY'S BULLET broke inward leaving the gate, straightened up and dueled from two wide on the early pace, took command midway through the turn,
opened a clear lead in upper stretch, drifted out down the lane and held the closer safe. THAROLITE stalked the pacesetters from three wide, loomed boldly
turning for home, failed to gain on the winner but was a clear second best in a good effort. SHARP LIKENESS broke alertly and was hustled to the early
lead, dueled through the turn from the fence and weakened late in the drive. MIA MITOLE chased the front-runners from gate to wire failing to mount a rally
when called upon. IN A MINESHAFT went evenly without ever posing a threat. KOLLYNS JULIE raced near the rear of the field and never menaced. FOXY
ELAINE squeezed leaving the gate to be forced to the back of the pack and lost all chance from the gate.

Footnotes
CLASSIC RUNNER was well rated behind the pack while two wide down the backstretch, was urging on the turn to dig in gamely in the early stretch, then
split rivals grudgingly to be up in the final strides. PERFECT TOM vied for the lead while six wide, was moving up on the turn to duel with an inner rival in the
upper stretch but was out finished in the end. BAJA BOOGIE was unhurried early, then was gaining ground gamey from the four path throughout the bend,
rallied in the upper stretch and closed belatedly to be up for third place. MAN IN THE MIDDLE rushed along the inside to take the lead heading into the turn,
dueled with an outer rival in the early stretch, then was out kicked by another rival and missed show in the end. HONOR THE LAW vied for the lead while
three wide, then rallied on the turn and flattened in the stretch. PRINCE CURLIN vied for the lead from the two path down the backstretch, was hard used on
the turn and tired in the stretch. SEEKING CHROME veered out at the start and bumped rival, then vied for the lead while four wide, then faded slowly and
had no final bid. CAPO'S DREAM was forced out and bumped by an inner rival at the start, then vied for the lead while five wide.

Footnotes
MORO LINGERIE stalked the pace from the rail throughout, saved all the ground, rallied gamely up the fence and drew clear to the wire convincingly.
TEXAS TIDELANDS prompted the pace through the far turn, loomed prominently turning for home and finished well through the lane to garner the place.
MIDNIGHT'S GIRL took the lead into the first turn, set a well rated pace to lead into upper stretch, responded when called upon but could not hold.
TWENTYTWENTYREDO reserved off the pace in the clear saving ground through the turn, angled out for the drive and showed good late interest to be
gaining late. TRUE BLUE SKY chased the leaders throughout and failed to make up any ground. HOURGLASS FIGURE settled near the back of the field
and made late gains coming home while failing to menace. HONOR GIVEN slow early to trail to the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals in the stretch.

through early.

BROADWAY DISH broke alertly to assume the lead from the gate, was pressured throughout by the runner-up but prevailed in a hard drive. FROSTY
BREW pressed the pace from the start, challenged the winner gamely but could not get by while proving a clear second best. VEGAS BLUE tracked the
leaders in striking distance, saved ground up the fence and made mild gains in the lane to be up for the show. ATTA MOY GIRL stalked the pace from three
wide, loomed up turning for home and flattened out down the stretch. EUROROSE chased the pace from five wide and failed to gain ground. WATCH OUT
NOW went evenly and was never a threat. MRSG'S LIL DREAMER settled near the rear of the field and passed tired rivals in the stretch. HIT'EM UP broke
out into rivals away from the gate, dropped to the rear of the field and was not a factor. LUNA S raced mid-pack for a half mile and faded in the stretch.

DARE TO BE WILD lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, then inched further away from the pack on the far turn and held on
well down the home stretch to prevail wire to wire. FEDERAL HILL chased the pace while two wide, was urging strongly on the far turn to menace gamely in
the stretch but was no match in the end. TALE TWISTER chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the turn then continued to race evenly
throughout the final furlongs. RUSSIAN TANK pressed the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive throughout, was used up on the turn and flattened out
in the stretch. JOHN DOUGH trailed behind the field then bid from the sixth path on the turn and was no threat. RESOLUTIONIST settled two to three wide
down the backstretch, then bid on the far turna and was no threat. MERCI was in a strong drive to press the pace throughout the first three quarters, was
used up entering the home stretch and stopped.

LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG settled into stride off the early pace, moved up four wide into the turn to take command nearing the quarter pole and drew clear
in the lane convincingly. LANGUAGE BARRIER reserved off the pace for the first three-eighths, angled out five wide to mount a good closing kick in the
lane. GUNNER PAUL raced near the back of the pack, was asked for run into the turn and responded with a steady grinding gain to the wire. OJITOS slow
into stride early, moved up the fence into contention down the backside and through the turn but flattened out in the drive. DELIRIUM trailed the field to the
head of the stretch, swung way wide and made a mild late gain. PLAY RULE sped to the early lead, dueled to upper stretch and tired. BEHIND THE
CURTAIN flashed brief speed from between horses and gradually gave way. MAGIC BOW dueled from between horses on the pace for a half mile and
tired.

LOVE TANK reserved off the early pace near the rear, made steady progress down the backstretch to move to striking position at the head of the lane,
engaged the leader and dueled determinedly to the wire to prevail. GET SERIOUS dueled from the rail for the lead for a half mile, shook off the pace
presser into the turn, gamely responded to the challenge of the winner but was unable to hold that one off. TAHITIAN BREEZE slow early to be well behind
the pack, quickly made up ground approaching the turn, rallied five wide circling the field to threaten turning for home and finished up evenly. ROSIE JANE
prominent in the second flight early, dropped back down the backside losing position and mounted a mild rally down the stretch to make a late gain. FOR
FUN went evenly never presenting a threat. GIRL ON THE GO stalked the leaders to the far turn and gradually gave way. STARTECA sped up to take a
brief lead in the first turn, dueled for a half mile and stopped.
