Footnotes
LIZZSAIDNO stalked the early pace inside, bid between foes at the three-quarters pole, led inside, drew off in the stretch and won under mild urging.
VALINE stalked the early pace in the four path, pressed between rivals, bid at the five-eighths pole, then couldn't match strides in the drive. GET STORM
AWAY saved ground, bid between rivals at the three-eighths pole, but was no threat. NO JOKING MATTER was unrushed early outside, bid at the half-mile
mark, pressed the pace in the three path, then gave way at the quarter pole. FAR'S LAST ONE was unrushed between rivals, saved ground on the far turn,
then had no late bid. SEMINOLE MIDNIGHT was bumped at the start, pressed the early pace, then gave way. GIRL IN THE CITY led early inside, gave way
at the three-eighths pole, then was eased through the stretch.

CROWN IMPERIAL was off a beat slow, chased the pace through the turn from the four to the three path, bid into the lane three wide, caught the leader
inside the eighth pole, continued on under a hand drive and cleared. APRIL CLOVER set the pace through the turn while in the two path, vied with another
into the lane, repelled that one inside the eighth pole but was no match for the winner while well clear for the place. HEAVENLY DREAM pressed the pace
into the turn, moved to vie for the lead into the lane, was still a threat with an eighth to go then weakened. PRETTY VEGAS was in the three path through
the turn and into the lane and tired. BEST CUPCAKE raced in the two path through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
MOMS MOON stalked the early pace inside, shifted to the three path at the half mile mark, rallied at the quarter pole and was clear and lasted under steady
handling. HUMBLE WARRIOR was unrushed inside, moved to the three path entering the stretch, bumped with a foe at the eighth pole and was then
getting to the winner. TOPF ROAD RULES raced four wide and was bumped at the eighth pole. CODE VIOLATION was off a step slow, then trailed and bid
through the stretch. SILENT SONATA was unrushed, raced six wide in the stretch but had no late bid. MOON MISCHIEF dueled outside leader, then gave
way in the stretch. UNDISMAYED was clear early, then dueled inside and then gave way in the stretch. WORKINFROMHOME was not a factor.
