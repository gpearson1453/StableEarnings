Footnotes
M IS FOR MAGIC stalked the pace from inside, checked when losing his path into the turn, chased along the rail then two wide into the lane, moved out to
take aim at the leaders, came with a late bid in deep stretch and got up. IRISH PATSY was off slow to begin, raced along the inside near the back, had to
wait for room when boxed in on the turn, found an opening leaving the bend, steered out then back inside while closing late but was outkicked by the winner.
AVENTAPP was closest in pursuit early on, bid outside the leader approaching the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole,
challenged from both sides in the final sixteenth and could not hold on. MISS LIZZY broke poorly from inside and trailed off the rail early, had to pause when
running up on heels at the three-eighths pole, rounded the bend two to three wide, steered out in the lane and finished willingly. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN
allowed to settle outside a rival, took the turn two then three wide, asked in the lane and never responded. DADDY CLASSY DILL sped clear to take control
early, jumped a shadow at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained in front into the turn while near the inside, was pressured by outer rival at the quarter pole,
lost command in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DELITEFULL HART stalked from inside, tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside the leader before taking over with a furlong remaining, then drew away
in deep stretch when flagged with the whip and hand urged. APPLE FEST set the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from ROYALE DELTA at the
three-eighths pole, cleared again midway around the bend, led along the inside into the stretch but was soon confronted by DELITEFULL HART in upper
stretch, yielded to that rival and stayed on to hold second. ROYALE DELTA stalked off the inside, put in a mild bid at the three-eighths pole but was turned
away at the five-sixteenths marker, chased two then three wide into the lane and churned on for the show. MINEDANDREFINED angled out to track from
outside, rounded the bend three then four wide and weakened in the late stages. GUITAR GIRL broke a step slow, pulled up early and walked off.

BLONDE BOMBSHELL bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside, inched ahead approaching the quarter pole, cleared into the lane and
powered away under urging. WHISKEY OUTLAW stumbled a bit leaving the gate then lost his action shortly after, chased from off the pace then moved
closer into the turn, loomed three to four wide into the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. ASSUREDLY set the pace inside
BLONDE BOMBSHELL early, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and gave way. SHAMBALA GIRL broke in and
bumped rival, trailed two then three wide on the turn and was not a factor.

LUCKY FOR YOU cleared and crossed over to the inside then got pressured by TECUMSEH CAROLINE, held a short lead into the far turn, dueled around
the bend, battled down the lane and drove clear in deep stretch. TECUMSEH CAROLINE bumped chasing three deep into the first turn then went up to
press the pace from outside, headed the leader and dueled on the far turn and into the stretch, battled into the final furlong and faltered in deep stretch.
HEELS UP bobbled slightly leaving the gate then bumped both sides chasing into the first turn then had to check around the bend, raced two wide on the far
turn, tipped out and gained the show. AWESOME TAYLOR chased along the rail and bumped with outer rival into the clubhouse turn, lost ground while still
on the fence on the last turn and came up empty in the drive. TROUVILLE broke a step slow, tracked four then three deep early, lost ground two then three
wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
OVERRULE cleared and steered over to the rail, controlled the pace through the early stages, showed the way through the far turn, coaxed along into the
stretch and held well under a drive. KAWAZAKI (IRE) broke well then moved inside to track along the rail, jumped shadows but recovered quickly
approaching the half-mile pole, raced near the inside then two wide on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and finished well to gain the place. THE KEY IS
UNITY tracked two wide then outside a rival early, gained two then three wide on the far turn and took aim at the winner in the final furlong but lacked the
needed late kick. BELMONT BILL was keen early chasing from inside then moved to the two path, remained closest up the backstretch and into the far turn,
was ridden along through the last turn in the two path and failed to produce a bid. STOP AND A TRES brushed with outer rival at the start, raced two wide
then moved inside, saved ground through the far turn and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. RUSSELLS HUSTLE raced three then two wide off the
pace, chased two then three wide on the far turn, tipped out into the lane and needed to find more in deep stretch. STORM THE NIGHT unhurried in the
beginning, raced near the inside on both turns, waited for room from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole then was asked but was too late. PORT ROYAL
stalked from inside, closed in on the far turn, remained inside through the stretch and flattened. SECRET TREASURE bumped leaving the gate, raced two
wide outside a rival near the back, continued two wide into the stretch, then steered out and failed to menace. CARPE BELLUM raced on the inside in
mid-pack, entered the far turn outside a rival and weakened in the drive. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS hit the gate at the start, started to pull and became rank early,
continued to tug the rider along on the first turn and early on the backstretch, raced outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and came up empty.
SIPPIN WHISKEY took hold to drop back early and moved inside, trailed into the stretch and was never involved.

Footnotes
CARELESS KITTEN chased on the inside then steered out on the backstretch, launched a bid four deep at the quarter pole, quickly took over and kicked
clear into the stretch, drew away under urging and was kept to task in the final sixteenth. BIG SWEDE stalked three then two wide early, bid three deep at
the quarter pole, could not keep up with the winner exiting the bend and finished willingly for the a clear second. ECONOMICAL set the pace under pressure
in the two path, maintained a short lead into the far turn, dueled along the rail on the second bend, was overtaken passing the quarter pole and weakened in
the final furlong. BIG SPLASH unhurried in the beginning and trailed wide through the first turn, passed a pair of rivals four to five wide on the second bend
and got up for a minor award. SIR FLATTER pressed the pace three deep early then outside the leader up the backstretch, dueled for command around the
far turn and between foes with a quarter mile remaining, could not match strides with the winner leaving the bend and faded in the lane. CRYPTO MUNNY
moved to the inside early racing near the back, traveled two wide on the far turn and tired. KRIXUS FLASH pressed the pace from inside, chased the leader
past the halfway point, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
TIMELY LUCK settled inside, moved into range in the middle stages, tipped out at the quarter pole and took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside
the leader and took over with a furlong to go, then drew away in deep stretch under urging. WARRIOR LADY chased outside a rival then pulled nearing the
first turn and had to alter out from behind rival, moved back to the two path around the bend, saved ground along the inside on the far turn, rallied up the
fence in the drive and gained second. YVETT'S SURPRISE raced on the inside at the back and had to steady into the first turn, tipped two wide then moved
back inside, steered out into the stretch, moved inward to go between rivals, came back out late and earned the show honors. CHERRY CHAOS showed
speed to take control early and moved inside, led clear to the stretch, challenged by the winner in upper stretch and relinquished the lead at the eighth pole,
then flattened to fourth in deep stretch. SMOOVE AS SILK bumped leaving the gate, pulled early then got floated out on the clubhouse turn, chased
between in mid-pack, angled in for the far turn, steered out in the drive, asked left then right handed but flattened in the late stages. TAPIT ROCKS was off
slow and bumped leaving the gate, chased between rivals then steadied off heels into the first turn, got blocked behind a rival early on the backstretch,
trailed into the far turn, ran into traffic at the quarter pole and had to alter out with a quarter mile remaining and kept on to improve position. SAPADILLA was
closest in pursuit from the two path early, chased two then three wide on the far turn, moved out in the drive and weakened. BOGINSKAYA chased three
deep early then got floated out five wide on the first turn before moving back three wide, continued outside rivals into the second bend, got floated out again
leaving the turn and came six wide into the stretch and failed to menace. LOVE OUR FAMILY pulled and drifted into the first turn then stalked off the inside,
started to weaken on the far turn, got bothered from inside exiting the bend and tired. BETSY IS THE CODE raced three deep at the back early, altered
widest on the first turn, raced outside rivals near the back in the middle stages, between on the far turn, was forced to check past the quarter pole and had
little left for the drive.
