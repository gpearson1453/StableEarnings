Footnotes
RIVER LIBERTY trekked the two path around the first turn, raced two wide near the half way point, gained command through the closing bend and finished
under a stiff drive to procure the honors. ROSE OF EKITA rated close up and travelled three wide through the opening half, forced the issue with front
runner around closing turn, then was outdueled in the homestretch while finishing well clear of rest of field. HARPERS VISION flashed early speed and led
the field through the opening half before yielding to top pair inside the half pole. FOREIGN CREATION failed to threaten while saving ground. FETCHING
FURY showed reserve from outset, established a ground saving stance and was no factor while giving chase from a back rated position.

FLASHY GAIL broke alertly, shared early command as the inner rival, had a slight advantage at upper stretch, and kicked clear in final furlong. OKIE HOPE
pressed the pace from between rivals, travelled two wide around the bend, locked into a stretch duel for place and got the bob for those honors at the wire.
NITRO NINA settled in behind the pacesetting trio and saved ground around the bend before rallying mildly along the inside to duel in final furlong for the
place honors, but was nipped at the wire and forced to settle for the show. BOTTLES AN BIBLES came up empty in the closing strides after pressing the
pace from a four wide stance and rating close up three wide at upper stretch. BIKER BABE trailed the field from outset and passed a tiring rival in closing
strides. SALT CREEK CAT came away behind rivals, gave chase to front runners while trekking the four path and tired in the latter portion of contest.

TIFFANY TWIST pressed the pace from between rivals, was on even terms at upper stretch, engaged in duel for the entirety of homestretch and dug in to
prevail for the honors. DO YOU BILEVE broke alertly, had the slightest of advantage along the backstretch as the inner rival of four abreast, locked into a
stretch duel at top of lane and was edged in final stride. BRING IT ON BABY stalked the frontrunner from a four wide pose along the backstretch, rated
close up as the outer most of three wide at upper stretch, then gave way to dueling duo in final furlong and settled for the show. HOT SPRINGS BLING
lacked a needed rally after coming away from outset in a tardy fashion. MISS M J lacked a closing bid after stalking the early pace from a four wide stance
and rating three wide at upper stretch.

SHANGHAI SKIPPER pressed the early pace from a two path stance, gained command at upper stretch and denied al rivals while inching away in the final
furlong. KWIK travelled wide early, pressed the issue nearing the half pole from a three wide pose, locked into a stretch duel at upper stretch, but was
outdueled in final furlong. CHARING CROSS hustled from outset to gain first command, led the field along the backstretch while saving ground, relished
command through the closing bend, and finished evenly to hold on to the show. LIMBO'S PROMISE failed to match strides in the late going after saving
ground and stalking the pacesetter through the opening half. SCHLEICHER settled in behind the pacesetters and trekked the two path, swung wide at upper
stretch, but failed to execute a rally in the late strides. MORHAWK travelled wide through the opening bend and steadily lost ground to front runners
thereafter. PER RULING #23-WRD-013 FROM THE OKLAHOMA HORSE RACING COMMISSION SHANGHAI SKIPPER WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE

MAGNA TAP stalked the front runners through the opening half, swung four wide nearing the quarter pole, gained command near the eighth pole, and
kicked clear in closing strides. GRANDSONSAM trekked three wide throughout, was between foes at upper stretch with a slight advantage, but was unable
to fend off the late kick of winner in the closing strides. MAJESTIC LIAISON trekked three wide in the early going, gained command near the half pole, rated
between rivals at upper stretch, then was outfinished in final sixteenth. SWORD OF GOLD pressed the pace from a two wide stance around the opening
turn, shifted in to a ground saving pose nearing the half pole, rated close up as the inner most rival at upper stretch, but failed to match strides in
homestretch. GOSPEL GRAYSTONE rushed from outset to lead the field through the opening half while saving ground, then retreated rapidly inside the
halfway point.

ALL AFLUTTER pressed the pace from an inside pose, angled out near the three sixteenths pole, and finished under a stiff drive to procure the score. CAT
TALE SKY loomed off the pacesetter along the backstretch, rated within striking distance at upper stretch while trekking three wide, and finished with good
response to urging but was no match for winner in final sixteenth. RAINBOW SMILES stalked the early pace from a two path stance, rated on even terms at
upper stretch, but failed to sustain the bid in closing strides. LADY ENVOY showed reserve along the backstretch, trekked wide through the turn, lost ground
to front runners, and failed to gain on leaders in homestretch. SHAWK'S LIL AVA established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, chased the front
runners through the bend, and finished willingly along the rail. CAROLS KITTEN rushed form outset and led the field into and around the turn before fading
rapidly in the final furlong. MISS COFFEYVILLE broke in air, trailed the field along the backstretch, and failed to muster a needed rally.

Footnotes
DOMINANT OKIE finished under a stiff drive and procured the victory after forcing the pace from a four wide stance along the backstretch and trekking three
wide at upper stretch. BLUESKIESANDANGELS hustled away from the break, established an inside position, set the pace in concert around the turn, then
was outdueled in final furlong. KYEMBEA stalked the early pace from a two path pose, rated between rivals in the second flight at upper stretch, then
proved best of rest behind dueling duo. TATER rushed from outset and battled for command from between rivals, then failed to sustain the bid in crucial
stages. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE pressed the early pace as the widest of five abreast, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but came up empty to
urging in the final furlong. SEVEN VISIONS failed to threaten while saving ground from a back rated stance. GOSPEL DANDY trailed from outset and was
no factor.

Footnotes
RANCHO A GO GO rushed from outset to set a fast pace in tandem with FORT NECESSITY, locked into a stretch duel with that rival and dug in for the
victory. FORT NECESSITY hustled early and shared the early command from a two path pose, had the slightest of advantage at upper stretch, then was
outdueled in final sixteenth and finished a clear second. FANCY PAYNTER was reserved through the opening half before rallying along the rail to earn the
show. GOSPEL BONANZA settled behind the front running duo, trekked the three path around the turn and finished willingly but was nipped at wire for the
show by late rallying rival. MR GYPSY established a four path position along the backstretch, rated in the second flihht around the bend, but was unable to
muster a rally in the homestretch. LITTLE MAD MAX failed to menace while trailing the field from outset.
