Footnotes
SHINY SLAM set the pace racing in the two path, then inside rivals on the turn, responded when roused, turned back a bid from the runner up at the eighth
pole and drew clear under urging. TURN ON THE CHARM was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied
three wide into the stretch, made a strong bid at the furlong marker and came up second best. MADELINE'S GROGU was bumped at the start, chased
three wide, bid two wide on the turn, weakened in the lane and held third. SISTREN was outrun early, saved ground on the turn and closed belatedly in the
two path. BODIL was bumped and steadied after the start, outrun early and closed belatedly outside. WORLD TRAVELER chased on the inside, chased on
the turn and lacked a rally. LADY SHYLOCK was off slowly, moved up inside and was in tight at the five furlong marker, then steadied between rivals at the
half mile pole, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and tired. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS chased between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
NANCY MY LOVE steadied in the chute, raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final sixteenth and
was up in time for the win. MISS NEO stalked close up two wide, bid entering the far turn, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely to the finish
and was caught in the final strides. SHAYMYNAME vied two wide for the early lead, took over on the backside, dueled with MISS NEO into the stretch,
yielded, then dug in on the rail to the finish. DIXIE GROOVE hit the rail in the chute and checked sharply, then raced off the pace with an inside trip, rallied
inside in the stretch and had some traffic late. HURRY UP DEAR was bumped and stumbled at the start, raced off the pace, made a middle move while
three or four wide, then chased and finished evenly. WINE GODDESS raced off the pace inside, was shuffled back at the half mile marker, then lacked a
rally. ZIPPY ZINNY was bumped and steadied at the start, raced off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and tired. FANCY LIKE was bumped hard at the
start, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. BINGO STAR set the pace on the inside and gave way.
