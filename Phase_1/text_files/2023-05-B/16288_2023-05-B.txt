Footnotes
VISKI JONES allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide through the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew off
under right handed urging. GILES pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs, made the lead briefly then was no match for the winner. THE DRAKE close up
along the inside, angled out to the five path entering the stretch and was outfinished. MASTER OF WAR advanced two wide before a half then leveled off.
GOOD IDEA offered a mild bid along the inside nearing the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. AULD LANGE SYNE made the lead soon after
the start, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then gave way late. YONDERING broke slowly and was outrun. STAGE READY broke slowly, was a
sharp threat three wide then through after a half.
