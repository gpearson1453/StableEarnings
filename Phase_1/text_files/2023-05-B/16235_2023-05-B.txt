Footnotes
RECALCITRANT set the pace inside BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY into and around the turn, shook free at the top of the stretch, urged right handed past the
eighth pole and drew off under steady handling late. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY pressed the pace from outside to the top of the stretch, could not keep up
with the winner in the lane and held the place. DANCE ELLA DANCE stalked on the inside into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, drifted
out in upper stretch and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. SELDOVIA broke a step slow, chased three then four wide on the turn and leveled off in the
furlong grounds. GRACEFUL SCARLETT brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, chased two wide into the turn, angled over to the rail around the bend
and weakened. ANNIE FOX hit the gate to break slow, chased four wide on the turn, five wide leaving the bend, angled out in upper stretch and had little left
for the drive.

Footnotes
PALEO'S PRINCESS stalked on the inside then moved off the rail chasing the pacesetter, took aim two wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader
midstretch, took over late and held over the runner-up. CORNELIA FORT settled early then moved into range, inched closer on the inside through the turn,
rallied inside the top pair from the fence and just missed. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) cleared from outside and crossed over, showed the way a bit off the rail into
the lane, challenged from outside in the furlong grounds, held a short lead into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly between rivals. TRAVEL SMART
steadied behind a rival briefly early, tracked two wide while out of range into the turn, drew closer around the bend and tipped three wide into the lane,
drifted inward in the final furlong while finishing willingly to earn a minor award. WESTWARD BREEZE settled inside off the pace, saved ground through the
turn, moved out a bit in the lane and lacked a rally. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) trailed on the inside into the turn, two wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

CRAZY HOT chased from outside to the turn, swept by the leader from outside at the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared and started to open up late on the
bend, drifted in a bit and was corrected once with the left hand crossing the eighth pole and widened under hand urging. FIAMINA chased from inside under
coaxing early, lost ground around the turn, remained inside to the stretch and kept on to best the rest. HIGH FLYING GRACIE chased from off the pace in
the two path around the turn and was along for the show. CONQUEST CELSIUS cleared early and moved inside, lost command past the three-eighths pole,
chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. STAY QUIET bobbled shortly after the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, passed a rival on the turn,
passed a weakening rival in the lane and failed to make an impact. THIRSTY FOR LOVE raced in mid-pack three wide and failed to menace. LOVME
LIKEAFOOL was off a bit slow to begin, coaxed near the back early, took the turn three wide and was not a factor.

SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE) broke a step slow then tucked inside at the back, went outside a rival into the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch,
rallied widest and got up at the wire. EVER SMART stalked three deep early, bid two wide into the far turn, dueled and took over late on the bend, put away
inner rival midstretch, led through the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. ANGEL NADESHIKO stalked in the two path, coaxed along around the far
turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, finished willingly through the lane but lacked the needed final kick. ALOHA KITTEN took control early from inside,
showed the way up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, fought on to midstretch and weakened.
FOUNDER'S DAY pulled and was rank early along the inside, ran up behind the leader and had to steady at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back and

Footnotes
MOR TEQUILA cleared early, led along the inside through the turn, roused past the quarter pole, opened up in upper stretch, had the rider fumble his left
rein briefly at the eighth pole, asked left-handed with a sixteenth remaining and was ridden out late. BIG HAT WILLIE chased off the rail then moved into the
two path, spun three wide into the lane, kept on through the drive, could not threaten the winner in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best.
BROADWAY UNIONS was off slow to begin, moved up to stalk from inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked the needed response but churned on to
hold the show. BRAZEN BULL stalked off the rail then outside a rival, chased two wide into the lane and flattened. BUFFETT tracked the pacesetter while
widest early, ran four then three wide while dropping back on the turn and came up empty. ZIHUATANEJO chased three wide into the turn, angled in around
the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
RUBY NELL was keen while trying to rate along the inside, tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole, drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, took
over past the eighth pole and drove clear. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) settled in mid-pack on the inside, inched closer on the far turn, cut the corner into the
lane, rallied along the fence and gained the place. STRIKINGLY showed speed to take control and move inside, set all the pace to the lane, was challenged
from outside in upper stretch, clung to a narrow advantage at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after, came out late and managed to hold on for
third. LUMINIFEROUS settled inside, tipped out leaving the first turn, raced outside a rival in mid-pack in the middle stages, made progress while angling
out around the far turn and came four wide into the lane, finished willingly widest in the drive and missed the show. ANNIE'S JOY stalked two wide early,
took aim two then three wide on the final turn but flattened in the furlong grounds. LULU LEMON DROP tracked in the two path, spun three wide into the
lane and could not rally. GALIMINE (FR) hit the gate then stumbled shortly after the start, trailed on the inside, passed a rival at the quarter pole and was not
a factor. ROCKIN TO THE BOSS was off slow to begin, raced two wide near the back, trailed three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
TENTH STREET DON sat off the pace then inched closer nearing the turn, ranged up three deep then took over two wide leaving the bend, quickly clear
into the stretch, powered away when asked with the left-hand, kept to task into the final sixteenth and coasted in late. PRAYFOROURCOUNTRY dueled for
the lead from outside the chased the leader past the half-mile pole, raced two to three wide around the bend and churned on to best the others. MY AMIGO
broke inward, went up to duel from inside then cleared outer rival up the backstretch, headed by the winner at the quarter pole, gave up the lead soon after
and flattened to third. KING HEAT dropped back under coaxing, trailed into the turn, saved ground around the bend, moved out in the lane and was along
for a minor award. APPLE WARRIOR stalked on the inside into the turn, asked two wide leaving the bend and weakened. LIDDELL broke slow then inward,
chased on the inside into the turn, moved off the rail and came three wide into the drive and faded. ARTABKEEN tracked out of range while widest early,
rounded the bend four wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ELM DRIVE was away quickly then ceded the lead to FREEDOM FLYER, remained closer up applying light pressure from outside, took over entering the
stretch, cleared inner rival and moved inward in upper and held safely in the final sixteenth. HONEY PANTS broke inward, settled along the inside, moved
out around the turn and came three wide into the lane, steered out further in the stretch, finished willingly but could not reach the winner. BIG SUMMER
raced two wide near the back into the turn, launched a bid while angling out to enter the lane five wide, lugged inward in upper stretch and faltered in the
late stages. VERY SCARY stalked in the two path, angled four wide across the dirt, got floated in by BIG SUMMER and lacked room in upper stretch, could
not find room until the final sixteenth but was too late to regain momentum. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) broke a bit slow, trailed on the inside around the turn
before angling out approaching the dirt crossing, kept on to improve position late but failed to threaten. CANOODLING broke inward, stalked from inside,
waited behind the leader leaving the turn, gained an opening at the top of the stretch, lost her path at the eighth pole, angled out and could not rally.
FREEDOM FLYER broke well and cleared ELM DRIVE to take control early, was lightly pressure by that rival around the turn, was overtaken in upper
stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
STRIKE THAT brushed leaving the gate, tracked three deep early, bid three wide and took over at the quarter pole, dueled two wide into the lane, put away
inner rival in upper stretch, drew away past the eighth pole and held safely late. SELF TAUGHT brushed with outer rival at the start then dropped back,
trailed into the turn, moved into the two path then angled out to entered the lane four wide, rallied through the lane but was too late. JOKER BOY sat off the
pace, gained four wide around the turn and got outkicked for the place. ECONOMICAL stalked two wide into the turn, lacked room behind the leader past
the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and flattened. WHO'S CANDY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, stalked on the inside, challenged
inside pair at the quarter pole, dueled with the winner into the lane, could not keep up in upper stretch and weakened. TIME TO ZOOM sped clear early,
showed the way from inside into the turn, challenged from both sides approaching the quarter pole and relinquished the lead, got shuffled back between
while starting to weaken into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
NINEELEVENTURBO was up close early and got bumped three deep into the first turn, settled off the rail, went two wide into the second bend, angled out
and chased four deep into the lane, challenged four deep in midstretch, then drifted in to bother rival at the sixteenth pole, cleared briefly and held late.
HALFBARBERBINGIE unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, trailed into the stretch, steered out in the drive, surged in deep stretch but ran out of
time. LOTTERY PICK tracked two wide then moved inside, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out into the lane, launched a bid between rivals in
midstretch, then got floated in by the winner and bumped SEVEN CHARMS at the sixteenth pole and kept on for the show honors. CREW DRAGON
climbed while chasing from inside early, moved to the two path and went up to challenge for command on the first turn, dueled on the backstretch then
cleared past the half-mile pole, opened up on the far turn, continued clear to the eighth pole, was challenged in midstretch, drifted out to make contact with
SEVEN CHARMS at the sixteenth pole losing command in the process and got edged for third late. ONCOMING off a step slow, trailed on the inside early,
went outside a rival on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, improved position but needed to find more to threaten late. FLINT STROLL unhurried in the
beginning and moved inside, raced two wide into the lane, angled back inside in the stretch and improved position. SEVEN CHARMS vied for the lead into
the first turn then cleared briefly before taking hold to cede command around the bend, dropped back to chase off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch,
angled out and tried to rally between foes before being sandwiched and checking at the sixteenth pole which halted all late momentum. DURANTE showed
early speed then became rank and drifted out a bit on the first turn, dropped back to stalk off the pace, chased two wide then between foes on the far turn
and weakened in the drive. STOTLAND broke a step slow, chased three then two wide early, ran two then three wide around the second bend, angled out
into the stretch and failed to menace. ROSENQUIST forwardly placed four deep then got floated out a bit on the first turn, went up to duel three deep
leaving the first turn, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, traveled two wide then three deep into the lane and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY
THERE WAS A DOUBLE DISQUALIFICATION REGARDING THE SAME INCIDENT AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE. THE STEWARDS FIRST
DISQUALIFIED NINEELEVENTURBO FROM FIRST TO SIXTH FOR DRIFTING IN AND FORCING LOTTERY PICK INTO SEVEN CHARMS. THE
STEWARDS THEN DISQUALIFIED CREW DRAGON FROM FOURTH TO SEVENTH FOR DRIFTING OUT AND MAKING CONTACT WITH SEVEN
CHARMS.
