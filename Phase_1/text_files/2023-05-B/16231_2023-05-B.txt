Footnotes
ROCK THE BOAT showed speed down the backstretch, raced near the inner rail, gained a clear lead approaching the stretch, was kept alert in the stretch
and readily increased his advantage. TAPIO , along the inner rail on the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and rallied between horses to dead heat for
second. AMERICAN SPEED , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, remained on his left lead through the stretch and held on for a piece of the
place. TAUBER , steadied on the heels of a rival leaving the backstretch, circled the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and rallied. MONSTER
MASON , steadied when shuffled back by BUSTINUPISHARDTODO soon after the start, raced along the inner rail in upper stretch, steadied lacking room
in mid stretch, moved out a bit and rallied between horses. BUSTINUPISHARDTODO bumped PERUVIAN LUCKY when bearing in soon after the start, was
well positioned turning for home and failed to rally. HE'S ORIENTATE showed speed outside the winner down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail in
the stretch and weakened. PERUVIAN LUCKY , bumped soon after the break, swung four wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. BOURBON AND ICE ,
three wide chasing the pace along the turn, gave way. SWIFTY DEVIL dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
BE BETTER , between runners tracking a contested pace, stayed in touch while outside a foe leaving the far turn, was guided out past the five sixteenths,
ranged up five then took over with a furlong to go, responded to solid right handed asks and drew away. IYWAAN , a bit washy heading to the gate, edged
up four wide around the first turn and gained a stalking spot, traveled three wide with aim off the duel past the five eighths, shifted out a bit wider for the
drive, moved up between runners in mid stretch to briefly threatened then churned on to save the place. TATE cleared soon after the break then dropped in
to secure the rail, was joined around the first turn by RUSTYSGFIVEFIFTY, sparred with that one through the backstretch and final turn, held the advantage
under pressure into the lane, ceded to the winner nearing the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and just missed the place. CODE RUNNER settled off
the pace, angled out leaving the far turn, swung six wide for the drive and had belated action. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY moved up to the outside of TATE and
took a short lead heading to the seven eighths, dueled through the backstretch and final turn, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then faded. SERIFOS
steadied off heels into the first turn, regrouped to stalk inside, was pushed along past the five sixteenths, failed to go on with the leaders past the three
sixteenths, eased out and faded. ONE TEN rated three wide early, was put to pressure into the far turn but failed to seriously respond. TORCH OF TRUTH
broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was under pressure while saving ground leaving the three eighths marker, failed to respond, was unsaddled near the
six and a half furlong pole following his gallop out then was vanned off.

Footnotes
COMPOSER'S DREAM , patiently rated near the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, advanced outside foes to take
command near the sixteenth pole and prevailed under urging. TOOFAREASTISWEST , rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, saved ground the
far turn, waited for room turning for home, moved to the two path approaching the eighth pole and closed inside the winner. WEYHILL ROAD prompted the
pace two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, gained a clear lead in mid stretch and weakened late. HEADLINE NEWS stalked the pace
between horses to the stretch and had a mild rally. LANGLEE AVENUE set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in mid stretch and weakened late.
HE'S GOT SWAGGER raced between horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to rally.
PITAGORE drifted out entering the first turn, was five deep around the turn, remained outside horses backstretch, weakened. CLASSIC LEGEND , three
wide, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. ARROGANT RIDER bobbled in tight quarters soon after the break and was no factor. KING JOEY raced
along the inner rail on both turns and was not a factor. HERE'S LIAM was outrun.

Footnotes
ARABIAN LION bobbled a bit at the break but quickly recovered and cruised clear into the first turn, set the pace just off the inside, met an outside challenge
from TAPIT'S CONQUEST leaving the far turn, kept that one at bay while nudged along past the five sixteenths, spurted clear into the stretch, responded to
a few right handed asks near mid stretch then widened while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TAPIT'S CONQUEST settled about four wide
early on, drafted in a bit and edged up heading to the half mile pole, engaged the winner from his outside around the far turn, pressed that one while under a
hustling ride, failed to match strides soon into the stretch but kept on with effort while well clear of the rest. DENINGTON , unhurried early while four wide,
was under solid urging circling four wide into the lane but lacked a serious response. SHERIFF RONNIE steadied off the winner while saving ground
approaching the first turn, continued to steady past the seven eighths, settled better into the backstretch, stalked towards the inside, failed to go on entering
the lane and gave way through the final sixteenth. FEELING WOOZY , three wide outside the winner prompting the early pace, dropped back leaving the far
turn.

Footnotes
RYVIT broke a bit inward and made contact with HAVENAMELTDOWN, was quickly righted, sped to the early lead then was joined from his outside by
HAVNAMELTDOWN after a furlong, sparred with that one into the turn while under some rating, inherited a clear advantage near the five sixteenths, was
guided a few paths off the rail into the lane, opened up under brisk handling then held firm over a closing PRINCE OF JERICHO. PRINCE OF JERICHO ,
off the pace and about three to four wide, steadied behind rivals leaving the three eighths, regrouped to advance three wide in upper stretch, worked
between rivals leaving mid stretch and finished with good energy to gain. FROSTED DEPARTURE brushed with HAVENAMELTDOWN then checked near
the five eighths, regrouped then edged up off the inside leaving the far turn, checked then altered out to avoid HAVENALMELTDOWN leaving the three
eighths, shifted in for the drive and churned on. PROVE RIGHT chased the pace three wide, was carried out five wide nearing the five sixteenths, moved up
four wide and between runners leaving the three sixteenths then flattened out late. SUPER CHOW , four wide with pursuit, drifted five to six wide entering
the lane, was corrected with right handed asks then weakened in the final furlong. BRISTOL CHANNEL chased the dueling leaders, checked and altered
out mid turn, angled towards the rail nearing the lane and tired. HAVNAMELTDOWN broke a beat slow and bumped with the winner, angled out then
brushed with FROSTED DEPARTURE when sent up between foes nearing the five eighths, engaged the winner and dueled outside that one into the turn,
sustained a catastrophic injury unseating his rider leaving the three eighths pole and was euthanized on the track. THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY
INTO THE RUNNING AROUND THE TURN BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
NEVER EXPLAIN rated kindly while saving ground, edged up within himself leaving the far turn, swung out four wide entering the lane and was put to a
hustling ride, sustained under strong right handed asks and surged between rivals to get up in the final jumps. HURRICANE DREAM (FR) , taken in hand
and saved ground, sat patiently behind runners into the far turn, swung out five wide with momentum into the lane, straightened away, made a strong rally
outside rivals and nabbed the place. EMMANUEL prompted the pace two wide, was put to a serious ride soon into the lane, kept grinding past mid stretch,
drew on near even terms while between runners in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. SPEAKING SCOUT bobbled at the break, regrouped and
settled off the pace while saving ground, continued inside with some advance past the three sixteenths, angled out and churned on between horses.
ATONE took over soon after the break and set the pace towards the inside, moved clear around the first turn and was nursed along, came under pressure
approaching the stretch, switched over to his left lead leaving the three sixteenths, clung to the advantage past the sixteenth marker, was taken on by
multiple foes in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. EASTER (FR) broke a step slow, settled off the pace and outside a rival, was guided further out in
the course past the five sixteenths, shifted six wide into the lane, made some progress past mid stretch but failed to sustain. RISING EMPIRE stalked
outside a rival, failed to kick on between runners past the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
BEER CAN MAN , with the early pace three deep, saw the leading duo get away a bit leaving the far turn, chased three wide into the lane, shifted out some
when edging closer in mid stretch, closed determinedly under strong handling, drew alongside NOTHING BETTER leaving the sixteenth pole, exchanged a
bump and forged ahead in the final yards. NOTHING BETTER broke sharply then was guided out soon after while taking the lead, was headed from his
inside by THAT'S RIGHT entering the turn, pressed that one around turn, moved to command in upper stretch then edged out to a clear advantage in mid
stretch, kept on past the sixteenth marker, bumped when hooked by the winner and stayed gamely. COPPOLA , forced in a bit soon after the break, circled
four wide into the lane and rallied mildly. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS , in close and bumped at the break, was taken to rate inside, got out a few paths entering
the turn, was guided back down past the three eighths, angled out for the drive and closed some. NOBLE EMOTION , forced in some after the break then
was shuffled, regrouped and rated inside, worked outward for the drive and continued with effort. THAT'S RIGHT , bumped at the break, hustled up and bid
inside a pair of foes to take command into the turn, took outside pressure around the turn, ceded the lead past the three sixteenths then weakened late.
DETERMINED KINGDOM drifted out nearing the turn and failed to respond. BREAKTHROUGH came in after the break tightening some rivals, corrected
and chased four wide, was carried out some nearing the turn, continued wide around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
NAGIRROC , five wide outside rivals nearing the wire the first time, was deftly maneuvered towards the rail with six furlongs remaining, crept up to rate
close just off the inside, worked through a seam leaving the three eighths and engaged the leader soon after, struck the top with a quarter to go, quickly
kicked away after being shaken up in upper stretch, was kept alert with a right handed ask near the sixteenth pole then was steadily hand ridden to the wire.
FUNTASTIC AGAIN took over inside rivals heading to the first turn, moved clear and set the pace towards the rail, ceded command to the winner nearing
the lane but kept on with good effort through the final furlong to save the place. CIRCLING THE DRAIN broke a beat slow then was pinched back,
regrouped and was taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, eased out and worked between rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper
stretch, straightened and closed willingly. KINGFISH STEVENS , taken to rate off the pace and raced between runners past the half mile pole, made a two
wide advance under asking into the stretch, shifted in a bit and kept trying to the wire. WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) settled off the rail, raced three deep
near the half, angled five wide past the quarter pole but came up empty. MOONSTRIKE (GB) was steadied soon after the break, dropped off the pace,
came three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. TOP RECRUIT , bumped at the start, was sent up to contest the early pace four deep, was brushed and
carried out entering the first turn, regrouped to stalk three wide, raced four wide with pursuit past the five sixteenths then tired. FADETHENOISE , a bit
fractious in the gate, vied two wide between runners then got a bit floating rivals into the first turn, got settled into the backstretch, stalked three wide, was
joined from his inside by the winner leaving the three eighths, chased past the five sixteenths and faltered. A WESTERN YARN broke outward and bumped
with TOP RECRUIT, straightened and disputed the issue three wide between foes passing the stands the first time, was carried out by FADETHENOISE
into the first turn and brushed with his outer rival, regrouped to be a few lengths off the pace, moved up some off the rail past the half, shifted in to pursue
around the final turn then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
NATIONAL TREASURE made the early lead without coaxing, was kept well off the inner rail approaching the first turn, moved in entering the turn, set the
pace slightly off the rail down the backstretch, eased out in upper stretch, was challenged by BLAZING SEVENS in upper stretch, dueled, was bumped near
the sixteenth pole, dug in tenaciously and twice bumped with BLAZING SEVENS approaching the finish. BLAZING SEVENS , well wide entering the first
turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, took aim on the leader past the three eighths, bid for the lead outside NATIONAL TREASURE
in upper stretch, dueled, bumped that one when drifting in near the sixteenth pole, finished gamely and twice bumped with NATIONAL TREASURE near the
finish. MAGE , slightly off the inner rail on the first turn, rated between horses while stalking the pace down the backstretch, eased out four to five in upper
stretch, drifted in briefly behind the top pair in mid stretch and finished evenly. RED ROUTE ONE , brushed by COFFEEWITHCHRIS leaving the starting
gate, raced along the inner rail on the first turn, steadied when rank entering the backstretch, remained along the inner rail advancing near the five eighths,
saved ground on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CHASE THE CHAOS lacked speed, raced near the inner rail on the
first turn, was off the rail down the backstretch, swung wide turning for home and passed tired horses. PERFORM lacked speed, raced outside horses down
the backstretch, entered the stretch in the three path and weakened. COFFEEWITHCHRIS came out at the break, prompted the winner while snugly in
hand down the backstretch, was under urging on the far turn and tired entering the stretch. A supplemental nomination was added to increase the purse to
$1,650,000. The winning numbers for the TWO DAY ALL DIRT STAKES were 2/4/5/8/9-2/6-10-4/8-1.
