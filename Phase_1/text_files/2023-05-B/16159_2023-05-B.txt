SNAKERATTLEANDROLL stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain, then shook clear and drew off in the final yards. C THE KING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out inside the furlong marker for clear racing room and lacked the needed late kick. MARSAC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then weakened under pressure late and held the show. LAUDERDALE tracked the pace well back, held
position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. COUNTY COURT unhurried in the early going, looped
up four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. FARAT showed little, inside. REUX (GB) well placed
and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. RED CAT (CHI) was no factor.

Footnotes
IM A MODEST MAN unhurried early, angled out three wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
WHISKEYMAC well placed and outside, moved up three wide to gain a short lead through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then was
no match for the winner late. DR. HYDE mid pack, gained a striking position four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then
weakened late and held the show. ELSINORE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the lane
and flattened out. PACE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and improved position.
KENJI'S EMPIRE set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded in the lane.
MCGOLDEN well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. YANKEE TEA PARTY led in the early
going, held position inside, then faded after a half.
