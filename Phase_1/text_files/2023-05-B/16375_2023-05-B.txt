Footnotes
DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF brushed with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while inside of a foe
for most of the turn then moved to the three path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then extended the advantage into upper stretch, drifted
out some then came under a right-handed crop near the furlong marker, turned back the runner-up into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging.
MIRACLE showed speed between horses, was taken back off the pace near the three-quarter pole then switched to the outside, ranged up to prompt the
leader from the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was given her cue with three furlongs to run, lost touch with the winner while driven four wide into
upper stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong, loomed a threat again near the sixteenth-pole but was turned away while well clear for the place.
MIDTOWN LIGHTS settled on the inside of a foe, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved in near the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SECURITY CODE brushed with a foe at the start, dropped back on the outside, went four
then five wide on the turn and was no factor. LES BON TEMPS bobbled at the start then was hustled, raced just off the pace under coaxing, chased inside
on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FLEETFOOTED broke out at the start and was corrected, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the sixteenth pole, inched away to the finish to
prevail. MOONAGE DAYDREAM coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. BLAME IT ON MARY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand through swift splits just off the inside, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to command until collared a
sixteenth from home, kept on to preserve the show honors. ROAD TO REMEMBER along the inside early on, got forced to steady in behind the tucking
SILVER FIST five and a half furlongs out and tipped to chase just off the inside, came under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SHINFULL chased three wide down the backstretch before being tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position offering up a mild bid. SILVER FIST coaxed from the gate,
tucked inside with five and a half furlongs to go forcing ROAD TO REMEMBER to briefly steady on the rail in behind, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the
turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. TEMPERMENTAL four to five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths before tipping back out four to five wide at the head of the stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
CLASSY EDITION stumbled momentarily after leaving the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure while four then three wide on the
turn, took over before the quarter-pole, shook clear when asked for her best in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. STERLING SILVER
broke a step slow, was reserved off the pace, drafted in the three path on the turn, was roused late on that bend, chased the winner under a right-handed
crop into the final furlong, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop near the sixteenth-pole then went back to a right-handed crop and was well clear
for the place. TIMELESS JOURNEY was taken under a tight hold early then settled near the back, was roused while saving ground at the three-eighths,
turned into the stretch in the two path then angled further out and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. VENTI VALENTINE went to
the front, showed the way well off the inside under a snug hold, vied three then two wide on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths then dropped back,
angled four wide at the quarter-pole, fell further back while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and just missed the show. LET HER INSPIRE U
prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, vied along the rail on the turn, led briefly passing the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner,
dropped back in upper stretch and faltered. OK HONEY was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path while
roused and also faltered.

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY broke out at the start bumping WHAT'S UP BRO, then got his lane taken away by RADIO RED and altered inwards, chased along the
inside, decided to tip out nearing the nine-sixteenths and had RADIO RED oblige tipping out and nudging LIFETIME OF CHANCE to make room for him,
raced three wide through the turn steadily advancing on the leader under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch,
rallied herding out RADIO RED a furlong out before seizing command just inside that station, then drifted out in front of RADIO RED a sixteenth from home
safely in front while surging home. RADIO RED came out just after the start taking over the lane of MAKER'S CANDY and forcing that rival to alter inwards,
chased three wide until tipped out four wide nudging LIFETIME OF CHANCE briefly five wide allowing the eventual winner into the three path into the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied and was herded out a path or two near the eighth pole, then kept on to
the finish altering inwards in the late stages to no avail while along for the place honors. LOOMS BOLDLY showed the way in hand just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths under challenge from the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and relented
nearing the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages. WHAT'S UP BRO got bumped at the start by MAKER'S CANDY, chased four to five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. LIFETIME OF CHANCE
chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, weakened. JACKSON HEIGHTS grew detached at the tail of
the field seven paths off the inside when outrun early on, tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ETNICO chased five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from
midway, took the inside route into upper stretch, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
COLLABORATION was taken under a tight hold in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside under snug restraint, drew even with
the leader in the two path on the far turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper stretch, came out slightly and bumped with
the runner-up just outside the furlong marker, dueled inside that foe in the final furlong and wouldn't let that one past in a game effort. IM JUST KIDDIN was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, tugged hard on the bit while five wide on the first turn, dragged her way forward onto the backstretch, was taken
up inside the seven-eighths, stalked outside from that juncture, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped her head in some while bumped by the winner just outside the eighth-pole, dueled outside that foe to the finish
and was denied while clear for the place. KOSUKE bumped lightly with a foe shortly after the start, was hard held while inside to the two path on the first
turn then rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick while willingly earning the show. SALS DREAM GIRL dropped from the two path to the inside on the first turn, settled at the rear, went three
then two wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved for the last spot in the superfecta. LADY JASMINE made light contact with an
opponent shortly after the start, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SWEETEST PRINCESS checked in
traffic early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced three wide while roused on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. SMOKIE EYES was fractious in the gate then backed out and reloaded, dropped to the inside on the first turn, showed the way down the
backstretch, came under increased pressure while inside on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way. WATERVILLE went three then
two wide under restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, drafted behind foes while moving from two to three wide early on the final turn, shifted
four wide over heels near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. RECOGNIZE rounded the first turn in the two path,
settled towards the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn and was no factor. DASHING DELLA went four wide under a hold on the
first turn, dragged her way forward under stout restraint with seven furlongs to run, was rated just off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path
while between foes, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF IM JUST KIDDING AND A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY, COLLABORATION WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE COMING TO THE
FURLONG MARKER

Footnotes
MARVELOUS MAUDE tracked the pace along the inside in behind the cover of SANURA as the leader spurted away down the backstretch, tipped to the
two path half a mile from home before making her way three then four wide with three furlongs to go, advanced on the front in tandem with a pair to her
inside, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, offered up a good finish to rally and get on near even terms with the runner up a sixteenth
from home, knocked heads and was up in the final jump to score. RUNAWAY RUMOUR two to three wide in pursuit, got roused spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the outside, dueled inside of the sixteenth marker and was nailed
on the wire. SANURA tracked the spurting away leader in closest aim along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, took
over command angling in to take the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, kept on inside to preserve the
show honors clear of the rest. FINEST WORK saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. OUT OF SIGHT coaxed from the start, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. EARLY EDITION coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride with
five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. FREDDYMO FACTOR established the front shortly after the start and spurted away
crossing to the inside into the backstretch, widened away into the turn and took the two path through that bend coming under growing threat through the
latter portion of the turn as the field rapidly took closer order, got collared just outside the quarter pole and went three wide at that station, then tired through
to the finish. Please note the half mile split was omitted pending review.

Footnotes
DAUFUSKIE ISLAND was hustled while breaking in front, displayed good speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn,
took the lead outside the quarter-pole, shook clear into the stretch, responded well in the drive and held under strong urging. OCEAN'S RESERVE settled
well off the pace, saved ground under urging for most of the turn then moved to the two path, came out four wide into upper stretch then quickly moved
further out, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the place. AGILITY was urged along off the pace, raced inside
for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, chased the winner willingly in the stretch and lost the place while clear for the show. GOLDEN ARM was
away well from the outside post, chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. PINEAPPLE MAN was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three wide
on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ZEEBEAR settled well back under some urging, went around most of the
turn in the two path, dropped to the rail while off the heels of a foe near the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. PETE N BILLY raced well back on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EAST COAST GIRL was backed out and reloaded then hustled
from the gate, moved up under strong urging to get the lead, set the pace under heavy pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead
outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. JUGGLER dropped well behind while void of speed, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn
and showed little.

Footnotes
CITY MAN saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out five wide into upper stretch set down for the
drive, closed well through the final furlong coming inwards slightly to look JERRY THE NIPPER in the eye and was up in the last jumps to the finish loosely
between foes at the end. JERRY THE NIPPER attended the pace of RINALDI from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
and began to apply pressure to the front, spun three wide for home advancing to issue a challenge taking command nearing the eighth pole, then dug in
under threat from a pair and was nailed in the final strides. DAKOTA GOLD saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and paused before slipping three wide at the top of the stretch, had to wait on CITY MAN to clear outside before tipping out behind a trio of rivals in front,
bumped SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN a furlong out to the seven path and offered up a mild kick closing in late to latch on the top pair as they hit the finish.
OCALA DREAM tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. CITIZEN K two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and weakened in the
late going. RINALDI showed the way in hand along the inside under attendance from JERRY THE NIPPER to the outside but facing little pressure until
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths as his main escort did the same intensifying the prompting, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under threat from that rival and was collared near the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN four then three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung six wide into upper stretch, got bumped by DAKOTA GOLD tipping out from in behind a trio of
rivals a furlong out and weakened through to the finish.

BANKIT settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path the four path on the turn, rallied to make a bid into upper stretch then took the lead,
responded well under threat from multiple foes in the final furlong and just held on the wire. OLYMPIC DREAMS stalked the pace on the outside, was asked
in the three path on the turn, made a bid in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, passed the three-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, fought on determinedly
in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. SHERIFF BIANCO showed speed then was taken in hand, settled just off the pace, drafted
inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then shifted three wide from behind foes, chased into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole
but was outfinished while able to get the show. DR ARDITO moved out while urged along off the pace, was roused for more while three wide on the turn
then driven four wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. WHITTINGTON PARK settled towards the back, was roused
while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. SEA FOAM was hustled to the front,
angled in near the seven-eighths pole, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the three-eighths then
pushed for more outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS settled on the outside, was asked
while four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. OUSTER settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn and failed to respond. TWO FOR
CHARGING raced well back on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. CURLIN'S WISDOM settled
off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. BROOKLYN STRONG was urged early then settled towards the rear, saved
ground on the turn and failed to threaten. BARESE lost his footing slightly at the start, raced well back in the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the
turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
KREESA chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied threading his
way through some rivals and was up in the last jumps to prevail. ART OF COURAGE showed the way in hand from the two path through swift splits, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge to the outside, spun three wide for home, dug in stubbornly clinging to command, drifted out late
herding SCHERZANDO out and was nailed in the final strides. SCHERZANDO four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was herded out late by the aforementioned and missed at the end. Z DANCER six paths off the inside early
on, tucked three wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LAUNCH
CONTROL chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got
outfinished in the late stages. FACTUALLY CORRECT chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. I'M JUST coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five
wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. KID EMERALD off a beat slow, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SHARPAZ broke out at the start bumping CONQUIST, raced three then two wide in closest aim of
the leader advancing to apply pressure and coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
UTAMARO chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. CONQUIST got
bumped at the start by SHARPAZ and chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired.
