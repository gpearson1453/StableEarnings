RED PIXIE allowed to settle, moved to position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader, shook clear quickly, then
drew off and was kept to the task. HONEY BOURBON tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well
for the place. REDHOT KATIE mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out, weakened
and held the show. NO SNIVELING well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, drifted in into the stretch and evened
out. KEYPIT sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the stretch, then faded the final furlong. TIZ PROMISING RVF rated back in the early
going, saved ground through the turn, came widest into the stretch and could not gain.

FLOAT AWAY tracked the pace, angled out and moved to a striking position on the two path, bid outside the leader into the stretch, edged ahead at the
furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. AIR ONE well placed and between, steady back on heels into the turn, angled out three wide to gain
back position, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. SOME KIND OF CRAZY mid pack and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, weakened late and missed the place. I'M HEADING EAST
set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. BETHPAGE
unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch and evened out. SHADY DAISY allowed to settle, moved up two and
three wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved her position. OUT OF PAYNT passed tiring rivals. YOU LOOKING AT ME well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. JESSICA BLAH BLAH stalked the pace on
the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

DO YOU LOVE ME set the pace on the inside while bearing out, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure.
QUARTERFLASH allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed.
KRISPY RICE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. WILD
IRISH tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. AMERICAN HEIGHTS exchanged
bumps at the start, moved up quickly to vie for the early lead outside, then faded in the stretch. INDIAN SPIDEROO exchanged bumps at the start and was

finished on equal terms with I RECALL. I RECALL never far back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then weakened and finished on equal terms with TACTICAL PAJAMAS. DANA'S BEAUTY rated back early, looped three wide
through the turn, angled in into the stretch and flattened out. SHE'S DANCING unurried, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the

Footnotes
NATURE TRAIL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on and drifted out slightly into the stretch when challenged, then dueled through the
lane, drifted out late and bumping RAINAS ROLLIN and prevailed over that one. RAINAS ROLLIN rated close up and inside, angled out and moved to a
striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, dueled with that one, then was bumped late and missed. GEARED UP
allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out and closed well for the show. SO STEADY
unhurried early, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed through traffic to gain a share. HOPE SHE
COMES well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. ZORA mid
pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane and faded. JAYLEE ran evenly. LILLI ROSE well placed and
outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. SPARKLING WATER was no factor. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RAINAS ROLLIN AGAINST THE RIDER OF NATURE TRAIL WAS
ALLOWED FOR IMTIMIDATION AND CONTACT LATE.
