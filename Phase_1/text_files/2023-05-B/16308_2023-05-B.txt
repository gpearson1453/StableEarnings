RUN ROSSCO RUN quickly went to the front under a snug hold, kicked clear into the stretch, and won handily. DUKE OF DEWINTON squeezed out
leaving, raced three wide into the far turn, closed gradually inside under steady handling, and inched clear. REMAIN CALM saved inside, lost ground
entering the far turn, shifted outside entering the stretch, closed steadily late, and earned show. REBATE sat just off the pace outside, and flattened out in
the stretch. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE broke in and lodged a mild rally. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK broke in, and rallied mildly late. EXPLICIT FIRE lead the
second flight, and faded inside.

GLAVA stalked the pace while four wide, moved up alongside BON PRIX to challenge the lead into the stretch, and kicked away. BON PRIX set the pace
from just off the rail, and lacked the rally needed late. GREEK GEEK was three to four wide leaving the backstretch, rallied determinedly between rivals
through the stretch, and won the bob. HYPERFOCUS sat in range racing four to five wide, rallied three wide through the stretch, and was edged out.
VIATURE rallied inside entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. PARKING PERMIT saved to no avail. WALKTHELINE brushed gate leaving, and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IT'S ALEXUS took closer order nearing the quarter pole, kept on gradually outside, responded to encouragement late, and narrowly got up in time. CHATTY
GAL stalked the pacesetters leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of DAZZLING MIST after the quarter pole, and lost the nod. LITTLE HARPER saved
inside early, came under handling into the stretch, and got up for the show. DAZZLING MIST sat just of the early pace while three deep, inherited the lead at
the top of the lane, and weakened. FLASHY BIZ offered a late bid. TALA crowded leaving, and improved position late. DAZZLING CHIC offered little.
ONEFINEDAY set a pressured pace from between foes, was unable to keep the pace, and faded. KISSABLE U sat in range, and tired.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE vied for the early lead, dueled outside of DANCING WILLIE, and kicked away. LINCHPIN STORM sat midpack while three to four wide,
chased outside under urging, and was along in time for the place. SCHOCHOH chased outside, rounded the final turn while four wide, and was out finished
for place. BACKSTREET BOBBY chased, shifted inside at the head of the lane, and improved gradually. DANCING WILLIE brushed leaving, vied inside
from just off the rail, and flattened through the stretch. DUNE D'ORO lacked a closing response. SHARP DRESSED BEAU chased inside under urging, and
weakened. CARSON'S LEGACY hustled away, and bid belatedly. DREADNAUGHT was never involved.

CHICA HERMOSA sat just off the pace outside, dueled outside of THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI, and just held on under a late drive. MI REYNA broke alertly,
opted for a stalking position while three to four wide, went in pursuit nearing the quarter pole, angled out closing gamely and narrowly missed. JOY IN
GRACE chased and lacked the kick that was needed. HENRY'S GAMBLE settled inside, and passed a tiring rival in the final yards. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI
flashed early speed and yielded in stretch. GRIGORO lodged a mild late bid. QUICK DIAL showed little when called upon. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE failed
to threaten.

Footnotes
ECHO CREEK saved ground early while four wide, advanced quickly in the final turn, set sight on SINGING BELL, and won driving. BRYNN'S DREAM
trailed the field, drove inside at the head of the lane, chased under heavy urging, dueled, and inched up. MONOPOLIZE chased inside, swung outside in the
final turn, closed well, and just missed for place. SINGING BELL dueled for the early lead, disposed of rival then saw margins diminish, and gave way
grudgingly. GOLDIE SOCKS lodged a late mild bid. HERMANITA ALEX settled inside early, lacked running room at the head of the stretch, and yielded.
LILLY'S OF LONDON stalked the early pacesetters, and faded inside. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN dueled outside of SINGING BELL, was unable to move on
with rival in the far turn, and faltered.

order in the final turn, and rallied outside of J. CRUZ, then inched clear to secure second place. J. CRUZ sped clear early, saw margins diminish nearing the
quarter pole, drifted down to the rail off the final turn, dueled inside of DANZA UNBRIDLED and was out finished. VICTORY AT LAST reserved off the early
pace, lodged a rail bid then steadied out of close quarters at the three-sixteenth pole, shifted outside and finished evenly. LITTLE CHICAGO chased outside
at the head of the lane, and closed. TRICKY SPEEDSTER chased inside, and weakened late. FULL VELOCITY sat mid pack while outside, and lacked a
closing response. SNAP COUNT trailed early, circled the field entering the stretch, and improved gradually. NEVVARE chased from the two path, and
faded. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR fanned three wide, and tired early. HIGH KELLY SONG fanned five wide, and was done early. STEWARDS INQUIRY,

Footnotes
SHORTY THE SWEDE sent for speed inside, contested the early pace, lead into the stretch, and held under a late drive. ZICATELA chased wide, swung
out at the head of the lane, closed willingly under a strong hand ride and missed. AWHITESPORTSCOAT angled towards the rail, was roused at the quarter
pole, and held on for show. EXPLODE sat in striking distance of the early pacesetters, was set down for a drive at the head of the lane, dueled and
weakened in the final yards. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES never far back and rallied belatedly. DRINKING AGAIN attended the pace while four to five wide,
and faded through the stretch. WANDERING WEST was bumped in the backstretch brushing the rail, and bid belatedly. TUCKER TIME lacked early speed,
and passed tiring rivals. ABOVE AND BEYOND bumped WANDERING WEST in the backstretch, and lacked a bid. IMPERIAL BIRD contended the early
pace from between foes, and yielded. HARD TO COME HOME chased the early pacesetters, and was eased.
