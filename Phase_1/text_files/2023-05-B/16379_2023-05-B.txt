Footnotes
GUNNHILD saved ground setting the pace, responded when roused and maintained a safe advantage. TED'S CANDY GIRL was allowed to settle in stride,
moved forward along the inside nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out and then was carried further out leaving the quarter pole and finished strongly
when clear. FLORA bumped with Lute's Diamond at the start, then saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through in the stretch and finished in a late
rally. LUTE'S DIAMOND bumped at the start with Flora, then was in tight on the backstretch racing along the inside, slipped through nearing the
three-eighths pole to offer a bid, then got out nearing the quarter pole and weakened. BOSSY PEGASUS was prominent for six furlongs while three-wide
and tired. ZARAGOZA prompted the pace for five furlongs while two-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
AFFIRM CHIEF was bumped at the start by Barbarian, then saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the outside to join that one
nearing the eighth pole, came in to bump with him inside the sixteenth pole was was edging clear late. BARBARIAN broke out to bump with Affirm Chief,
then saved ground setting the pace, came out nearing the sixteenth pole to bump with that one again and continued on gamely to the wire to finish on even
terms with Pick Bymy Friend. PICK BYMY FRIEND saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly to dead-heat
with Barbarian for the place. RUNAWAY KRISTIN prompted the issue from along the outside and tired. WARRIORS HERO dropped back early, came
four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor,. TAP THE BANK was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired. THE STEWARD
CONDUCTED IN INQURY INTO THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE
IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

dueled for the lead to deep stretch from along the inside, wasn't quite good enough but held on gamely for the place. MAMACALLMEBOO saved ground
while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the drive but lacked the needed late response. FREESTONE was reserved off the early pace,
came five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. IRON ROB bobbled at the start, then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. GOLD RUSH CANDY dueled for the lead from between horses to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHEMAKESCENTS was allowed to settle in stride, launched a three-wide bid nearing the three-eighths pole to engage Lucinda Rella, dueled with that into
the stretch and drew clear late. LUCINDA RELLA saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when challenged, could not stay with the winner late
but held on gamely for the place. CAMDEN HIGH dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. MOSCOW LADY
saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked a rally. LA POPIS was unhurried early, slipped through along the inside entering the stretch and went
evenly late. AWESOME DAZE was forwardly placed while racing between horses, was in tight at the three-eighths pole and finished willingly when clear.
FOR YOU ONLY prompted the early pace while two-wide and tired. PURPLE NIGHT hopped at the start to get away behind her field and was unable to
recover.
