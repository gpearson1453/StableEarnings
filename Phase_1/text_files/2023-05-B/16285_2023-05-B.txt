Footnotes
PETULANT DELIGHT vied between rivals to the stretch, shook loose and stayed clear under steady handling. AHSAD well placed behind the dueling
leaders, moved wide in the stretch and rallied. INDIRECTLY broke slowest, saved ground and rallied mildly while no threat. DRONE SWARM lacked speed,
advanced very wide and narrowed the gap. I LOVE JAXSON engaged in four horse duel inside then began fading at the quarter pole. DIZZY GILLESPIE
prompted the pace four then three wide and proved empty in the stretch. STAY HYDRATED forced the pace between rivals to the far turn and stopped.
PER THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, PETULANT DELIGHT HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

the final turn then yielded in the stretch. CINNAMON DREAM was urged off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch then flattened out. POP THE CLUTCH
chased outside, weakened on the final turn and faltered. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE saved ground within range and weakened steadily. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER lagged far behind and was never in contention. ROLIN N CONTROLIN prompted the pace outside and faded after half a mile.

DESANTIS controlled pace slow fractions, repelled a challenge then steadily extended his advantage while ridden out. MODERN ERA settled inside, was
asked for run on the final turn and rallied. BACK EAST moved closer outside before half a mile then weakened in the stretch. CHIP'S FRIEND raced in close
pursuit of the winner for three quarters and faltered. RETWEET reserved between rivals, bid very wide on the final turn and flattened out. ZOPPI
FISCHBEIN raced within striking range three wide and lacked a response. CHECKITUP dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

SING SCAT led under a rating hold, widened when ready on the final turn then coasted home under mild urging. MAGNOLIA ROAD steadied entering the
backstretch, went after the winner on the final turn then tired. CAPE NEDDICK lacked speed, moved inside on the final turn, angled out into the stretch with
a mild rally. THENDARA'S LOST pressed the winner for half a mile and faltered. COLLEGE TRY rushed to contention before half a mile then faded. WELL
RESTED steadied along on the first turn and gave way. ROYAL PARTY chased outside and stopped losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
WINDSOR GOLD quickly moved clear under a rating hold, gradually widened throughout and stayed safe under mild urging. NOTABLE EXCEPTION raced
in closest pursuit of the winner and continued gamely while no match for the winner. BEYOND BEST dropped back outside, continued wide and lacked a
solid rally. BATTER UP BUD bumped at the start, settled off the pace and was never a factor. MAXIMUS AURELIUS saved ground off the pace and gave
way. SMARTEN UP came out at the start bumping rival then was always outrun. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH raced close up inside for half a mile and stopped.
