PLATINUM PROMISE vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, then dug in the final furlong and held on winning the head
bob, driving. NAIL POLISH tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to loom boldly, continued to gain the final furlong to just miss,
lost head bob. MORE RANSOM stalked the pace three wide, dropped to the inside entering the turn, then eased off the inside and came five wide into the
drive and weakened, bested rest. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR was off a beat slow, rushed up between rivals to duel for command by the half mile marker, then
was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. ARROGANTE reared at the start when the gates opened losing the rider, then walked off when
caught after the race. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start but after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

GREAT BARONESS vied for the lead outside of the trio, made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then drew out leaving the turn
and widened the margin to the wire to prove much the best, mild drive. PRINCESS KAIRA was rated early on the inside, made a three wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, kept on willingly to the wire but was no match for the winner, second best. TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was reserved early on the inside, came
four wide into the lane and was along for the show award. IMAGISM vied for the lead in between rivals and weakened in the drive. REAWAKENED vied for
the lead on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
HIBACHI set a pressured pace along the inside, then shook clear leaving the turn, then held sway late to prove best under strong handling. PATTY'S BOY
was well rated three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then continued that bid and was gaining but hung late, second best. PEPE TONO was
settled back early, came six wide into the lane and was along for the show award. EDICT was allowed to settle early on the inside, three wide on the far turn
and came five wide into the lane and had no rally, out kicked for the show award. DIGGERS DIAMOND was well placed early on the inside, angled out in
the drive and faded. E T'S SUPER STAR pressed the early pace two wide, between rivals by the half and on the turn and weakened. HIZAAM was four
wide into the first turn, stalked the early pace and then moved up to press the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in
the drive. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was off a step slow, settled on the inside and had no response. POCOPSON STATION was reserved three wide and never
factored.
