under strong handling racing near the rail. DEO stumbled at the break, raced near the back early and trailed. DAZZLE THE COMMAND rated to race in
hand in the early stages, raced in tight quarters near the three sixteenths pole, angled out and moved up late with good energy. FOYT showed good early
foot to set the early pace and faltered in the drive. KOKO'S MOM stalked the pace from the outside of foes racing three deep, made a four wide bid near the

Footnotes
HOW ABOUT A FRESCA chased the pace from the inside, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in race from the inside of She's So Fancy
and just got up under strong handling. SHE'S SO FANCY showed good early foot to set her own pace down the backstretch, asked through the upper
stretch while racing off the inside and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. MARY WALKER stalked the pace, moved up four through the upper stretch to
challenge and flattened out in the drive. BOB'S VAI took up sharply at the start, raced near the inside and had no late rally.
