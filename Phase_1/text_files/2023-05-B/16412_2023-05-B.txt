Footnotes
VIRADIA hustled to clear lead, led in hand while widening then extended her advantage while ridden out. BRODY SLAM wide on the first turn, angled inside
then pursued the winner throughout. JUST STAY HOME raced close up inside, faded on the final turn but came again for the show. LONDONDERRY
lagged far behind outside then passed fading rivals. ALWAYS A QUEEN moved closer three wide before half a mile then no further response. ELUSIVE
RYDER trailed along the rail and was never in contention. MARIANNA QUEEN dropped back wide and gave way readily. ABHAILE urged just off the
leaders early and stopped.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S RANSOM far behind early, advanced inside, offered a late surge and wore down the pacesetter and moved clear. RUNNIN REDBIRD dueled
outside, took over at the quarter pole, moved clear then weakened. OLD HEAD dropped far back inside then offered some late energy. FLIGHT chased
outside and continued willingly while no threat. ALL HAIL MO lacked speed chasing wide and passed rivals while no threat. BE WATER prompted the pace
three wide to the turn and faded. BOSS LIKE BETH raced within striking range inside and flattened out in the stretch. MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES earned a
narrow advantage inside then was finished after half a mile. RIVERVIEW stumbled soon after the start unseating her rider.

raced close up outside then weakened in the stretch. SHIFTINGGEARS broke very slowly, rushed to contention outside and faded. REX KWON DO
dropped back early and began stopping on the turn.

Footnotes
AVA K'S BOY vied outside, shook loose into the far turn, maintained a long advantage and was kept to a task. STORIED FELLA stalked the pace outside
and continued well while no match for the winner. LUCKY AS A SEVEN prompted the winner along the inside then began tiring on the turn. STRAWBERRY
CONE raced close up inside, was taken up sharply at the 7/16 pole then moved very wide. MIZZEN MAN saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.
CATCHING CUPID dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WILDCAT GIRL lacked speed, advanced inside, angled wide in the stretch then surged clear through the final furlong. TWIST HER well placed behind the
dueling leaders, rallied into the stretch and finished willingly. TEMPTED TO TOUCH was far behind in the opening quarter then finished strongly too late.
GETAWAY PALACE raced in midpack and narrowed the gap without menacing. ELL GRAY earned a narrow lead along the inside, shook loose in the
stretch then proved empty late. KATE'S CUBAN KISS dueled outside to midstretch and weakened. LITTLE DOYLE raced off the leaders inside and faded
steadily. BRUNO BARBER GIRL lagged far behind and was always outrun. JAVA'S LUCKY LADY was fractious in the gate delaying start then lunged at the
break and raced far back.

MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT broke alertly and moved clear, widened on the turn and held on gamely through the stretch. BAAFEED stalked the pacesetter
outside and made a gradual gain in the stretch. RUFFY saved ground close up, weakened but came again for the show. MR SANDMAN raced off the pace,
moved wide on the turn and lacked a solid bid. DAYDREAMING BOY dropped back in the two path and lacked a rally. AMITY ROAD dropped back at the
start and was never a factor.

BOOM BOOM GIRL controlled the pace, easily widened in the stretch and remained safe while kept to her task. DRIVEN BY SPEED settled off the pace
along the inside, swung wide in the stretch and closed strongly. GIRL'S ON FIRE reserved off the pace in the two path and narrowed the margin late.
SUMMER AT THE SPA stalked the winner three wide to the stretch and flattened out in the lane. LADY BREXIT raced off the pace while wide and lacked a
solid response. MY MASTERPIECE rated just behind the winner to the stretch and faltered. COMPLETE dropped far behind and made a slight gain through
the stretch. KENTUCKY PRIDE trailed the opening half mile and was never in contention. BOHEMIA BABE saved ground within striking range and gave
way. PROSPECTIVE CANDY dropped back early and weakened steadily.
