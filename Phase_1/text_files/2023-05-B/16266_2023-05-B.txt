Footnotes
EBBEN dueled inside rival for half a mile, drew away into the stretch, was urged then geared down late. JARLIAN saved ground throughout then rallied in
the stretch, while no match for the winner. B B BAD raced off the pace and offered a mild rally while no threat. BAILEY pressed the winner for half a mile
and faltered. CUMBERLAND AVENUE lacked speed racing very wide and was never a factor. NEIGH DUDE settled just off the leaders outside and
weakened. SAILOR AGAIN trailed to the stretch then caught a fading rival. SAPONARA dropped back after the start and weakened steadily.

TOUGH TICKETS settled inside off the pace, advanced on the rail, angled out in the stretch and was up late. BOAT'S A ROCKIN set the pace in hand, drew
off before half a mile then weakened slightly. LEASE lacked speed, advanced inside, swung wide into the stretch and rallied. THE KING CHEEK angled
inside early, bid into the stretch then flattened out. ANGELUS WARRIOR dropped back early, moved along the inside and was no factor. STRIKE ME
DOWN dropped well behind, moved wide on the final turn and was no threat. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR chased off the pace outside and weakened steadily.
CELTIC TREASURE lagged far behind and was never in contention. DRAMATIZED led briefly, pursued the pacesetter and stopped after half a mile.
CARTIER CAT dropped back early and trailed throughout.

ZETA pressed the winner early, pursued on the turn and continued willingly to hold the place. MIA TOSCA shuffled back early, advanced inside and closed
well. OUT DANCING urged off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally. FLASHING DIAMOND dropped back early racing wide and proved empty in the
stretch. MEMENTO MI lagged far behind then passed stopping rival late. VEDAREO raced inside within range early then began fading on the turn.
