Footnotes
SARGE'S SERMON raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far bend, pulled clear and held that margin to the wire. LITTLE RED RIFLE saved ground around the first turn,
steadied slightly coming into the backstretch, continued in the middle of the pack on the rail from there, saved ground around the far bend, began a bid
passing the quarter pole, switched to the outside and gained ground late. SUMMER ALL YEAR raced in the two path early, led the way narrowly racing
outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second turn and chased on in the lane. GLENDALE raced in the two path around the first
turn, chased the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the two path and kept on in the lane. UNIQUE PATH
led the way from the three path around the first turn, dropped back to track the frontrunner racing up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the
far turn, was caught in the stretch and finished evenly. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS raced inside at the back of the pack through the opening half mile,
continued to save ground around the second turn and showed no kick. TOUR THE WORLD saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and never threatened. VLOCK raced in the two path around the first bend, continued
up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the second turn from the three path and tired from there.

LAUGHTER dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn, bumped with STOMPING MOON
entering the stretch and dug in in the lane but narrowly missed. CROCODILE TEARS dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, bumped
with STOMPING MOON near the quarter pole and was outkicked in the final furlong while chasing on to the wire. STOMPING MOON dueled between
horses through the early going, raced in the two path around the bend, bumped mildly with multiple horses coming off the turn and weakened late.
BRIARTOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the four path and finished
evenly. WATER TO WINE raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. ALCAZABA (IRE) chased the leaders
on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. TAP THAT DIAL raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path for the run around the turn and tired in the lane. WEST BAY trailed the field up the backstretch, came
