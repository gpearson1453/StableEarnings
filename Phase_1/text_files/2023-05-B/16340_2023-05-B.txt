Footnotes
ONTHESTAGE reserved off the early pace at the back of the pack, rallied between horses entering the far turn, angled to the five path for the drive and was
up just in time under strong handling. BOUGIE JOE dueled on the pace from two wide throughout, took a short lead in mid-stretch while edging away from
the joint pacesetter and was caught on the wire in a game effort. GOLDEN FLASH set a pressured pace from the rail, battled determinedly through the lane
and was out-finished nearing the wire in a good try. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ stalked the pace from three wide, ranged up in the turn to loom boldly and
finished willingly through the lane without being able to close the gap. I AM GRODD went evenly while never seriously threatening. JOHNNY APPLESEED
was well positioned in striking distance but failed to respond when called upon for the drive.

RECKLESS RED lead the way from the start and into the turn, then drew off in the stretch proving best in the end. EUROROCKSTAR stalked the pace
while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn to menace in the stretch but was no match in the end. RED BIRD'S STORM raced while four wide behind the
pack, then bid on the turn to menace in the stretch and was closing well to be up for the show position. IRONICAL chased the pace while three wide, then
settled back on the turn, re bid in the stretch but came up empty in the end. TEXAS GOLD RUSH raced behind the field along the inside, then came out four
wide on the turn, passed tired foes in the stretch and needed more in the end. TENACIOUS LION chased the pace while four wide, rallied throughout the
turn then gave way in the late stretch. HARRY was in a hard drive to stalk the pace from the inside, then flattened out throughout the turn and into the
stretch.

WINGS FOR ENO broke sharply to be on top, settled off the leaders when taken in hand for the first quarter mile, commenced a four wide rally in the turn
and finished in a sustained drive to be clear late. CALARI BLUECAT pressed the pace to the top of the lane, edged clear in mid-stretch but could not hold
off the winner. WESTCOAST BREEZE sped up the rail to duel on the lead to upper stretch and finished evenly to hold the show. SONGWRITER reserved
well off the early pacesetters at the back of the main body and made a mild late gain down the stretch when called upon. MIDNIGHT HUNTER stalked the
early pace from three wide, dropped back in the turn racing three wide and passed tired rivals coming home. MAYAN well placed inside saving ground
through the turn, loomed briefly approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. SECRET SURVIVOR trailed as no factor.

Footnotes
JAN'S TURN TO WIN was well rated while tracking the pace from the inside into the turn, shifted out three wide in the early stretch, then dug in gamely to
edge clear late stretch and be up in the final strides. THINKITASADONATION was moving up while two wide to vie for lead into the turn, then dueled with an
inner rival heading into the stretch, menaced gamely but was out finished by an outer rival in the end. ZINASDESTINYVIRAGO lead the way into the turn,
was confronted by an outer rival heading into the stretch, dueled grudgingly from the inside but was out finished in the end. AUSTIN CITY GIRL settle along
the inside, then bid on the turn to close willingly in the stretch. GRAY ZONE raced in the middle of the field while three wide, was under a steady drive, then
rallied mid stretch but it was too little too late. SPECIAL TREASURE moved up to vie for the lead while three wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then
flattened out in the stretch. STILL OF THE NIGHT raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, then steadied slightly entering the stretch, then re bid but
came up evenly. AZUNIA settled behind the field while two wide, then bid while five wide on the turn and was no threat. GREY HALO was out run and no
menace. SASSY SAGEY trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PUNCH EM raced up the fence to take the lead leaving the chute, dueled on the early pace through mid-turn, opened a clear advantage turning for home
and held the closer safe while drifting out down the lane. CUCINA tracked the leader from off the pace while working his way down to the rail down the
backside, saved all the ground cutting the corner and made steady gains down the stretch in a good effort. RANDELLO rushed up to press the pace from
two wide, battled to upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. QUARTERBACK DAK settled off the leaders along the rail and rallied in the lane to make
up ground. KENTUCKY PEERLESS broke alertly, was taken in hand to be reserved off the pace, chased from three wide in the turn and failed to mount a
rally coming home. LOOKIN HIGH went evenly posing no threat. UNION STATION trailed to the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. BLING'S
BELLWETHER never menaced at any time. TOTALIZER flashed speed for the first five-eighths and tired in the stretch.

THETRUTHISTHETRUTH tracked the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack, was gaining ground on the turn, came out four wide to rally in the
stretch and was up in the final strides to prove best. SOUL SET FREE set the pace from the start, cleared the turn, continued to hold the lead down the lane
but was caught by an outer rival in the end. CARPE HORSESHOE chased the pace while three wide, was urging on the turn to rally in the early stretch,
then dueled for the show prize and was just up at the wire. SCARLET POSITION raced from the inside into the turn, then came out five wide in the upper
stretch then close well just missing the show prize in the end. SHACKLELACKALACKA chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the turn then
flattened out in late stretch. MISSISZIPPY BLING chased the pace while two wide, bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. SUMMER CAT settled in
the two path at an even pace throughout and needed more in the end. HIT'EM UP trailed behind the field and was no factor.

FAR FROM FINAL sped up to the leader shortly away from the gate to take a lead along the rail, shook off the pace pressure to take control in upper stretch
and held the closer safe in a game effort. MISTER CHAIRMAN stalked the pace from between horses three wide, rallied willingly down the lane to keep
coming but could not reel in the winner. PUTMAN saved ground tracking the leaders along the rail, cut the corner and was steadily gaining ground until late
in the drive. RIBBONS AND MEDALS slow early to be near the back of the pack, angled wide for the drive and made a good belated rally. BYE sped to the
early lead, dueled with the winner through the turn from two wide and gave way in deep stretch. COLTONS DREAM chased the leaders from four wide and
failed to gain ground. MY GOLDEN M tracked the pace from between horses to the top of the stretch and flattened out. MORE LIKE IT flashed brief speed
and dropped back as a non-factor. SEIZE THE TREASURE settled near the back of the field, was set to an early drive into the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
PICKENS tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn, engaged the new frontrunner at the top of the lane and determinedly out dueled that one to
the wire. UNDER THE GUN stalked the pace comfortably from three wide, engaged the leaders at the quarter pole, took a brief lead in upper stretch and
was out-dueled to the finish line while clearly second best. MORNING SNOW rushed up the fence to duel for the lead into the turn, took a short lead at the
quarter pole, was passed by the top two in upper stretch and dug-in to hold the show. TAPIT'S SPIRIT well positioned to be within striking distance but
failed to gain ground finishing evenly. RED N WILD went evenly never posing a threat. SAMURAI CAUSE slow early to be at the back, raced wide the entire
trip and showed little. DECLINED showed speed for a half mile and gave out.
