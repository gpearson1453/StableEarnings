Footnotes
ATOMIC TONE close up from the start, split horses three wide entering the stretch, drifted in when struck with a right handed whip at the furlong marker
while making the lead and drew off. LATIN SPICE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch while getting rapid fractions, checked at the eighth pole when
the winner drifted in in front of him and finished with good courage. THRU THE VINE trailed into the stretch and had a mild late rally along the rail. MIGHTY
ANGEL pressed the pace three then four wide into the stretch and faded late. DAVID'S GEM dueled for the lead along the inside while getting quick
fractions into the stretch then faltered. THE RIDER OF LATIN SPICE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ATOMIC TONE FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAJESTY sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace while getting rapid fractions and won as much the best under a strong hand
ride. PERMAFROST settled four wide, had a mild rally into the stretch and finished clear for second. WARHORSE WEST moved up three wide on the turn
then leveled off. BLUNDER failed to menace. STAR ENTERTAINER raced wide and passed tiring rivals. FLAWLESS CAT settled mid pack and lacked the
needed response. SCRATCHOFF stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. CONSIDER ME was no factor. RED COMET bore in at the
start and was no threat. A PRAYER FOR KIDS was always outrun. GIACOMETTI chased the winner along the inside and was through after a half.

IMMACULATE HEART settled four wide, circled horses rapidly through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch and finished full of run to win as much
the best. CASCABRIA saved ground into the stretch, had a mild late rally two wide and finished second best. FLYING BUSINESS ran up on heels entering
the turn causing her rider to check hard then came on again four wide through deep stretch. SNACKSTER pressed the pace two wide into the stretch,
drifted to the six path then faded. OPULENT WAYS failed to menace. LA MUNECA sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into
the stretch then weakened late. TALK DIRTY was outrun. WAR CAT had speed into the turn then folded.

Footnotes
GOOD MUSIC close up from the start, swung wide, had a mild late rally under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. KNOCK WOOD chased the
leader two wide into the stretch, led late and just missed hanging on. RAY'S EMPIRE never far back, swung wide and closed a gap mid track. SHOWTIME
BOY broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and weakened. SYNERGISTIC had speed from the start, offered a mild
bid inside the leader into the stretch, steadied when that one drifted in the lost momentum. HARSH TRUTH was bumped at the start and outrun. GRAND
ZHOUL was rank loading, bumped at the start, got out and was never involved. FAST CLIP bobbled at the start, chased the pace along the inside into the
turn and was through early. FIERCELY BRAVE was carried out on the turn and never threatened. THE RIDER OF SYNERGISTIC LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHOWTIME BOY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO
ACTION.
