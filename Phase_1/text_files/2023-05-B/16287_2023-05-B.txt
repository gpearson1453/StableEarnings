STARSHIP BELMONT sprinted away from the field, increased her margin without challenge to the lane, then held while being kept to the task. LOVELY
EVER AFTER unhurried to the second turn, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. AZTEC
PRINCESS mid pack and inside, bore out through the first turn, straightened and moved up through the second turn, came through inside and evened out.
SALIT allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and got up for a share. SCOOP THERE IT IS
rated just off the rail, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded the final furlong. I CAME TO DANCE
mid pack and outside, faded through the second turn.

made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. MY LILY MAE mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. HARD TO PLEASE well placed and inside, moved up on
the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SOLDIERESS well placed and
outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker
and weakened. ANNA LUCIA allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and improved position. QUEEN
OF THE DANCE unhurried, moved up inside through the second turn, came through on the two path into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DARK DAHLIA

ANOINT unhurried early, was blocked through the second turn, waited, came through on the two path into the lane, made a steady gain, split foes late and
edged up in the final stirdes. RIGHT NOW mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. MERINO WOOL stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader
into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead inside the furlong marker, then flattened out. STARSHIP MACYS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, increased her margin without challenge, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. BOURBON BLAST well placed and outside, moved up on
the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. WORLDLY BEAUTY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide
through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. CAGUA tracked the pace and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY HARRY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
CLEMSON TIGER mid pack, angled out through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place.
SUMMER PALACE unhurried early, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
for the place. BATTLE CREEK reared and hopped at the start, was allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on
that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and edged up for a share. FREE SHIPPING mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the
second turn, came widest into the stretch and evened out. PAPA JIMMY well placed and inside, tracked the pace through the second turn, came through
inside of rivals and faded the final furlong. ROWDY JESS well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, then had no stretch
rally. TRANSFER THE FUNDS was no factor. FACTORINO rated close up, saved ground through the turn, then faded into the stretch. A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.
