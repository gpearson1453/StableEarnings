RAINBOW STEW saved ground while being prominently place early, angled out three-wide leaving the quarter pole for room and finished fast to be up in
the final strides. SECRET HOTTIE was forwardly placed from the start, moved up two-wide on the turn to gain the lead nearing the stretch and then just
failed to last. GOAT ROCKS saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed to dispute the issue into the stretch and held on fairly well late to earn
the show. MANY MEMORIES was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to threaten. A FRIEND INDEED dropped far back after
breaking a step slow and was eased up on nearing the finish.

BEAU MISCHIEF prompted the early pace set by Amara Mike, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. ALL THE KING'S MEN saved
ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. LANGSTON ROAD was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide and finished in a mild rally. AMARA MIKE saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and drifted out late while weakening.

Footnotes
FRANKS FIX IT prompted the issue while racing three-wide, caught Dusalut nearing the quarter pole, dueled with him from that point and proved best in a
hard drive. DUSALUT dueled for the lead from the outset along the inside, responded when asked but wasn't quite good enough in a determined effort.
MAMACALLMEBOO was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. NEW EVERY MORNING was prominent from the start,
came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. OUR EMPIRE stumbled at the start, then was unhurried while saved ground, offered a mild along the
inside entering the stretch and went evenly late. R B EYE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. TAINO
HOUSE was unhurried early while racing two-wide and failed to threaten. MINEHUNTER vied for the lead to the stretch while racing two-wide and tired.
FOSTER BOI hopped at the start, then raced three-wide on the turn and was not a factor.

HEREDIA BOXER was reserved off the early pace, moved forward while five-wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole
and won drawing clear. CALIBOGEE saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner but held on well for the place. MOJAVE broke out
sharply, then saved ground, angled out entering the stretch to offer a bid and then hung. MISO FAST saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through
during the drive but lacked the needed late response. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO checked early when Mojave came out, then was unhurried, came four-wide
into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. DEMOCRAT was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. WARFRONT FIGHTER
was in tight early, settled in the middle of the packed and failed to threaten. D K'S CROWN gave way after showing brief speed. COMMISSIONER DAVID
was pinched back at the start, dropped back and failed to threaten. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING
THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
COMPANY'S DREAM saved ground setting the pace, drifted out leaving the quarter pole and was fully extended to just last. IT'S TURBO was reserved off
the early pace, launched his bid nearing the quarter pole while three-wide and finished fast to just miss. MISTER MIDAS prompted the pace while racing
three-wide and held on well during the drive for the show. ICE TOWER was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.
ROYAL HALO bobbled at the start, then was allowed to settle in stride racing along the inside, steadied lacking room nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
angled out and finished willingly when clear. GOLD RUSH JUNIOR was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MISS ACCELERATE was allowed to settle in stride, came between horses into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. STARRY
BEACH was forwardly placed from the start while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. A LITTLE GRACE vied for the
lead from along the inside, responded to pressure and held on well for the show. SHESRSECRETWEAPON was prominently placed while racing four-wide
on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. VANDULIE checked from between horses nearing the half mile pole, recovered to offer a
two-wide bid nearing the quarter pole but lacked a late response. POCKET KNIFE dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and gained her best
stride too late. LUTE'S DIAMOND was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to be a serious factor. SETTLER'S COVE vied for the
early lead from between horses, steadied in tight nearing the quarter pole and gave way.
