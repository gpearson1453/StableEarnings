ORASHI checked on the inside on the first turn nearing the thirteen sixteenths pole, then tracked the dueling leaders throughout, came four wide into the
lane and wore down the front runners late to get up in time, driving. LUCKY RUNNING CAT vied for the lead and made a two wide bid leaving the turn and
gained a short lead in the furlong grounds but was nailed at the wire to just miss. EYE ON THE CANDY vied for the lead on the inside and had a long drive
in the lane but was outfinished late. BENCH PRESS was settled early, made a four wide middle move to track the leaders on the backstretch and then
weakened on the tjurn. CABAR SUL was reluctant to load, then ran off pre-race, then broke alertly and was rated three to four wide early, dropped to the
inside on the far turn and faded. SUPER REIGN showed little.
