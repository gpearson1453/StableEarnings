MACHO SAM off a length slow, was able to clear due to drifting out rival floating out other speed threats, continued clear on the turn, entered lane clear and
held safely under urging. CHASING THE VISION stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued saving ground through the turn and into the
lane, responded gamely to urging and finished up well to the wire. HAKUNUI away well, tried to go to rail but floated out by drifting out rival, finally got to go
in going into the turn, bumped rival in the process, continued three wide on the turn, kept in a drive in the lane while earning a non threatening third.
WATER'S FOR FIGHTN away well, drifted out into the six path on the backstretch, bumped entering the turn while rival was coming in to save ground, went
two wide rest of the turn, in range entering the lane and outfinished while under a drive. OMAHA RUTSCH stalked pace two wide on the backstretch,
continued two wide on the turn, aggressively angled four wide in upper stretch but failed to respond when asked. PAUL L chased leader four wide on the
backstretch, continued wide trip on the turn, and began to weaken late on the turn while not offering much in the lane.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DOWN 123 away well, dueled with inside rival throughout, asked right handed and dug in to prevail in a tight finish. RACY SWEET CORONA
away midpack, accelerated well to duel with outside rival, kept in a drive and asked right handed late to come up short in a strong effort. THINK AGAIN KEV
away well but bumped on hind end at the start, which put him into a leaning in position, causing him to drift in, kept to task in a game effort despite not fully
leveling. JUST A FOOLER rubbed the gate and came away a step slow, in tight passing the gap, floated in midway and kept on gamely. BRINDISI away
well, asked right handed passing the gap, drifted in a path, and asked again late in a game try. CHOOSEN ONE broke out, steady urged left handed
throughout, floated in a path pass the sixteenth in a good effort. HEZ LONESOME bit slow and floated in by outside rival at the start, drifted in at the gap,
and kept to a hand ride to the wire. KEVINS KNOCKOUT broke in and brushed with rival at the start, asked early left handed and reacted negatively, asked
again midway and reacted negatively again and weakened thereafter. MAX STORM hopped and hit the outside part of the gate, bumped back in between
rivals in a rough beginning, lacked path early and saved after losing all chance.
