Footnotes
ZAKHARI took command from the onset, controlled the pace down the back straight, was still rating kindly unchallenged through the far turn, opened up in
upper stretch and won comfortably crossing the line. MIGHTY SEA sat on the rail in the middle of the pack in the early stages of the race, shifted just off the
fence to commence his run with three furlongs left to go, angled out five wide at the top of the lane and closed belatedly to be a clear but non threatening
second in the end. GUARD OF HONOUR was in a good spot under a snug hold behind the frontrunner at the half, was coaxed along inside midway on the
final turn, was in the hunt as they straightened out for the drive and evened out the final sixteenth holding for third. GLENHOLME trailed the field in the
beginning stages of the race, saved ground advancing on the fence at the three furlong marker, stayed on the rail in upper stretch and showed some late
interest passing tiring foes down the stretch. MOONQUEST was bumped by the inside runner at the break, travelled four wide mid pack entering the first
turn, was given the lines to go after the pacesetter three eighths from the finish, loomed four wide at the top of the lane and stalled in the final furlong.
CANDY WINE settled near the rear in the early going, continued to see most of the field down the backside, was roused to go after horses on the far turn
and could not make an impact in the stretch. COLLABORATIVE broke out at the start, tracked three wide into the first turn, kept a close eye on the leader
just off the fence down the backside, was ridden for more between rivals midpoint on the turn, offered little response and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPED UP was in just a hair tight at the start, lacked early speed racing last but one, encouraged along late on the turn racing near the inside, came out a
bit for the drive then dove back nearer inside, split rivals past the furlong marker, struck the lead seventy yards from home and prevailed under steady
handling. HEAT MERCHANT got away well, eased off rivals to stalk into the turn, went five wide on that bend, was forced out eight deep coming to the top
of the stretch by a drifting rival, bid and took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. UNDER SURVEILLANCE raced in behind runners off the
pace up the backstretch, steadied on heels past the nine-sixteenths, was guided to the rail coming to the three-eighths, put to urging at the five-sixteenths,
made a mild rail bid in mid-stretch but was outkicked. MR NARCISSISTIC advanced up the rail early but steadied on heels in tight at the nine-sixteenths,
regained momentum running easily behind the leaders, came out four to five wide turning for home, bid between runners in mid-stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. POSTURING switched outside foes heading up the backstretch lacking significant early speed, went four wide on the turn in behind
runners, moved out seven wide turning into upper stretch then altered outside a rival and kicked on but needed more. BENLION was unhurried at the rear
shifting in, saved some ground on the turn, came out in the stretch and passed rivals. FORESTER HUMOR prompted the pace outside the leader three
deep, bore out a bit leaving the turn, came back in but weakened through the stretch. HULLABALOO was rank and hard to control early pulling to the lead
while getting out and racing off the rail and a bit erratically, weakened in the stretch. NORTHERN PASSAGE got away well, was forwardly-positioned early
tracking in behind off the inside, dropped back heading into the turn, failed to rally. SENSING HOLIDAY advanced outside foes in the early going to reach
striking distance on the turn, went four wide on that bend, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
FOOLISH GAMES took the lead at the break, was challenged outside around the turn, found more when headed in upper stretch to open up on rivals at the
furlong marker and was kept to the task holding off the closing foes at the wire. HELLUVA HOLIDAY trailed the compact field at the half, began to pick up
runners three wide at the quarter pole, angled out widest in the seven path for the stretch drive, closed with a rush and just falling short in the end.
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES settled behind the pace with runners on either side down the backside, waited behind the contesting duo through the turn, looking
for a seam, had clear run in the three path at the eighth pole and ran through determinedly between horses in deep stretch. SOCIETY'S KAT stalked on the
outside four deep down the backstretch, rallied three wide around foes midpoint on the turn, loomed the threat six wide turning for home and levelled off in
the final sixteenth. SPEEDY RIVER pressed the pace on the outside through the turn, battled for the top spot five wide turning for home and faltered
between horses in the final hundred yards. O WOW was on the rail tracking the engaging leaders in the beginning, continued inside on the turn, was
shuffled back to last on the fence at the quarter marker and could not make any impression running to the wire.

Footnotes
WEEHAWKEN got away alertly, pressed the early pace from outside, applied pressure taking in the vicinity of the six-and-one-half pole, shook clear of
pursuers racing off the inside through the turn, kicked clear and widened in the stretch under steady handling. JULIE'S MIST was forwardly-positioned,
pressed the winner into the turn, was no match for that one but kept on to be second best. JOKES UP broke outwardly, raced off the pace mid-pack outside
foes, went five wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair but held show inside MORAL TURPITUDE, who bumped a rival a the start, raced outside foes
at the back, moved out from five to six wide on the turn coming into upper stretch about eight deep, ran on well but couldn't past for third. ZONING ORDER
was bumped by the aforementioned at the start, raced more forwardly than that one going four wide on the turn, drifted out leaving that bend, lacked the
needed late kick. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB broke awkwardly brushing a rival and a bit slowly, settled at the rear inside, angled out in the stretch and showed
belated interest. BIJOU BABY was prominent between runners early, eased back off those ones stalking in behind going three wide into the turn, failed to
rally. TAPPING A RHYTHM lacked early speed racing off the pace two to three wide, was never near enough to threaten. LIAM'S AWESOME was off the
pace racing inside, came off the rail about the quarter, failed to rally. BEYOND REASON was coaxed forward, showed brief early speed inside, continued to
chase while dropping back, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
BOLT ENOREE took command three wide with seven sixteenths remaining, controlled the pace on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and kept foes at
bay running to the finish line. MY BOY PRINCE was away alertly to lead the field at the half, gave way to the eventual winner to be the chaser throughout
the turn, was ridden for more at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire but was second best in the end. TUNECHI broke inwards when the gates
opened up, tracked outside off the top pair on the turn, was in with a chance three wide three sixteenths from home, could not match strides with the leaders
in mid stretch and held for the show money at the finish. SOUTHERN STYLE was brushed by the outside rival on the break, stalked the top trio at the half,
continued to keep pace with the leaders on the turn and finished up evenly down the lane to stay on for the minor share. MODDASSAH travelled in midfield
three wide between rivals down the backstretch, offered some run passing runners inside on the turn but could not reach contention through the stretch
drive. COMPUTER HACKER broke inwards to begin, was roused five deep at the half, put in a mild run outside foes early in the turn and levelled off in
upper stretch. PONTIAC broke in at the start, was in tight quarters seven sixteenths from the wire, was relegated to last with three eighths to go, urged three
wide on turn and offered little response to the finish line. NIGHT STRIKER was off slow at the break, advanced on the rail into the turn, was shuffled inside
to be last again midpoint on the turn and could not play a role through the stretch drive. SUGAR DROP settled in mid pack four wide at the half, could not
quicken with others throughout the turn and gave way turning for home.

STEP FORWARD stalked from outside three to four wide, was among the leaders turning for home and in contention, bid again seventy yards from home
while drifting out and took a narrow lead then fought on to prevail while continuing to come out all the way to the wire. THE GREAT OZ settled off the pace
mid-pack, advanced rapidly on the turn while moving out from four to five wide by the quarter pole and a bit wider into upper stretch, took the lead while
lugging out in upper stretch then lugged out again later and was outfinished late but game to the wire. JACK THE CAT moved forward inside pursuing the
pace along the rail, came off the fence on the turn, was guided out further in upper stretch for room, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest.
LENNY K settled at the rear lacking early speed, fanned seven wide into the stretch, kept on late but needed more. PERFECT CRIME settled off the leaders
inside, tipped out three wide coming to the quarter pole, angled out six deep into upper stretch, kept on late but needed more. LAPOCHKA broke a step
slowly, raced at the back off the inside, failed to menace. CITRUS BOY was coaxed forward to the lead then taken hold to dictate terms racing near but just
off the rail, weakened in the stretch. FINALIST tracked just off the leader racing three wide, came out further into upper stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TWIN CITY hounded the pacesetter down the back straight, applied more pressure on the leader three furlongs from the line, bid for the lead three wide in a
four pronged battle in upper stretch and dug in the final sixteenth surging at the wire to take the photo. WICO (IRE) settled in midfield well in hand between
runners at the half, engaged for the lead three wide five sixteenths from the finish, poked his head in front at the furlong pole and lost the late stretch battle
at the wire losing the nod. KEEN FLATTER took the lead from the onset, was headed outside through the turn, continued to battle inside up front with three
other rivals in upper stretch and stubbornly fought on to hold for third at the finish. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE travelled in the two path near the back in the
beginning, rally five sixteenths out three wide around foes, angled out widest to the seven path for the drive and was gaining slowly on the leaders but
settled for a minor share. ONE FOR CHAP settled near the rear in the early going, picked up the pace two off the fence midway on the turn, was in with a
chance for a small share entering the stretch and finished up evenly to the wire. CLASSIC DANCER tracked inside on the rail, waited behind the contesting
foursome at the quarter pole, was ridden on the fence turning for home and needed more in the late stages to be a threat at the finish. VELOCITOR
stumbled on the break, tracked three wide at the half, took up the chase four deep midpoint on the turn, threatened six wide turning for home but faded at
the furlong marker. DREAM JEREEM off slow at the start to trail down the backside, saved ground through the turn but could not improve and was not
involved running inside down the stretch.

Footnotes
CADAMOSTO (IRE) got away well, settled into stride shadowing the pacesetter while kept wide, went three deep on the turn, took command at the top of
the stretch, kicked clear and held safe. HILARIOUS AFFAIR raced outside foes mid-division, went four wide on the turn, closed the gap on the winner
without posing any real threat and was second best. EMBRACE MY UNCLE lacked speed at the rear, was encouraged along on the turn racing inside,
swung six wide for the drive, was gaining but too late. SIR SEAMUS broke sharply and took command of the pace setting it while in hand racing inside and
shadowed by the eventual winner, was overtaken by that one at the top of the stretch, fought on but was only one-paced and lost show late. HUNT
MASTER lacked early speed racing last but one, saved ground on the turn before shifting five wide turning for home, ran on mildly. SALVATOR MUNDI
chased from between runners in the second flight, lacked the needed late response. PRICELESS WILL raced between runners then outside foes in the
second flight going three wide on the turn, failed to rally. PARTICULAR pursued from inside runners in the second flight mid-division, failed to rally.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN took control right from the start, opened up on his chasing rivals while in hand at the three eighths pole, drew away easily in upper
stretch and crossed the wire all alone while never being asked through the lane. JAMIESTA was bumped on the break to trail the field down the backstretch,
found his feet with three eighths remaining picking up runners, angled out widest in the six path turning for home and closed in to be a non threatening
runner up at the finish. HIGHLAND LIFE stalked on the rail in midfield at the half, was steadied inside entering the turn to be outside four wide with three
furlongs to go, regrouped five wide at the top of the lane and closed well getting up in time for third. FOREST BUZZ broke in to start, pressed between
runners at the half, was scrubbed on to keep up with the loose frontrunner on the turn, could not gain but rebid inside in deep stretch to get a minor share at
the finish. KINETIC STONE tracked the top pair just outside four furlongs from the wire, closed around rivals to be second in mid stretch and weakened in
the final seventy yards losing the three horse photo for show at the finish. GIVE ME MY MONEY was near the rear down the backside, could not get
involved through the turn and found his best stride late offering a good finish. BOSS HOLIDAY broke in the begin, was three wide in the middle of the field in
the beginning, put in a brief run with five sixteenths left go and levelled out between foes at the furlong marker. HALF TO RELOAD stalked the top three
running inside throughout the turn, was ridden to go after the leaders two furlongs out, had no run to give and faded the last furlong. CRIMSON COMET
travelled in the middle of the pack with runners on either side in the early stages, gave way midpoint on the turn and retreated in upper stretch. RIDERS
