Footnotes
WAGON TRAIN lead the way into the turn under a steady drive then drew off in the stretch to prevail in the end wire to wire. MIAMI MOONLIGHT tracked
the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the turn to dig in gamely in the early stretch, drifted out then continued to close belatedly but it
wasn't enough in the end. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER tracked the pace while two then came out four wide on the turn to rally in the stretch and was closing
well but it was too late. WITHOUT A SONG stalked the pace from the inside, then came out three wide to rally on the turn and into the stretch but it wasn't
enough. BOMBER COMMAND was in a strong drive to press the pace into the turn while two wide, rallied in the early stretch but had nothing left and
weakened in the end. MILLCREEK ROAD broke outwardly at the start, then raced behind the field along the inside throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
DEAR BEAU (IRE) reserved well off the early pace near the rear of the field, commenced a rally in the far turn circling the pack was set down for the drive
on the outside and closed willingly to be up in the final strides. OIL N CANDY tracked the leaders from the pocket while racing along the rail, lost some
position in the turn when the pack tightened, cut the corner turning for home and closed willingly up the fence to just miss MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL stalked
the loose frontrunners down the backstretch from two wide, made a three wide bid in the turn to take the lead in mid-stretch but failed to hold off the two
closers in a good effort. GLORY O broke outward into rival, raced up from four wide into the first turn to take the lead, settled into a duel on the front end
finally taking command in upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. CHARMING LEAH well position following the leaders down the backside from
between horses two wide, loomed up turning from home from three wide, briefly took the lead and was out-finished down the lane. OCCURRENCE trailed
the field to the far turn and showed mild interest late making gains down the stretch. TIZ A KNOCKOUT squeezed at the start to drop back, gathered up to
settle into stride and went evenly never posing a threat. WISE MEMORIES flashed early speed to duel on the lead for the first three-quarters of a mile and
tired from there.

TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN dueled from the two path throughout the first three quarters then dug in gamely in the early stretch to kick clear and was ridden out
to the end. IMA SKY TRAVELER dueled with an outer rival down the backstretch and into the early stretch, then continued to menace grudgingly but was
outkicked in the end. TURN ON THE BLING was moving up while three wide down the backstretch and into the turn then closed willingly down the lane.
BEBOP BABY chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the turn and was under a strong drive to close evenly down the stretch. TOOTIE raced
in the three path down the first half, was in a hard drive throughout the turn to rally in the stretch but needed more in the end. PROUD VALENTINE chased
the pace from the two path, was moving up while four wide on the turn, then bid in the stretch but came up empty. MRS. KRINKLES raced close behind the
field while four wide then bid on the turn but did not fire in the stretch.

RUN WITT RUN reared at the start giving the field a length, moved into a comfortable tracking position along the rail, made a steady gain down the
backside to be in contention in the pocket turning for home, accelerated quickly to burst to the lead and be going away late after patient handling.
MISSINGYOUCRAZY sped off to take control down the lane the first time, maintained a well rated clear lead into the far turn, responded when challenged
turning for home and held the lead until mid-stretch when he ducked out several paths, was straightened away and finished up second best. XTRA SPICY
stalked the pace in striking distance through out, moved up late in the far turn to loom boldly and finished evenly down the lane. WICKED SONG tracked the
pace from two wide down the backstretch, veered out off heels down the backside briefly impeding rival, continued to be prominent from four wide and
flattened out late in the drive. GOVERNOR ANN settled near the rear of the field to the far turn and made a mild bid in the stretch to close some ground.
TEXAS TWINKIES raced three wide down the backside, was brushed down the backside when rival moved off heels, and went evenly from there never a
threat. KAUSE I'M DEVINE was rank for the first half mile and proved to be no factor. TRANQUILITY flashed brief early foot and steadily faded to the rear.

Footnotes
ASTA LAVISTA HONEY chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the upper stretch to draw off and prevail in
the end. DEVITO broke outwardly at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, was urging strongly on the turn to menace gamely down the lane and
was up for the place position. EAGLEFORD was unhurried early, then was moving up while five to rally on the turn and into the final furlongs just missing
the place prize in the end. ZIPSTER tracked the pace while two wide, then settled back along the inside on the turn, rallied in the late stretch to close well.
JOHN LOUIS' BEVO was unhurried early, then raced from the four path down the backstretch, then bid on the turn and found more in the stretch to close
well but it wasn't enough. WINNY'SSPECIALSTAR set the pace down the backstretch and into the turn then faltered in the stretch. HOLIDAY RUN raced in
the middle of the pack from the inside, menaced between rivals on the turn then gave way in the end. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN settled along the inside and
never fired. PUNTO RAFFA VOLO stalked the pace early from the inside, then slowly faded and wsa through early.

Footnotes
GOOD SCOUT hustled hard away from the gate to take the lead, came under a drive at the quarter pole, surrendered the lead in upper stretch and battled
back under strong handling to gain the advantage. IMA BLING CAT broke alertly, pressed the pace from two wide through the turn, took command turning
for home and was out-finished late in the lane. COLTONS DREAM chased the leaders from the gate to the wire in striking position but failed to gain on the
top two. SWEET RIVER BAINES settled off the rapid early pace along the fence, angled out for the drive and finished with a late mild bid. POMEROY HAZE
slow early to be near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals through the stretch. SIDETOWN broke near the back of the pack, rushed up into mid-pack
contention and faded through the lane. SHE'S AN ANGEL tossed head at the start, moved up briefly and finished up as no threat having lost most of his
chance at the start. REACH THE CIRCLE was never a factor.
