TIMMINS stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BREACH OF TRUST forced
the early pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. RUBY ROAD was off the
pace, saved ground on the far turn and was up for show. FIRST ROUND set a pressured pace but gave way on the far turn and had nothing left.
BROADWAY RUCKUS was well back and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
PACENZA tracked the early leaders, dueled on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. REIGN BY REIN was in range, raced
evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. IS THERE A FOREST was hustled early and a factor on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. BORN TO BE GOOD was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. DOODLE
DANDY was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. REMEMBEROLDTYMES forced the pace and had a slim lead
on the turn but had nothing left. ERRATIQUE was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. BELLA
NINA had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

ALACRITOUS was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. MONEY MATTERS tracked from the
outside, forced the pace on the turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but just missed. LETTING LOOSE was unhurried early,
saved ground on the turn and was the best of the rest. TORPEDO MAX was off slow and closed the gap on the turn but was not a factor. MARTEN RIVER
was hustled early and had a good position on the turn but came up empty. RED MAPLE was up close but chased on the turn and dropped back through the
stretch.

BLACK TAFFY raced in mid pack, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. MISS SCHILLER was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BRIENNE OF TARTH had no speed and saved ground on the
turn but was in tight through the stretch. TANGERINE TWIST was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. MY SONG AND MELODY
showed speed from the outside and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way. OUR STORMY SOPHIA was in range and hustled along on the turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. BELLE FEMME was off the pace, showed little and was never a threat. LOKI'S LIGHTNING stalked
the leader and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. WICKEN CENTS was well back and showed nothing
while outrun.

Footnotes
PENNIESFROMABOVE was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. SHES
ASTYLISH KATZ was in range and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. ONE LAST
FLING was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR was off the pace and
moved up on the turn but needed more. ROAD MAP was in mid pack but chased on the turn and had no rally. ONLY BELIEVE had no speed and was
roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. VERMONT HOLIDAY was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn
but was empty. LUNATICA was well back and showed nothing while never in contention.
