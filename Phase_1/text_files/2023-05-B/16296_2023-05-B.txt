Footnotes
FREE LOVE was sent to the front to set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. STAR OF TOMORROW raced close to the
pace, fell back on the turn, lacked a rally and finished second best. BELLS OF JOY got away well, fell back, saved ground, bid inside leaving the turn,
angled out and gave way. BUMPER GIRL was never far back, raced outside, lacked a stretch response and dropped back steadily. JEMEZ FALLS was
slow early, saved ground, slipped through along the rail on the turn and failed to respond. GOTTA B KITTEN ME was void of early speed, went seven wide
at the top of the stretch and lacked a response. HEY MA raced between horses, stopped on the turn and steadily dropped back.

BLAME NELLIE rallied into the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. BE MY BESTIE stalked the pace, bid between horses in the
upper stretch, inched clear and was outclosed. GO ON GIRL pressed the pace two wide, bid willingly to duel, came up empty late and settled for show.
SECRET OPERATION was crowded along the backstretch, put in a steady effort and improved position. IZZY'S MONSTER was crowded along the
backstretch and failed to menace in an even effort. LORIENT broke slowly and did not threaten. REBA ATTACK was never far back, saved ground and
lacked a bid. STRONGENOUGHSTORM was not a factor. GETTIN DOWN was hustled along to set a pressured pace, had the rider lose the whip in the
upper stretch and gave way. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY came in along the backstretch and was through early.
