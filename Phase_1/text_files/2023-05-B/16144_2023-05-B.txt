Footnotes
ORPHAN HALLIE had a good spot inside watching the contesting trio up front, was ridden hard to go after the leaders at the quarter pole, surged up the
fence with an eighth remaining and won the nod for the victory at the line. HARDWARE GAP was shuffled between foes to trail the field at the half, shifted
out to the five path seeing the field turning for home, split rivals at the furlong marker with a closing rush and lost the bob in a close photo at the finish. LUV
TO WIN broke out at the start, pressed the issue outside down the backside, continued to force things running three wide on the turn, poked his nose in
front in mid stretch but needed more to hold off the closers late. PRINCE SUSSEX had a nice position outside watching the threesome engage one another
up front on the turn, rallied five sixteenths from home picking up the leaders to loom the threat in upper stretch and stalled running four wide to the finish.
WOOD BE WILD set the pace inside while pressured by a pair of rivals on the turn, determinedly fought on until mid stretch and weakened late running on
the wrong lead to the wire. ALLEN DIGGS battled for the lead between runners down the backside, continued fighting up front with runners on either side
throughout the turn, still was in the hunt at the top of the stretch and retreated at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
BOLD RELOAD took control soon after the break, continued to dictate the pace through the turn opened up on the field entering the stretch and was kept to
the task to win comfortably in the end. MORNING THOUGHTS sat behind the front pair rating kindly down the backside, waited behind the front duo running
on the turn, found the seam in the two path in upper stretch and closed belatedly besting the rest. TWO YEAR CONTRACT settled between rivals in the
middle of the pack into the turn, took up the chase three wide five sixteenths from the line, bid four wide as they turned for home but needed more to
threaten in the end. NAVAL OFFICER chased the frontrunning winner at the half, dug in determinedly between horses through the turn and levelled out in
mid stretch holding on for a minor role. NO MORE travelled near the rear in the early stages, put in a brief rally three wide on the turn and could not get
involved running to the wire. LORD M was allowed to settle at the rear outside at the half mile marker, put in a mild run four wide around runners midway on
the turn, was in the seven path at the top of the lane and had nothing to offer running to the wire. LIL GREEN MACHINE broke out at the start, tracked in the
two path in the middle of the pack down the backside, was shuffled between foes to trail entering the turn and was not a factor running through the stretch.
SIR GRAYVENSCROFT stalked on the rail down the backstretch, saved ground running inside on the turn, was hard ridden at the quarter pole, no response
and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HICKSY hounded the frontrunner in the early going, was coaxed for more at the quarter pole, bid for the lead in upper stretch in the three path, took over at
the eighth pole and held safe to the finish. MR CROWLEY tracked the front pair into the turn, took closer order to the top duo rallying three wide two furlongs
left to run, had dead aim on the winner at the top of the stretch outside and was gaining slowly but could not wear down the winner in the end.
FORESTER'S TURN stalked in mid pack two off the fence down the backstretch, offered a good run three wide midpoint on the turn, angled in to the rail at
the furlong marker and closed in to capture third at the finish line. DECIMATOR was near the rear down the back straight, started to pick up runners two
wide outside horses at the quarter pole, angled to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired runners for a minor share. TAKE A CHANCE set the
fractions down the backside and turn, was collared outside by the winner at the top of the lane and yielded between foes at the furlong marker.
DESOLATOR rated in the middle of a spread out field down the backside, was nudged to keep up inside on the turn, could not match strides with others and
was not a presence in the stretch drive. DRAGON'S BREW settled near the back inside at the half, saved ground while advancing on the turn, was in with a
chance for a small share of the prize turning for home but could not quicken inside late to be a factor. HIT THE POINT travelled at the back outside runners
in the beginning, continued to trail on the turn making little progress and could not make an impression running to the wire.

Footnotes
SILENT GHOST took control from the onset, set the fractions uncontested on the turn, was let out a notch to open up on the field turning for home and had
enough left late to hold off the closer at the finish. PINO IN A PURSE was squeezed at the start, patiently weaved her way through traffic down the backside
to get a good position at the three eighths pole, waited behind runners until the quarter marker ,slipped up through the rail at the top of the lane, angled out
to the three path in upper stretch and was gaining late on the winner. SIMPLE SOUVENIR settled near the rear in the early stages, rallied midpoint on the
turn navigating between weakening runners, angled in to rail in upper stretch and finished up strong to close in for a clear third. MACHISIMA raced five wide
mid pack entering the turn, continued to be outside of rivals keeping up with the field at the quarter pole, shifted out to the six path for the drive and battled
on showing late interest to get up for a minor share. LADY MAEVE (IRE) tracked on the rail watching the leader in the two path , was in contention with two
furlongs left to run, angled out to the four path at the top of the lane and finished evenly to the wire. WICKED MIAH chased the frontrunning winner in the
three path in the early going, was ridden four wide two furlongs out, could not keep position and gave way in upper stretch. HASN'T HIT ME YET tracked
four wide into the turn, continued running between rivals in the four path making little progress with five sixteenths remaining and could not play a factor in
the drive to the wire. MORE SAVVY travelled on the rail in the middle of the pack in the beginning stages, was shuffled back through the field on the fence
through the turn and could make little gain on the rail down the stretch. IVY'S STAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SWEET NOLA raced in the back half of the field, went three to four wide on the turn, came out six deep in upper stretch, finished strongly under urging to
just get up. CRIMSON NIGHTS caught a flyer breaking very sharply, dropped back off the leaders pursuing from outside, went four to five wide on the turn,
struck the lead in upper stretch, was just caught. TAYLORMOON raced off the pace two to three wide into the turn, angled out past the quarter pole, entered
upper stretch seven wide, brushed a rival lightly in mid-stretch and rallied. CRUMLIN BEAST bumped the inside rival at the start, was outside toward the
back, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, brushed lightly in mid-stretch, finished up well to gain late. SILENT SKY vied inside for the early lead, was
overtaken past the five-sixteenths, fought back inside the new leader to best that one but was outkicked by others. TELLTALE bumped a rival at the start,
chased inside, was unable to menace. WORRY LESS pressed the dueling leaders under a hold early, pulled forward to the lead past the five-sixteenths
going three to four wide, faltered in the lane. SNOW LAKE was bumped and squeezed back at the break, trailed early, swung about four or five wide into the
stretch and was never a threat. TENDER SITUATION was bumped at the start, moved forward to duel outside then between runners, dropped back on the
turn and continued to weaken some.

AIM FOR THE SKY bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, had the early lead but was outsprinted and content to press, moved closer on the turn, took a
narrow lead past the five-sixteenths, edged to a bit further advantage turning into upper stretch. NIAGARA SKYLINE tracked in behind the leaders near the
rail, angled out three wide and put to urging coming to the quarter pole, floated out five wide into upper stretch making a bid, couldn't get past the winner
and held second. POSEIDON STEEL settled at the rear near inside, advanced into upper stretch, came out six wide and was gaining but too late. MAAKWA
was reluctant to load, urged at the break and moved to the lead quickly, was pressured into the turn and overtaken midway on that bend, fought on but
needed more. THERE'S NO JOE settled off the pace, swung seven wide, ran on mildly. CHANCEL was lightly bumped at the start, chased from between
runners in the second flight two to three wide, came out five wide for the drive, failed to rally. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) was urged at the start, raced three
to four wide on the turn, shifted in a bit in upper stretch, made no bid.

Footnotes
ANARCHIST got away alertly, was overtaken for the lead past the five-eighths, stalked from outside, moved forward to challenge late on the turn, was in
command at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear and held sway while being kept to the task. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) raced outside the second flight, swung
six wide into upper stretch, closed the gap on the winner but needed more. OLD CHESTNUT exchanged a light bump at the start, tracked from between
runners in the second flight, came out five wide turning for home, gained inside a rival but evened out late. CANDY OVERLOAD settled off the pace, swung
eight wide for the drive, gained some but too late. IRONSTONE bumped with a rival and lost the path getting squeezed back at the start, raced at the back
early while from off the inside, advanced between runners on the turn, kept on in the stretch. ARZAK was coaxed forward to the lead inside a rival after the
opening furlong, set the tempo on or just off the rail, was challenged past the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. READY FOR A FIGHT chased from
inside, was encouraged along by the five-sixteenths while dropping back some, ran on evenly in the stretch. RED RIVER REBEL raced in behind the
second group off the inside going in the three path on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep, faltered.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON was unhurried early outside of horses, content with being near the back in the early going, put in a bold move four wide at the three
eighths marker around runners to bid for the lead in upper stretch and determinedly outkicked his rival down the lane to edge away in the final stages.
SILENT POET had a good position watching the top pair battle down the backstretch for the front, quickened with his outside competitor midpoint on the
turn to take lead in this compact field into the stretch and could mot match strides with the winner late. CLEAR DESTINATION settled at the rear running
between horses in the beginning stages of the race, was relegated to trail the field with three furlongs remaining, shifted out widest to the five path in upper
stretch and fought on with an inside rival for the show share of the prize just getting up with the nod to dead heat for third money. HAVE A SOUPER DAY
settled on the rail in the final flight stalking at the half, angled outside off a tiring front dueling pair at the quarter marker, was four wide turning for home,
battled with an outside foe for the show award and was just caught at the wire to dead heat for the show award. KAWACATOOSE pressed the early pace
just off the leaders flank down the backside, assumed a brief lead at the three furlong marker, was quickly taken over by a pair of outside challengers as
they entered the stretch and faded inside at the furlong marker. WARP RIDE was hustled inside to secure the lead down the backstretch, was collared at
the three eighths pole by an outside rival, quickly gave way, faltered in upper stretch and was not persevered with through the lane.

Footnotes
MASTER SPY settled off the pace outside, advanced four to five deep on the turn, kept on in the lane to edge past late. ROCKET JOE COPPER switched
out early and advanced outside four wide late up the backstretch and on the turn, ridden along at the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch making a bid
near the sixteenth, was outkicked for the top prize but got the nod for place. SAILOR'S PASSION was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn, came out
in upper stretch, rallied inside foes late but just missed the nod for second. DOT'S VISION broke inwardly, raced mid-pack off the inside, was held up in
behind rivals at the five-sixteenths, moved out leaving the turn, came into upper stretch eight wide, kicked on mildly. CRAFTY CONQUEST was lightly
bumped into a rival at the start, moved clear, set the pace racing off the rail, was well clear in upper stretch, began to weary and weakened through the lane.
HONEY WON'T was mid-pack inside early, steadied on heels about the five-and-one-half, lacked room pinned down inside soon after, came off the rail late
on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. MAYITO bumped a rival clearing the gap, chased two to three wide, shifted seven deep into upper stretch and
weakened. TRICKY MAGICIAN bumped a rival at the start, stalked from outside, moved to the rail on the turn chasing the leader, came up empty. MR.
DAZZLE switched outside a rival at the start, raced toward the back off the inside, failed to rally. MAD DOG N JOE was bumped inwards passing the gap,
tracked from inside, failed to rally. BEYOND BORDERS was bumped lightly at the start, raced outside at the back, was never near enough to threaten.
