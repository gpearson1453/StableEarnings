Footnotes
SISTER SPIRIT raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from three or four wide down the backstretch and dueled down the stretch with the
leader, edged away to prove best. WICKED SAUCY pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then took the lead nearing the half pole, was
challenged rounding the final turn and dueled down the stretch to be a game second. LOOKING FOR FLARE had good foot early then settled off the pace
around the first turn, moved between horses entering the final turn and gave late effort to be up for the show. DESTINED TO DANCE was allowed to settle
around the first turn then launched a bid at the three eighths pole to improve position but was empty. CHANTILLY MOON (PER) stalked the pace from the
two path then moved up inside of rival down the backstretch and faltered. COWGIRL HOP trailed the field to the top of the stretch and passed tiring rivals.
ALWAYS FORWARD tracked the leaders to midway down the backstretch then made a mild bid into the turn and tired. MY BEST GIRL went to a pressured
lead to the half pole then vied for a furlong and retreated.

Footnotes
BUDDY BUDDY was hustled to the lead into the first turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole, dueled to the wire and won the nod. SPANGLISH
was off the pace in the two path around the first turn then engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole and matched strides to the wire but was denied.
MINISTRY OF MAGIC was unhurried down the backstretch then launched a bid from three wide at the quarter pole, moved out to four wide in upper stretch
to make a late rally for the show. PENGUIN PARADE stalked the pace around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole to vie for the
lead around the final turn but was out kicked late. BOSS E BOOGS never fired. REMYS SHOWTIME tracked the leaders around the first turn then tried to
move between horses after the three eighths pole but was in tight and had to be taken up and couldn't recover.

to six wide in upper stretch to make a late run and matched strides with the leader but was denied. CLEARLY VISIBLE raced in the middle of the pack
around the first turn then move up to go between horses at the five sixteenths pole but lost her path and steadied slightly, made a rebid and split horses at
the eighth pole and held the show. CHINA CAT trailed down the backstretch then made a two wide bid going into the final turn and maneuvered through
traffic around that turn and rallied to just miss the show. DON'T TELL GRANDMA went four wide into the first turn then rushed up to vie for the lead from
three wide through the final turn and tired. SAX stalked the pace from four wide then made a bid on the final turn and weakened. DAT DARES GOLD was
close up on the inside down the backstretch then tried to move up but lacked room on the final turn, moved out to four wide in the stretch but had no late
kick. SWEET ANNABELLA remained back. SUPER WILDCAT was rushed to the lead around the first turn then was over taken a the three eighths pole and
slowly faded. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS LODGED, THE JOCKEY OF SHINY PENNY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF RED QUEEN FOR

DIVINE FASHION was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn to give a late kick to just get up for the win.
ACADIAN GIRL vied for the lead from the two path down the backstretch then match strides with the leader around the final turn and inched away going into
the stretch but couldn't fend off the late closer. KALENJIN was allowed to settle around the first turn then launched a two wide bid at the three eighths pole
and was gaining on the leader around the final turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch and flattened out. FLOATING BY race near the back around
the first turn then made a two wide bid at the quarter pole for a late run to improve position. MY JUBA went to the front to set the pace, was challenged
going into the final turn and matched strides with outside rival to top of stretch and tired. TEQUILA FOG chased the leader but was not a factor. SHERIFF'S
KID was not a threat. TAPPING SOUTH trailed throughout.

stretch and was nailed at the wire. SNOWY JUBA CAT chased the leader and never made a bid. FAST MULE had no early speed then moved up from
three wide on the turn and improved position. SISTER JOANN raced back early then moved between horses at the three eighths pole but failed to menace.
KILBRITTAIN'S RED split horses early to be off the pace to the to the turn and retreated. CEDAR'S WISH was restless in the gate then was last away and
never a factor. EMBERLY had brief foot then had to check early and dropped back.

Footnotes
IRISH SAMURAI raced near the back around the first turn then advanced from three or four wide through the final turn and collared the leaders at the eighth
pole and drew clear late. JACCACI trailed the field around the first turn then moved up the rail down the backstretch, moved around horses on the turn then
split horses at the top of the stretch and prove second best. SPUNKY ZOEY bumped foe going into the first turn but kept on to be off the pace on the inside,
moved up to engage the leader at the three sixteenths pole and took a brief lead and tired. SUPERSNAKE was rushed up from three wide to take the lead
at the half pole then was collared at the three sixteenths pole and tired. FORT ZANNA was unhurried down the backstretch then moved out to three wide at
the quarter pole and improved position. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a rail bid at the quarter pole,
moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch and made a late run to improve position. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE was bumped going into the first turn then
advanced to contention from three wide down the backstretch but flattened out in the drive. PRETTY SPECTACULAR was close up on the leaders around
the first turn then dropped back. CURLIN'S DOVE went to the early lead around the first turn then tracked the leader down the backstretch and gave way. C
