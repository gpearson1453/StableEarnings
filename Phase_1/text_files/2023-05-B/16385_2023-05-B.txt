Footnotes
RAP ARTIST was the speed of the race and took advantage it, took the lead early, secured the rail spot, set the pace to his liking, and drew off late
uncontested, was much the best today. CARLOS PUNCH vied for the early lead then eased back just a bit and stalked the eventual leader from the three
path, stayed just at the leaders hip until he was asked at the half mile pole, moved up half of a length on the outside, another rival moved up beside him
along the rail, had room but could not get a head of the eventual winner and chased through the lane earning second place dividends. SILKY'S DANCE
settled off of the pace, mid pack on the rail, was asked to advance at the half mile pole, responded with a mild bid and held his position.
HEREWECOMETOGETYOU was off a half of a step slow, settled well off the pace in the three path, was encouraged at the half mile pole and showed a
brief turn of foot as he was able to circle half of his competitors through the turn, raced five wide down the stretch but to no avail. PAYNTED LOVER made
no impact. ROCK STAR ALEX was never involved.

Footnotes
SHE'S TAKIN OVER was off a step slow, raced four wide through the first turn and down the back stretch, launched a bid at the half mile pole, moved in
between foes, found room and angled out five wide entering the stretch, was encouraged and kept on point, responded willingly and cleared the early leader
after the sixteenth pole. TRACK QUEEN raced five wide while tugging against her reins through the first quarter, settled along the outside in the second tier
and stalked the early leader, launched her bid after the half mile pole on the outside and responded well, drew clear at the quarter pole, was driven, and
encouraged but was run down late by a closing foe and settled for second place honors today. Still very game effort today. SUE'S LITTLE ZING bumped at
the start, was quickly corrected and vied for the lead, took the rail and set the pace as he showed the way, was challenged at the three eights pole, gamely
battled on through the stretch but gave way late. GEAUX VOTE broke and settled off the pace, raced along the rail, was behind the leader and had a set of
competitors on her outside, patiently waited for racing room, angled out into the four path at the quarter pole, but had no late kick. MOR KISSES bumped at
the start, settled off the leader in the three path and stalked, was joined by another competitor at the half mile pole, traveled in company with that foe while
stalking the leader until the three eighths pole then faded. COUSIN VICKIE showed little. ZEEROCK was never involved. T J'S FIRST trailed.

MINT was fractious in the gates, momentarily stalked from the four path, willingly improved position, challenged the early leaders for a few strides on the

raced along the while setting the early fractions, was challenged by two outside rivals at the half mile pole, relinquished the lead, shifted out at the quarter
pole and raced four wide down the lane, struggled to switch leads and had to settle for second place today. CRAFTY HEAT stalked from the two path, was
joined by another competitor and raced with company, challenged the early leader at the three eights pole, couldn't sustain the bid with the horse to his out

PROUD VICTORIA vied for the early lead, raced on the rail while smartly taking back and stalking the three early leaders, waited until the five sixteenth pole
to launch a bid, shifted out a bit, had clean racing room, and was asked, responded willingly and quickly, was kept on point and was up in time to gamely
take the top spot. KEWPIE DOLL stalked the early pace from the three path, launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole, took the lead in the furlong ground but
was caught just a few strides later and settled for second. HURRICANE TIZWAY vied for the early lead and was able to secure the rail, raced along the rail,
was pressured by outside contenders, repelled these rivals while passing the quarter pole, but was quickly challenged in deep stretch and gave way late.
POINT OF VICTORY settled off the pace, angled down to the rail, saved ground but to no avail. QUEEN'S MISSION showed little. L G GIRL was never
involved. KIND WAYS was no menace.

Footnotes
IRONIT raced along the rail a few lengths off the early speed on a loose rein, gently edged out into the four path at the five sixteenth marker, circled the field
through the rest of the turn willingly, was four wide entering the stretch, was encouraged with the right handed crop at the top of the lane, responded well,
was slightly encourage into deep stretch and drew away under a hand ride. HARRIET'S DREAM vied for the early lead, raced in the two path while setting a
brisk pace, was pushed by an inside challenger, and pressured by a rival on the outside, shook those contenders, to be caught in the stretch by a fast
closing challenger, battled briefly and tired. SCAMPERING GRAYCE raced off the pace five wide, followed the eventual winner's path through traffic, closed
well but it was not enough today. HUSHED COURT ROOM raced off of the pace three wide, maintained that position, was asked, closed mildly and passed
tired foes. OURPERFECTPRINCESS vied for the early lead along the rail, drew next to the leader then gave way. TWN MS MIDSHIP raced in the two path
but could never get involved. MISS PRIORITY raced on the rail, had no excuse. LA SMOOCHIE raced in the four path, was briefly in contention after the

Footnotes
MORE ICE stalked the pace setters from the three path, was cued at the half mile pole, was encouraged and kept on point, was able to out finish the rest.
NATE'S ATTACK raced from off the pace on the inside early, advanced up in between foes along the backside, gained ground and moved into a stalking
position along the rail, coolly stayed on the fence and took advantage of the rail opening up at the quarter pole, closed well and just missed. AFLEET
ASCENT vied for the lead, attended the pace, then tired late. OAK HILL SOLUTION stalked the pace, was in contention then faltered. SENATOR CON
raced along the rail in mid pack, maintained that position through out. ITS A CITY DAY showed little. HARD LOVE was never involved. DOC IRWIN gave a
mild effort before fading. VINYL trailed.
