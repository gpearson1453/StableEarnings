WINE WITH A ROSE tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, drifted in,
straightened, then drew off in the late going. CEREAL I D sprinted away to a long lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. BABY BLUE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide
into the stretch and closed well for the show. GARBET well placed and outside, drifted out through the second turn and faded. ISHKA BARHA was never
involved.

Footnotes
LEONARD'S LEGACY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the lane and lasted under steady pressure. CITY TRIPPER
tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. ASPLUNDER mid
pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SLIPPERY WHEN
WET allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well, gaining a share. HINDENBURG well placed and
outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. MAGIC BOMB unhurried, moved up three wide
through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and ran evenly. AWESOME PUDDING pulled to contention, stalking the pace, lost some ground through
the turn on the two path, then faded in the lane.

VELOCIMO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task.
NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed and inside, moved up through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. YARDMAN hopped
at the start, was slow to get in strides, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the show. POINT
LOMA stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
PITON well placed and outside, angled in to the two path and moved up through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened in the drive. FLAT
BUSTED allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not gain. MOMENT AT SEA mid pack,
moved up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and faded. ROUND ROBIN was never involved.
