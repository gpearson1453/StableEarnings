from the four path in mid stretch but gave way. MORE SAVVY was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and closed willing through the stretch. JUNGLE

HASN'T HIT ME YET was in touch, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. FRERET was away
alertly, a factor on the turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. SAVVY'S SISTER was off the pace, trailed
the field on the turn and was up for show. FRESH DREAMS showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but needed more. MS. P'S BELLA showed
speed and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE was hustled early and dueled
on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. NEW YORK MINT was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
ONE MORE RING was away alertly, had a good position on the turn and angled out in mid stretch to get up in time. CORE stalked the leader, was a factor
on the turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but was outgunned. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was off the pace, moved up on the turn and was
up for show. BAJAN BULLET was hustled early and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. EIN WAHRER
SOLDAT was off slow, had a mild gain on the turn and was the best of the rest. GUS'S GAMBLE was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but had no
late kick. PRINCE FOR A DAY was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. RELOAD BULLET was
in range and hustled along on the turn but had no impact. GREY DECEPTION was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. AMEN
TO THAT broke poorly and showed nothing while outrun. EL GUERO had no speed, showed little and was not a factor.
