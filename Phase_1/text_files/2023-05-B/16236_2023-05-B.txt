Footnotes
SHEZA HAILSTORM stalked the pace, rallied between horses on the backstretch, assumed command, drew clear on the turn and held well. ARE YOU
LISTENING led to the backstretch, fell back to stalk inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, came again and narrowed the gap. LADIES SISTER was
unhurried early, offered a mild bid along the inside and was along for show while no threat to the top two. PANDORA WHO held a good position along the
inside, angled out on the turn, had nothing left and faded. PRINCESS KITTEN stalked the pace, challenged three across on the backstretch, tired on the
turn and gave way. MARKING'S MIRACLE raced mid pack while wide, lacked a bid and was outrun. DANDY MONEY broke out, trailed the field and passed
tiring rivals. BEVERLY WHO was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, was taken wide and was outrun. RUTHLESS MONEY showed little.

second turn, angled out and closed well. MASTERCLASS stalked the pace towards the outside, was carried out leaving the turn and lacked a rally. MR
CHARLIE KING was sent to the front, vied two across to the second turn, tired and gave way. SPINNING RED was not a factor. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE

Footnotes
FIRST AGAIN advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, closed willingly and drew clear late. NATION OF LAWS set a pressured pace to mid
stretch, was in tight late and all out for place. TURN ON ARCH pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, vied, was in tight late and outnodded
for second. SHAME ON CHARLOTTE stalked the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide and closed steadily. SWEET TEMPEST saved
ground while racing mid pack, had nothing left for the drive and faded. HEMATITE advanced to the turn, bid off the rail and had nothing left for the drive.
MISS LUCKY LADY was not a factor. FOXY RED went five wide on the first turn, pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. GONNABEE
was outrun. CAROLYN'S WAY showed little.

Footnotes
DELBERT TOO stalked the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held well. JET N G raced mid
pack, bid inside on the turn, loomed a threat and didn't have enough late. STORM BAYOU raced close to the pace in an outside trip, bid, hung and settled
for show. ALL CHROME was slow early, saved ground, bid off the rail and finished well. EVACUEE swung wide entering the stretch and finished well.
SHINING SOURCE was not a factor. TUCUM vied for the lead, drew clear into the second turn, tired and gave way. WHERES BRAYDEN pressed the pace
while racing three across, tired on the turn and gave way. PROBATE broke slowly and was crowded at the start and outrun. DESERT REWARD pressed
the pace, challenged between horses on the backstretch and stopped. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference at the start. No
change was made.
