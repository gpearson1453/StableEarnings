Footnotes
ARGENTIUM was unhurried on the rail near the back in the early stages of the race, saved ground picking up rivals on the far turn, bid for the lead three
wide between runners at the top of the stretch, lost his path nearing the eighth pole, re-rallied in deep stretch to edge away from foes at the finish.
INFAMOUS COVERT was in a good spot behind the engaging duo down the backstretch, was ridden to go after the frontrunners midpoint on the far turn,
took command four wide at the furlong marker and was caught by the winner in the final hundred yards. GENDRAGON settled near the back four wide into
the first turn, trailed the field down the back straight, could still see the field five wide at the top of the lane and offered a good late run widest to the wire to
close in well to capture third. JUST START ME UP tracked between runners into the first turn, travelled comfortably three wide outside watching the top pair
at the half, was roused between runners at the three furlong marker, made little impact and finished evenly in the stretch drive. BIG INVESTMENT pressed
the issue going into the first turn, hounded the pacesetter with a half left to run, took control outside at the five sixteenths marker and gave way between
runners while drifting about at the furlong pole. TRIZMO was under a snug hold in midfield three wide in the opening turn, stalked four wide outside rivals
down the backside, put in a mild turn of foot three deep through the far turn and levelled out at the top of the lane. MAD DOG N JOE took the field inside to
the first turn, had a slight advantage setting the pace down the backside, was headed outside midway on the far turn and retreated on the fence in
mid-stretch.

Footnotes
SPANISH PRINCE stalked from outside just off the leader, moved forward to take a narrow lead by the half-mile marker, was clear coming past the
three-eighths, willingly widened the advantage turning into upper stretch, was put to urging at that juncture and kept to the task late. BARTICA settled off the
pace inside, saved ground on the turn, found room inside rivals up the rail in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but captured the place. SING DIXIE
was forwardly-positioned tracking the leading pair from inside, was guided out three deep at the three-eighths coming four wide into upper stretch and with
aim on the leader and now under urging, could only go on evenly in the lane. SEATTLE POINT exchanged a light bump at the start, raced well in hand
mid-pack but not too far back of the leaders early, shifted in and saved ground into the turn, came out while advancing leaving that bend, was two deep
between runners in upper stretch, evened out late. NGABE was unhurried well back early, shifted in and went two to three wide on the turn, ran on well but
too late. SNOOKERED raced mid-pack early, was between foes into the turn, shifted six wide turning for home, kicked on mildly. OPEECHEE stalked in
behind the leaders outside a rival, went three to four wide on the turn, put to urging while coming five deep into upper stretch, needed more late. ZIPPY
HOLIDAY exchanged a light bump at the break, raced well back and off the rail, passed tired foes. INFINITELY KATZ set the pace inside, was overtaken
into the turn, came out leaving that bend, turned up empty. WIN THE DRAW was outpaced and failed to menace. DON'T STOP DREAMIN was urged from
the break, raced outside foes mid-division into the turn going three to five wide on that bend and coming wider still into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
INDY CHAMPAGNE broke inwards to begin, was in hand near the rear entering the backstretch, began to weave his way through runners at the half,
loomed the threat four wide in upper stretch and grinded out the win through the entire lane getting the nod at the finish line. AHA MOMENT had a good
position down the backstretch tracking the top pair three wide on the outside, assumed the lead outside at the two furlong pole, braced for the outside
challenge in the three path in upper stretch and fought tooth and nail to the wire losing the close photo in the end. ANDROMACHE led the field into the first
turn inside, continued on the lead setting a soft pace down the backside, was headed outside at the quarter pole, stubbornly dug in on the rail through the
stretch and gave way grudgingly just before the wire. ANTIHERO had a nice position behind the front trio into the first turn, continued to be situated well
down the backside, was on hold on the fence waiting for a seam to open up through the far turn, had clear room inside at the top of the lane and had no
finishing kick running to the wire. THE ARCHANGEL trailed the field for the first half, was ridden for more five sixteenths from the prize and passed tiring
rivals turning for home. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY was on hold behind rivals through the first turn, was shuffled back a few positions down the backside,
saved ground at the three furlong marker and had little finish to offer in the stretch. QUICKER TREAT hounded the pace in the early stages, pressed for the
front at the half mile marker, was scrubbed on to keep up at the three furlong pole and backed away two furlongs out. TURF AND SURF was unhurried
three wide in midpack through the first turn, was roused outside horses into the far turn, had no response and lost touch with the field straightening out for
the drive galloping to the wire.

Footnotes
BEAU GUEST settled just off the leaders, advanced four then five wide leaving the turn, struck the lead just past the quarter pole, was quickly clear and held
sway under steady handling. BE LIKE CLINT broke outwardly bumping a rival, settled at the rear, began to move out on the turn fanning seven wide into
upper stretch, rallied strongly to gain the place. MIDNIGHT ARKLE moved forward between runners mid-pack on the turn, came out five to six wide for the
drive advancing on the leader, needed more late and just held show honors. CLASSY WHISPER was encouraged from the break but lacking early speed,
was held up in behind runners in the two to three path near the three-eights, came out a bit nearing the furlong grounds then dove back in for room and
finished full of run but too late. ALLEGORICAL was outsprinted in the early stages, went four to five wide on the turn losing some ground, altered out nine
deep in upper stretch and showed good late effort. JUSTIN'S WAY settled inside off the pace, came out a path in upper stretch and ran on. SILVER SMOKE
moved forward and clear to set the early pace inside on or just off the rail but was soon overtaken by a foe after the opening quarter, continued to pursue
that one from near inside, came out four into upper stretch and kept on but needed more. QUIET INTENT was bumped and in tight at the break, lacked
room in behind runners midway on the turn racing three to four wide, came out six to seven deep for the stretch run and kicked on mildly. CONFUSING
chased the leaders three to four wide through the turn then weakened. LOBBY BAR was caught outside five to six wide on the turn, failed to rally. VICTORY
TOWN tossed the head slightly at the start, moved forward to hound the leader then take over after the initial quarter setting the tempo two to three wide,
was clear on the turn and shifted in leaving that bend, in a bit tight near the three-sixteenths while weakening and tired thereafter.

Footnotes
KEROUAC took control inside with his neck bowed under the wire for the first time, set soft fractions alone up front down the backside, continued
unchallenged throughout the final turn and drew away when asked in mid stretch. FANORE (IRE) stumbled on the break, was under a hard hold down the
backside behind the winner, waited on the rail through the second turn, had dead aim on the fence in upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the
final eighth. LANIGAN settled near the rear with runners on either side with a half remaining, was urged at the three furlong marker inside, shifted out three
wide midpoint on the final turn, five wide in upper stretch to rally and found his best stride late closing well to just miss getting up for the place share. BILL
NEEDLE chased the loose frontrunner into the first turn and backstretch, could not maintain position running between rivals at the five sixteenth marker and
gave way in upper stretch. GIOVANNINO stalked in midfield all alone at the half mile marker, took closer order three deep running on the final turn and was
in with a chance turning for home in the three path but stalled at the furlong marker. GOLDEN BURN was allowed to settle three wide trailing in the early
stages, could see the compact field running through the backstretch, was ridden inside with five sixteenths to go and made no impression driving to the wire.
BIG SHOOTER travelled near the rear outside in the beginning, advanced three wide through the back straight, was asked three wide at the three furlong
marker, made little gain and was not involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S REBEL was forced out just a bit at the start but quickly went to the lead and clear, rated on the front-end while dictating terms, moved to the rail
to save ground on the turn, kicked away in upper stretch and held safe. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN had early forward position but was placed in tight
quarters on the rail about the five-eighths, switched outside a foe at that juncture tracking from inside the third group but still just off the leaders, saved
ground near the rail on the turn, gained the place inside in late stretch. WHERE IS ESSA broke outwardly just a bit, was fighting rider's restraint in behind
the leader while keen and in tight behind that one and inside foes, eventually settled down tracking the leader from inside, moved out three wide coming into
upper stretch, needed more and lost place late. PAT'S GAMBLE was encouraged along early racing inside off the pace, improved position in the stretch.
SERENADE AT SEA raced forwardly from between runners to the five-sixteenths going three to four wide on the turn and in range of the leader coming past
the quarter pole but lacked the needed late kick. SOCIETY'S THUNDER broke in the air then bobbled at the start, advanced outside foes five then six wide
on the turn coming seven wide into upper stretch, evened out thereafter. RAGING BEAR raced mid-pack three wide between runners into the turn, came
into the stretch five deep and ran on evenly. SOUPER SUNSHINE broke outwardly lightly bumping with a rival and steadying slightly, moved forward
between foes then outside rivals with intent to get closer to the leaders, pursued four wide into the turn, came out six wide leaving that bend, faltered and
faded. CLIVE CROSS was bumped and squeezed back at the start, angled in and saved ground racing inside at the rear, came out five wide turning for
home then altered out wider still nearing the sixteenth pole and ran on. FLAWLESS RULER had good position outside runners mid-division four wide on the
turn but faded thereafter. MANAGED FOREST broke inwardly bumping a rival, made a mild early advance between runners racing off the inside in about
the three to four path, made no bid. HIGH RESERVE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SIR SAHIB was patiently handled on the rail for the majority of the race, saved all the ground at the top of the lane, shifted out to the three path at the
furlong pole, showed good turn of foot splitting runners in deep stretch and got up for the well timed victory. TECUMSEH'S WAR had a good position inside
watching the top pair down the backside, waiting on the rail in the early part of the turn, shifted out just off the fence at the three eighths marker, had a clear
path to bid in mid stretch, took over the front at the furlong pole and was caught nearing the wire. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) was rating kindly in the middle of
the field with a half left to run, swung out to the five path turning for home, started to lengthen his stride to look like the main challenger at the eighth pole six
wide and needed more in deep stretch to threaten for the win. TAPSASIONAL set the pace through the backstretch, was headed outside with three furlongs
from the line, battled on the fence in upper stretch, gave ways to the leaders at the eighth pole and held for a minor role in the end. SAND DANCER was on
hold inside in the middle of the pack in the beginning,, started a run four wide at the three sixteenth marker and showed late interest weaving his way
through traffic passing horses the final eighth. LAC MACAZA chased the frontrunner early on, engaged for the top spot at the three furlong pole outside,
fought for the lead between horses at the three sixteenth marker and faded between foes with an eighth to the finish. SUNRISE DRIVE was situated near
the rear in the early stages, raced three wide on the turn making little advancement on the leaders and was a non factor finishing up inside down the lane.
RELIABILITY trailed the field three wide outside foes down the back straight, offered a mild run four deep around horses in the turn, angled out to eight path
for the drive, shifted inwards to the four path and passed tired runners down the lane. TWOWAYCROSSING settled near the rear in the three path in the
beginning, put in a mild rally four wide with three eighths remaining, drifted inwards running in the six path in mid stretch and was not a factor in the late
stages. SILVER PEAK was in a nice position outside watching the front pair through the turn, loomed the threat four wide when the straightened out for the
drive and yielded five wide at the furlong pole. LIL BIT GANGSTA travelled near the rear with runners on either side at the half, was on hold through the turn
running behind and between rivals and could not get in gear through the stretch.

Footnotes
GASTON shifted in heading into the first turn and settled in behind the leaders two to three wide, took closer order on the far turn racing nearer but just off
the rail, came out in upper stretch then continued to drift a bit with aim on the leader, struck the front past the sixteenth and drew clear. WAR COURT was
caught four wide into the first turn, settled and eased back off the second flight, began to advance three to four wide on the far turn, angled five turning into
upper stretch, was forced out a path in the lane and kicked on to get up for place. MALIBU EDGE was intent on the lead and moved clear then shifted in
entering the first turn to dictate terms, faced very brief outside pressure early up the backstretch then once again re-kicked clear, was put to urging turning
for home still well clear, shortened stride and was collared past the sixteenth pole and caught for place late. LIKE THE KING tracked from inside, was
encouraged along by the seven-sixteenths, ran on evenly. BOHEMIAN BOY switched outside the pacesetter into the first turn racing in the two path, moved
forward on that rival three wide to very briefly press coming to the five-and-one-half but was turned away, continued to chase two to three wide, was carried
out in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. DANCIN IN DA'NILE raced off the pace two to three wide, took slightly closer order on the far turn, swung
out seven wide turning for home, ran on evenly. A THREAD OF BLUE settled in the back half of the field, saved ground, was unable to threaten.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was slow to gather bringing up the rear, swung seven to eight wide for the drive, was not a threat. CONCEALED CARRY gained
forward position under some early coaxing racing three wide and between foes into the first turn, dropped back in the stretch and faded. CANADIAN

Footnotes
SCOOT DADDY was off slow inside at the start, was patiently handled on the rail saving all the ground through the turn, had no room to run in upper stretch,
finally got clear space in the three path with a furlong to go, burst through and was edging away at the wire. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was situated in the middle
of the field in the early going, found his best stride seven wide having a clear lane turning for home, was full of run in mid stretch and closed well besting the
rest in the end. BASKETBALL JONES watched the front threesome duel on the lead sitting outside through the turn, was looking for room behind runners at
the top of the stretch five wide, shifted to the inside at the furlong pole and rallied to get up for third. NINETYFOUR EXPOS waited behind the contesting trio
on the rail running through the turn, angled out finding a seam three deep at the three sixteenth pole, drifted outwards at the furlong marker and finished up
only evenly the final sixteenth. ABISKO set the fractions taking the field into the turn, was headed outside by two runners at the three eighths marker,
repelled those early challengers, was collared again in midstretch and weakened the final sixteenth. WAR STRATEGY forced the issue for the lead three
wide on the turn, bid four wide at the top of the lane, was in close quarters between rivals around the eighth pole, was brushed and gave way. MIDWAY
MISCHIEF trailed the field down the backside, continued on the turn seeing the field , angled eight wide for the drive and passed some weary ones in the
stretch. MUSICAL SPELL travelled four wide throughout the turn, posed a threat five deep at the quarter pole, lost path inside the furlong marker, was
steadied and could not recover in time. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was off slow on the break to be near the rear down the backside, trailed at the half,
angled seven wide straightening out for the drive and could not reach contention running to the wire. PALACE VIEW (IRE) applied pressure up front down
the backside, bid between runners in the two path at the three eighths pole, was in tight surroundings in upper stretch, lost path and retreated in the late
stages of the race. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 MUSICAL SPELL ON #3 CAUSIN' MAYHEM IN MID STRETCH RESULTED IN NO
CHANGE,STEWARDS INQUIRY THROUGH THE STRETCH RESULTED IN #2 NINETYFOUR EXPOS BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED EIGHTH

Footnotes
ENJOYTHESILENT switched outside foes up the backstretch, advanced rapidly four then five wide on the turn, took charge outside the three-sixteenths,
quickly spurted clear under urging, was eased up in the final stages. CHASING TROUBLE settled off the pace, raced outside foes four then five wide on the
the turn swinging seven deep into upper stretch, secured the place while no threat to the winner. SO CALLED VACATION moved forward to engage the
leader, dueled inside that one but off the fence, came out a bit in upper stretch after being overtaken, kept on to hold show honors. JIM'S HOPE got away a
step slowly, angled in and steadily advanced inside rivals up the backstretch, was within range on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, faced traffic in
behind runners briefly nearing the sixteenth pole and ran on willingly. GRAND AMBITION stalked from outside with good forward position early, went four
wide on the turn urged and moving quickly to bid at the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort in the stretch. ROCK BULLET settled off the pace racing
just off the rail, moved out four wide past the quarter pole, came out further in upper stretch and ran on. HEMLO GOLD broke in the air and quite slowly,
moved up to regain contact with the field inside, saved ground on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, needed more. STREET SERENADE shifted in racing
near the inside toward the rear just off the rail, ran on. QUIET VISTA failed to threaten racing off the inside part of the track. FOREST STAR was outside
foes toward the back three to four wide on the turn, swung eight deep, failed to rally. BROTHER BELEN got away well, set the early tempo, was soon
engaged by an inside foe, dueled with that one to the three-eighths then steadily retreated and was not persevered with in the stretch.
