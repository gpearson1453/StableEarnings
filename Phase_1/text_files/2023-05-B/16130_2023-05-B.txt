MAKEITORBREAKIT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch, was unable to match strides with the winner entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. DEBATABLE

JUVEE TOO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, unleashed his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the
rail in the drive to get up in time. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, began to advance midway to the final turn, angled three wide to commence his bid entering the final turn, was bumped by
KNOPFLER entering the lane, and closed willingly three wide in deep stretch to just miss. KNOPFLER away well and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, held a narrow advantage into the final turn, drifted out
bumping with FOOT SOLDIER entering the lane, and battled determinedly from between rivals to the wire to just miss. CALAMAZEUS away alertly and
dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the late
stages. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER chased the leaders into the first turn while racing two wide, before easing off the leaders to gain a tracking trip, held a
striking position in the run to the final turn, but had little to offer over the final furlong. CERTIFIABLE stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, struggled to keep up in the run to the final turn while dropping back to trail, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

SOARINGFORTHESUN away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid three wide
entering the final turn, collared the leaders entering the lane, and prevailed over CASCADE BILLY following a stretch long battle. CASCADE BILLY pressed
the pacesetter two wide entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of BOLD ARCH in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, was collared by SAILINGFORTHESUN entering the lane, and battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to just miss. BOITANO unhurried
early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn and closed determinedly three wide in
the drive to get up for a share in a game effort. SLEW'S BAK away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. BOLD ARCH broke
sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the
final turn, but faded in the stretch drive.

MORETHANSOULTITLE stalked the leaders into the first turn while splitting rivals, chased the leader two out from the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, assumed command in mid stretch and held off a late charge from RING OF KERRY to prevail. RING OF
KERRY lagged well back early while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and split rivals in
deep stretch while finishing with a rush to just miss. AVE'S IN COMMAND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
sprinted to a clear advantage in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was collared in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final strides in
a game effort. RACING RIVER stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through
the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. QUAGMIRE away alertly and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide through
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing three wide in the lane. MCMURPHY settled off the early pace while saving ground at
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in an even effort. APPELLANT unhurried
early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid. YOU DON'T OWN
ME hopped at the start to get away poorly, lagged well off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
but failed to menace. SIR BARCLAY away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to maintain his
position in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

KLIMTOGLORY settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance into a striking position in the run to
the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to take command in deep stretch and quickly
pull clear. RIMFIRE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and
closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. Y VEE R away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B
entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, took control entering the lane, but was
outfinished in deep stretch while racing at the rail. COUNTRY COWBOY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. GREYTOGO broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders
into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the stretch drive.
BETTER TONE lagged well back early while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive. WISELY PLAYED lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a
serious late impact while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. SLOOP JOHN B away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of Y VEE R in the run to the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the turn, and tired over the final furlong.
