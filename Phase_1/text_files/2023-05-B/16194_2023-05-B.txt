Footnotes
PHLASH DRIVE was on the pace inside FOR REEL throughout, was headed by CALEB ON THE GO turning for home but dug in and rallied back through
the lane to be up in the closing jumps. CALEB ON THE GO stalked the leaders four wide to bid through the far turn and edge clear into the lane but could
not hold off the winner late. FOR REEL forced the pace outside the winner throughout and weakened nearing the lane. LITTLE BITOTHUNDER settled back
off the pace two wide, moved up four wide but was not a threat. YAYASGOTMOREGAME stalked the pace in reach four to five wide and weakened.
JUDGE'S BRIBE saved ground in reach of the pace and tired in the far turn.

Footnotes
QUALITY BOW stalked the leaders while saving ground early, angled out nearing the far turn to move four wide, bid into the lane and ran down RETRO
RITA through the final sixteenth. RETRO RITA was on the pace three and four wide outside rivals to bid through the far turn and edge clear into the lane
then could not contain the winner late. EVIE saved ground back off the pace, moved up through the far turn but could not threaten the top pair. EXPECT
THE BOSS failed to mount a bid three and four wide. BOUJEE BRITT was on the pace inside rivals and weakened nearing the lane. DISTANT HOLIDAY
was always back. NOBLE PRESENT was not a threat three and four wide. ANGIE'S REVRAC was on the pace between rivals early and weakened going to
the far turn.
