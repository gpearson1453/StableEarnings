Footnotes
MR. EXTENSION stalked close up outside, bid on the turn, dueled briefly, took charge, pulled away under urging, drifted out a bit and was kept to the task.
ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE lost the rider and was briefly loose after the post parade, then set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn, was
no match, dug in and earned the place spot. ENSIGN PARKER raced three wide off the pace, moved up on the turn and rallied mildly outside in the lane.
BOOM BOOM KABOOM raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and closed mildly inside in the lane. TIEMPO PERFECTO raced three wide off
the pace, went three wide at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. THEJIGISUP raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. ONE MORE SCORE
trailed the field, came four wide into the lane and did not factor. BAYOU SHACK broke outward and pulled in the early stages, chased the pace, moved up
on the turn and faded in the stretch.

RUNNING RIVER vied two wide for the lead, cleared off entering the turn, then dueled with SKI COUNTRY passing the quarter pole, responded when
roused and regained the lead from that rival coming to the furlong marker and then drew clear. SKI COUNTRY bobbled at the break, chased three wide,
made a strong three wide bid at the quarter pole, dueled into lane, put a head in front, lost the lead and then dug in gamely outside to the finish. LITTLE
LUCA vied inside for the lead, chased the winner on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and stayed on well through the lane. Z'S SO GOOD chased
between rivals early on, came three wide into the lane, angled in and closed mildly inside. GOLDEN TALENT was bumped at the start, steadied in tight at
the five furlong marker, raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and had no rally. HOT LOVE chased on the inside and faded. COCO SHELL was
bumped at the start, steadied behind a rival at the five eighths marker, continued off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
PROGRAM TRADING (GB) tracked the leaders while well placed on the inside, came two wide into the lane, angled out, responded when asked, quickly
ran past COAST ALONG, kicked away and was in hand late. COAST ALONG stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, led into the stretch, dug in
gamely, was no match for the winner, then held well for second. SACRED RHYME raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied and
finished well for third. AMERICAN DAY was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, then two wide and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. EXTREME
ACCESS raced three wide early, stalked two wide, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. IRISH RILL raced two wide off the pace, chased
on the far turn, altered course at the eighth pole and lacked a rally. CICCIOBELLO steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the
lane and had no rally. PRINCE OF TROY set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and faded. CHANGING THE KARMA was bumped at the start,
raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CHECKITUP raced off the pace with an inside trip and tired.
