Footnotes
JUSTIN'S LEGACY tipped inwards early around the first turn and set a controlled pace inside, was roused early around the far turn, opened up from the
three path into the lane, and was driven out. LYTE CRUDE had to steady between foes midway around the first turn, chased in the three path, was cued
from the four path around the far turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. KING D'ORO steadied along the inside into the first
turn, tracked inside, was under urging around the far turn, tipped out to the four path into the lane, and kept on for show. JEBY was unhurried along the
inside, under coaxing from the rail early around the far turn, shifted out to the five path and was cued left handed into the stretch, but drifted out thru the
stretch while bumping an outer foe, and finished evenly. RIGHT KARMA bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, was under a drive in
the six path entering the stretch, but got herded outward and bumped through the stretch, and could not factor. RIGEL raced up close in the two path, was
driven between foes around the far turn, but faded down the lane. IMMENSE FAITH was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start and bumped with an outer
foe, trailed in the three path early and made no impact. DELVEY had an awkward start, stalked in the four path but backed up early around the far turn.

I'LL FIGURE IT OUT set the pace in the two path, drew off late on the turn and held clear under a drive. ROYAL KITTEN raced off the pace five and six
wide and rallied outside to gain the place. HIGH YIELD KITTEN saved ground off the early pace, angled five wide nearing the three-eighths pole, was no
match for the winner and was outfinished for the place. PIYPA DE LYNDA saved ground and failed to menace. ASSERTIKO stalked the pace four wide and
faded through the lane. VALID EXCHANGE was off slow and outrun inside. JUPITER BLUES prompted the winner in the three path between foes, could not
keep pace nearing the lane and was eased through the final furlong.

NIC'S BRO stalked in the four path, was under coaxing passing the three eighths pole, bid from the five path into the lane, took the lead just before the
eighth pole, and drew clear. LOCO ABARRIO prompted the pace in the three path, bid early into the turn, stuck a head in front before the quarter pole,
floated out to four path into the stretch, and kept on but was overtaken by the outer eventual winner just before the eighth pole to place. SONG RUNNER set
the pace from the two path into the turn, was challenged by an outer foe early around the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter, tipped to rail into the lane,
and evened out for show. BOLDNESS chased in the five path, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, but was one
paced. LORD EDDARD STARK trailed in the four path early and did not threaten from the five path down the lane. STERLING HARMONY tracked inside
but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
VAN DUSEN (GB) dueled two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. MY BOY BLUE bumped with READYSEEKGO at the start,
saved ground off the pace and rallied between rivals to gain the place. READYSEEKGO bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and finished
evenly for the show. STARSHIP WIZARD raced in range three wide and had a mild rally. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE chased the pace from the rail and lacked
the needed rally. D. SILO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ASSERT DOMINANCE dueled inside of the winner and tired in the drive.
GARMENTO trailed inside.

Footnotes
FLY THE W rated in the four path, moved into the contention and shifted to the two path approaching the far turn, was coaxed between foes approaching
the quarter, cut the corner to take the lead from inside at the top of the lane, opened up under left handed encouragement into the final furlong, and held
safe. SOUPER LEGACY tracked in the five path, was cued right handed midway around the far turn, bid approaching the quarter, was outrun but the inner
eventual winner while still in the five path turning into the stretch, and chased that foe home to place. RACE CRAFT trailed in the three path, was coaxed
into the far turn, urged left handed while tipping out to the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. UNCLE ARMANDO stalked in the four path, inherited
the lead while under a ride early around the far turn, but lost the lead while in the two path turning into the lane, and faded. THE BEST DISTANCE set the
pace in the three path, was roused while shifting inside into the far turn, but yielded around that turn. MOMZA raced off the pace in the three path but made
no impact from the six path down the lane. BRYCE CANYON chased along the rail into the backstretch but was done early.

BLUEFIELD bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path, ranged up around the turn, took aim from the six path at the top of the stretch,
rallied down the center, was up nearing the final sixteenth, and drew clear. POIEMA brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace inside, took
the lead from the rail rounding the turn, stayed on under right handed cues from the two path in upper stretch, but was caught by the winner just past the
eighth pole to place. R ADIOS JERSEY set the pace in the two path, lost the lead to an inner rival midway around the turn, and flattened from the three path
down the lane for show. BATTLE CRY brushed with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path, was cued early around the turn, shifted out to the four
path into the stretch, but was no factor. STARSHIP NALA bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the six path but made no impact.
RESTOFTHESTORY stalked in the three path but faded turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
GREEK MOJO tracked in the five path, ranged up in the four path and bid around the turn, took the lead approaching the quarter and opened slightly while
wandering between the two to four paths into the final furlong, but was straightened out and held sway. NOVELLIE stalked inside, waited along the rail early
around the turn, tipped out to the four path while under coaxing into the lane, and ran on for place. AREUOKWITHTHIS got loose on the way to the gate but
was quickly caught by the outrider, set the pace in the two path, was cued into the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter, and evened out from inside down
the stretch for show. SUBTLE FAITH travelled off the pace in the five path, was driven between foes in the six path entering the stretch, but was one paced.
SHARP PIPPA rated in the three path, received right handed cues while shifting outward early around the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, but
was no factor. LOVELY DRAMA prompted the leading duo in the four path but faded into the stretch. TAYYARA was unprepared, dwelt, and broke outward
at the start, raced wellback in the six path but made no impact. MAGICK MINSTREL pressed in the three path but gaveway around the turn. FONE YOUR
MOM had a slow start and trailed throughout around the eight path.
