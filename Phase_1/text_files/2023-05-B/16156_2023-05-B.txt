Footnotes
TOSS OF FATE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, bid in late turn to gain a short lead, lost the lead to the rallying runner-up outside the eighth pole
then battled back to edged up late. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, bid through the four path in late turn, came into the lane under
a drive to gain the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe. UPHOLD raced three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk the
pace while in the three path, bid three wide into the far turn, continued as a contender into the lane then weakened while finishing far in front of the others.
LITTLE KANSAS was never a factor while near the back into the far turn then lacked a response. MACHO ALEGRE set the pace along the inside into the
far turn then gave way.

into the lane, was in the three path once straightened in the lane and needed more. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET was near the rail through the turn and into the
lane, looked for running room inside the eighth pole from the two or three path, moved to the inside late and finished with energy. STAR OF KODIAK was
near the rail through the turn while trailing the field, came off the rail for the drive and was gaining momentum late. MERLIN'S SONG was in the four path
and three wide through the turn, swung into the lane from the six path and five wide and lacked a closing response. CASANOVA KITTEN raced in the five
path and four wide through the turn when being asked for more, came into the lane from the seven path and six wide then lacked a bid. LOOKIN FOR LOKI

EXPRESS LADY vied between foes early, dueled outside of a rival from the turn, brushed with that one at the eighth pole and lasted under steady urging.
STARLET EXPRESS vied inside, dueled inside of the winner from the turn, was brushed by that one at the eighth pole, then was outfinished. BREAKUP
WITH TITOS vied four wide early, then couldn't stay with the leaders. LOVE DRUNK saved ground, then rallied belatedly. HOOSIER PREMIUM vied in the
three path, then gave way on the turn. AMAZINGNESS was not a factor. The rider of Starlet Express lodge an objection against the winner for interference
in the stretch, but it was disallowed by the Stewards.

Footnotes
MAGIC BEAUTY set the pace on a clear lead at once, continued on a long lead into the far turn, was still well clear into the lane then was kept to the task to
hold the diminishing advantage. RED ROULETTE was unhurried while in the three path down the backstretch, began gaining momentum through the far
turn, swung into the lane from the six path with energy and rallied to the wire while clearly second best. MISS BRIGHTSIDE was unhurried while in
mid-pack, gained momentum into the lane and was gaining to the end from the four path. MY JO JO saved ground through the turn and into the lane and
gained along the rail. CORTADO chased the pace along the inside through the far turn and weakened after turning into the lane. MIDNIGHT MEGHAN
chased the pace from the four path through the far turn and lacked a closing response. BLUE BLUE BAYOU saved ground into the far turn and was never a
threat while improving position. LIL BIT OF CAPITOL never a factor while in the two or three path. CLOVERTOWNE chased the pace from the three path
and faded through the lane. COURTING WAR was in the three path through the turns and was empty through the lane.

CAUMSETT vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared after straightening down the backstretch, widened through the turn and into the lane, was on her
widest advantage coming into the lane then was ridden out through the final eighth while never threatened. LUMINIST was unhurried while off the inside,
moved four wide through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and rallied for the place spot while not a threat to the top one and had to be
caught by the outrider after the race while running off down the backstretch. LIVY B was unhurried while off the inside, advanced through the five path on
the far turn, swung into the lane from the six path and showed good energy too late. FREDERICIA chased the pace from the three path through the far turn
and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. LIGEIA was off the rail into the far turn, was asked for more while three wide through mid-turn, moved closest to
the winner straightening in the lane then hung. FRACING HOT trailed along the inside into the turn, continued along the inside into the lane and improved
position while not a threat. CINDERELLA STORY was bumped at the start and forced inward, taken to the rail to chase from mid-pack and was never a
menace while saving ground. LOOKIN ROYAL vied for the early lead along the inside through the first turn, chased the winner into the turn then faded. RE
ANTE chased the pace from the three path into the turn and was done nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GRANATO stalked the pace in the four path, rallied late and was in time under mild urging. MORE THAN A DIVA stalked the pace in the two path and bid
late four wide and missed. WICKED FROST dueled outside of a rival and was outfinished. LA CREMA dueled inside and then faded late. CORNER KICK
stalked the pace inside, bid in early stretch and then faltered. MURAL stalked the pace in the three path, then had no bid. NO NO NO NEVER (IRE) was
impeded at the start and improved position late. VIDEO PRINCESS stalked the pace in the three path, then gave way in the turn. POINT WELL TAKEN was
not a factor. BLOSSOM DIVA faded. AWESOME VALOR stalked the pace in the four path before fading. LADY EVELYN CAN was not a factor.
