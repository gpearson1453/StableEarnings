Footnotes
RED RAIDER XPRESS was off a step slow but was given time to find his stride, started to gain ground at the seven sixteenth pole, angled out five wide to
find clear racing room, circled the field through the turn, was five wide in the stretch and had clear racing room, was put to task and driven after the quarter
pole, was encouraged and driven and closed with a vengeance, which paid off with the honors of the win. UNAFFILIATED hopped at the start, settled in
along the fence and started to slowly gain ground and momentum, improved position by the three eighths pole, saved ground and passed up the rail, closed
at the sixteenth pole and was up in time for second. OLD TOBY vied for the early lead, ended up matching strides with another rival while setting the pace,
gave way in mid stretch. LAKE HAMILTON raced along the rail while stalking the pace early, was given the cue and angled out at the three eighths pole,
gained ground and was in contention in the stretch but had no late kick. OCEAN KISS vied for the early lead, matched strides with an inside rival as this set
managed the pace, was in contention in the stretch but tired in the lane. RAY'S BIG BOY showed little early on and was pulled up in the stretch. RAY'S BIG
BOY WAS VANNED OFF.

started to improve position, edged out four wide at the five sixteenth, challenged for the lead at the quarter pole battled for the win through the entire stretch
with a foe on the inside and a late closing threat on the outside, continued to drive and raced determinedly and got up for the win. game effort. NATE'S
ATTACK raced mid pack in the four path on a loose rein, fanned out six wide at the quarter pole, challenged for the lead and battled with another rival
through the stretch but just missed. GIMME SOME MO inherited the lead and set the pace while saving ground following the rail, was challenged at the five
sixteenth pole, battled into the stretch and gave way late. JOEBOY was no menace. GOBLER was never involved.

Footnotes
REALITOS took advantage of the one post position and took the lead while staying on the fence, was stalked by on outside rival for the first have of the
race, was threatened by this rival for the lead at the five sixteenth pole, responded well to the challenge and battled back while not giving up any ground, the
set drew away from the rest of the field as they battled for the win, REALITOS was kept to task and kept trying and was able to take the win. FUHR MEO
stalked the pace setter from the three path, launched a bid and challenged for the lead at the five sixteenth pole, matched strides and battled for the lead,
drew away from the rest of the field, but could not get past REALITOS and had to settle for the place honors. TRINITY HOPE was racing mid pack in the
four path, was cued at the three eighths, gained some ground but did not have enough today to threaten the set that was in front of him. STAR'S DREAM
raced along the rail and was able to save ground, launched a mild bid but to no avail. I DONT KNOW EITHER was off a step slow, tucked in behind horses
and saved ground early, patiently rated behind horses until the have mile marker, edged out into the five path and launched a bid, was encouraged, driven,
after the quarter pole, drifted out in the lane and faded. ZEEROCK raced 3w and was never involved. GIFTED TALENT raced two wide and trailed through
out.

STARPORT was always in control, was able to have everything to his liking and drew away in the stretch as he was much the best today. EGOR OTAY
stalked the early leader, then resorted to chasing the eventual winner through out but was second best today. DRAG MALIBU raced off the pace along the
rail, slightly improved position, but was never a threat. NOW NOW SAINT had and awkward start and never got involved. FIGHTING SOLDIER showed
little.

Footnotes
G'WILDCAT took control of the race early, raced confidently along the rail through out, was challenged by an outside rival briefly at the five sixteenth pole,
raced on to the quarter pole where G'WILDCAT re took control, shook this challenging rival and drew off handily to scored an easy win. ALTERANA raced
mid pack early, launched a bid at the half mile pole, was encouraged at the three eighths pole, closed well and was able to get up for second. ADIOS
CARLOS raced mid pack, maintained position through out and slightly improved late. BISPING vied for the early lead, smartly settled off the pace and
stalked the early leaders, saved ground by racing along the rail through out, was well placed but had no late kick. SLITHER made no impact. FIERY
PLAYBOY flashed early speed, while racing seven wide and folded up. FLASHY PREMO was off slow and was never involved after that.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOA KID took advantage of the one post position as he raced up the rail and took the lead, was able to race at a pace that suited him,
comfortably saved ground and drew off in the stretch proving to be much the best today. I DON'T VENMO tracked the early leaders while being rated in
hands, launched a bid in the upper stretch, responded by closing with a turn of foot and was up fo second. STIFF DRINK was off a touch slow, was allowed
to settle in hands along the rail, launched a bid after the quarter pole and closed gamely. PAPIRINGO vied for the lead, had to settle off the pace and stalk,
stalked the eventual winner into the stretch then faded. BIG BOO raced mid pack, maintained the same position through out. GO BROTHER GO raced wide
through out and was never at threat. THEO D'OR showed little. CATCHIN DRAMA was no menace. CROSSING IRIS made no impact.

Footnotes
MINT stalked the early leader briefly, challenged for the lead at the seven sixteenth pole, battled for a few strides, led by the five sixteenth pole and
separated himself from the rest of the field by eleven lengths and proved the best today. COASTAL CHAOS showed brief speed while racing from the three
path, was collared at seven sixteenth pole, was chasing the eventual winner by the five sixteenth pole, raced on and proved to be second best today.
EXCLAIM raced off of the pace and launched a mild bid but to no avail. SUPER GEEK no menace. PLENTY OF CENTS was never a threat. ALLIGATOR
CRAWL stalked, the early leader, was shuffled back and faltered.
