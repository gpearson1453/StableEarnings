Footnotes
MONGOLIAN BOX pressed pace two wide heading into the turn, continued pressing pace on the turn, headed rival into the lane, dug in under urging to
edge away in the final sixteenth. HOLYJAZZ hard sent to the lead on the backstretch, cleared heading into the lane, continued to hold the rail on the turn
and headed in upper stretch, battled gamely and faltered in the final one hundred in a game effort. RING GENERAL stalked pace along the inside on the
backstretch, continued ground saving trip through the turn, kept to task in the lane while unable to reel in the leaders. LAMPY off a length slow, kept under a
hold early to avoid running up on heels, settled off the pace and off the rail, continued off the rail on the turn, roused into the lane, and mildly rallied in
between rivals to the wire. HELICOPTER PILOT sent to contest pace, had to settle into a chasing position on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the
turn, launched bid widest in the lane and outfinished. SHARP WARNING tracked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the
turn, a bit in tight coming into the lane and flattened when having a clear path.
