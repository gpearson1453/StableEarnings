Footnotes
DUNCAN IDAHO stalked the early pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and took over in the three path past the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the
turn and was kept alert through the lane. HARLEY SIOUX chased inside, angled outward toward the top of the lane, lugged in through the stretch and was
outfinished later yards. ALL ROADS TO DENIS broke a step slow then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the three path and came along for third
in later yards. WINDSOR'S STAR chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. BIG BAD BRASS chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. B. J. MOOSE set a pressured pace inside, was met at the rail past the quarter pole,
dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. MYLASHURRAH saved ground.

Footnotes
MUCHACHO MACHO raced with the early pace two deep, took the nod into the backstretch and kept the edge over Mi Gusto Es from that point, drew clear
approaching the five sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the far turn and held well with steady handling. UNCAPTURED KING rounded the first
turn in the four path, bid past the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and settled for second. ELVIRUS was bumped at the break then saved
ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. MI GUSTO ES came away
awkwardly and made contact with Elvirus, rated a slim lead inside but was met into the backstretch, gave chase from that point, dropped back toward the
five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SPRING THE BEAST stalked the early pace from the three path but showed
little response through the backstretch. INDIANA RED raced in the five path the first turn and never factored. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR raced well off the
pace and never factored. MONGOLIAN HERO saved ground.
