Footnotes
SUPERCOOL pressed two wide and between horses, vied with the pace setter in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and
edged away in the final furlong. CHARLIE WHISKEY bumped an inner rival leaving the gates, set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, fought on after being
headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, but yielded grudgingly in the late stages before holding place. HAIL ALLEN hopped slightly
before taking contact from an outer rival at the start, tracked four wide, moved forward to prompt the top pair into the turn, but failed to keep pace with them
entering the lane, yet ran on through the final furlong to come up short to reach place. MR. COMMANDER chased along the inside and pursued evenly
along the rail through the final furlong. TEXAS TED broke outwardly, trailed along the inside, and moved up. CHOWMEIN made little impact from the four
path. VELOCIMO pressed three wide, but weakened between horses nearing the three furlong pole.

path and outside of rivals, then ran on to gain place leaving the sixteenth pole. COMEDY ACT set a clear pace into the turn, was confronted by the eventual
winner in upper stretch, and gave way to that one through the final furlong. TRANSPARENCY tracked along the inside and faded at the three furlong pole.

RIDER'S SPECIAL tracked in the three path, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead under a right handed crop
entering the final furlong, yet sustained his grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth pole before edging ahead. INSOLITO set the pace in the five path while
outside of a vying foe down the backstretch, tucked to the two path entering the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, held sway through midstretch as an outer
RIDER'S SPECIAL pursued, but met that foe's challenge at the sixteenth pole and was bested. AMERICAN ICON trailed along the inside and moved up
between a pair of rivals in the final furlong. HOCUS rushed forward after being last away, vied inside of a rival to the turn, but failed to keep pace with that
one in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. IGNITIS chased along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, but tired.

MIDWAY MIRACLE tracked in the four path, gained place turning for home, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, closed in entering midstretch,
offered a bid in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. KING OF KENTUCKY broke sharp, showed the way with a clear margin around the turn
and through midstretch, but was worn down by an outer bidder in the closing stages. SCOTCH NO ROCKS stalked in the three path and between horses,
gave way to the top pair nearing the lane, yet held show from inner rivals through the final furlong. GARY'S FLYING LION saved ground off of the pace,
then gained fourth from an outer rival late. COUSIN ODELL stalked inside of rivals while a path off of the rail but faded. LEFT POCKET MONEY never got
involved from the three path. FULL TIME JOB trailed in the four path and showed little.

Footnotes
INFILTRATOR tracked behind the leaders and from the two path, shifted out turning for home to take aim on the new leader from the four path entering the
lane, ranged up to that one at the furlong grounds, drove past him at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. VALE broke inwardly at the start, prompted the
pace three wide, bid in hand turning for home, drew clear entering the lane, but met an outer challenge in midstretch, then failed to keep pace with that one
in the final sixteenth and proved second best. SWITZER broke a step slow before being herded inwardly by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three
path, split foes in the four path in upper stretch, and ran on to gain show entering the final sixteenth. BABY QUINN set the pace inside of a vying rival, but
was headed by another outer bidder nearing the lane and gave way entering it. LOUISIANIMAL lacked speed in the four path, but yielded after getting
floated to the five path nearing the lane. TOWN BRANCH vied for the lead two wide, then between horses around the turn, but weakened nearing the
quarter pole.

Footnotes
HENRIETTA TOPHAM settled off of the pace two wide, swung to the six path entering the lane, rallied to bid along with inner rivals at the sixteenth pole,
and forged an advantage in the shadow of the wire. FAST AS FLIGHT broke a step slow, recovered to stalk outside of the leader into the first turn, offered a
bid around the far turn, drew clear in the three path in upper stretch, but met challenges from rivals on either side entering the final sixteenth, and was
surpassed by an outer bidder approaching the wire before holding place. JUSTIFY MY LOVE (BRZ) pursued from midpack two wide and between horses,
tipped to the four path straightening for home, offered a grinding charge to bid along with inner and outer rivals at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked and
denied place. ARM CANDY saved ground off of the pace, spun into the lane in the three path, rallied between horses to produce a bid inside of the leader at
the sixteenth pole, but flattened out while getting outkicked by outer rivals, and missed show. CANDY LIGHT hopped and brushed the outer part of the gate
at the start, trailed along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and made little impact. VALENTINA DAY
pursued three wide, floated to the five path entering the lane, and lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. WAVE OF GOODNESS set the pace along the
inside, but was headed by an outer bidder nearing the lane, and faded in midstretch. INTRIGUE tracked along the inside, spun into the lane in the two path,
but was outkicked by an outer rival nearing midstretch and faded.

BRITERDAYZAHEAD took a bump from an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led in hand in the four path entering
the lane, and drew off entering midstretch. WILD THINKER set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one around the turn, got headed entering
the lane, yielded at the furlong grounds, yet saved place from an outer rival late. LUDWIG chased the top pair from the three path while inside of another
rival, spun into the lane in the five path, and sustained stride in pursuit of the top pair to miss reaching place late. TOP SECRET broke half a step slow, laid
off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the four path in midstretch, and stayed on to gain a minor share. SMOKE WAGON pursued from midpack
along the inside, took a bump from an outer rival in upper stretch, then failed to menace. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN broke outwardly, tracked four wide,
floated to the six path entering the lane, but gave way while drifting inwardly in upper stretch. HOLY MOLY ABRAHAM chased in midpack in the five path
around the turn, drifted inwardly entering the lane before bumping an inner rival in upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. CUORE SACRO

along the inside, and failed to factor. SON OF A GRAY broke slowly and was outrun in the three path. BOLT ACTION broke slowly but avoided contact from
an inner rival in the process, laid off of the pace two wide, but lugged in greenly while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, and weakened through the

Footnotes
SAUDI CROWN bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, held an advantage from that one through
midstretch, and inched away in the final sixteenth. SWEET CHERRY PIE pressed two wide, vied around the turn, but hung on his left lead while subtly
failing to sustain even terms in upper stretch, and yielded to his inner counterpart in the closing stages. ANGKOR tracked four wide, then three wide into the
turn, and chased the top pair home well to prove best of the rest. GREENER PASTURES bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path,
advanced inside of rivals in upper stretch before shifting to the five path at the furlong grounds, and ran on. PAGE ONE chased along the inside and tired
through the final furlong. BLUE LIGHT took contact from rivals on either side at the start, chased three wide and between horses, but faded once put to a bit
of tight quarters entering the lane. APPEAL DENIED tracked two wide and between horses, but gave way leaving the three furlong pole. CHARTER OAK
trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
TAKING CANDY broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, rallied in the four path coming to midstretch, offered a bid inside of the leader inside the final
furlong, struck the front with a sixteenth to go, and drew clear. ST. NEOTS tracked in midpack three wide, moved forward four wide approaching the far turn,
bid outside of the top pair turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. CAROOM
pursued from midpack along the inside, steadied behind foes turning for home, tipped out to the four path while launching a rally in upper stretch, sparred
with an inner rival for show through the final sixteenth, and prevailed. HARRY HOOD stalked along the inside, searched for racing room behind foes in
upper stretch, got outkicked while tipping three wide at the furlong grounds, battled for show with an inner rival through the late stages, but missed. NOW
THAT ICAN ROCK set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by a different bidder in upper stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. ROENICK
lacked speed three wide, gained in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. ATHENS MOON vied two wide, but was headed by
an outer rival in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. HIGHEST RATED (IRE) saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. BIG ELM
was outrun along the inside. CRUSADER CONRAD tracked two wide and between horses, but retreated down the backstretch, altered course to the five
path at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. ILLEGAL trailed in the two path, but shied from an inner rival and to the six path at the five sixteenths pole
before making little impact. FIGHTERTOWN stalked three wide, but weakened between horses around the far turn.
