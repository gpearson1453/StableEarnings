Footnotes
BAD BOY GEIST moved to the lead at once, remained clear through the turn, widened into the lane and was under minimal encouragement while extending
to the wire. LOONY chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, came off the inside and into the lane then was all out late to save the place spot.
MONUMENTALJUSTICE was off awkwardly while stepping out and brushing, was asked for more in mid-turn, came into the lane from the five path and was
closing in on the place rival to just miss that spot. AMELIA'S MACHO chased the winner through the turn from the three path and was empty turning into the
lane. REVS MEDAL never a factor while in the three path. IMPLODING raced in the three of four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path
and tired. TEQUILA SILVER trailed throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
GIO'S BABY GIRL raced in the three path through the turn when moving up, continued with good momentum into the lane while three wide, caught the
leader inside the eighth pole then edged clear. RAPUNZELS SONG stalked the pacesetter from the three path through the turn, was asked for more into the
lane, between rivals outside the eighth pole with aim on the lead then could not go with the winner while staying on for the place spot. ALWAYS BLOSSOM
set the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, was under pressure with an eighth to go then yielded to the winner and lost the place spot
soon after. DARNELL raced in the three or four path through the turn and into the lane then moved up while never a threat. TEAKETTLE was three wide into
the turn, continued in the three path through the turn, moved closer to the inside for the drive and weakened. SHAKIN IT UP BABY in the four to the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and tired. ARRINGTON never a factor while well back into the lane. COLOR ME FAST was in
tight at the start, hustled up to chase the pace into the turn while near the inside, dropped back through late turn and was empty after straightening in the
lane.

Footnotes
EL ROSILLO led early between foes, then dueled inside of a rival, bid in early stretch, turned back a challenge from BIG BOSS BEN by surging late and
prevailing under mild urging. BIG BOSS BEN stalked the early pace, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't get to the winner. WHITE PIGEON was off
awkwardly, then closed outside. YOLO SANTIAGO was off awkwardly, stalked the pace between rivals, bid in early stretch along the rail and then faltered.
WHERE'S MOE saved ground before fading. SHIPSHAPE was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROYAL VICKY was off to an alert start to clear at once, raced on a clear lead into the backstretch, rated down the backstretch when under pressure,
widened through late turn and into the lane and was kept to the task until late. CHANNEL Z saved ground through the turns when never far back, gained
momentum into the lane, split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining to the end to be well clear of the next rival. HEZMORETHANREADY raced
along the inside through the turns and into the lane, had aim on the leader but lacked a closing response. FACE VALUE chased the pace from the three
path into the lane, was in the four or five path once straightened in the lane then weakened. BOOSTER SHOT was four wide through the turns when close
up, bid into the lane from the six path and weakened. SAILOR'S CHANCE trailed the field while in the two path through the far turn, angled into the six path
for the drive and moved up while gaining mildly. TRICOLOUR never a threat while in the two path through the turns. COSMIC STARDUST bid four wide
through the far turn then flattened after straightening in the lane. CONRAD THE RED never a factor while in the four path through the far turn. BAYOU
CHROME pressed the pace two wide into the far turn and was done on the far turn. DRAMA CRITIC was checked into the first turn when in tight and
running up on rivals, continued in the three path into the far turn, was checked between rivals entering the far turn and dropped back.
