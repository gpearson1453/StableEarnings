Footnotes
STAR ATTITUDE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tipped three wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong outside the top pair and was just up in the final jumps to the wire. MOVING
PICTURES broke open the stall door prior to the start inspired when RAW COURAGE broke through the gate next door, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive inside the leader through the final furlong and just missed at the end getting up for the place honors in the last jumps. DADS GOOD RUNNER traded a
bump at the start with BAD WATER, showed the way three paths off the inside in hand, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat from flanking rivals and was nailed by both in the final strides to the finish. REUNION TOUR four
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along from the half mile pole, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly with a mild bid through to the
finish. BAD WATER traded a bump at the start with DADS GOOD RUNNER, came under hustling and chased just off the inside, floated briefly three wide
directly in front of MOVING PICTURES and was corrected at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. LARZ broke open the
stall door just after RAW COURAGE broke through the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide at the head of
the stretch and weakened. RAW COURAGE grew fractious and broke through the gate prior to the start, inspiring LARZ and MOVING PICTURES to open
their stall doors in small protest, while the assistant starter kept a firm and strong hold to not allow an escape, got examined and reloaded and chased seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA STEWARD.

EYE WITNESS was eased back off the pace then rated comfortably, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, gained to take the lead into the
stretch, responded well while clear into the final furlong and was all out to hold off the runner-up and prevail. INFLATION NATION (IRE) was coaxed early
then settled off the pace, moved closer leaving the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while well clear for the place. VACATION DANCE hit the inside of
the gate then brushed with a foe, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased the winner outside into
the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. HEY EUGENE dropped back on the outside then moved in while settling towards the rear, saved
ground while asked on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. JOEY
FRESHWATER settled on the far outside without cover, was roused four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SON OF A
BIRCH pressed the pace loosely between foes, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CHARGING went to the front,
showed the way under some pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner into the
stretch and faded. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside of two foes, was given his cue in the three path
on the turn, dropped back in crowded quarters into the stretch and stopped then was eased but walked off.

GOLDINI three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, issued a challenge nearing the eighth pole and
had LANDBISCUIT come out just outside that station and was bumped solidly, seized command just at that juncture and edged away under a drive to
prevail. LANDBISCUIT coaxed from the gate, dueled four then three wide with CHOWDA to his inside, took over sole command inside nine-sixteenths to
run, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and spun three wide into upper stretch under growing threat to the outside, dug in coming out near the eighth
pole and bumped GOLDINI solidly as that rival went on by, ran on to chase him home well clear of the rest and along second best. HEALING five then four
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and tired. CHOWDA broke out at the start and was corrected
coming under coaxing to duel three then two wide with LANDBISCUIT to his outside, yielded the front just inside nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CURLINS CHOIR tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid near the quarter-pole then came five wide, took
the lead inside the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. VAX brushed with a rival
just after the start, showed the way under pressure to her inside, vied in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner inside the three-sixteenths, battled with that foe into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. AMANDA'S FOLLY chased the
early pace, dropped back near the five-eighths, traveled around the turn in the three path, was driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the
drive and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. HARLAN'S BOND bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, came under
stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SICILIAN GRANDMA was urged
along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LUNA LOCA bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the
pace on the inside of the leader, vied along the rail on the turn and tired. BELMAR SUMMER settled at the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SILIPO showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
gamely repelled the challenge to shake away in the late stages never relenting command. LITTLE DEMON coaxed from the gate, chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing to issue a challenge five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in latched on through the stretch but
was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. WINTER POOL chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch,
kept on to secure the show honors over a rival on the wire. COOL QUARTET broke out at the start brushing SAILOR SPEED, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. JUMPSTER six paths off the inside in aim of the
front down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn and steadily backed away under coaxing from the three-eighths, went nine wide into upper
stretch and tired. SAILOR SPEED got taken in hand when brushed ta the start by COOL QUARTET, chased five to six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

Footnotes
I'M NERVOUS NOW settled on the far outside, issued a challenge in the four path on the turn, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch, kicked clear
into the final furlong and powered away under steady urging to prove much the best. MOSTLY HARMLESS established a forward position early, jostled with
a foe near the five-eighths then was taken in hand, stalked the leader on the outside from that point, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the
three path on the turn, took a brief and narrow advantage at the quarter-pole, was headed by the winner in the four path into upper stretch, angled out after
losing touch with that foe inside the furlong marker and proved no match but safely secured the place. BLAME IT ON PARIS settled off the pace, was
roused three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the show while no match for the top two. DEVILLY settled
towards the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response then just
missed the show. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND went to the front, showed the way while off the inside, went around the turn in the two path, lost the lead at the
quarter-pole and gave way. EVER GRACEFUL settled just off the pace, dropped back under urging while inside on the turn and came up empty. QUICK
POWER NAP settled just off the pace, jostled with a foe near the five-eighths then was taken in hand nearing the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide
while asked on the turn and capitulated. PREDETERMINED was last to commence, raced on the outside at the rear under urging, traveled around the turn
in the five path, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BEGUINE went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, shook clear at the five-sixteenths pole,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off while given two pops of a right-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker, widened while
kept to the task to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. ROYAL POPPY bumped twice with an opponent at the start, was well placed
early then dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and was along
for the place. CHASING CARA was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, dropped from the four path to the two path
early on the turn, reached the rail around the three-eighths pole, pursued the winner into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. AMARETTI
broke in at the start, pressed the pace between foes then on the outside, vied four then five wide on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend
and tired. AWILLAWAY bumped twice with a foe at the start while last away, was urged at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
SECRET RULES chased the leader down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, was roused for more when joined on the inside by the
runner-up outside the five-sixteenths then made a bid, dueled outside of that foe in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. H P MOON broke a step
slow, settled well off the pace, angled in inside the three-quarter pole, made a strong rail rally on the turn, closed well to make a bid at the five-sixteenths,
dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and missed in a good effort while clear for the place. KING ANGELO was hustled from the gate then urged along
off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths, dropped from five to four wide early on the turn, moved to the three path late on that bend and lacked the
needed response while clear for the show. ROYAL TRYST dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.
SAINT SELBY went to the front, showed the way while well out in the track, rounded the turn in the five path, was headed by a duo at the five-sixteenths
and tired. SCOCCIATORE settled on the outside, moved in a bit near the five-eighths, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to respond. LOBSTA
was urged along off the pace, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, spun four

Footnotes
MISTICAL CURLIN hustled from the gate, showed the way six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came
under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and began to widen away from the field, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, forged clear under a drive
kept to task until the final strides to the wire. MAJESTIC MICHAEL seven paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked three
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on safe
for the place honors. OCASEK coaxed from the start, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. EXUDE chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. FIRST MONEY coaxed from the gate, chased
four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under a prolonged drive from the half mile pole, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. RIDE UP began on an awkward first step, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five
wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung six wide at the top of the stretch and tired.
