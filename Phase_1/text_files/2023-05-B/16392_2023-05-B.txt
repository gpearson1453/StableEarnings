Footnotes
HESA PROSPECTOR moved up inside, assumed command into the turn, drew off into the stretch and widened under mild urging. ZENFULLY ZESTY
stalked the pace, closed steadily and got up for place while no match for the winner. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO set the early pace, responded when
challenged to duel for the lead, swung wide entering the stretch, fell back and finished evenly. ZESTY JAZZMAN got away well, raced in the second flight
towards the outside, dropped back early and lacked a rally. JUVAL was void of early speed, advanced inside on the turn, had nothing left and lacked a bid.
HOT CHARLIE stalked the pace to the turn and gave way. FARMER FRED R F was not a factor. QUIEN ES fell, lost the rider and was vanned off. The
stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
ABSTRACT KAT raced close to the pace towards the outside, challenged three across into the turn, inched clear and held safely under urging. RYDERS UP
was a bit crowded at the start, pressed the pace, fell back, went five wide leaving the turn, lacked the needed rally and finished second best. LAUGHING
STORM challenged along the inside entering the turn, fell back into the stretch, weakened and settled for show. TRICKING TRIXIE showed good early
speed, dropped back, went widest in the drive and closed well. CANDY RASCAL broke out, vied to the turn, dropped back and faded. CHIPPSTER stalked
the pace along the inside, lacked a stretch response and was not a threat.

YOU'RE MY BOY KAT set a pressured pace to late stretch and drew clear. TARDY CAT pressed the pace while racing in hand, challenged along the inside
on the turn, vied for the lead, was no match late and finished second best. BOOM BOOM DADDY was unhurried early, offered a mild bid only and was
along for show while no threat to the top two. TOMMY'S UP vied to the turn, swung wide, fell back and had no further response. REALLY A STORM stalked
the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. ROLL TO RICHES reared at the start to be away slowly and was outrun in an even effort.
HUNDREDOLLAROIL raced outside, showed speed to the turn and gave way. HOLLYWOOD DAX saved ground and was not a factor.

BESITOS CRIMINALES vied around the first turn, drew away on the backstretch for a clear lead, bore out leaving the turn, dropped back, came again and
drew clear late. DADDY WHAT IF was rated early, advanced to the second turn, bid inside, assumed command, was outclosed and finished second best.
HALF COURT SAM was never far back, offered a mild bid only and was along for show. ELLIOT was unhurried early, raced in the back and passed tiring
rivals. RIG RIDER vied inside around the first turn, dropped back to stalk to the second turn, tired and gave way. ROAD TO HEAT raced mid pack, showed
speed to the second turn and gave way.
