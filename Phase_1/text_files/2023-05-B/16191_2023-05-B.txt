Footnotes
GEORGE'S HONEY prompted the pace two wide and between horses, forged an advantage at the furlong pole and drove clear. UNMATCHED tracked in
the three to four path around the turn, lacked progress while hanging on her left lead through midstretch, yet ran on late as ahead foes tired and gained
place in the final sixteenth. DEBOISBLANC broke slowly, gained outside of rivals to press three wide entering the turn, bid turning for home, but was turned
away in upper stretch, kept on to re-bid for place in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer rival soon after. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS broke inwardly
towards open space, set the pace as a pair of outer rivals applied stern pressure, clung to a margin through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong
pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. HONOR CAT tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, chased behind the leaders through upper stretch,
then stayed on three wide late, but failed to threaten. AIM HIGHER broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four path, and failed to factor on her left lead.
GREEN CHILE broke slowly and was outrun in the five path.

Footnotes
DAZZLING BLUE hopped while off slow, tugged forward to reach the fore approaching the five furlong pole, set the pace well in hand in the two path around
the turn, drew off under moderate hand urging in upper stretch, and was put to wraps in the late stages. SUNDAY SHOES tracked four wide, ranged up to
the leader under rousing around the turn, but quickly proved no match for that one in upper stretch, and fended off an inner place-bidding foe through the
final sixteenth. PROMISE OF HOPE trailed along the inside, vacated the rail to surpass a tiring rival turning for home, tipped back to the fence in upper
stretch, then rallied along it to bid for place in the final sixteenth, but was denied reaching that position. B G WARRIOR chased in the three path and
between horses, but gave way. HOLIDAY DECISION chased outside of the leader while inside of other rivals into the turn, but weakened at the three
furlong pole.

Footnotes
V V'S DREAM broke slowly, raced off of the pace two wide into the turn, launched a rally by splitting foes in the four path turning for home, then rallied in the
five path under confident handling to sweep past the leader at the sixteenth pole before kicking clear. CHEETAH MISS quickly sped clear, opened up a wide
margin into the turn, showed the way in the two path around the bend, held sway from pursuing foes into midstretch, but was overhauled by the eventual
winner approaching the final sixteenth, and held place safely. HI'IAKA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the three path in midstretch, and
rallied to reach show at the wire. GLORIETTE tracked two wide, ranged up turning for home before shifting to the four path entering the lane, but only
managed to chase the clear leader through upper stretch, got outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, then was nailed at the wire for show. ARGAN raced
off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, then failed to menace between horses. VIBE CHECK broke slowly, trailed in the two path, fanned to
the six path in upper stretch, and failed to threaten outside of rivals. TX WOMEN FOR ARTS stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in upper
stretch before fading. LITTLE MUSIC chased two wide but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
HIGH FRONT stalked along the inside, bid and struck the front passing the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and desperately lasted from a
pair of late bidders at the wire. B D VALESKI pursued from midpack two wide, awaited racing room entering the lane, split foes in upper stretch, rallied along
with an outer rival to offer a bid approaching the wire, but narrowly came up short. COUNTERSTRIKE tracked four wide, spun into the lane five wide,
grinded away while shifting inwardly on his lead in midstretch, straightened and sustained his charge to bid in the closing stages, but missed. ARABIAN
PRINCE laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, tipped to the five path in midstretch and offered a late rally to gain fourth in the shadow of
the wire. GILDED RULER was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, vied for place with outer foes nearing
midstretch, but yielded through the final sixteenth. LAVER lacked speed in the two path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on. TRUST
DADDY stalked three wide, spun into the lane four wide, but was outkicked while put to tight quarters among foes at the furlong grounds and weakened.
GROUP EIGHTEEN took contact from an inner rival before steadying from pinched quarters at the start, lacked speed four to five path, and drifted in
through the lane while failing to factor. BRAZEN BOY broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch and
made little impact. KING OF SONG broke outwardly and bothered multiple rivals at the start, set the pace in the two path, but was headed by a rail bidder at
the five sixteenths pole, then caved three wide and between horses at the three sixteenths marker. ROMAN GIANT was outrun along the inside. FINGERS
transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe while being forced outwardly at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside into the turn and
weakened around the bend.

Footnotes
JUST LIKE MAGIC tracked along the inside, gained place before taking aim outside of the leader entering the lane, then assumed command from that one
leaving the three sixteenths pole and drew off. GRAY FROST set the pace in the two path, shook away from an outer presser nearing the lane, but offered
no resistance to JUST LIKE MAGIC's challenge at the three sixteenths pole while hanging on her left lead, shifted out while changing over entering the final
sixteenth and held place. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE pressed the leader from the three path, gave way entering the lane, but kept on to maintain show. ROJA
LIGERA stalked in the four path and lacked a bid. BIZZY GIRL trailed in the three path and made little impact. LILY'S CREED lacked speed in the two path
and got outrun.

FAITHFUL RULER was washed out moving to post, chased outside of the top pair, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and
narrowly held from his inner game counterpart. MAC DADDY TOO was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, vied two wide, led around the turn, dug
in to resist FAITHFUL RULER's outer challenge entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch, yet fought on gamely to duel through the final furlong, but
narrowly missed. STONEVICIOUS tracked from the two path, spun into the lane in the five path and chased the embattled leading pair home.
MIDASWELLRUN trailed, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. BODOCK bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, laid off
of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. PICO D'ORO raced off of the pace two to three wide and failed to menace. ON K P broke outwardly and
bumped a rival with his hind quarters at the start, tracked four wide, but spun into the lane in the six path and caved. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke out and
bumped a foe before taking contact from an inner rival at the start, dueled along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and stopped through the lane.
PER RULING 23-0051 FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, STONEVICIOUS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

headed in midstretch, vied for show through the lane late stages, and prevailed in the photo for that position. MAHAAMEL pressed two wide, vied between
horses around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer rivals in midstretch, vied for show through the late stages, but missed between horses.
MICROPHONE (IRE) pursued from midpack three wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, ran on to
bid for show late, but came up short. HENLEY'S JOY stalked along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane, then chased three wide and between
horses through the final furlong. STOLEN BASE had his hind heels clipped early on, saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch,
but encountered traffic two wide through the final furlong. PUNCH HARD pursued from midpack two wide, but laid further back around the far turn before
making little impact. ALTAZOR (ARG) settled far back along the inside, shifted out turning for home before fanning to the eight path in upper stretch, and

COLORATURA stalked two wide, bid turning for home, took over entering the lane, and lasted safely from an outer rival late. HAMMERDONHAPPINESS
broke slowly, recovered to track from the two to three path around the turn, gained place at the furlong grounds, and cut into the leader's advantage late.
GET BY gained midpack position in the three path into the turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, and ran on mildly. PADDY GAL broke outwardly
before being slow into stride, lacked speed in the two path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on. TERRANOVA sped clear, got headed
by an outer bidder entering the lane, and stopped. WITCH OF NOVEMBER chased along the inside and gave way entering the lane. KEEN CONTENDER
was slow to stride after breaking slowly, trailed in the three path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. CALLIE'S PASSION veered
outwardly at the start, then made little impact from the five path. FASHION IDOL pursued from midpack in the two path, then faded around the turn in the
four path. MARKSWOMAN lacked speed along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
RETAINED vied two wide and prevailed in the long duel. CIRCLE BACK JACK vied along the inside, sustained a long battle, but missed. SUPREMELY
stalked outside of the top pair, and chased them through the lane. AERONAUT tracked in the two path, then pursued one-paced through the lane.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE tracked four wide and gave way. SCHMOOZIN trailed and failed to factor. KEEN ON YOU lacked speed along the inside and
tired.
