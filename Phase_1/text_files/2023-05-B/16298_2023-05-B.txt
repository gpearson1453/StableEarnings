Footnotes
LILMISS SASSYPANTS vied for the lead two wide into the turn, cleared in mid-turn, continued on the lead while widening into the lane then held. BEREA
stumbled in at the start bumping rival on her inside, rushed up to gain the lead before the first call, lost the lead through mid-turn, chased the winner into the
lane and was all out late to save the place spot. GOODY FOUR SHOES chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the
four path and was gaining on the place rival to the end. LUCKY LINDA W never a factor while angling into the lane from the five path. SHANGHAI
EXPRESS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four or five path then flattened out. MEAN ELENITA never a
factor while moving closer to the inside in mid-turn and never was a factor. BICARB BETTY was bumped at the start and settled to the back, raced in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and did not make up ground.

Footnotes
AUTO GLIDE stalked the leader from the three path into the far turn, bid approaching mid-turn, quickly gained a clear lead, continued to be clear into the
lane then widened through the final eighth. TABEGUACHE saved ground into the far turn, was asked for more soon after the winner asked, chased that one
into the lane, could not gain but was well ahead of the next rival at the rival. ICE TIME saved ground through the far turn then moved up for the show spot
while not a threat to the top two. THE MOTTO chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, took after the top two into the lane when not far back
then tired inside the eighth pole. RISKY CHOICE tired after racing in the two or three path throughout. CAMBIASO never a factor while in the four path
through the far turn and racing in the six path in the lane. TOTALITARIAN set the pace into the far turn then was suddenly done nearing the three-eighths
pole. ORO was four wide through the first turn, continued in the three path into the far turn then was done entering the lane and was eased through the lane
and walked off.

turn when never far back, swung into the lane four wide and moved up for the show spot while not a threat to the top ones. AUSTIN TEN raced off the inside
into the turn, bid three wide in late turn, swung into the lane from the three or four path and weakened in the drive. SAHARAN FLEECE vied for the early

TAILLIGHTS vied for the lead from the outset while between rivals and in the two path, was on a short lead with an eighth to go, cleared approaching the
sixteenth pole then was kept to the task to the wire to hold. VICTOR'S DEAL was unhurried while along the inside through the turn, was asked for more in
late turn, took aim on the leader into the lane while moving off the inside then finished willingly to be closing in to the wire and clearly second best.
GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside of three rivals, remained on a short lead into the lane, continued to duel
with the winner to inside the eighth pole then yielded to that one. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE trailed while off the rail through the turn then moved up in the lane
while never a factor. SPOKE pressed the pace four wide through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. MACHO ALEGRE pressed the pace three
wide through the turn while between rivals and was done turning into the lane.

Footnotes
FIREWATER JAKE was unrushed early, rallied five wide at the three-eighths pole and drew off late. ENGLISH TIDE pressed the early pace, took back, bid
at the quarter pole but couldn't hold off the winner. POET OF LIFE (IRE) raced well back, then bid belatedly inside. MAJOR SPARKS raced well back and
bid belatedly outside. PATRIOT DRIVE raced inside, then improved position late between rivals. EVIL EYE stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in
the stretch. POLKA POLENTA dueled early outside of a rival, drew off, then gave way in the stretch. COUNT FROST was not a factor. SOLITAIRE GAME
stalked the early pace before giving way.
