Footnotes
DRIFTER broke back, lacked speed off the inside, tipped out five wide turning for home seeking room, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be
edging away at the end. LULOS bothered to be off a step slow, moved up to press the issue through the turn, vied four wide through the bend, continued to
do battle past the furlong marker, could not match strides late with the winner, prevailed for the place. EUROBELIEVER broke outward to bother the runner
up, raced behind the lead pack, continued in traffic late turn, slipped through a narrow opening along the inside entering the stretch, finished clear of the rest
while outkicked for the runner up spot. B W P SPIRIT away in good order, narrowly set the pace along the inside, got out a bit to allow EUROBELIEVER the
inside into the stretch, weakened. ORDER UP dueled early in the two path, continued to contest the issue up front through the turn between horses, faltered
in the drive. BARAHIN in the second flight early, advanced and challenged up front three wide and between foes early in the turn, gave way soon after,
trailed home.

Footnotes
BUCK DOLL TAYLOR broke alertly, set the pace off the inside, allowed CHECKULATER the rail into the lane, came in slightly to exchange a brush with that
foe past the furlong marker, came in more significantly under a right handed crop to soundly bump that same foe late. CHECKULATER forwardly placed
along the inside, crept closer into the lane, lodged a rail bid past the furlong marker brushing with BUCK DOLL TAYLOR, soundly bumped by that foe late,
well clear of the others. COCAL reluctant to load, broke in good order, prompted the pace pace while three wide into and through the turn, had little for the
top pair to the wire, narrowly saved the show. FRIEND'S DO CARE went one paced along the inside in the second flight, not enough for the show. GONE
SOLUTION off a step slow, raced in mid pack off the inside, steered out past the furlong marker, finished up evenly in also lacking a closing punch. TRUE
CRIMSON in the second flight outside, four wide late in the turn, lacked a closing kick as well. APRIORITY AVENGER five wide into the turn when off the
pace, four wide exiting, remained back. MINE YOUR BIZ four wide into the turn, tired. HAPPY SEASON bothered early in some traffic, tried to get out
midway up the backstraight, bolted early in the turn, jogged in on the outside rail. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CHECKULATER
AGAINST BUCK DOLL TAYLOR FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
TOUGH CHARLIE closest to the leader into the turn, asked along late in the bend, lodged an inside rally a furlong out, steadily drew out while kept to
pressure. SPECTROLITE broke on top, quickly clear, set a lively set of fractions while maintaining daylight through the turn, challenged from the inside by
the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, comfortably held the place. WILD BERT settled outside and in the main body, continued
out in the course into the lane, getting to the runner up late while not a threat to the winner. TACTICAL PRIORITY in the second flight just off the inside,
continued in the two path for the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. BINDING AGREEMENT last to leave, raced back and was
never dangerous. GRAND PRADO raced well back off the pace, failed to produce a rally. CHIMNEY ROCK trailed while racing four wide.

Footnotes
WAITIN' ON A WOMAN in a bit tight at the start, closer into the turn when four wide, took over into the lane, quickly clear, ridden out late. HALF A BUCK in
mid pack while off the inside, four wide through most of the turn, asked midway on the bend, rallied to be clear for the place, no match for the winner.
BRYKEN N MITCHELL back off the pace outside, five wide through the turn, improved to be closest to the winner in upper stretch, had little more for that
one, could not contain the runner up while remaining clear of the others. CIGAR VAN within striking distance early, raced three wide and inside the winner in
the second flight into the turn, bit closer with that one by late in the bend, lacked further advance through the stretch. SIR POKERFACE void of speed while
in some traffic into the turn, four wide exiting the bend, improved position without posing a serious threat. JOEY'S LIGHTENING broke back, lacked speed,
improved position, no real threat. NOCOMET last to leave, moved up to race in mid pack toward the inside through the turn, had little left for the drive.
SHOT ON WINDY HILL remained back in failing to menace. CLASSIC RED RACER vied up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed before a half,
gave way in the drive. MONITOR MILLS broke through the gate and ran off for two furlongs, broke well, flashed early foot along the inside, backed up.
THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER fell back after the start, was always outrun while wide.

Footnotes
MEAN AMERICAN within striking distance off the inside, shifted out a bit turning for home, challenged soon after outside the leader, lugged in to bother that
one slightly a furlong out, continued to try to lug in a bit while edging clear at the wire. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON four wide when forwardly placed into the
first turn, pressed the issue up the backstretch, took over far turn, showed the way into the lane, responded when the winner challenged, bothered slightly
by that one a furlong out, gave ground grudgingly to the winner to the wire. US SECOND CUTE PIE in mid pack for five furlongs, roused in the second turn,
two path into the lane when beginning a mild rally, up for the show while no match for the top two. THE GREY BEAUTY broke on top, set the pace for a half,
briefly dueled with the winner in the far turn, began to weaken when headed by that one, caught late for the show. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS lacked speed for
five furlongs, improved position without posing a serious threat. MYLIES STAR settled off the pace and the inside, lacked response in the drive.
MSCHITCHATTOUR last away, remained back in failing to threaten. KAITLYN'S COURT was finished after a half, trailed in.

Footnotes
FIREINTHESTORM broke sharp, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to hold a small advantage while saving ground through the turn,
shrugged off the other speed entering the stretch, remained clear until late, enough left to withstand a late run from the runner up. OLE STUD MUFFIN back
off the pace out in the course, five wide into the lane when beginning to rally, finished with good energy down the middle of the course to be rapidly getting
to the winner in the waning strides. HARD CANDY squeezed back at the break, void of speed while three wide and between foes turn, still well back into the
stretch, late run to finish up well and gain the nod for the show. WIN WON DOBBS with the pace while three wide into the turn, continued to vie, fell back off
the winner entering the stretch, lightly bumped with BORDEAUX RED just inside the furlong grounds, nipped at the wire for the show. BORDEAUX RED
pressed the issue between foes, could not keep up with the winner upper stretch, lightly bumped with WIN WON DOBBS midstretch, weakened. MEET
KEVIN settled in mid pack, went one paced throughout. LITTLE PUCK brushed at the start, made little other impact,. HEY JACKSON raced in the second
flight early while outside, tired. COLT'S BRIM had nothing for the drive. ST JOE last to leave, was always outrun while racing five wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
LOVELYREDSTILETTOS broke out, was straightened to move up and contest the issue through a rapid opening quarter, shook off the other speed to be
well clear through the turn, maintained a clear advantage through the lane under firm handling in a solid effort. CAJUN GUMBOW broke alertly, showed the
way early, dueled with the winner late backstretch inside that one, fell back off that one through the turn, set down for the drive, coming again late. THAT'S
MY MAMA chased the dueling leaders early, continued that pursuit into the stretch, some gain late while holding sway for the show. A RUNNIN AFLEET last
to leave, lacked early foot, improved position slightly. APRIORITY MAGIC in mid pack, had little for the drive. AGAMI fell back to trail after the start, failed to
menace.

lose ground to the other leader, came back to reengage that one inside the furlong grounds, held the runner up safe late. SAINT MARY fractious post
parade, cut off at the start, lacked speed for over a half, advanced off the inside into the stretch, steadily getting to the winner late. HIGHER NOTE broke
out, chased the early leader up the backstretch, took over early in the turn, dueled with the winner outside that one late in the bend, shook free of that one
when straightened for home, weakened the final furlong to lose the advantage then was caught in the final strides for the place. KASENS TRIBE broke
back, void of any early speed,improved position while racing outside. SILK NOT SATIN forwardly placed early, steady fade. MS. PRIESTLY behind the pace
inside, moved out, failed to rally. BON CHANCE BET took command to show the way out of the chute, set the pace up the backstretch, stopped in the far
turn, finished far back. TOUCHING ACES within striking distance up the backstretch, moved a bit closer in the turn, lost action midway on the bend,
gradually pulled up, walked in.
