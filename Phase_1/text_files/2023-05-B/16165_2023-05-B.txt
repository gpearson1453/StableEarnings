Footnotes
TUCKABUCKAWAY In hand along the three path, four wide on the turn, five wide into the lane, reached the leaders four across a furlong out and under the
whip outran ROYAL KAZ to the wire. ROYAL KAZ Five wide early, four wide into the turn, challenged outside, battled from between and finished gamely.
OLIVER'S FORTUNE Vied for the lead along the rail, battled inside and faded. STORMY NEW YORK Vied for the lead along the two path on the turn,
between into the lane, battled and weakened. JACOBA Three path on the turn, was not a factor. MO CRAZY BLUES Close up along the three path into the
turn, checked midway around and weakened. YAH HUH Saved ground and tired. STORM ALFEET Broke sluggishly, was outrun.
