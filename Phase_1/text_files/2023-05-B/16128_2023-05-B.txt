Footnotes
GROSS PROFIT settled off of the contentious early pace, maintained a two wide path to the half-mile marker, inched closer along the second turn, was
roused three wide into the stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, responded to urging heading to the sixteenth-marker, surged in deep stretch
and was up just in time to prevail in a blanket finish. JERRY JEFF WALKER sent leaving a good beginning, established the lead into the first turn and set
decent fractions into the backstretch run, was pressed into the far turn by CUT ACROSS SHORTY, shook free from that foe nearing the quarter marker, was
confronted again by CUT ACROSS SHORTY into upper stretch, dueled with that rival to the furlong grounds, continued to battle to deep stretch, held a
narrow lead to the final strides, was overtaken at the wire by GROSS PROFIT and gamely held for second. CUT ACROSS SHORTY forwardly placed in the
early running, disputed the decent pace through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground to JERRY JEFF WALKER along the second turn, re-rallied in upper
stretch, confronted JERRY JEFF WALKER and dueled with that rival to mid-stretch, continued to battle to the final stages, was not able to get by a game
JERRY JEFF WALKER in deep stretch and was outfinished by GROSS PROFIT at the finish, while holding for third in a good effort. LORD OF LIGHT
allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn, slipped to the two path for the backstretch run, was steered three wide into the second turn, was
roused four wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker while on the left lead but could not reel in the leaders in the final stages. DE LA
LUNA unhurried through decent early fractions, saved ground through the backstretch run, came two wide into the second turn, was roused three wide into
the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and offered a mild late rally in the late stages. NEVER HAD I EVER tracked the decent early pace,
saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, dropped back along the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR close up in the early running, attended to the solid fractions into the turn, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker while stalking
GREAT STORY, overtook that rival in upper stretch, kept to task under steady urging to mid-stretch and held GREAT STORY at bay in the final stages to
prevail. GREAT STORY broke out a step at the start and crowded AWESOME DUDE, was sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions into the turn,
dictated terms to the quarter marker, was overtaken by HORSE DOCTOR in upper stretch, chased that foe to the furlong grounds, ran on in deep stretch
but could not catch HORSE DOCTOR in the final stages and was outfinished, while besting the rest. AWESOME DUDE crowded at the start by GREAT
STORY and was away a step slowly, chased the solid early pace from the inside, tipped two wide for the drive, rallied at mid-stretch, could not sustain that
run in the final furlong and was outkicked by the top pair, while holding safely for third. WINE AND WHISKY chased the decent early pace while outside of
rivals, was floated out a bit on the turn by COPPER HALO, raced four wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. COPPER HALO forwardly placed in
the early running, chased the decent pace into the turn, drifted out a bit on the turn and floated out WINE AND WHISKY, was steered three wide into the
stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and tired late.

Footnotes
GRAND SLAM SMILE showed good early speed and contested the lead into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper
stretch, drew to a clear lead while in hand nearing the furlong marker and drew off in the final stages as much the best. BLEVYS TIGER lacked early speed,
saved ground to the top of the lane, found her best stride late and rallied in the final sixteenth to secure the place. LUSMA prominent in the early running,
pressed the solid early pace while outside of GRAND SLAM SMILE, could not keep pace with that foe into the drive, weakened in the final furlong but held
well at the finish to save third. CORAL CAT raced in tight into the turn and steadied at the three-furlong marker, chased the decent pace from the rail into
upper stretch, improved position inside of the furlong pole, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for third. DRUM BUNNY forwardly placed into the
turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, was steered two wide into the stretch and could not muster a late response. CLEAR THE COAST lacked early
speed, swung widest into the stretch, offered a mild late bid but did not threaten in the late stages. DADS DREAM chased the decent early pace, raced two
wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed three wide into the stretch and tired in the drive. LUCCA'S LEGACY broke in at the start and was off slowly, saved
ground along the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
AZURE STAR (IRE) showed speed leaving the break and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch
run, was confronted by SGT POWELL nearing the quarter marker, turned away that bid in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, kept
to task to deep stretch and remained clear to the wire to prevail. SGT POWELL close up in the early running, stalked the decent fractions through the
backstretch run, confronted AZURE STAR nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with that rival into upper stretch, drifted out a bit into
mid-stretch, could not make headway on AZURE STAR in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely for second at the finish. BOOMING
BERNARDO settled off of the early pace while saving ground, made a steady advance along the backstretch run, maintained a rail trip to the quarter
marker, continued to gain to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed late response and was outkicked by the top two, while clear of the rest for third. DO IT
FOR DAVE allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the second turn, was asked for run two wide into the
stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole and finished evenly in the final stages. MOTOWN CLASSIC took back off of the early pace, raced three wide
into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and stalked the decent fractions to the second turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, was
outrun into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. COOPERKLIMT was shuffled leaving the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages,
gained ground while trailing through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the second turn, made a mild late rally in the drive but did not factor.
LASMUIGH (GB) settled off of the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run, gained ground approaching the second turn,
was roused four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong pole and gave way. COBRE allowed to settle in the early stages, gained
ground along the backstretch run while two wide, dropped back nearing the second turn, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
EL PERFECTO was prominent in the early running, pressed the moderate fractions into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the
half-mile marker, advanced on UNCLE WALT nearing the quarter pole, overtook that rival in upper stretch, kicked to a clear lead inside of the furlong
marker, was kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held safely for the win in the final stages. SEVENTEEN BLACK
was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the moderate fractions into the first turn, raced two wide through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground
at the half-mile marker, slipped to the rail entering the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive, advanced at mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages,
could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. FAST CHAD settled just off of the early pace, maintained a two wide path into the
backstretch run, lost a bit of ground heading to the second turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, was not able to impact the
top two in the final stages and closed for third at the finish. UNCLE WALT assumed command in the early stages, set the pace while off of the rail into the
first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run while prompted by EL PERFECTO, showed the way to the quarter marker while holding EL
PERFECTO at bay, was overtaken by that rival in upper stretch, ran in pursuit to deep stretch and was just edged for third at the finish. CANTILEVER
stalked the moderate early pace from a three wide position into the first turn, maintained his position through the backstretch run, chased three wide on the
second turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ACERO broke out at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the
moderate early pace, advanced position while three wide through the backstretch run, was not far back heading to the second turn, was asked for run four
wide into the stretch and lacked a late response. BUY THE RUMOR well placed in the early running, tracked the moderate pace from the rail through the
backstretch run, lost ground along the second turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the pacesetter through decent fractions into the backstretch run, was roused
entering the second turn and confronted LADYWEARSTHERING nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead with that rival to the furlong pole, continued
to duel with the stubborn LADYWEARSTHERING to deep stretch, wore down that rival inside of the sixteenth-pole and held in a drive in the final strides to
prevail. LADYWEARSTHERING sent leaving an alert beginning, showed speed and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions through the
backstretch run, was well handled to the half-mile pole and drew to a clear lead approaching the far turn, was confronted by NAUGHTY NADINE nearing the
quarter marker, battled with that foe to mid-stretch, stubbornly met the bid of NAUGHTY NADINE to deep stretch, grudgingly gave way in the final sixteenth
and was second best in the end. A CROWN FOR KITTEN allowed to settle in the early running, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, steadily
advanced from the inside approaching the top of the stretch, tipped two wide for the drive, split foes at the furlong grounds while improving position,
continued her sustained rally to deep stretch, could not reel in the top two in the final stages and outfinished DERRYGOOLIN to secure the show.
DERRYGOOLIN bumped SHEZARUNAWAY leaving the start, chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the backstretch
run, advanced three wide on the second turn and came within aim at the quarter marker, lost ground heading to mid-stretch, ran evenly in the final furlong,
was outkicked in deep stretch and lost third in the final strides. BANDEENA not far back in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, was well
placed through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, could not match strides at the furlong
marker and weakened in deep stretch. AGREETODISAGREE tracked the decent early pace from the inside, maintained her position through the
backstretch run, advanced while two wide on the second turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong pole and did not offer a late
rally. WARRIOR'S MOON was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, was coaxed three wide into the far turn, lost ground
into the drive and did not factor in the final stages. PACIFIC ZIP bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, recovered and was forwardly placed
into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions from a rail position through the backstretch run, maintained that rail trip into the second turn, advanced at the
quarter marker, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. SEEMS LOGICAL settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the
backstretch run, was steered three wide into the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and did not threaten. SHEZARUNAWAY bothered
RIVENDELL at the start then was bumped by DERRYGOOLIN and was shuffled back at the start, was allowed to settle through the early stages, raced
outside a rival to the half-mile pole, advanced beween runners then came in tight heading to the second turn, slipped to the rail on the far turn, made a mild
gain at mid-stretch but could not muster the needed late response and did not factor. JACRODRA'S DEVIL chased the decent early pace from a two wide
path, was outrun along the second turn and gave way in the stretch. RIVENDELL bothered at the start by SHEZARUNAWAY and was off slowly, was
unhurried through the early stages, raced two wide along the backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally on the second turn, could not sustain that bid into
the stretch and flattened out in the drive.

Footnotes
AWESOME SUMMER broke in at the break causing a chain reaction to the inside, then sprinted away and settled into a stalking position behind PARK
ROAD COWBOY, moved to challenge that one on the turn, dueled into the stretch, got the upper hand inside the furlong pole and drew away under
intermittent urging. I'M DR. O was outrun from the break but kept the rail path, moved forward to a striking position going into the turn, loomed a big threat
turning for home and ran on well but was no match for the winner while gaining the place. GRAZEN SUN broke slightly outward at the start, tracked the
leaders from mid-pack while racing in the two path, started a bid from the three furlong pole, had trouble finding clear running in the stretch then ran on well
to grab third by the narrowest of margins. TALBOT BAY broke inward, was last away and at the rear of a compact field down the backstretch, was boxed in
and awaited room through the turn, tipped out to the three path just past the three-sixteenths pole, made a mild late rally and was just nailed at the wire for a
minor award. PARK ROAD COWBOY got away best from the gate and seized the early lead, set a controlled pace through the turn, met a challenge from
WARM SUMMER at the top of the stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. ROBIE raced close up early, chased the leading pair through the turn,
attempted to rally at the top of the stretch but was unable to summon the needed response and lost position in the final furlong. WINDRIBBON pinched, took
up and shuffled back after the break, raced four wide down the backstretch, fell back to last going into the turn, swung five wide and made a tepid rally
turning into the stretch but only passed one in the end. LITTLE CASINO was forced in at the break putting WINDRIBBON in a tight spot, raced close up but
wide down the backstretch and through the turn, was asked for more passing the quarter pole but had nothing to offer and trailed the field to the wire.
