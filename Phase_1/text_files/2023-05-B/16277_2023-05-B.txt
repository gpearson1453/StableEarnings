inside the furlong marker. TWO HEARTED well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, lugged in and
closed for the place. ALEXANDRA'S SONG sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, then weakened late and held the show. BERYL RACER unhurried,
looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly. ANOTHERDAYOFWORK void of speed, saved ground moving up through
the turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally. GYPSY WANDERER broke slowly from the gate and was never involved.

UNCLE ANDREW rated on the lead, turned back a bid and shook clear through the second turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. C THE
KING tracked the pace well back, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed for the place.
SPETTACOLI (ARG) well placed and outside, moved up to gain a striking position on the two path through the turn, then could not match strides with the
leader into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. ORAZIO allowed to settle, angled out through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
could not gain.

and held. BROKEN LOVE broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, then lacked the
needed late kick and settled for the place. UPTOWN CHARLOTTE tracked the pace back, steadied for racing room into the turn, loosing ground, came
through on the two path into the stretch, then closed willingly to gain the show. SUPER GEUSE bumped at the start, was unhurried early, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside, then angled four wide for racing room, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. SAINT FOXY broke out,
bumping a rival at the start, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. GLO GIRL GLO sprinted to a long
lead soon after the start, then faded the final furlong. AFTER NOON KISSES well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came
through on that path and weakened. LIBERTALIA hopped and broke out at the start, bumped and steadied along early, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. DETAILED chased the pace and steadily lost ground.
