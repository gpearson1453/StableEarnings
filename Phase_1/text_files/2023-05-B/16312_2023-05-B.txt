BIG JOLT away in good order, took back to stalk the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter while two wide along the
second turn, overtook SUE GENEROUS in upper stretch and was set down from the three path, kept to task to deep stretch and held safely in a drive in the
final stages. PEACEHAVEN settled in the second flight early, raced three then two wide along the first turn, advanced three wide on the second turn, was
asked four wide into the stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the drive and bested the rest. ACHROMATIC hopped at the start then was crowded by a
neighboring rival and was off slowly, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive,
advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the top pair in the final furlong and ran on in the final stages to secure third. SPORTS FOR
WOMEN allowed to settle, saved ground through the backstretch run, swung five wide into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. SUE GENEROUS
showed speed leaving the break, set moderate fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, came under pressure at the quarter marker, was
overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
DICK BEST broke alertly and showed good early speed to dictate terms into the turn, set solid fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in
upper stretch, drew to a clear lead heading to the furlong pole and remained clear under steady urging in the final stages. HAWK HILL prominent in the early
running, stalked the quick pace to the turn, advanced to press DICK BEST along the bend, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, chased the winner
through the lane and could not make late headway but held well in the final stages to secure the place. SAFE COMBINATION away a step slowly at the
break, chased the decent fractions to the turn, raced two wide between runners to the quarter marker, closed in the drive and held for show at the finish.
BROKEN FINGER tracked the decent early fractions from the inside, lost ground at the quarter marker, lacked a late response in the drive and was
outfinished for the minor awards. AWE chased the decent fractions while outside of rivals, raced four wide to the quarter marker and needed more in the
stretch. ECHO ALPHA SIX chased the decent early pace, raced three wide between runners on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong pole and lacked a late
rally.

Footnotes
LOTSA PEPPER broke alertly, sped to the early lead and set a quick pace to the turn,extended the lead heading to the quarter marker, drew off in upper
stretch, kept to task through the drive and remained clear in the final stages to hold sway. KITTEN'S KID bobbled leaving the start, chased the fast pace to
the turn, advanced three wide on the bend, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final stages, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and held well to
secure second. TIGER QUEEN chased the quick early pace from the inside, checked in tight quarters entering the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane,
re-rallied in the stretch, was outfinished for second and was up in time to gain third. O'NEILL'S LEGACY chased the quick early pace, raced two wide
between runners into the turn, lost ground approaching the top of the lane, ran evenly in the stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. SHOUT IT
OUT came in tight in the early stages, took up and was shuffled to the back heading to the turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed three
wide into the stretch and showed good late interest while unable to threaten the leaders. DANCING CRANE stalked the fast early pace, lost position while
three deep on the turn, was steered four wide into the stretch and tired in the drive. JERSEY STAR lacked early speed, raced three wide into the stretch and
did not factor.

Footnotes
SWEET LAYLA RAE prominent early on, took back to stalk the decent early pace, was well placed into the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, was
roused two wide in upper stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong pole, closed well in deep stretch, confronted GRAZED N' CONFUSED inside of the
sixteenth-marker, responded well to urging in the final strides and was up in time to prevail. GRAZED N' CONFUSED broke alertly, took back off of the solid
early pace and stalked DANCING BONBON to the turn, advanced on the bend and pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, gained command in upper
stretch and extended the lead at the furlong pole, came under pressure in deep stretch, was confronted by the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker, could
not hold off SWEET LAYLA RAE in the final strides and held safely for second. ADAPTED MEMORY chased from the second flight, raced outside of rivals
on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the stretch and held for third at the finish. UNION HARBOR away slowly, chased the solid pace to the turn,
was coaxed three wide into the stretch, closed willingly in the drive and missed for third. DANCING BONBON sent to establish the early lead, showed speed
while carving solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the late stages. SAINT
HELEN lacked early speed, chased the pace from the rail on the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO sent in the early running, contested the early pace with LIL MIRACLE MAN then assumed command into the first turn, was a bit keen into the
first turn and set the pace while off of the rail, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was steered to the inside into the second
turn, held foes at bay into upper stretch, dug in in the drive while responding to steady urging and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. LIL MIRACLE MAN
forwardly placed in the early running, took back to stalk the decent fractions into the first turn, ran in pursuit of IL CAPITANO through the backstretch run,
advanced on that rival on the second turn, chased into the stretch, could not make headway on IL CAPITANO in the final stages and was outfinished, while
holding safely at the end for second. QUE SERA SIR RALPH allowed to settle in the early running while not far back, maintained a two wide path through
the backstretch run, advanced two wide at the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the top pair in the drive and just held for third at the finish. HOLY
GHOST unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the second turn, was roused four wide into
the stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for third on the wire. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) settled three wide along the first turn, maintained his
position through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid through the stretch drive and lacked the
needed late response. CHIEF JACKSON saved all of the ground in the early stages while settling off of the pace, mounted a two wide bid along the second
turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, made a mild late rally in deep stretch but could not muster the needed late response.

Footnotes
SEA DOG unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, advanced along the second turn, came in a bit tight at the top
of the stretch and angled two wide for the drive, loomed approaching the furlong grounds, drifted out under firm urging inside of the furlong marker,
confronted RODRIGOKNOWS and took a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, kept a slim lead while drifting out into deep stretch, determinedly held foes
at bay and held on in the final strides to prevail. HAPPY DOES allowed to settle in the early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that
three wide path to the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of the leading pair inside of
the sixteenth-pole, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while winning the nod for second. RODRIGOKNOWS settled in the second flight
early on, was caught four wide into the first turn then settled in the two path into the backstretch run, tracked the leaders to the half-mile marker, raced three
wide into the second turn, came four wide into the lane, loomed in upper stretch and took a narrow lead to the furlong pole, met the bid of SEA DOG to deep
stretch, came again inside of the sixteenth-marker, battled the winner to the finish, was gamely bested in the final strides and was just edged for second,
while well clear of the rest for third. DUPLICATION settled off of the quick early pace while not far back, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch run,
advanced two wide at the quarter marker, was steered three wide into the stretch, continued to gain ground heading to the furlong pole, came in tight at
mid-stretch, was pinched back and took up between rivals heading to the sixteenth-marker and lacked a late response. NAUVOO broke alertly and showed
the way into the first turn, conceded the lead to TRINIDAD into the backstretch run, stalked that rival through quick fractions to the second turn, lost position
approaching the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch. TRINIDAD sent to be prominent in the early stages, gained command along the first turn and
set the pace into the backstretch run, carved out fast fractions to the half-mile pole, maintained a clear lead into the far turn, was overtaken at the top of the
stretch and faded in the drive. MOTHER'S PRAYER fractious in the gate, settled two wide off of the solid early pace, lost ground heading to the half-mile
pole, was pulled up approaching the second turn and was vanned off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WHILE SEA DOG DRIFTED OUT AT MID-STRETCH AND CAUSED DUPLICATION TO TAKE
UP, THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST DUPLICATION THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH. THERE WAS ALSO A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DUPLICATION AGAINST THE RIDER OF SEA DOG
AND THE RIDER OF HAPPY DOES.

one while coming out of the far turn then rallied under strong handling to wear down that stubborn rival. WINDRIBBON came away well from the gate then
was hard held through the first turn, settled mid-pack down the backstretch, advanced on the far turn, was boxed in heading to the quarter marker, slipped to
the inside in upper stretch, rallied in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and won the nod for second on the wire. JACKS
OUTLAW broke best, sprinted clear of the field through the clubhouse turn, rated well through reasonable fractions, responded when asked at the top of the
stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final yards and was just edged for second. KODIACTION broke alertly but was not asked for speed, settled near the
back of the pack and was content to trail to the half mile marker, started to rally four wide into the far turn then swung out even wider for the stretch run and
kicked well down the stretch but was too late. SUNNY SPOT unhurried from the break, took a three wide path throughout, rallied through the far turn and
through the stretch but could not make an impact. WARD 'N JERRY lacked early speed, kept to the inside while racing near the rear of the field to the
stretch, was unable to get clear run down the lane and could not improve position once able. ROUGH NIGHT broke well, vied for the early lead, went a bit
wide into the first turn then settled for a tracking spot on the rail well behind the runaway pacesetter, started a bid from the three furlong marker and loomed
a threat at the top of the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
VANISKY settled in the early going while never far back, made a steady gain to the second turn, was roused three wide into the drive, closed fast inside of
the furlong marker, reeled in the leaders in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. ROARING TIGER tracked the quick early fractions from
the inside, was well positioned through the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch with LUCK IS GOLDEN
then took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, held a slim advantage to the sixteenth-pole while kept to steady urging, was confronted in deep stretch by
VANISKY and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while holding for second. LUCK IS GOLDEN broke alertly, ceded the early lead to DI LAURIAN and
stalked that rival into the backstretch run, kept attendance to the solid pace to the half-mile pole, took command nearing the quarter marker, was set down in
upper stretch, was overtaken by ROARING TIGER at the furlong pole, battled from the inside to deep stretch but was outfinished in the final stages and just
held for third. LOOKOUT POINT settled in the second flight, raced three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the far turn, continued
that advance four wide into the stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for third at the finish. CHRIS FIX settled three wide in the early stages, was
coaxed along four wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker, was steered two then three wide along the second turn,
ran evenly in the drive and lacked the needed late response. BEROLIJEAN (FR) was a bit slow into stride early on and a bit keen into the first turn, settled
along the rail through the backstretch run, was steered two wide into the far turn, offered a mild late rally but was unable to threaten in the stretch. DI
LAURIAN disputed the early pace then assumed command along the first turn, showed good early speed and carved quick fractions to the half-mile marker,
was overtaken along the second turn, chased in pursuit to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. MESA EMPIRE allowed to settle, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, slipped to the rail heading to the second turn and did not factor in the stretch.
