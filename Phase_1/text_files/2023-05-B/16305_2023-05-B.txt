Footnotes
MY GIRL JAL showed speed between foes, was taken up while put in tight quarters between those rivals outside the five-eighths, drafted inside while just
off the pace on the turn, lost action while hugging the fence and a bit impatient behind the leader at the three-eighths, raced just off heels into upper stretch,
altered out from behind the leading duo in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, gained to take the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then went clear while
drifting out some late to prevail at big odds. MOONEY MOONEY was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path
on the turn, took a short lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for
the place. DARK PRINCESS stumbled at the start then was taken up while recovering, spotted the front several lengths, went two then three wide on the
turn, gained six wide into the stretch then drifted out some and finished willingly for the show while flattening some in the end. NOBLEANDGREENOUGH
showed speed on the inside of rivals, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was headed in upper stretch,
battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. GRACEFUL settled off the pace, was urged along in the three to four path on the turn, drifted out some
in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. KAREN'S HONOR broke out leaving the gate, was coaxed along on the outside, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, went around the turn in the four to five path, was carried out a bit in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
BEAUTE CACHEE (FR) rounded the first turn in the two path under a snug hold, tossed her head while keen nearing the seven-eighths, stalked the pace on
the outside, traveled around the far turn in two path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled outside
of the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. UNION DOLLY went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested
pace on the inside through tepid fractions, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop while challenged in upper
stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the eighth-pole, dueled determinedly inside of the winner to the finish and just missed while clear for the place.
CHILI FLAG (FR) was reserved towards the rear in the two path, came under urging on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while clear for the show. AMBITIEUSE saved ground while rated just off the pace on the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased in the
two path into upper stretch and came up empty. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) broke in at the start, went three wide around the first turn, dropped back while
keen under restraint onto and early on the backstretch, was reserved on the outside, traveled three then two wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOVIE MOXY prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch taking over
command, drew clear under a drive to prevail. DANCING SOPHIA chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the place honors while never threatening the
winner. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY cut the pace along the inside under some pressure through sensible splits from MOVIE MOXY to the outside, got collared
spinning three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. OK HONEY chased along the inside coming under brief coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch, tired and was eased home through the final eighth. IMPAZIBLE DONNA suffered an injury to her left rear leg
and was pulled up in the vicinity of the six and a half furlong marker, then was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
PENNER ASH (IRE) was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, made a bid near the half-mile pole, vied outside of a rival in
the two path on the turn, gained the lead outside the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and held under strong urging.
MAURITIUS was hustled to the front, moved clear inside the seven-eighths while well off the inside, was challenged with a half-mile to run, vied inside on
the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, fought on well under a drive in the stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and just held the place.
LEGENDARY LORE was hustled from the start then taken back after put to restraint, dropped off the pace under reserve, was roused while saving ground
on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong then angled further out, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed the place.
PARATUS settled off the pace, was roused in the three to four path on the turn, held a good striking position into upper stretch but lacked the needed
response. GENERAL'S DUTY broke out then was corrected by the rider, dropped to the rear then moved in, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
ADDICTED TO YOU was last to commence, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
PREDICTED showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken back off the pace outside the three-quarter pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
GOOD RAPPORT tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace, tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling to the finish and got the nod on the line. COLLECT FROM IKE attended the
pace of CHESS SPECTACULAR from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and dueled through the final furlong with the aforementioned foe to the outside and was nailed in the final jumps to the
finish. PLEASE BABY broke out at the start and was forced to steady off the heels of MY FAVORITE TOPIC causing his own issue, chased three wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. CHESS SPECTACULAR showed the
way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge for the initial time, yielded the front and spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. MY FAVORITE TOPIC chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. SWAY'SINMYDNA broke out at the start and was corrected, got steadied out when rivals crossed over from the outside a
mile from home losing about a length of ground, tracked just off the inside until tucked inside midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. EDDIEMUSH tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, tired. EQUALIZER settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. BEAR'S CORRECT chased just off the inside until tipped three then four wide through the far
turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
NO MORE TALK was urged along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, took the lead coming
to the furlong marker, disposed of STRIKING SPEED into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. PRINCE JAMES dropped back then
moved in while settling off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, chased the leaders in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. STRIKING
SPEED tracked the pace on the outside, issued challenge in the three path early on the turn, took the lead passing the seven-sixteenths, came under a
drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong marker, fought with that foe to near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then
lost the place while clear for the show. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the advantage while inside on
the turn, battled under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MAJESTIC TIGER angled out while urged along early,
went four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. WINNING DRIVE was urged along at the rear, went four wide around the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish. STARSHIP LAOBAN coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared at the sixteenth pole and was along clear for the place honors. SWEET FRANNY LU three wide in pursuit, got nudged four wide near the
five-sixteenths by DREAM CENTRAL as that rival tipped out to escape the backing away CAIRO SUGAR, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on
outside to secure the show honors. DREAM CENTRAL saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped two then three wide nudging the aforementioned foe to
the four path near the five-sixteenths to get around the fading CAIRO SUGAR, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to
the finish and was outkicked. SILKEN DOLLAR tracked the pace from just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped
four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. CAIRO SUGAR attended the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing just outside the
three-eighths and retreated readily through the latter portion of the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.

HEYMACKIT'SJACK showed speed then went clear, extended the advantage near the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, responded
well when asked near the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. ROYAL KING was
hustled from the gate then well placed behind the leader, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner under a drive
into the final furlong, gained on that foe into the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the place. VOLKERT was forwardly placed on the outside, went
around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, chased the top two in the drive and finished willingly for the show. WATASHA settled at the
rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and improved position. GIRAMONTE broke through the front of the gate prior to
the start but remained in the stall, came out and bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the
needed response. FOLIAGE settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ON OUR
WAY BOYZ steadied when a foe crossed in front nearing the five-eighths then dropped back, saved ground for most of the turn then moved to the two path,
came under a drive in upper stretch and also failed to rally. MOVING PICTURES was taken up when put in tight nearing the five-eighths, saved ground on
the turn, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. SPETTRO bumped with an opponent at the start, settled
off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MOON HUNTER settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn and
failed to respond. RAW COURAGE was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and was no factor.
ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, moved in near the five-eighths, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and faltered.
