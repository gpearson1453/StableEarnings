Footnotes
CHIEF GOVERNOR was crowded at the start, unhurried early, rallied around the second turn, bid five wide and wore down his rivals to get up near the wire.
STABILITY pressed three across to the backstretch, vied to the turn, assumed command, drew clear and was caught in the final strides. ROYAL JOKER
pressed the pace while racing between horses to the backstretch, vied to the turn, fell back, finished evenly and held safely for show. M T S RUNNER was
unhurried early, saved ground to the second turn, angled out for the drive and closed well. ETHAN broke in and failed to menace in an even effort.
ACCELERATION went four across on the first turn, stalked the pace and had nothing left for the drive. PRIVATE TRAX led around the first turn, fell back to
stalk inside to the second turn, tired and gave way. DYNAMIC WOMAN saved ground mid pack and was through after a half. E. Z. PAPA broke in, raced
wide and had nothing left for the drive. R U TIZZIN' ME veered out at the start and trailed the field.

ROVER was unhurried early, saved ground to the second turn, angled out, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. SHANGHAI MIKE vied to the upper
stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and settled for show. HOLD ME ONLY was unhurried early, went widest in the drive and finished well. BEAR BRIAN
raced close to the pace along the inside, rallied between horses into the turn to loom a threat, weakened and faded. KING LEBRON vied between horses,
tired on the turn and gave way. TRUST MANDO advanced to the second turn, had nothing left and did not threaten. HESA PROSPECTOR vied inside, tired
into the turn and stopped.

WREXHAM raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide, bid and hung. CRIMSON T. advanced on the turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and failed to rally. STORMING PEACE advanced on the turn, bid and came up empty. SINGING DELIGHT showed speed to the turn,
was carried out and gave way. SUERTUDA broke slowly and was not a factor. OUR ISLAND GIRL broke slowly and was outrun. SALLY STANFORD
pressed the pace along the inside, was through early and stopped. WHO'STHATGIRL was eased and walked off.
