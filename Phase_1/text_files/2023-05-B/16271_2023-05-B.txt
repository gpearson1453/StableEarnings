Footnotes
CRUNCH B B B Away well, vied for the lead along the rail, angled to the three path, kicked clear into the lane, widened while kept to the whip to the
sixteenths pole and then wrapped up late for the win. KHALI BULLET Bobbled at the start, five wide into the turn, three path out of it and finished well to
earn the place. GREEK EASTER Vied for the lead along the three path, two path midway around, chased and missed the place. BUSTER BURNS Four
wide on the turn and hung. WESWORLD Lagged back five wide and failed to be a factor. TIZA BROWN Broke sluggishly, close up along the rail to the lane
and tired. SHE SPEAKS WELL Checked at the start, lagged back, checked at the top of the lane and tired. CHEF PETER JULIEN Broke sluggishly, saved
ground and tired. BUD HAYDEN Vied between early and tired along the three path.
