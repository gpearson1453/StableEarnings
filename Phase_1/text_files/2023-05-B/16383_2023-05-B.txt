while in the four or five path then could not hold the winner safe while second best. ACE REPORTER chased the pace from the three path through the turn
and finished evenly. ZUPITA set the pace on a clear lead into late turn, continued with the lead into the lane then yielded to the others. UNBRIDLED FOX
never a threat while in the two path through the turn and into the lane. CATCHAFALLNSTAR trailed into the turn while in the two path, angled into the seven

Footnotes
TAPERINEA raced in the two path, bid at the three-eighths pole, angled to the four path in the stretch, bid and was in time under steady urging. BLOODY
MARY MORNIN pressed the pace in the four path, bid at the half-mile mark, vied, was clear in the stretch but was caught. PRESCIENCE was unrushed and
rallied belatedly five wide. MIZZEN ASH raced inside, rallied between foes at the three-eighths pole but couldn't close late. AMAZING GAL pressed the
pace between foes before fading. Z ZS RED raced evenly in the four path. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY stalked the pace five wide, bid at the half-mile mark,
then faltered. BREWSKY led inside, then gave way in the stretch. VOODOO JUSTICE saved ground to no avail. CHINATOWN NANCY was not a factor.
FASHION DIVA pressed the pace in the three path before giving way on the far turn.

Footnotes
JUANCHO cleared early while in the two path into the turn, was put under pressure in mid-turn, vied for the lead into the lane, was on near even terms with
an eighth to go then re-cleared through the final sixteenth. FOREVER LASTING chased the winner into the turn, moved to press into the lane, vied to the
eighth pole then could not keep up late and just lasted for the place spot. COWBOY IMAGE was along the inside into the turn, guided off the inside after
mid-turn, bid into the lane from the three path and showed good energy to the wire to just miss the place spot. TANEYCOMO raced in the three path
through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the four path then flattened out late. NINE POINTER trailed into the lane while saving ground,
continued along the rail through the lane and gained belatedly. REITERATION never a factor while saving ground. LANTANA STAR was in the three path
through the turn and tired. STICKER chased the pace along the inside through the turn then faded through the lane. SKY HIGH FIVE never a factor while in
the four path through the turn. DOC BENNETT raced in the or four path through the turn and was empty through the lane.
