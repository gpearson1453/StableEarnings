Footnotes
KERICS BEAUTY settled on the rail in the middle of the field down the backstretch, began picking up rivals inside with five sixteenths remaining, angled out
to the four path for the stretch drive and wore down the loose frontrunner in deep stretch for the win. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY took command from the start,
set a soft pace taking the field down the backstretch, opened up turning for home and was caught late just missing out in the end. BEQUIA tracked the
pacesetter in the two path going into the first turn, was outside keeping a close eye on the frontrunner with a half remaining, was slowly gaining on the
leader through the lane between horses but could not find more in deep stretch to pose a threat for the win. TARA LUNA travelled in mid pack throughout,
was urged on the final turn and showed some late interest picking up the pieces in the stretch drive to get a minor role. HALLANVAARA was allowed to
settle near the back into the first turn, saved ground through the backside, continued to skim the rail on the far turn and passed a weary runner down the
lane. CHROME'S ANGEL had a good position tracking the leaders outside under a snug hold down the back straight, was ridden to go after the frontrunners
midpoint on the far turn, offered little response and faded in upper stretch. MUM'S THE WORD trailed the pack in the early stages of the race, was urged
with three furlongs left to run, lost touch with the field on the far turn and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
JUNGLE TIGRESS had a good position watching the top pair at the half, rallied up the fence midway on the turn, shifted out three wide turning for home and
was full of run down the lane to win comfortably at the wire. EYE GOT IT GOOD hopped at the start to be near the rear down the back straight on the rail,
advanced inside with three furlongs left to run, split foes angling out to the three path at the quarter marker and closed belatedly to be second best at the
finish. CASTLETON tracked on the rail in the second flight in the early stages, kept pace with the leaders running on the turn and showed late stretch
energy inside to finish up well to capture the show award. BIG BANG BLUE had a slow start to be near the back in the beginning stages of the race, could
still see most of the field racing on the turn and found her best stride late finishing up well to get a small share of the prize crossing the line. FOREST VIXEN
took command from the start, put away an early outside foe midway on the turn, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and stopped in the final seventy
yards losing a few positions nearing the wire. GENTLE SEAS travelled outside in the middle stalking the leaders, offered a mild run three wide at the three
furlong marker and stalled in the six path in upper stretch. SAKE AND SUSHI pressed the issue two wide down the backside, was scrubbed on the keep
pace up front three eighths from the prize and yielded turning for home. HI AST POWER was void of early speed outside to trail at the half, made little
headway running on the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY settled in the middle of the pack in the beginning, could not
match strides with rivals through the turn, was pushed out some entering the stretch and faded at the furlong marker.

FORTYFIVESEVENTY tracked in the two path down the backside, made an early move to get a good position entering the turn, contested for the lead
outside five sixteenths from home, battled three wide with rivals on either side at the top of the lane and stubbornly prevailed with a good finish the final
furlong. BEDAZZLE ME was content to trail the field down the back straight, took up the chase on the rail three furlongs out, waited patiently for a seam
inside through the turn, burst through four wide to bid between foes in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final eighth and had to settle for the runners up
share. FRIENDS FOR LIFE tracked four wide outside horses at the half, travelled three wide on the turn keeping pace with the top pair outside, was pushed
out widest to the five path turning for home and finished evenly in the stretch to be a clear third. TIPSY MOON led the field down the backstretch, was
headed outside by the eventual winner three furlongs from the finish, was battling stubbornly on the rail at the top of the lane and gave way in the final
furlong. UMNEYAAT tracked three wide between rivals down the backside, was shuffled back to trail this compact field at the three eighths pole and could
not find another gear at the quarter marker to pose a threat for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BOXER BRIEF settled off the pace, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, made a sustained rally while drifting in a bit in mid- to late-stretch and edged past
late. SWATH moved forward and clear to set the pace, soon faced pressure from an outside rival up the backstretch and on the turn, came out a bit turning
for home, kicked clear by mid-stretch, drifted out just a bit soon after, was outkicked by the winner but a clear second. LOMAKI FORCE angled in after the
start settling at the back, saved some ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch for room, had to alter outside runners near the sixteenth pole and kicked
on to just get up for third. VICTORY MARCH broke a step slowly and in a bit tight, pulled through between rivals to a forward position, pressed the leader
two to three wide into the turn, floated four wide into upper stretch, evened out and lost show honors late. LOVE THE GAME bobbled at the break, raced off
the pace inside, angled five wide into the stretch, kept on evenly late. BODIE moved forward inside to track the leading pair, saved ground early on the turn,
shifted four wide coming out of that bend, took aim on the leader, ran on somewhat evenly but steadied on heels about the sixteenth. GUNGI tossed the
head and was in tight at the start, raced in the back half of the field off the rail, was never near enough to threaten. STUBBORN STREAK raced outside foes
toward the rear and failed to menace. NOVA FOLHA stalked the leaders from outside into the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch, dropped back and
faded. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was quite hard to load, steadily retreated. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BODIE AGAINST SWATH
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
OCTOBER FROST was bumped into a rival at the start then bounced around between foes a few strides after, shifted in and had to tap on the brakes a bit
early on the first turn racing in behind rivals inside, settled soon after, shifted five wide beginning past the five-sixteenths to the top of the stretch, engaged
the leader putting a head in front a furlong out, edged away late. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY was caught outside four wide into the first turn off the leader,
advanced with those runners on the pacesetter four to five deep up the backstretch racing just off the latter into the far turn, moved to the fore nearing the
quarter pole taking a narrow lead, was challenged near the eighth pole, yielded only grudgingly late. TRINITY PARK settled off the pace shifting in just
outside a rival two to three wide early, raced in behind off the leaders up the backstretch, came out six wide for the drive and kicked on late to secure show
honors. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE was forced out and into a rival at the start then exchanged a bump soon after, raced forwardly three wide then advanced
on the leader midway up the backstretch taking closer order four deep and between runners, dropped back from the seven-sixteenths, fanned eight wide for
the drive and kept on late to improve position. SPRING MOUNTAIN was bumped at the start then bumped a rival soon after, moved forward pulling keenly
to draw clear and shift in setting the pace just off the rail, was pressured nearing the half, weakened in the stretch. BET N WIN veered out at the break
brushing the gate and forcing a rival out, had forward position but content to rate off the early lead inside, advanced outside that one up the backstretch to
press from the nine-sixteenths, bid between runners coming to the three-eighths, had a narrow lead briefly on the turn but was overtaken by the quarter
pole, had no extra for the drive. MISTER MESEEKS was unhurried at the rear racing inside and never near enough to threaten.

AMBER LIGHT dragged the rider to lead, put away early challengers midway on the turn, opened up on the field at the top of the stretch and held safe at the
finish line. UPTOWN LIGHTS travelled in midfield three off the fence down the backside, split runners rallying two wide with three furlongs remaining, angled
to the inside turning for home and offered a good finish besting the rest in the end. AGILE DANCER was unhurried early trailing down the backstretch,
began to lengthen his stride three wide with three eighths remaining, rallied four wide around foes midpoint on the turn and was gaining with every jump
running in the six path to the wire. SOVEREIGN CAUSE had a good spot behind the engaging threesome at the half, rallied three wide at the quarter
marker, was four deep in upper stretch and finished up one paced in the final sixteenth. LITTLE DOMI stalked in the middle of the pack on the rail, advanced
on the fence through the turn, shifted outside three deep off fading runners as they turned for home and could not make an impact to the finish. IGNITE THE
STORM tracked four wide in the beginning, put in a mild run when urged at the three furlong marker and could not get involved when they straightened out
for the drive to the wire. NITEINSHININGARMOR was situated near the rear three wide on the back straight, trailed the field entering the turn and passed
tired runners down the stretch. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER broke a little tardy, pressed for the lead inside from the half to midway on the turn and backed
away through the field on the fence at the top of the lane. AIR FORCE RESERVE forced the issue up front between rivals at the half, continued to fight for
the top spot with five sixteenths to go and stopped in upper stretch. CHICAGO FREDDY started a touch slow to begin, stalked near the back of the field at
the half, could not get involved running on the turn and was a non factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
THREE SONNY SIDEUP had a short lead in the early going, scooted away from the chasing rival at the five sixteenths marker, was headed outside by
multiple challengers at the furlong pole and determinedly dug in to win the nod for the narrow victory at the line. SILENT FORTUNE hounded the pace in the
beginning, was then ridden midpoint on the turn to go after the winner who opened up a touch through the turn, bid three wide at the top of the lane and
battled to the wire stubbornly only to lose the nod at the wire in a gutsy stretch effort. MORSTACHY'S was allowed to settle trailing the field down the
backstretch, began to pick up horses outside with three furlongs left to run, showed a good burst of speed circling five wide at the quarter pole to loom the
threat in upper stretch and stalled the final sixteenth. SMART SKY had a good spot tracking the top pair three wide into the turn, threatened four wide when
they straightened out for the drive but needed more in the final eighth to be a major player in the end. RENEGADE SERENADE was two deep near the rear
at the half mile marker, made little impression running through the turn and could not reach contention down the lane. CANDY STREET travelled near the
rear on the rail in the early going, advanced inside at the half, looked good waiting behind the winner for a seam at the quarter marker and came up empty in
the drive to the line.

Footnotes
DO THE GRIDDY pressured the lead outside off the frontrunners flank with four furlongs to go, was gaining three wide at the furlong marker while never
switching leads in the stretch and began to edge away in the final strides. PIDIN set the fractions in the early parts of the race, still led the way at the top of
the stretch, continued to fight on with an eighth remaining and gave way grudgingly very late. TORY'S HOLIDAY broke out to start, sat off the contesting
pair only a few lengths behind into the turn, angled out to split rivals four wide turning for home and finished up with run to just miss getting up for the place
award. BOSTON BAY was in a good position sitting behind the engaging duo at the three furlong marker, found a seam on the fence straightening out for
the drive, lost his path at the sixteenth pole, shifted out some and held on for a minor role in the end. HARPER CITY was off slowly to begin, settled on the
rail in midfield down the back straight, crept up the rail through the turn, angled out to the three path at the furlong marker and offered a good finish in the
end to be beaten not that far for it all in the end. TAYBO had a good spot tracking the top pair three wide at the half, was coaxed for more run midway on the
turn, turning for home was in with a chance five wide and finished up evenly in the last eighth. ARAMOS was bumped at the start, stalked four deep at the
half, travelled four wide outside horses on the turn, shifted out in mid stretch to the seven path and closed the gap between him and the leaders in the late
stages of the race. STORMIN DAVE was situated near the back in the early stages of the race, saved ground on the turn, chose to shift five wide turning for
home and never threatened but showed interest taking closer order to the leaders at the finish. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was bumped on the break to trail the
field in the beginning, could not get into gear throughout the turn and was never a menace finishing down the stretch. QUIET SPEED settled in the middle of
the pack three wide down the backside, was hard ridden three wide at the three furlong marker, could not quicken with rivals and tired at the top of the lane.
IT'S ME MARIO was three wide with runners on either side in mid pack, made little change in position throughout the turn and had nothing to show running
in the stretch.
