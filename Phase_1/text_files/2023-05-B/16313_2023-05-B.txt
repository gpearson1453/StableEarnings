Footnotes
PREVENT vied for the lead in the four path early, stuck a head in front while under a ride in the three path passing the quarter, floated out to the five path
into the lane, and inched clear in the final furlong. PRAISEWORTHY led along the inside into the turn, was coaxed when headed nearing the quarter, ran on
while remaining inside down the stretch, but was second best. ZAINO bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the five path, took aim
while under right handed urging in the seven path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. ZINGALES KING was hustled in midpack around the six path
early, under a drive in the five path around the turn, tipped back out to the six path into the lane, but was one paced. MANHATTAN BOY bumped with an
inner foe at the start, chased in the five path, received right handed cues between foes around the turn, was in the four path entering the stretch, but
flattened. TITAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed from the four path into the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, but was no factor.
ALWAYS ON CAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the seven path early and did not threaten. ARIUS had a hesitant start,
tracked in the three path but faded into the stretch. KINGY stalked in the two path but gaveway around the turn. BACK WARRIOR'S got pinched at the start
and never menaced while wellback along the rail.

Footnotes
NATURAL VIBES vied between foes in the three path, could not keep pace with TIK TOKABLE late on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, re-bid
outside and was up late. TIK TOKABLE was fractious in the gate, was pinched back at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead
nearing the quarter pole, drew clear turning for home and led until deep stretch. CORPORATE AFFAIR dueled inside of the top two in the two path, could
not keep pace leaving the five-sixteenths marker but stayed on to hold the show. TRAVEL GUIDE bumped TIK TOKABLE at the start then failed to menace
while racing four wide. KING ZAM hit the starting gate, trailed inside, went in the three path around the turn and never threatened. STEEL HAWK bumped at
the start, then had only brief speed two wide. UNSTOPPABLE APPEAL chased the pace from the rail and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS settled up close in the four path, bid under a nudge rounding the far turn, took the lead just before the quarter, was cued from the five
path at the top of the stretch, and drew clear. SHE FLED THE SCENE travelled in the four path around the first turn and rated from out in the six path down
the backside, was under right handed urging in the four path around the far turn, tipped back out to the six path into the lane, and ran on for place. GOLDEN
VOICE set the pace in the three path, was cued right handed when headed midway around the far turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter, was in the three
path entering the stretch, and evened out for show. CRICKET WEST stalked in the two path, shifted out to the four path while under a ride into the lane, but
flattened. KAEKO had her head turned at the start, trailed in the two path, tipped to rail into the far turn, but did not threaten. SHORT CIRCUIT tracked in the
five path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS WAVE stalked the pace three wide, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. ACTING raced in range four wide and ran on to be
clearly second best. ACQUIRED TASTE pressed the pace two wide, took the led between foes near the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with
the winner in upper stretch and held well enough to save the show. EMPIRE GIRL raced off the pace three wide and improve position in the lane.
LUMINANT chased the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY failed to menace while racing three wide.
KRAZYKATKOUSIN set the pace inside and tired in the lane. SHE IS ROYALTY was outrun inside. MARPIN raced four wide and made little impact
appearing to try to get out throughout.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC PHAROAH led from the three path into the turn, opened up under a nudge early around the turn, was kept to task from the two path down the
stretch, and held sway. RUNAWAY TOM got bumped between foes at the start, chased in the five path, was ridden around the turn, remained in the five
path entering the lane, and kept on for place. DUKE SKYWALKER was pushed along while in range along the inside early, dropped back to last and was
under right handed urging around the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch to get up for show. ACTION DREAM bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked
in the four path, was roused from the five path passing the three eighths pole, was cued left handed while in the four path entering the lane, but flattened.
ALLAGASH RUN bumped an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path into the turn and did not threaten. TI SENTO (IRE) broke well and
prompted the early pace from the three path into the turn, but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
FACE THE MUSIC set the pace in the two path and held sway under a drive. LOVE RHAPSODY prompted the winner in the three path, angled to the rail in
upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but lasted for the place. ONE SMOKIN' RITA raced off the pace four wide, angled eight wide in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead, closed outside and just missed second. NO ACTION raced in range five wide between foes and was one-paced through the lane.
RAGGEDY chased the pace six wide and lacked the needed rally. HOT FOOT SUSIE was fractious in the gate then raced evenly inside. MARILYN failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. APACHE RIDE hopped at the start then bumped PREEMPTION, saved ground and played no further factor.
PREEMPTION was bumped at the start, raced up close four wide between foes and came up empty in the lane.

GITANA bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the three path, bid under a nudge and took the lead midway around the turn, was roused and
opened up from the three path into the stretch, and held sway under a drive. BARBARA prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed midway around the
turn, under right handed urging from the four path into the lane, and chased home the winner for place. RAIN chased in the two path, tipped to the rail and
was cued early around the turn, angled out to the seven path into the lane, and stayed on for show. RASMALAI bumped with an outer foe at the start, was
sent along to set the pace in the two path, lost the lead while under a ride midway around the turn, and faded. SAMMY'S TOWN rated in the five path,
fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and did not threaten. TEE UP tracked in the three path, but dropped back early around the turn and was no
menace. MUDSHAFT got bumped on both sides at the start and was never involved around the five path.

IMONRA stalked the pace inside down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. FLAKES
set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and along the rail around the turn, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the final
furlong. KIKILOVE prompted the pace three wide, could not keep pace from the quarter pole and just lasted for the show. PRINCESS TENKO failed to
menace while racing four wide. SHILOH played no factor while racing three wide. PARTY FAVOR was outrun while racing two wide.

the first turn and raced in midpack around the five path down the backside, ranged up under coaxing in the four path around the far turn, bid from the five
path into the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole and got bumped by the inner pacesetter while doing so, ran on but was caught in the final strides to
place. KITTENZEN trailed in the seven path down the backstretch, circled inner rivals while under a drive around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path
into the lane, and kept on for show. NUMBER ONE GIRL hit the side of the gate leaving, was held up while in range from the three path, ridden around the
far turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. LA DAME DE FER settled in midfield around the three path, was driven along while
tipping to the rail early around the far turn, but was one paced in the stretch. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM set an open pace in the three path, was roused in the
two path early around the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch, lost the lead and bumped an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and faded. FORTUNATA
bobbled, then got pinched at the start, traveled off the pace in the six path but never threatened, was pulled up afterwards and walked off. SAYONARA
SISTER stalked in the four path but yielded turning into the lane. MY FIRST DATE tracked in the two path but backed up early around the far turn. BACK
