Footnotes
NOT AGAIN JACKIE moved up outside the leader to share the lead with five furlongs to go, was put to urging upper stretch and drew away inside the last
furlong to prove clearly best of the others. PACHI took the advantage nearing the end of the first sixteenth, maintained a slight lead in hand after being
challenged at the five-furlong marker, was roused leaving the bend, no match for NOT AGAIN JACKIE inside the final eighth, began to wear down in the
waning yards but lasted for the place. TWO COOKIE RULE broke on top, was soon chasing others from outside, took the bend three wide, gradually drifted
out upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong but finished evenly. READY REDDING fractious in the gate, hesitated at the break then made a large
leap from the gate, bore to the outside fence, was pulled up and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into READY REDDING'S start. After their review,
the stewards determined READY REDDING was prepared to race with the others when the gate opened and he remained a starter for wagering purposes.

Footnotes
KANITHAPPEN shared the early lead from inside, began to float out when let out on the bend, gradually drifted out as he widened command upper stretch,
continued to drift out in the late going but held sway under steady handling. SAFE moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, picked up his pace on the
turn, took over second inside the last eighth, made up ground on the leader late but came up short. WARNING LABEL bumped a couple times with
WINDIGO SPIRIT just after the start, moved to the outside early on, lost ground widest through the bend and gained with third eighty yards to go. HE'S A
FINE MAN prominent between rivals, took over second three wide on the turn, angled out some trying to keep a clear path upper stretch then gradually
wore down inside the final furlong. OKLAHOMA HEAT forwardly placed from outside, failed to keep up just off the rail on the bend, fanned out to path four
into the lane and had no late bid. WINDIGO SPIRIT fractious in the gate, broke on top then bumped a couple times with WARNING LABEL, was hustled
along to contest the pace between hoirses but gave way the last two furlongs. K T'S JILTED GROOM also fractious in the gate, hesitated at the start then
broke in air and was always outrun.

BIG SALLY broke somewhat slowly but moved up quickly between rivals to gain the lead before finishing the first sixteenth, soon moved clear, saved
ground, lengthened command under urging in the lane, began to wear down in the late going but kept MOON PIES IMAGE at bay. MOON PIES IMAGE
without early speed, was just off the rail taking the turn, altered out widest for a clear path upper stretch, made a strong move but came up short. SHINE
DOWN in contention early, was two wide on the bend then could only make up minor ground deep stretch. DRAGONFLY KISSES progressed from inside
on the turn, vied for second upper stretch but leveled off late. PRIMITY helped prompt the early pace but began to yield from path four on the bend. CESSO
prominent for a half mile, gave way from path three in the lane. DEWSHINE soon trailed and steadily faded from the rest after two furlongs.

Footnotes
I CAN'T TELL YA rated on the front end from inside, moved ahead when let out leaving the second turn, was under steady urging in the stretch and was
clearly the best. FUTURE VISION bumped at the break, was kept close three wide, commenced his bid on the second bend, moved clear for second and
angled in some upper stretch, loomed a serious threat inside the last eighth but began to wear down in the waning yards. GEORGE'S VISION reluctant to
load into the gate, was settled well off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, saved ground taking the second turn, angled to the outside upper
stretch, drifted out further going to the furlong marker, kept a straight path the final eighth, closed well, just missed for second but was easily best of the rest.
VIVA VIOLENCE vied for the early lead just outside I CAN'T TELL YA, did not keep up leaving the second turn, angled out some for a clear path upper
stretch and steadily yielded. HIGH LIFE AGAIN advanced from inside on the backstretch, closed the gap from just off the rail on the second bend, moved
out four wide upper stretch but had little to offer. RIP IT RYAN broke inward, bumping FUTURE VISION, was void of speed though hustled along, stayed
well off the inside nearly all the way and showed little. BULU displayed brief speed four wide but steadily once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SOCIETY set the pace from inside, moved clear when asked on the bend, lengthened command under urging in the lane and was kept to task
until the final strides. THAT'S A BIRD moved to the inside at the half mile pole, rallied along the rail after four furlongs and took over second nearing the
wire. THERE RUNS MARY pressed MIDNIGHT SOCIETY from just outside, floated out some into the stretch, was no match for the leader and weakened
the last furlong. RAIN ATTACK prominent outside THERE RUNS MARY for a half mile, flattened out for the drive. WILDWOOD'S WILDCAT bore out at the
break, was checked, advanced from outside the first two furlongs, leveled off from path three on the turn and faded widest in the stretch. PACKAGE DEAL
moved toward the outside early on, was just off the inside on the bend and had little to offer in the lane. THIS IS ANFIELD soon trailed and showed little.
There was a stewards' inquiry into WILDWOOD'S WILDCAT. After their review, it was determined WILDWOOD'S WILDCAT was prepared to break with the
rest of the field and was declared a valid starter.

UPBEAT MELODY broke in stride and soon took the inside, showed the way in hand, was let out some on the bend, asked with two furlongs to go, widened
his lead under urging in the stretch and was kept to task until the last seventy yards. TONYS MORNING LINE chased from just off the inside, swung out four
wide for a clear path into the lane, was forced out briefly upper stretch, took over second with a furlong to go, could not close the gap on the leader but was
clearly best of the others. CHICKS FOR FREE appeared to bobble slightly a few strides from the gate, was taken outside early on, lost ground widest
through the bend, forced out some to avoid TONYS MORNING LINE nearing the furlong marker and passed tired rivals late. MAC PANDOWDY chased
from inside, came off the rail some entering the lane, gained a striking position upper stretch but could not sustain his bid inside the last furlong. FULL
MAGAZINE was hustled along outside UPBEAT MELODY on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn and drifted out as he began to fade between
horses in the stretch.

Footnotes
AIKEN TO BE TAKIN rated from inside, waited for room on the bend, got through two wide with a quarter mile to go, fanned out to path three, moved ahead,
was challenged from inside then outside also after entering the final furlong and narrowly held on. MINI DRESS was away somewhat slowly, steadily
progressed from inside to vie for the lead inside the last eighth, drifted out some under left-handed pressure deep stretch and had to settle for second.
AMARI S. gradually angled in as she vied for the early lead, was two wide on the turn, drifted out some leaving the bend, came again four wide to dispute
the pace inside the final furlong and leveled off in the waning yards. ZENCHUA SKY hesitated at the start, was settled at the back, angled in on the turn,
moved out five wide upper stretch, made a strong move in the late going, was too late but easily best of the rest. FILLY FROM ILLY vied for the early lead
between horses, gained the rail and moved clear on the bend, floated out some into the lane and began to wear down. LORI ATTACK prominent between
rivals, was steadied slightly and altered out at the half mile marker, four wide on the turn, checked hard off ARNEIS' heels nearing the quarter pole and had
little for the stretch run. DIAMOND GUCCI was an early factor between rivals but faded before finishing three furlongs. ARNEIS forwardly placed between
horses, was three wide on the turn, sustain an injury approaching the quarter pole, was pulled up and vanned off.
