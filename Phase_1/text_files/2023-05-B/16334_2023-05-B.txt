Footnotes
KING DOODLE was checked when his path was taken at the half mile marker, altered out, went for the lead three wide on the bend, battled on even terms
inside WILDWOOD MINISTRY, was brushed and bumped by the latter several times inside the last furlong but edged ahead in the waning yards.
WILDWOOD MINISTRY a step slow at the break, angled out to path four to commence his bid on the turn, engaged KING DOODLE upper stretch, tried
repeatedly to lug in inside the last eighth, brushed and jostled with the latter several times, did not have enough late but was easily second best. VALIENTE
CLAYMORE vied for the early lead outside DURANGO CHROME, angled in beside the latter at the half mile pole, angled in some nearing the two furlong
marker and gave way the final furlong. DURANGO CHROME displayed early speed from inside, was kept in tight quarters along the rail on the bend, was
checked when his path narrowed nearing the quarter pole, swung out to path five into the lane and had no late bid. LAGRUE moved up to contention from
inside on the turn but faded the final two furlongs. LELAND JOHN steadily gave way from outside once on the bend. The rider of DURANGO CHROME
lodged an objection alleging interference from VALIENTE CLAYMORE. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

DUCKDEVIL advanced between rivals to share the lead on the backstretch, gained the rail on the second turn, battled in the lane, shook free inside the last
eighth and maintained control in the waning yards. PAYNT BY LETTERS bore out through the first bend, was taken into control on the backstretch,
progressed from outside to vie for the lead outside DUCKDEVIL on the second bend, fought in the stretch, did not have enough left inside the last eighth but
was easily best of the rest. MARCHING ORDERS well placed from inside, did not keep up after a half mile, gradually angled out through the second turn,
came into the stretch from path four and ran evenly the rest of the way. DRAGGING MAIN raced in contention toward the outside from the beginning but
began to yield outside MARCHING ORDERS the last two furlongs. UNCLE O. G. displayed early speed just off or along the rail but gave way from inside
after five furlongs.

PRINCE OF MAYHEM broke alertly, was rated on the front end from inside, roused on the second bend, floated out to path three into the lane and gradually
opened up under urging. WILLOW RIDGE bumped at the start, pressed PRINCE OF MAYHEM from just outside, proved no match for that one when set
down for the drive but was easily second best. JOHNNY LONGBOAT chased from between rivals, commenced hid bid along the rail on the second turn and
edged out SOME DUDE for third late. SOME DUDE progressed from outside on the backstretch, moved clear for third from path three on the second bend,
floated out further into the stretch, was all out trying to keep the show but did not have enough left in the waning yards. AMERICAN SUCCESS showed little.
KRAMDEN broke outward, bumped WILLOW RIDGE, was steadied and gave way from inside with a half mile to go.

Footnotes
FRANKEL BABY gradually angled in as she vied for the early lead from outside, was in path two on the bend, floated out further entering the lane, drew
clear under urging and held sway under steady handling. BACKSTAGE BAMBI raced in the second from just off the inside, swung out behind BLAME TERI
into the stretch, angled to the inside approaching the final furlong, took over second inside the last eighth, closed the gap in the waning yards but was too
late. BLAME TERI hesitated at the break, progressed between horses to vie for the lead outside FRANKEL BABY with two furlongs to go but leveled off tor
the drive. MISS DUTTON without early speed, picked up her pace from inside on the bend, fanned out to path three into the lane and showed a willingness
to run late from between rivals. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC soon trailed, gradually angled out through the turn and passed between a couple tired rivals in the
stretch. LITTLE ACCOUNT broke on top, began to retreat from between horses midway on the backstretch, altered out for a clear path approaching the half
mile marker and soon gave way. HALLIE'S RAINBOW displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
EL RAYO outrun from inside on the backstretch, picked up his pace on the bend, squeezed through along the rail at the top of the lane, was jostled from the
rear just after entering the final furlong, turned outward from WESLAN'S impact, gained the advantage approaching the sixteenth marker and drifted out
slightly as he edged ahead the last sixteenth. U S HONOUR NAP forwardly placed between rivals, went for the lead two wide on the turn, was forced out
some into the lane, came in slightly midstretch, battled for the advantage, began to yield some approaching the sixteenth pole and gradually angled out to
keep a clear path outside EL RAYO in the waning yards. I'M YOUR VALENTINE was taken outside early on, lost considerable ground four to six wide
through the bend, progressed widest in the stretch, could not close the gap on the top pair the last eighth but got up for third near the wire. WESLAN
gradually angled in on the backstretch, was steadied nearing the half mile pole when his path was taken, had the rail on the turn, swung out to path three
entering the lane, altered in some to gain a clear path at the eighth pole, tried to force his way in a narrow opening between EL RAYO and U S HONOUR
NAP, bumped repeatedly with the rear of EL RAYO inside the furlong marker, was checked hard and steadied while boxed in, gained a clear path along the
rail with a sixteenth left and narrowly missed for the show. SKIP AWAY CARTER in the second early, went for the lead four wide on the bend, fanned out
further into the stretch, edged ahead upper stretch but could not sustain his bid in the late going. BLEEDING BLUE rushed up from outside to contest the
pace, was three then four wide taking the turn and began to fade from between rivals at the top of the stretch. B G ATTACK gradually angled in as he vied
for the early lead, had the rail on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, began to yield, was checked behind WESLAN at the eighth pole and
continued to fade. The rider of WESLAN lodged an objection alleging interference from EL RAYO leaving the eighth pole. After their review, the stewards
did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE in hand early, shared the lead from outside on the backstretch, was roused three wide with two furlongs to go and moved clear
approaching the last sixteenth. YOU'RE IN COREY soon shared the lead outside EVERLOVINGHAND, came into the lane from path three and slowly wore
down approaching the final sixteenth. DIAMOND DAVE settled inside, commenced his bid leaving the second bend and found best stride too late along the
rail. EVERLOVINGHAND displayed early speed from inside, floated out some entering the stretch, gradually began to yield and was drifting out in the
waning yards. VIOLENZA D'ORO chased from just off the inside, saved ground taking the second turn, fanned out some into the lane, advanced to
midstretch, leveled off inside the final furlong and angled out to keep a clear path in the waning yards. BLAZEN ROAD chased the early speed from outside,
was just off the rail on the second bend, swung out for the stretch run and gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S BELLAMY TIME pressed from just off the inside, gained the rail into the bend, began to drift out leaving the turn, came into the lane from path four and
shook off MY LITTLE TIPSY inside the final sixteenth. PEACOCK MAN progressed from inside, came off the rail at the top of the lane, began to angle out
further approaching the eighth pole, his rider looked back at the furlong marker, rallied under a drive inside the final furlong and caught MY LITTLE TIPSY
for second nearing the wire. MY LITTLE TIPSY broke inward, jostled with FIXICO, advanced between rivals to vie for the lead three wide on the bend, was
forced out into the stretch and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. STOSH in contention between horses, advanced two wide on the turn, altered
outside PITAMAN approaching the quarter pole, was forced out by that one shortly after that, came into the stretch from the middle of the track and ran
evenly the rest of the way. FIXICO jostled with MY LITTLE TIPSY at the start, progressed two wide on the bend, drifted out at the quarter pole, was steadied
off PITAMAN'S heels, altered in, gradually angled out to gain a clear path upper stretch, was checked hard behind LINE OF DENHAMS at the furlong pole,
veered inward and finished evenly. FRONTANA chased from outside, lost ground through the turn, came into the lane seven wide, was checked sharply to
avoid the fallen rider midstretch, also veered inward and finished evenly as well. CRAPS SHOOTER broke in stride, was overtaken from outside at the end
of the first furlong, gave way from between horses with three furlongs to go and was steadied behind FRONTANA deep stretch. PITAMAN made a slight
leap from the gate, rushed up to gain the lead at the end of the first eighth, began to fade two wide before finishing a half mile, began to drift out at the
quarter pole, steadily gave way, also veered in to avoid the fallen rider midstretch, was eased the rest of the way and walked off. LINE OF DENHAMS soon
trailed, advanced from inside on the bend, gradually angled out upper stretch trying to gain a clear path, clipped PEACOCK MAN'S heels nearing the eighth
pole, lost his rider, finished the race and was walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run. After their review, PEACOCK MAN was
disqualified and left unplaced for coming out into LINE OF DENHAMS' path without being clear of that one.
