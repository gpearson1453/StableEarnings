Footnotes
LUCKENBACHER broke in the air but quickly recovered to prompt the pace three and four wide, challenged outside PRAIRIE SQUALL through the far turn,
then dueled that one through the lane and surged late to be narrowly up at the wire. PRAIRIE SQUALL gained the early lead to establish position inside,
was pressed throughout, dug in as the winner challenged nearing the lane to duel to the end but came up short. SPEEDY FELLAR tracked from between
rivals to the far turn and weakened. GONE PREACHIN leaned into the side of the gate to get away last, stalked inside, angled four wide nearing the lane but
had no rally.

SWEETNESS TO was in reach of the pace three to four wide to move closer into the lane, responded when set down and rallied clear under urging. GIVE
EM SHADE made the pace on a short lead inside to edge back clear into the lane but could not contain the winner's late run. POPS GIRL ALEXA dropped
off the pace three to four wide and made a late run to gain the show. SLOOPY HANG ON was just off the pace four, then three wide and weakened into the
lane. TALLANDLONG prompted the pace outside GIVE EM SHADE to the far turn and weakened. BEAUTIFUL JUDGE saved ground and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
S C ANGEL showed the most early speed to gain inside position, made the pace then angled out nearing the lane to about the four path and held safe
under steady handling. AUNT IRENE moved two and three wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn then could not go with that one in the lane while
clearly best of the others. STARLIGHT TWIST was slow into stride to drop off the early pace saving ground, angled four wide nearing the lane moved up
while not a threat. HARLONS COMMISION forced the pace outside the winner to the far turn and faded in the lane. NINA EN FUEGO was not a factor.

the closing sixteenth. CHARACTER COUNTS was on the pace three and four wide to edge clear into the lane but could not hold the winner late. MISS JET
rallied four wide into the far turn to move up and continued on to gain the show while unable to reach the top pair. CHAMA saved ground back off the pace,
angled out into the lane and rallied late. SPITFIRE SUZIE was with the leaders three to four wide to the far turn and faded in the drive. EXODUS AND
HOPE moved up four and five wide with a bid into the far turn and could not sustain the run. PIZZA GIRL drifted out into the first turn while showing speed
and tired.
