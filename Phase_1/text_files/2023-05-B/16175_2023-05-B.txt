Footnotes
WILSON Q set the pace outside of a vying rival, clung to an advantage in the long duel through midstretch, edged ahead entering the final sixteenth, and
held from an outer bidder. GOLD SWEEP bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased the leaders from the two path, tipped out to the five path entering
the lane, rallied to offer a late bid approaching the wire but missed. WORKS FOR ME vied along the inside, prolonged the battle through midstretch, but
yielded in the final sixteenth. STORMQUIST was hustled to press the top pair into the turn, but gave way entering the lane. TRAILING MONSTER bumped
with an outer foe upon leaving the gates, lacked speed two wide and between horses, tucked to the rail at the three furlong pole, and failed to menace
thereafter. RHYME SCHEMES chased four wide and faded. TOP OF THE STREET made little impact. THE RUSH IS ON was outrun. EARLY MUNNY
saved ground off of the pace, but weakened after shifting out entering the lane.

Footnotes
A LITTLE BIT CRAZY tracked four wide, ranged up to the clear leader from the three path turning for home to bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch,
then edged clear in the final sixteeenth. PUGLIA tugged along the inside while pursuing behind the leader, but failed to sustain forward position entering the
turn, lacked a response to urging around the bend, yet ran on through the lane, and gained place from an outer rival in the closing stages. BEACH KITTEN
set a clear pace into the turn, met a challenge nearing the lane, got headed in upper stretch, kept on through midstretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole.
TRIBAL SPIRIT trailed in the four path entering the turn, and moved up while hanging on her left lead. FAST GAL bumped with an outer rival at the start,
chased two wide and between horses, emerged as the leader's closest pursuer into the turn, but steadily faded through the lane. FLORIS stalked three wide
and between horses, but yielded entering the turn, and continued to weaken therafter.

ODDSONTONY laid off of the pace three wide, rallied along with an inner ATKINS in midstretch to reel in the leader at the sixteenth pole, sparred with his
inner counterpart through the closing stages and prevailed. ATKINS tracked two wide and between horses, rallied with an outer ODDSONTONY to bid at
the sixteenth pole, dueled thereafter, but was outfinished. COWBOY VALUES set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, shook
free in upper stretch, but was worn down by a pair of outer rivals leaving the sixteenth pole. FROG TOWN laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped out
turning for home before spinning into the lane in the five path, but only managed to chase the leaders home mildly. DEVIL'S CAY broke a touch outwardly,
stalked three wide, bid outside of the leader turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, and faded late. BIG BEEMSTER trailed in the four to
five paths before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. CHAMBERS BAY pressed two wide and between horses, but weakened
along the inside leaving the three furlong pole. MISTER SHARPIE pulled along the inside, chased into the turn, steadied while being shuffled behind a
weakening CHAMBERS BAY inside the final three furlongs, and weakened.

Footnotes
FRIVOLE (FR) leaned outwardly while off a step slow, laid unhurried two wide, tipped five wide in upper stretch, then offered a good kick to drive past the
new leader nearing the final sixteenth and drew clear. ELLE EST FORTE pulled two wide and between horses before checking around the first turn, settled
into a tracking position soon after, smoothly tipped to the four path entering the lane to take aim on the leaders, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, but
shifted inwardly while forging an advantage at that juncture, then got outkicked by an outer on charging foe entering the final sixteenth. JOYFUL APPLAUSE
pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled in the three path and between horses coming to midstretch, but was herded inwardly while getting
outkicked by her outer counterpart at the furlong pole, and held show thereafter. LOVED REIKO bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the
pace, sustained stride after altering off of the rail at the furlong grounds, and gained fourth from between horses late. HAY STACK leaned outwardly while
slow away, raced at the rear along the inside while keen behind foes moving through upper stretch for the first time, settled entering the second turn, rallied
five wide and outside of foes around the final bend, but fanned seven wide entering the lane and leveled off. SWEETS MAKER set the pace along the
inside, vacated the rail while clinging to an advantage entering the lane, but was herded inwardly by outer foes at the furlong grounds while weakening.
SUCH SOUNDS was a bit antsy in the starting gate, then took mild contact from rivals on both sides at the start, stalked along the inside, attempted a rail
bid in upper stretch, but steadied hard when shut off by inwardly drifting rivals at the furlong grounds, and failed to recover. LA TOURISTA lacked speed
while five wide, then three wide around the second turn, attempted to advance four wide around teh far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
CHATON ROUGE was a bit crowded between horses at the start, raced at the rear two wide, then was outrun after taking the final turn in the five path.
QUEEN JUDITH was antsy awaiting the start, bumped an inner rival leaving the gates, tracked three wide, pressed approaching the far turn, but weakened
between horses turning for home. DIVINELY BOLT transferred contact from an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly between horses, but
steadied around the first turn, laid off of the pace three wide thereafter, but weakened. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

ICEATUDE lacked speed along the inside despite rider's urging down the backstretch, picked up stride three wide and between horses turning for home,
sustained a rally among foes four wide in midstretch, then drove past the outer leader at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. KUPP chased outside of the top
pair, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage while drifting to the five path in upper stretch, but was surpassed by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, then
lasted for place. WICKED SECRET lacked speed four wide, then rallied in the seven path in the final furlong, but was too late to reach place. RUN FOR
REAGAN pursued from midpack, inched closer in the four path turning for home, but drifted inwardly in upper stretch and chased evenly. SIPPICAN SHOP
broke slowly, lagged behind around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied between horses on her left lead as the pace collapsed. BOUDIN
pursued the top flight from the four to five path and gave way. MO MOVES vied along the inside, led around the turn, but was headed in upper stretch
before weakening through the final furlong. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY laid off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. ALL JOKES ASIDE vied two
wide, pressed around the turn, but weakened between horses through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead. SERGEANT COUNTZLER saved
ground off of the pace, altered course around a rival leaving the three sixteenths pole and failed to menace behind foes in the final furlong.
STAYINYOURLANE made little impact five wide. TIME TO MEDDLE tracked along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
KING'S OVATION established a loose advantage around the first turn, met a pair of outer challenges while well in hand turning for home, repelled those
foes and shaking free in upper stretch, then inched away in the final furlong. INTREPID HEART tracked two wide, loomed a danger outside of the top pair
around the far turn, but only managed to chase the clearing pace-setter through the lane, vied for place in the final furlong, and edged that position in the
final sixteenth. OUTLIER shifted outside of the leader around the first turn, stalked before bidding two wide around the far turn, turned for home between
horses, but was turned away by the leader in upper stretch, then lost place to his outer counterpart in the final sixteenth. ZOOMER laid off of the pace along
the inside, took closer order before tracking the leading trio around the far turn, but shifted out while failing to keep pace in upper stretch and lacked a bid.
ROMAN CENTURIAN trailed throughout without having pace to work with.

Footnotes
FANCY MARTINI tracked four wide, inched closer to press three wide into the far turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper
stretch, inched clear entering the final sixteenth, and held sway. ONE TIME MO rated off of the pace two wide, saved ground patiently around the far turn,
picked up stride in upper stretch, surpassed an inner rival before offering a rail bid in the final sixteenth, but flattened out while vying for place with an outer
BLISSFUL and prevailed for that position. BLISSFUL stalked along the inside, tipped four wide in upper stretch to take aim on the leaders, but only
managed to chase the clearing leader in the final furlong sparred for place with an inner ONE TIME MO late, but missed. UNDER ONE SKY settled far back
along the inside, took closer order down the backstretch, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on between horses to gain fourth in the late stages.
SHE'S GONE tracked three wide, bid two wide along with an outer FANCY MARTINI around the far turn, vied entering the lane, but was headed by that one
in upper stretch, kept on well through midstretch, but yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. TAP DANCING LADY tracked in midpack in the two path,
pursued the leaders from the three to four path around the far turn, floated to the five path while chasing in upper stretch, and gave way. MANUCA (BRZ)
broke a step slow, settled far back two wide, improved five wide and outside of foes around the far turn, but leveled off six wide in upper stretch and chased
evenly. LADY PUCHI laid off of the pace along the inside, vacated the rail down the backstretch, then steadied between horses turning for home before
making little impact. FOREVER DREAMING trailed, spun into the lane three wide and between horses and never got involved. PHAROAH'S SONG set the
pace along the inside, met a pair of challenges around the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. BHOMA pressed two wide and between horses, but
yielded leaving the half mile pole, and continued to weaken through the lane.

Footnotes
NEVER TELL PATTI shifted inwardly at the start, tracked three wide, ranged up to the leader turning for home to offer a bid in upper stretch, gained an
advantage at the furlong grounds, and flopped back to her left lead while driving clear at the sixteenth pole. FANCY broke a bit outwardly, prompted the
pace two wide, led at the three furlong pole, resisted an outer challenge in upper stretch, but was headed by that one at the furlong pole and was second
best. FREEDOM FOR ALL bobbled a bit and brushed an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace four wide, stayed on to bid for show at the
furlong grounds, and flopped back to his left lead while securing that position at the sixteenth pole. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES set the pace, got headed by
an outer presser at the three furlong pole, and gave way in upper stretch. TAKE SHAPE brushed with rivals on both sides just after the start, rushed inside
of foes to a stalking position down the backstretch, but failed to sustain forward momentum and yielded around the turn, yet ran on between horses.
PENUMBRAS MAKER raced at the rear, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and failed to factor on his left lead. INVENTING ANNA took contact from
rivals on both sides a few strides out of the gate, tracked two wide and between horses, chased around the turn, but faded through the lane. CHURCH
SERVICE never got involved.
