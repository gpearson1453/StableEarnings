Footnotes
KALL KAT dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, then drove clear in upper stretch. MAHOMEBRED got forced inwardly by an outer foe and into
an inner rival's path at the start, prompted the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch, dueled with the other for
place through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. CORTADO came in at the start, trailed in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and ran
on to miss reaching place at the wire. TAMARA'S WAY sparred for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but failed to keep pace with her most immediate
counterpart in upper stretch, dueled for place with her other rival through the late stages, but was bested by that one and nailed by a bidder for show.
SOULFUL TARA broke a beat slow, steadied hard when an outer rival took her path at the start, hopped an inner foe's heels in the aftermath, then tracked
the leading trio from the two path, but faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
TOWING bobbled slightly upon leaving the gates, prompted the pace three wide, vied two wide around the turn, forged a narrow advantage from his inner
counterpart in upper stretch, then clung to a margin thereafter as that foe fought on gamely through the late stages. AMANI'S EAGLE showed the way along
the inside, vied with an outer TOWING around the turn, fought on after being headed in upper stretch, but saw his rider lose his crop after switching to
right-handed encouragement at the furlong grounds, battled doggedly despite his rider briefly standing passing the sixteenth pole, but failed to regain even
terms. ASPEN CLUB prompted the pace two wide and between a pair of rivals for a quarter mile, but failed to sustain that pressure and chased those foes
from the two path around the turn, failed to keep pace with them in the three path in upper stretch, yet fended off an inner rival for show. RAYMOND trailed
along the inside, chased along the fence in hopes of bidding for show in the late stages, but was kept at bay and failed to menace. EAST OF INDIA tracked
in the three path, but faded in the four path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHARP TUNE set the pace along the inside, inched away from an outer chaser while in hand around the turn, drew off under a drive approaching upper
stretch and held safely from an outer pursuer late. FOOLISH FRONT FIFI laid off of the pace in the four path, rallied outside of foes to gain place at the
sixteenth pole and continued to narrow the leader's margin through the late stages. WHAT'S CRACKIN bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the
pace in the two path, then sustained stride along the rail to gain show from an outer rival in the closing stages. INTERMITTENT FAST prompted the pace
two wide, chased outside of the leader around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, lost place to an outer bidder at the sixteenth
pole and weakened. CRYSTAL SYMPHONY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three path and failed to menace between horses through the lane.
KRICKLE broke on top, stalked an inner pair from the three path into the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rallying rival in upper stretch and lacked a bid.
RISKY SPIRIT never got involved from the two path. HOCKEY broke a step slow before making contact with an inner rival at the start, then got outrun along
the inside.

Footnotes
JUDY'S WAY stumbled at the start while still breaking with the field, prompted the pace outside of the leader and from the four to three path into the turn,
forged an advantage in upper stretch, but drifted out through the final furlong and lasted from an outer bidder late. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI lacked speed
in the three path while under moderate, yet consistent, coaxing, gained show from between horses turning for home, pursued the top pair in upper stretch,
shifted ground outwardly to remain outside of the drifting leader while slowly closing in through the final furlong, but was too late to reel that one in while
gaining place at the wire. BLUE GRASS ANNA set the pace in the three to two path into the turn, but was headed by an outer presser in upper stretch, yet
kept on thereafter. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR tracked along the inside, but retreated to trail at the three furlong pole and made little impact thereafter. HIGH
SPEED stalked in the five path early on but faded in the four path around the turn.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM IMPACT lagged behind along the inside, offered a sweeping four wide blitz to circle inner rivals around the far turn and take charge entering the
lane, drew clear under a mild drive, then was eased up entering the final sixteenth before being mildly encouraged to seal the deal as rivals closed in late.
WHAT A COUNTRY tracked along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer rival while awaiting racing room turning for home, shifted three wide and
between horses entering the lane and ran on among foes to gain place late. KUNSHAN BRIDGE surpassed an inner rival entering the first turn to set the
pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer rival down the backstretch and around the far turn, but offered no resistance to MAXIMUM IMPACT's
challenge nearing the lane, kept on to maintain place through midstretch, but was reeled in for that position late. MY BARILEY lacked speed in the three to
two path around the first turn, pursued the rest from the four to five path around the far turn, then stayed on outside of rivals to bid for minor placings late,
but missed reaching place. SILVER DUST pressed two wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival nearing the lane and weakened between horses in upper
stretch. IMPROBABLE STORY relinquished the early lead entering the first turn, chased two to three wide, but was outmoved by an outer rival around the
far turn, weakened in the four path and between horses in upper stretch, then was eased in the final sixteenth before walking off.

Footnotes
I RUN tracked three wide, bid two wide in upper stretch, dueled before wrestling an advantage at the sixteenth pole and held between horses late.
CROSSING stalked two wide, bid before gaining an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, dug in to resist I RUN's outer challenge in upper stretch, dueled
before getting headed at the sixteenth pole and fought on to save place. ABSOLUTE COURAGE stalked along the inside, swung to the four path entering
the lane, sustained a grinding charge to close in on the top pair in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to reel them in and missed reaching place. OFF
THE CUFF set the pace along the inside, but was headed turning for home and weakened entering the lane. COTE D'IVOIRE never got involved from the
two path. JOR EL steadied out of tight quarters at the start, then showed little before being eased through the lane. TOLLGATE CANYON failed to respond
to urging while off of the pace in the five path around the turn, then drifted outwardly while being eased entering the lane and jogged home.

Footnotes
EMERALD EXPRESS leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, rallied entering the final sixteenth to bid inside
of the leader late and prevail at the wire. FITZPATRICK tracked two wide and between horses, took aim outside of the leaders and from the four path
turning for home, bid entering the lane, inched away in midstretch, but was nailed by an inner bidder at the wire. GULFSTREAM WAY brushed with rivals on
both sides at the start, vied outside of the leader while in the three path, got outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, chased that foe and held place
through midstretch, but lost that position to an outer foe entering the final sixteenth. DEVIL'S TOWER shifted out and brushed an outer rival at the start, set
the pace inside of a vying rival while a path off of the inner rail, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way. ALL EYES WEST
stalked along the inside, chased through midstretch, but yielded in the final furlong. LEGAL DEAL took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked
speed in the four path, drifted out to the nine path entering the lane and failed to factor. LOST IN LIMBO dropped his rider pre-race and ran loose, was
gathered by an out-rider and returned to be remounted without further incident, took minor contact from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked in the four to
five path while outside of foes around the turn, weakened in upper stretch, but fell inside the final sixteenth and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BAD BEAT BRIAN pressed two wide, vied in upper stretch, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds and inched clear through the final sixteenth.
SMOKIN' JAY saved ground at the rear around the turn, then swung four wide upper stretch and rallied in the final furlong to reach place late. JUST MIGHT
set the pace inside of a pressing rival, sparred with that one entering the lane, got headed at the furlong grounds, gave way in the final sixteenth, and lost
place late before saving show. BOUND FOR NOWHERE stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but lacked the
needed punch, got outkicked for a minor reward in the final sixteenth and missed reaching show. SURVEILLANCE laid off of the pace two wide, fanned to
the four path entering the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
HE'S GOT THIS tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home to assume command entering the land, then drew off and
was ridden out. LONG CROW broke slowly but avoided contact from an outer rival by doing so, saved ground while trailing around both turns, improved
while picking up stride entering the lane, aimed between horses in upper stretch before altering course to the five path and outside of rivals at the furlong
grounds, then sustained a rally to gain place at the wire. JOB SECURITY bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the
four path entering the lane, ran on to gain place at the furlong grounds, but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. LONGSHADOW broke inwardly,
prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked entering the lane and tired. MILLARD'S SMILE bumped an inner rival leaving the
gates and failed to factor from the three to four path. FIELDSTONE took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, stalked in the three path, but was
floated to the four path turning for home and faded in the six path entering the lane. LI MU BAI (IRE) set the pace along the inside but weakened entering
the lane.
