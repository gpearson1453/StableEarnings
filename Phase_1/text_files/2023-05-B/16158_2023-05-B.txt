through to the front at top of stretch and continued gamely to the wire. MY BOY COLTON broke very slowly, moved to contention outside then weakened in
the stretch. GOLDEN WILDCAT dueled outside, moved briefly clear at the quarter pole then faltered. DOCTOR MAGIC lagged wide throughout then passed
fading rivals. PRINCIPE dropped back early and weakened steadily. IT'S A PITY urged to a narrow early lead and stopped abruptly.

CLASSY MISS raced in closest pursuit of the leader, took over at the three eighths pole ,quickly pulled clear and extended her advantage under mild urging.
SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD moved off the pace inside, angled out on the final turn and was easily second best. CREME CARAMEL raced close up outside,
was put to urging on the final turn but had no response. OUI MADAME lagged far behind then passed rivals inside in the stretch. HEY DEWZPOTS broke
slowest, saved ground and was never a factor. VALUABLE BREIGH stumbled at the start, set a clear pace to the far turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
VITAEMI shook loose early then widened throughout under mild pressure. BABY FADE saved ground just behind the pacesetter then came again for the
place. FRAME THIS lagged far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. SYSTEMIC RISK stalked the winner outside to the stretch and
weakened. BELLS ON HER TOES dropped back inside and lacked a rally. MANUELA chased very wide throughout and faltered.

Footnotes
BIG CITY BOB stalked the pace three wide, took over at the quarter pole then edged clear and stayed safe driving. R GOODTIME CHARLIE prompted the
pace along the inside, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. MAGNETRON lacked speed then finished with good energy outside. KING'S
HOUSE earned a narrow lead early, vied on the turn then weakened. SAN ANTONE chased off the pace between rivals and faltered. HIBACHI dropped
back after the start and was never involved. EMPIRE'S SCORE raced close up inside then began retreating on the turn. RONIN WARRIOR lacked speed
and trailed throughout.
