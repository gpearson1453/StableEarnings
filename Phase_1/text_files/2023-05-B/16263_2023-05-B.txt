NEW YEAR'S FEVER gained a clear lead soon after the start, continued to be clear through the turn and into the lane while rider sat chilly, roused in the
last seventy yards and widened to the end. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE chased the winner into the turn, continued closest to the winner into the lane, was under a
drive after straightening in the lane, could not gain on the top one but stayed on for the place spot. ME AND CHILI was to wide through the turn, entered the
lane from the two or three path, could not gain on the winner while getting up to split the show spot. MANUELITO was three wide through late turn, came
into the lane from the five path and shared the show spot while not a menace. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was in the three or four path through the turn and
never was a factor. FERDAN was closest to the winner early while near the rail then faded. AZZARO STEEL was never a factor while saving ground.

Footnotes
FIRING RANGE vied for the lead with stablemate throughout while two wide, shook clear straightening in the lane then widened through the final eighth.
UNBRIDLED VICTOR was four wide through the first turn, continued to chase the pace from the four path, bid into the far turn while three wide, could not
keep up with the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. BENNY'S LEGACY was two wide through the far turn when never far back, lacked a
closing kick after entering the lane then just saved the show spot. VENICE BEACH vied for the lead along the inside into the lane then gave way.
INDOCUMENTADO was in the three path while near the back into the far turn, asked into the lane while in the five path and never was a factor while
finishing in mid-track. SHOTGUN JOE never a factor while in the six path through the lane. ROOKWOOD chased the pace along the inside into the lane and
was empty. BOLD BIZNESS stumbled badly at the start and lost his rider, ran rider-less for three-quarters of a mile while far off the rail and was eventually
caught and walked off.

Footnotes
HARTFUL HOPE stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane two wide, was on near even terms nearing the sixteenth pole and
edged past. NIKKI M P vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, repelled dueling challenger into the lane, was joined by the winner soon after,
dueled with that one through the final eighth and could not hold sway while clearly second best. KINGMAKING (GB) raced in the two or three path through
the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the top ones while saving the show spot. WICKED BEAUTIFUL was near the rail while near the back through
the turn, put in tight near the three-sixteenths pole and never was a threat. ROSARIO'S PRAYER trailed into the turn while near the inside, angled into the
seven path into the lane and moved up while not a threat. PARTY NEVER ENDS chased the pace from the five path through the turn then was empty
turning into the lane. GOGO GEISHA vied for the lead two wide through the turn then faded after entering the lane. ALWAYS DREAM BIG never a factor
while in the two or three path.

CANDYMAKER led early between foes, was clear on the turn and held sway under mild urging. GOOD BALI was unhurried early, rallied four wide at the
quarter pole and closed late. IZZIT MIDNIGHT stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole and yielded late. PRINCE COLTON pressed the pace outside
of the winner to the turn, stalked the pace in the three path and had no bid. BLACK WHITE N GOLD was off a step slow, then gave way in the stretch.
