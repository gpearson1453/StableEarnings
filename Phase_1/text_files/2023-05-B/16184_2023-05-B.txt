Footnotes
DULCE KIARA raced in the two path on the turn, eased out four wide approaching the stretch, floated to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses
and was up in deep stretch. DANCER'S MELODY , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly.
MY JUBA set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened late. BACKSTREET AFFAIR saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the
stretch and was not a factor. MRS. DEL , outrun, raced along the inner rail the final five furlongs and remained on her left lead in the stretch. MISS CASEY
prompted the pace outside MY JUBA and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
EVANGELINE ALLONS rated two wide behind rivals as a three pronged battled went on up top, swung out seven to eight wide for the drive, rolled up
outside rivals under right handed asks leaving mid stretch, took over with about a sixteenth to go and went clear at the wire. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN
rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out near mid stretch, worked between runners and kept on gamely while earning the place. IMAGINE
VICTORY , off slowly after being a bit rank and hopping, lagged off the pace while saving ground, angled wide into the lane, worked well out in the course in
deep stretch and rallied. FANCY PRINCESS , between foes and in range of the duel, was kept in entering the lane, bid between horses in mid stretch but
flattened out late. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK disputed the pace three deep, drifted out leaving the three sixteenths, was corrected with right handed asks
then faded. LADY CINCO DE MAYO broke a step slow, rushed up five wide early, chased four wide outside rivals into the lane, had aim, failed to kick on in
mid stretch and gave way. SASSY BABE sped clear in the initial strides, was hooked from both sides, dueled between rivals into and around the turn,
stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. ELLIE VICTORINA was hustled up soon after the break and challenged to the inside of runners, battled inside a
pair around the turn, kept on past the three sixteenths then weakened late. CREATIVE CADENCE was sent up along the rail soon after the break then was
rated off the leading trio, tracked inside around the turn, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ALVY , forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked inside and awaited room behind the leading trio leaving the far turn, responded when roused and split
rivals entering the lane, took over to the inside of FOWL NATION in upper stretch, spurted clear under stout asks in mid stretch, kept on under firm handling
and denied STEELE MONEY through the final sixteenth. STEELE MONEY stalked two to three wide behind the leaders, angled out and was pushed along
leaving the three eighths, circled five wide with an advance into the lane, threatened the winner in upper stretch, kept on gamely but was held at bay. HE'S
ON FIRE cleared near the seven eighths, dropped in and set the early pace, met outside bids near the five eighths, dueled to the three eighths, was urged
along trying to keep pace past the five sixteenths then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. BLOWN SAVE , off the pace, was under pressure around the
final turn while removed from the rail, swung six wide for the drive but came up empty. FOWL NATION reared up when fractious in the paddock, broke
alertly, bid between foes nearing the five eighths, dueled, shook clear after six furlongs, was engaged from both sides in upper stretch and weakened
through the final sixteenth. IRISH WARLOCK , keyed up five wide soon into the backstretch, pulled his way forward four wide and took over leaving the five
furlong pole, sparred into and around the far turn, failed to go on nearing the quarter pole, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, floated five deep at the head of the stretch, closed steadily and was up at the wire.
NEVER CHANGE stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, advanced in the two path on the far turn, bid for the lead inside the sixteenth pole
and just missed in a game effort. GALATIANS raced in the two path around the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. ACE NINE
NINE sprinted clear early, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. LOST MY VOWCHER , unhurried down the backstretch, grazed the
inner rail entering the far turn and failed to be a factor. SOUPER CATCH stalked the pace outside horses, circled the far turn three wide and steadied
behind GALATIANS in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JACKIE A edged up between rivals early, stalked behind the leaders leaving the far turn, worked through a seam in upper stretch, closed in under pressure
and engaged the WORKIN ON A DREAM in mid stretch, dueled, wrested command in deep stretch and held firm. WORKIN ON A DREAM vied outside a
rival into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch and set the pace towards the rail, kept rivals at bay around the final turn, came off the inside with the
advantage into the stretch, dug in when collared leaving the furlong grounds, battled gamely inside the winner, ceded command inside the sixteenth pole but
stayed well to preserve the place. ONE TWO KID was taken four wide for the backstretch, moved up into the far turn, continued four wide with aim through
the drive but failed to follow through. COLBALOAF had speed to the inside of WORKIN ON A DREAM, rated off that one and stalked through the
backstretch, steadied in a bit tight leaving the three sixteenths, angled out and closed steadily. STRONG HEADED dropped in early and drafted off the
pace, came off the inside leaving the far turn, angled five wide for the drive, straightened and finished with good energy to gain. SEMPER FI prompted the
pace two wide, was urged along past the five sixteenths, guided three wide allowing a path to the winner entering the lane and faded. DIXIE DRAWL stalked
three wide, was pushed along between runners past the five sixteenths and faded. KENDAMA broke outward and hit the gate, stumbled then recovered to
save ground, checked sharply around the first turn, regrouped and raced inside, edged up a bit saving ground past mid stretch then flattened out. JOHNG
was steadied when in close into the first turn, raced off the pace, traveled between runners past the five sixteenths but lacked a bid. SUMMER SILENCE
failed to menace.

Footnotes
MONTAUK POINT stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, weakened clear in
mid stretch and lasted. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , bumped by SEA GHOST leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on both turns, angled out in upper stretch
and closed smartly between foes. SEA GHOST bore in at the start, saved ground on the turns, eased outside entering the stretch and flattened out.
HARDSPUN REASON lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and offered a mild rally. AFFABLE
MONARCH trailed to the far turn, circled horses four deep approaching the stretch and passed tired rivals. WHAT SAY YOU showed speed along the inner
rail to mid stretch and tired. YOUR ANALYSIS , four wide both turns, weakened. CANDY FOR CARMEL , four wide entering the first turn, raced along the
inner rail in the stretch and was not a factor. ROMP , between horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, gave way. CARVELLIAN QUEST disputed
the pace outside WHAT SAY YOU and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPERSTITIEUX , three deep stalking the dueling leaders, took closer order past the five sixteenths, forged past the leaders in upper stretch and kicked
away under a right handed drive. SHADOW BOX moved up outside early and engaged CAVALRY COMMAND, poked a head in front into the turn, dueled,
ceded the lead in upper stretch, switched over to his left lead inside the furlong grounds and kept on willingly to hold down the place. CAVALRY COMMAND
, bumped at the break, straightened sped up to a short lead, was headed near the half mile marker, dueled around the turn and gave way grudgingly.
PRESSING CONCERN broke outward and bumped with a rival, tracked inside, checked near the half mile marker, chased around the turn and came up
empty. SIR SMOAK , between rivals early, shifted four wide into the lane, faltered past the three sixteenths and was eased late.
