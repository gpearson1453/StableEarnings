APPRAISAL stalked the pace into the stretch, surged late between rivals three wide and got up in the final strides. GOLD HERITAGE allowed to settle,
rallied steadily late four wide and just missed getting up in time. AWESOME ENOUGH pressed the pace along the rail to the top of the stretch, made the
lead, drifted out late under right handed urging bumping with MASTER and was outfinished. MASTER broke alertly, set a pressured pace two wide to the
top of the stretch, drifted out late, was bumped causing his rider to check nearing the wire and was also. GRAND DEAL closed a gap late outside. EL
SICARIO bobbled at the start, settled within striking range, lacked the needed responded and finished on even terms with GRAND DEAL at the wire.

ADHHAR stalked the pace from the start and finished determinedly in the five path. LORD OF LEGENDS away alertly, set a pressured pace along the rail to
the top of the stretch and faded late. DERBYS MONEYMAKER failed to menace.

Footnotes
CARILLO pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a brisk hand ride.
TONKAWA SPRINGS away alertly, battled for the lead along the inside to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. TIMESATAPPIN void of
early speed, found his best stride late inside rivals. LAST COOKIE bumped at the start, contested the lead two wide into the stretch then weakened.
BOURBON TALKING bumped at the start, was in tight along the rail causing his rider to check entering the first turn, checked again midway on that turn,
was a forward factor for six furlongs then gave way.
