Footnotes
PRIME CODE broke at the rear of the field, was given a few taps on the shoulder away from the gate to gain position, moved up to stalk from three wide,
engaged the leader in upper stretch and prevailed in a determined drive. UNCORKED HUMOR slow early to trail the field by several lengths, began to pick
up momentum in the turn and rallied well on the outside to be gaining late. BIG TICKET broke alertly to take command from the start, set a well rated pace
on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon, dug-in gamely but failed to hold in deep stretch. SAINT PIO tracked the pacesetters from the rail to the
head of the lane but lacked a response when called upon for the drive. YACHT ROCK (IRE) pressed the pace for a half mile and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
FRED'STWIRLINCANDY set the pace into the first turn, then lead the way throughout the backstretch and into the far turn and held on grudgingly until the
end to prove best. PARROT HEAD raced down the backstretch from the four path, was gaining ground gamely throughout the far turn and kept on down the
lane and was best for second place. BROCK ON BY stalked the pace while two wide, was urging on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch and down the
lane and just missed the place prize in the end. FREEDOM FACTOR chased the pace while two wide, was gaining gamely on the far turn to rally in the
stretch then gave way in the end. GO SPEED RACER GO was moving down the backstretch while five wide then rallied throughout the turn but needed
more in the end. COLOSI was unhurried early then raced behind the field and needed rally in the end. GUITAR SLIM chased the pace from the inside then
gradually faded and had no final bid.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SMOOTH pressed the pace from two wide to the far turn, edged to the clear turning for home and drew off down the lane under constant
urging. BIG STORY well placed into the first turn along the rail, lacked racing room and steadied off heels for a sixteenth of a mile to the backstretch, angled
into the clear to stalk from three wide, was set down mid-turn for the drive and ground out the place. VICTOR VALENTINO dropped back for the run down
the backside, rallied turning for home and showed good late interest to be gaining near the wire. ACCRUAL raced wide in the clear down the backside and
into the far turn and kept on down the lane. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY sped to the lead up the fence, set a pressured pace to midway on the far turn and
faded coming home. GIST slow early to be at the rear of the field and made late gains in the stretch passing tired rivals. CALIPARI raced evenly along the
rail and never menaced. DIRT BIKE SLADE raced mid-pack and never threatened. PLUTONIUM showed little as a non-factor.

Footnotes
HAILEY'S JEWEL trailed behind the field early, then steadily gained ground on the far turn, rallied from the four path to surge down the lane and be up for
the win. JUSTCAUSEICAN chased the pace from the inside, then rallied on the far turn to close strongly down the lane to be up for the place prize.
MADAME RUE chased the pace while two wide, then settled back throughout the far turn and into the early stretch, then had more to close well in the end.
SKYSPEIGHT dueled from the two path throughout under a gamely rally then gave way in the late stretch. JULIE'S PASSION was unhurried early, then
saved ground to no avail and needed more in the end. MEMORABLE FLIGHT was under a hard drive to duel for the lead from the inside, was used up in
the stretch and gave way in the end. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER chased the pace while three wide, came out five wide on the far turn then flattened out in the
stretch. FREE DROP GYPSY stalked the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive throughout. MAGICAL GOLD was taken up early and vanned off.

Footnotes
AUTOSTRADA saved ground while racing mid-pack for the first three-quarters along the fence, waited patiently for racing room turning for home, burst
through along the rail when given an opening and closed with a rush to be up in time. GHOST BAYOU pressed the pace into the first turn and to the head of
the lane from two wide, took command from the pacesetter in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to hold off the late closer. DRENCHED
tracked the leaders in striking position from between horses to the far turn, split rivals down the lane and closed well to be coming late. VIEWING TRAIL
stalked the pace from three wide throughout, loomed up in striking position turning for home and failed to sustain her bid. NIGHT ORB sped to a clear lead
into the first turn, maintained a clear lead to the far turn and weakened in the stretch. NORDIC QUEEN well placed from three wide in the second flight and
failed to mount a closing rally. RIOBELLA reserved off the pace near the rear of the field and showed mild late interest in deep stretch. DASHYNS DREAM
well placed for the first three-quarters along the rail and flattened out in the lane. ROSES ARE GRAY went evenly failing to menace. ELMO'S SECRET was
never a factor.

PIVOSKY was well rated while stalking the pace from the two path, gained command at the top of the turn, then drew off in the stretch and held on well to
succeed in the end. NUBILITY was gaining ground steadily while four wide, then menaced in the upper stretch and held onto the place position throughout
the final furlongs. OCCURRENCE chased the pace while three wide, then rallied gamely on the turn and closed evenly throughout the home stretch.
VIVACIOUSLY was unhurried early, then came out five on the turn to bid in the stretch and was closing well but it wasn't enough in the end. NICAMINE
settled in the three path, then was moving up on the turn to rally in the early stretch but came up empty. HOLIDAY NELSON moved swiftly down the early
backstretch along the inside, then settle back, bid on the turn while three wide and into the lane but came up empty. ELENA MAE set the pace down the
backstretch and into the turn then gave way in the stretch. HAUNTED DREAM settled in the two path and was no threat. LUV AND COMMITMENT stalked
the pace while two wide, then faded throughout and had no final bid in the end. BOLD EXAGGERATION chased the pace while two wide, then flattened out

SKELLY broke a half step slow, immediately took command in the first few strides, opened a well rated advantage while racing in the two path, shook off the
pace pressers turning for home and finished well while never having been seriously threatened. ALBIZU stalked the leader from the rail, was in tight for one
stride into the turn, rallied well up the fence for the place and was second best. JACKMAN chased the leaders from three wide to be prominent throughout
but could not close the gap in spite of a good effort. DEAN'S LIST reserved off the leaders to the top of the stretch and mounted a mild rally to just miss the
show. ERNIE BANKER prompted the pace from two wide to the quarter pole and gave way in the lane. GO WEST broke alertly, settled into stride showing
brief speed for an eighth, dropped back off the pace down the backstretch and failed to respond when called upon. THE TRAINER OF THE ALBIZU FILED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST SKELLY FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS RULED NO CHANGE WAS TO BE MADE

COGBURN was well rated in the middle of the field, came out four wide on the turn then closed fastest to be up in time. TIZ MAGIC dueled for the lead while
two wide, roused off the turn to gain short lead in the final furlongs grounds but was denied in the late stretch. EXCESS MAGIC vied for the lead from the
inside, then battled gamely throughout turn, faded in the late stretch and held onto show in the end. MY PAL MATTIE dueled from the inside under a strong
drive into the home stretch then gave way in the end. ALEXIS S settled along the inside, then menaced in the upper stretch to close willingly in the end.
REBEL POSSE chased the pace while two wide, then rallied on the turn to close well but it wasn't enough in the end. CHATTALOT chased the pace from
the inside, was in a gamely bid throughout the turn and continued to close well but was out finished in the end. ROBO raced in the middle of the pack while
two wide, then made a mild bid on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. HE'S A BOMB settled in the three path then flattened out throughout and was
no threat. EMPIRE OF GOLD chased the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive throughout then flattened out in late stretch.

Footnotes
ADALINE JULIA pressed the pace from the gate from two wide, called upon from between horses turning for home, dueled with the runner-up through the
lane and prevailed under strong handling. TAP DANCE FEVER dropped in mid-pack down the backside saving ground, ranged up three wide entering the
turn, engaged the front pair at the top of the stretch, took a brief lead in mid-stretch and was out-finished late in a game effort. MAJESTIC WAYS tracked the
leaders from the second flight, waited behind a wall of horses at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and closed willingly. QUATRO sped to the lead
under constant pressure, responded when called upon to repel the pressers, dug-in to deep stretch and weakened late in the drive. ROLLIN CHROME well
placed along the rail chasing the front-runners, cut the corner to challenge at the head of the lane but could not sustain the bid. HEADLAND lunged at the
start, settled into stride to be at the back of the second flight and made up some ground in the stretch. DISTORTED FLASH went evenly without ever
making an impact. HEAVENLY RHYTHM kept wide the entire trip and never threatened. KABOOM BABY raced wide keeping rival to the outside and was
not a factor.

HAYES STRIKE saved ground down the backstretch, was urging on the far turn, angled out five wide in the early stretch then dug in gamely to close fastest
and be up at the wire to prevail. HARLOCAP tracked the pace from the three path in the first trio of rivals, rallied on the far turn then lead in the late stretch
but was caught in the end. EYEING CLOVER pressed the pace in hand while two wide, given queue off the far turn to make a three wide bid, was in a long
drive but was caught in the end. GHOST HERO set the pressured pace in hand down the backstretch, nudged along leaving the five sixteenths, put down
for the drive leaving the far turn then gave way grudgingly in the end. RARIFIED FLAIR tracked the pace from the inside, then menaced gamely on the far
turn to close willingly in the stretch but it wasn't enough. GUNFLASH chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then came out three wide to bid
on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. HOW DID HE DO THAT settled between rivals down the backstretch, then dropped back behind the field,
rallied in the upper stretch but it was too little too late. CABALLO FELIZ tracked the pace between rivals, was in a strong drive throughout the far turn then
gave way in late stretch. BLACK POWDER chased the pace while three wide in the second group of rivals then rallied on the far turn then flattened out in
the stretch. SINGLE RULER settled in the three path down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and was no threat. CURLY JACK chased the pace
between rivals then faded on the far turn and had no final bid in the end.

Footnotes
JUNCTURE (GB) settled in hand near the rear of the field for the first half mile, commenced a rally from between horses two wide into the turn closing the
gap, waited to angle out in upper stretch and exploded to the front with a rush late in the drive to be a convincing winner. IKO IKO stalked the pace from
three wide in the first flight to the far turn, rallied leaving the three-eighths pole to take the lead turning for home, opened a clear advantage in mid-stretch
but could not hold off the fast closing winner while a definitive second best. COLORS OF THE WIND tracked the pace from two wide between horses in the
second flight down the backside, started a drive at the head of the lane and finished well to be gaining ground and be up for the show. GLITTERARY saved
ground along the rail in the third flight, held position beginning to move into the far turn with the eventual winner, waited to angle into the clear in upper
stretch and launched a belated rally to the wire. LOVELY RIDE prompted the pace from between two wide through the first turn and down the backside,
moved with the runner-up to engage the pacesetter in the far turn but could not sustain his rally and flattened out in he drive. QUINN ELLA trailed the field
most of the way, swung wide for the drive and showed late interest passing tiring rivals. TAKNTOTHECLEANERS took command shortly away from the
gate, set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead while in hand, responded when challenged through the turn to upper stretch and gave way late in the lane.
ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) sat a stalking trip from the fence in the second flight, moved into threatening contention at he quarter pole, cut the corner saving
ground but weakened in the stretch. SKYKAT tracked the leaders from three wide in the second flight to the far turn and failed to respond when called upon
and faded coming home.

to lead in the early stretch but could not go with Frosted Grace in the late stretch and was second best. KOKOKOMO was unhurried early while saving
ground down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn, angled out seven to eight wide to close gap fast to just miss, too late. SONNEMAN saved ground
down the backstretch, then bid while three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly in the late stretch and needed more in the end. MINE THAT STAR vied for the
lead from the inside throughout the first three quarters then tired in the late stretch. SILVER PROSPECTOR chased the pace while three wide, then rallied
on the far turn but did not fire in the stretch. ALLEGE chased the pace from the inside then flattened out in the final furlongs and needed more in the end.
