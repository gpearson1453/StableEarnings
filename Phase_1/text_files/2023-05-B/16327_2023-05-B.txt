JUNK DRAWER broke outward then was brushed leaving the gate, dueled into the stretch, and edged clear under pressure. MS CLARA broke in bumping
into JETSUP, and was outkicked. NAUGHTEE OR NICE brushed, closed too late. EYEMADASHIN showed early speed inside, and weakened late. HEZA
MAJESTIC HERO brushed, and lacked rally needed. FIRECRUNCH bid belatedly. SHAWNEE IS BOSS dismounted the rider at the gate before the start,
and offered a late mild bid. WESTERN BURNER no threat. JETSUP squeezed out leaving the gate and chased to no avail. STEWARDS INQUIRY and
TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the Trainer of JETSUP against the rider of MS CLARA alleging interference at the start was not allowed
after review by the Board of Stewards.

COMMON KNOWLEDGE prompted the pace, dueled through the stretch, and edged clear. WYE CROSS raced at the back of the pack, closed steadily
outside and got up late to earn second place. PRESS GANG angled down to the rail leaving the backstretch, shifted out to the four path, and closed
gradually getting up late for the show. LONE PIONEER reserved off the early pacesetters, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and was outkicked.
BARE BACK JACK went three to four wide in the opening turn, and rallied too late. JULIUS THE GREAT set a pressured pace, and weakened in the final
yards. BIG AL'S VISION sat in range and tired.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC hustled to the front, angled to the rail leaving the backstretch, responded to a looming threat at the head of the lane, and stayed clear under
steady handling. RYANWATER jostled away, sat in striking range outside, drove five wide into the lane, and closed earning place. MOONSHINE NOW
chased inside and flattened out in the final sixteenth. PERDITION broke inward bumping into RYANWATER, fanned four wide into the opening turn, rallied
four deep into the stretch, and weakened. YORKTOWN broke outward bumping into RYANWATER, chased the pace from between foes, and lacked a
closing response. FROBISHER BAY was never far back and lacked a serious bid. SAVED BY ZERO sat in range and was outrun.

Footnotes
KAUAI DAN was brushed away from the gate, found running room along the rail entering the stretch, swept the lead and won going away. SIX SHOTS OF T
vied outside, gained the advantage in the far turn, was overtaken, and finished up second best. BARAK fanned three-wide, and improved late stretch. LIFES
ADVENTURE broke alertly, dropped back through the far turn, and passed a tiring foe deep stretch. FROSTEDBIRD came over leaving the gate causing
COOL DOMINION to clip heels, dueled inside of SIX SHOTS OF T in the final turn and came up empty for the drive. COOL DOMINION clipped heels with
FROSTEDBIRD away from the gate, trailed and failed to produce a bid. REAL JUSTICE showed little. TAPFERSURE stalked outside, and tired.
STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of COOL
DOMINION against the rider of FROSTEDBIRD alleging interference away from the gate. After review by the Board of Stewards, FROSTEDBIRD was
disqualified and placed sixth for interference to COOL DOMINION.

Footnotes
SUDDENLY MISTY position within striking distance moved up closer in the far turn, angled out to the four path, wore down EDDIE'S ON PATROL deep
stretch and inched up to score the win. EDDIE'S ON PATROL vied outside crossing over to the three path, pressed WOMANONTHEWARPATH, gained the
advantage in the final furlong and was rundown deep stretch. DRAMATIC FLAIR chased inside, and closed gamely securing the show. QUEEN RHONDA
reserved well off the pace, advanced outside entering the stretch and was outkicked. SHAKINOFFTHERUST raced in close quarters in the early stages,
chased four wide into the opening turn, and lodged a late bid. WOMANONTHEWARPATH contested the early pace, dueled inside of EDDIE'S PATROL to
the top of the lane, and yielded in the final sixteenth. LILBITSPICY lacked early speed and failed to pose a threat. AMBER PRINCESS trailed throughout.
JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SHAKINOFFTHERUST against the rider of EDDIE'S ON PATROL alleging interference on the
backstretch was not allowed after review by the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
BIG BAD INTAGLIO sat in the second flight, dropped back saving ground in the far turn, was roused at the head of the lane and made a late run outside for
the win. LIL ZAPPER quickly went to the front then showed the way through the backstretch, and was challenged by MUDINATOR around the
three-sixteenth marker, clung to the lead under encouragement but was denied late. MUDINATOR chased from the four path, loomed boldly near the
three-sixteenth pole, but was unable to muster the bid that was needed. ROUGH CUSTOMER reserved off the early pace from along the rail, lacked
running room inside entering the lane, shifted outside and missed after a good effort late. OUR SUNSHINE lacked a serious bid. VIRAL was not a factor.
KISS ME HELLO chased the pacesetter from the four path, and tired early. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run
but made no change after review.

Footnotes
RUMOHR REIGNS jostled away, stalked the pace from the three path, dueled in the final turn outside of SMART PLAY, edged clear and held under a late
drive. BOSS MAN CAN stalked inside, dropped back in the far turn, shifted outside and rallied determinedly for the place. FATHER O'FLAHERTY saved
ground early, and closed well late for show. SMARTY RIVER PANTS chased outside, and closed with good energy late. SMART PLAY broke outward then
set the pace, responded to challenge from RUMOHR REIGNS, and gave way inside. CLANCY'S PISTOL bumped repeatedly at the start, and gained some
ground late. SIMMS jostled away, and was unable to recover ground. WEDGE POND bumped leaving, stalked the pace outside, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
STOLEN JEWEL contested the early pace from the rail, gained a short lead into the lane, and held under a late drive. SWIFT SWALLOW reserved off the
early pacesetters, responded to handling then dug in late stretch to get up for the place. GET BAKK chased wide early, loomed boldly entering the lane, and
was edged out for placed. CAPA BELLA sat just off the pace inside, lost ground leaving the backstretch, shifted outside at the three-sixteenth marker under
heavy urging but was unable to improve her position late. PERPETUAL BLISS failed to threaten. LETS GO ALL THEWAY lacked a bid. LAURA BELLE vied
outside for the early lead, was unable to move on with rival, and wilted abruptly. CUVEE TEE did not receive a fair start, did not finish, and was walked off.
STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race and after review, the Stewards deemed it an unfair start for CUVEE
TEE and issued a refund for monies wagered on CUVEE TEE.

Footnotes
STUBBORN LOVE advanced quickly in the final turn, drove three wide into the lane, responded under strong encouragement then prevailed under a drive.
WICKED WIZZY sat mid-pack, angled out to the two path at the quarter pole, wore down THIS TIME SWEETIE, but was unable to hold off STUBBORN
LOVE in the final strides. DYLAN'S SAVE rated well off the pace in the three path, closed gradually outside and got by late for show. THIS TIME SWEETIE
chased the pace from the rail, swept the leader entering the lane, was under attack mid-stretch and gave way grudgingly late. SHES MY DESTINY reared
leaving the gate, and showed little. SKYWARD BOUND zipped clear, saw her margins shrink entering the final turn, and yielded. LENT ME FIFTY sat in
range, and faded with two furlongs remaining. KNEW HER AS NANCY offered little.
