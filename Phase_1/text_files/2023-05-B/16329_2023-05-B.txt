Footnotes
SPOTTED BULL was off a beat slow, recovered and chased the pace from the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn and drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best under a mild drive. MR. PETE was rated along on the inside, came two wide into the lane and rallied well to gain the place award.
BAZOO pressed the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, came four wide into the lane and faded late, held show
award. SEANOW set a pressured pace while racing in the two path, floated out and came three wide into the lane and faded the final furlong, missed show
award. PEPE AND HEYWOOD prompted the pace four wide, fell off the pace on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, weakened. CREATIVE
CLOUD was settled early and was two to three wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
BALI KUTA was well placed along the inside behind the front runners to the top of the stretch, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim and made a bid
and got up late after a long drive to prove best. UNCORKED (AUS) set a pressured pace but a controlled one, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by
the furlong marker, dug in late but could not hold off the winner late to just miss. INANNA'S QUEST was allowed to settle while saving ground, then rallied
well late to best the rest. COLOR CRUSH was reserved on the inside, then had a belated rally on the inside for the minor rewards. LIGHTRESS was a bit
rank early while trying to rate three wide, then settled into stride on the backstretch, two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane and had no kick.
WATERWORKS prompted the early pace three wide, then made a two wide bid on the turn, came four wide into the lane weakened in the drive. GALILEI
chased the early pace three wide, then settled into stride two wide but lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
KING OF HOLLYWOOD set the pace on the inside and was well handled, drew clear leaving the turn, then was given two pops right handed with the riding
crop to widened the margin then was wrapped up late to prove much the best. MYSTERY MO stumbled at the start, settled two wide on the first turn, moved
up between horses by the three eighths, then came two wide into the lane and finished well to be clearly second best. AIN'T WASTING TIME stalked the
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened, bested rest. WALK AWAY JOE chased the early pace and was four wide on the backstretch,
three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive, weakened. SEICHE was reserved on the inside and swung out five wide leaving the turn and had
no response, not a threat. GOLDEN GULLEY chased the pace on the inside and tired. SAVVY LAYLA was settled back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SIR TERRE was off slowly, reserved early, made a five move on the turn and came six wide into the lane and closed well to get up in time under a drive.
READY REWARD pulled early on the inside, then rated on the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the turn and was clear nearing the sixteenth marker but
was denied late to just miss. BOCA GUY was steadied early leaving the chute, vied for the early lead between on the first turn, then on the inside on the
backstretch, made a bid to shake clear on the turn but was headed nearing the furlong marker and faded, held show award. RECONVENE was allowed to
settle early, advanced between rivals on the turn, then had to check hard by the quarter pole, then got back into stride and angled out in the lane and had a
late rally. BOOM BOOM KABOOM tracked the pace two wide and came three wide into the lane but lacked the needed winning bid. GRECIAN PHAROAH
was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. UNORTHODOX passed the tiring rivals. HONOR MY WORLD tracked the early pace and made a four wide
bid on the turn and weakened. SEVEN AND SEVEN vied for the lead three wide and then gave way on the turn, tired. MAYOR REMO chased the pace four

Footnotes
MINISTER QUINN bobbled at the start, set the pace while in the three path, drew clear on the turn and then drew off in the drive to prove much the best,
driving. CITI CREEK chased the early pace on the inside, shifted out and made a three wide bid on the turn, but flattened out, held place award. CUP
MATCH was bumped at the start, outrun early on the inside, two wide advance by the quarter pole, then finished willingly on the inside to just miss the place
award. BOYD'S BAND was reserved early on the inside, then eased off the inside and swung out six wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. GET
THEM DIGITS was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide by the quarter pole but had no late rally. FLEETS BAY was allowed to settle early, four wide
on the turn and had no rally. ESTILO CLASICO tracked the pace three wide and then was empty. RYE WHISKEY stalked the early pace and dropped to the
inside on the turn and stopped.
