third. ONE OF A KIND J avoided the wild events of the race but failed to capitalize in a one paced effort. ALICE KAY ducked out four paths early, steadily
asked right handed and abruptly swerved out midway and had to be taken up. FIRST BLUES MAN swerved out to outer rail at the start and had to be all but
