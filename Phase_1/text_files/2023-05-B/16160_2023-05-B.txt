Footnotes
VISUAL MISSION well placed, rallied rallied three wide into the stretch, made the lead at the furlong marker and drew off to win as much the best under left
handed urging. GOLD N SILVER set the pace along the rail through the clubhouse turn, gave up the advantage, shifted out two wide before a half, came on
again on the far turn, battled into the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. NEBULOSA chased the pace around the first
turn, made the lead and quickly drew clear after a quarter, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out late and. PRIVATE DRIVE stalked the pace along the
inside and lacked the needed response. SAMMY DA BULL was no factor. HANSENATION was no threat.

ALFIO chased the pace through the clubhouse turn, assumed command before a half, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win
as much the best under a strong hand ride. R CARDINAL PRINCE chased the pace and finished second best in the five path. AGNELLO'S DREAM well
placed along the inside, went evenly. BOSS BEAR unhurried, swung wide and passed tiring rivals on the far turn. ONEMORANDTHECHECK settled four
wide then failed to menace. SEE SPOT RUN set the pace along the rail around the first turn then was through after a half. HAD RIGHT trailed.

Footnotes
CYCLONE prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead at the quarter pole, matched strides until deep stretch then drew off under mild right
handed urging. CHARTED away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the quarter pole, dug in gamely dueling until deep stretch then was no match for the
winner. C C'S CLEAR CREEK had good early speed then faded. MOBOT trailed.
