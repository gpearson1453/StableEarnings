ground to the turn, angled out for the stretch run while all out for place spot in a good effort. OL' NED off rail position throughout, ran on evenly in stretch for
show. SERENDIPITOUS tried to keep up outside to turn, never a real menace. THE PINK Z brief speed from inside, could not keep up and faded back
inside. JUST TAPIT IN awkward from the gate outside, always far back. STUNT MAN through early, faded back readily.
