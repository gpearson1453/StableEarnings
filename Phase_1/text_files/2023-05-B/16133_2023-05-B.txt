AZUNIA set the pace along the rail and lead all around, merry go round, to triumph in the end. MOR PEANUTS stalked the pace throughout the course
while two wide and held on gamely to the place prize in the end. WAVING BYE stalked the pace in the three path into the turn and was best for show in the
end. FAST TRACK chased the trio of rivals from the inside throughout the course and was no threat. PHUNK reared up at the start, then chased the pace in
last position throughout and was no threat.

Footnotes
EAGLE EXPRESS gradually took command from the fence after the first eighth of a mile, opened a measured, well-rated advantage through the turn,
cleared the field in upper stretch and held the closer safe at the wire. DIAMONDS N ACES rated between horses off the pace to the head of the lane, split
horses and dug in gamely to be closing well late in the drive. CANDY BEE stalked the leaders from the fence in a three horse second flight duel, cut the
corner to challenge turning for home and finished evenly along the rail for the show. SENORITA BROOKE took the early lead from the gate, settled in to
press the pace for a half mile and weakened in the stretch. LEXINGTON DIVA raced five wide from the back of the field through the turn and passed a tiring
rival late. VOODOO MISTRESS chased the pacesetters from three wide in the second flight and flattened out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LET FREEDOM BLING quick early after the first few strides, took command in hand while rated kindly, responded when pressured to hold the lead, shook
clear in upper stretch and was never seriously threatened late. SALT N LIME reserved off the leaders and allowed to settle into stride, split rivals and closed
with a rush to be a clear second best. HEAD OVER BOOTS tracked the pace from between rivals to upper stretch and made late gains to pick up the show.
SWIFT RED BIRD prominently placed along the fence in striking distance of the leaders and failed to gain ground down the lane finishing evenly. SHACKED
STATESIDE moved up down the backstretch to press the pace and duel for the lead through midway on the turn and faded coming home. MISSISZIPPY
BLING circled three wide in the turn to threaten with an early middle move and flattened out in the drive. GEE SHE'S FANCY trailed throughout as a
non-factor.

JIM AND JIM reserved off the pace for the first half mile, moved up three wide entering the far turn to be in striking distance and finished gamely down the
lane to be up in the final stride. AMERICAN SMOOTH took command shortly away from the gate, set a well rated pace on the lead, responded when
challenged in the drive and just missed in a good effort. ONE MORE BABY tracked the pacesetter to the second turn, angled three wide for the drive and
loomed boldly in upper stretch but was out-finished in the drive finishing evenly late. BILLY YANK stalked the pace from the rail to the quarter pole while
saving all the ground and failed to mount a rally in the lane. GIST slow early to trail the field to the quarter pole and showed late interest making up ground in
the stretch. DIRT BIKE SLADE trailed most of the way as a non-factor. WEST TEXAS BOB pressed the pace for a half mile and came up empty tiring
through the lane.

Footnotes
GANGSTER RAP stalked the pace while two wide, then dug in gamely in the stretch to edge clear late and be up the final strides to prevail. A SONG FOR
MICKEY was in a hard drive to lead the way from the start and into the stretch, then gave way in the end. CRYSTAL CRESCENT tracked the pace from the
inside, was moving up on the turn to rally in the early stretch, angled out three wide and was closing well but it wasn't enough. JIBE raced behind the field
into the turn, then bid in the stretch but it was too little too late. SEXY RAGS chased the pace from the inside, then came out three wide to rally in the early
stretch but came up empty. GREY HALO chased the pace while two wide, bid on the turn, then flattened out in the stretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
HOLY EMPEROR set the pace through the first turn, settled just off the pace pressing rival down the backstretch, re-engaged into the far turn, took
command shaking off his pace rival in upper stretch and finished gamely holding the runner-up safe. EASTER SNAP saved ground along the fence for the
first three-quarters, moved into contention on the turn, lacked racing room turning for home, angled into the clear for the drive and closed well to be second
best. DEANOS CAPE broke a step slow leaving the gate, rushed to contention into the first turn, took the lead down the backstretch, battled the winner
through the turn and was out-finished down the lane. GUITAR SLIM well placed to track the pace from three wide to the far turn, was called upon early to
threaten and failed to sustain his bid. CHARLIECANDO raced wide down the backstretch and failed to mount a rally. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY stalked
the pace for a half mile and came up empty. MIDAS CAT slow early to trail and never posed a threat. MISHKO was never a factor.
