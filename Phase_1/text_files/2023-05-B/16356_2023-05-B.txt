Footnotes
RHODESIA was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished with a rush to be up in the final sixteenth. BIG GALUTE vied for the early lead
with Let George Do It from along the outside, opened a clear advantage nearing the stretch, responded to pressure during the drive and held on gamely for
the place. RAMPATIOUS prompted the issue while racing three-wide and finished strongly. AFRICAN PRINCE saved ground while being allowed to settle in
stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally,. SUBITO SLEW was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. MIQUEAS dropped back early and was not a factor. LET GEORGE DO IT vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired.

SMILING THUNDER bobbled slightly at the start, then saved ground, slipped through to take the lead nearing the stretch and gradually drew clear. SEVEN
SISTERS dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, responded to pressure during the drive and held on gamely for the place. RED NOVA vied for the lead
while four-wide and continued on well during the drive to earn the show in a steady effort. HEAT SEEKING LETA was unhurried early, came three-wide into
the stretch, angled to the inside for the drive, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out. SQUARE FOOTAGE dueled for the lead to the
stretch while racing slightly off the rail and weakened. CIELO DIAMANTE was forwardly placed early while five-wide and tired. MO CONNELLY was
prominent early racing between horses and gave way after three furlongs.

SOCAL RED was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, led entering and edged clear late
despite drifting about late. OLYMPIC LEGEND stalked Phillipie Fast early, moved up along the outside to take the lead from that one nearing the quarter
pole, responded to pressure but could not quite stay with the top one late in a game try. SARGENT KLINE was forwardly placed from the start, angled out
four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. SUPER CLASSIC was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining
slightly late. WINTER SOLDIER came four-wide into the stretch and gradually improved his position. PHILIPIE FAST saved ground setting the pace to
nearing the quarter pole and tired. MOONLIGHTNWINE was prominently placed to near the stretch while two-wide but lacked a rally. GUARDSMAN PASS
dropped back early and failed to threaten.

STEPUP saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. SHELBY GOLD chased the winner throughout while racing two-wide, could
not reach the winner but continued on well for the place in a steady effort. PEPPER MILL saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked the
needed late response. JAMIES INHERITANCE saved ground to the stretch while being unhurried, angled out 5-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and
was making up some ground late. MS FLASHY HARBOR raced four-wide on the turn, came six-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. DRIVEWAY settled
in the middle of the pack, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

YOUNG LIFE LAURA rushed up along the outside to join the leaders nearing the turn, took the lead after a quarter mile and gradually drew clear. RAVEN'S
QUEST hopped slightly at the start to get away behind the field, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to be five-wide at the quarter pole and
finished strongly. SHESRSECRETWEAPON was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally.
GOIN' COASTAL was reserved off the early pace while saving ground, angled out during the drive and was gaining slightly late. SETTLER'S COVE vied for
the early lead from along the inside and weakened. VANDULIE vied for the early lead while two-wide and tired. DANCING TO GOLD settled in the middle of
the pack, came seven-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MANY MEMORIES dropped back early and failed to menace.

OUTRIGHT saved ground while being unhurried, lacked room on the backstretch, round room nearing the three-eighths pole, caught Provost nearing the
eighth pole and won drawing clear. PROVOST was prominently placed racing along the inside, angled out on the turn to be three-wide, took the lead
entering, was unable to resist the winner but continued on gamely for the place. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide
nearing the three-eighths pole and finished well in a steady effort. WEAR THE CROWN saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. THE CALABRESE KID was forwardly placed early while three-wide and tired. FRANKS FIX IT prompted the issue
from along the outside and gave way. BEL RAGAZZO dropped back early and was not a factor.

LAFONDA saved ground setting the pace, responded when asked and was all out to prevail narrowly. COASTARANDO was reserved off the early pace,
rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to just miss. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was close up early, check in tight along the inside nearing the
three-eighths pole lacked room, angled out to come five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. PATRICIA L was unhurried early, came five-wide into the
stretch and went evenly late. CRAZY ABOUT YOU was forwardly placed while saving ground but lacked a rally. GOLDEN HALO settled in the middle of the
pack racing between horses but lacked the needed late response. RODEO ROSE hopped in the air at the start, then dropped back, came six-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. GRAZEN DEB prompted the issue from along the outside for a half mile and gave way. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
SMILING GOODBYE prompted the pace set by Polacco, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR
saved ground stalking the pace, was briefly in tight running up on horses nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out three-wide and finished well for the
place in a steady effort. POLACCO saved ground setting the pace to the stretch, was unable to match strides with the winner but held on fairly well for the
show. COBRA JET was allowed to settle while racing two-wide but lacked a rally when asked. EXECUTIVE CHEF was unhurried early while racing
three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. PRAYER OF JABEZ checked sharply and was pinched back at the start when
Hollywood as Usual ducked in, then moved up along the inside to be forwardly placed to the stretch and tired. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL ducked in sharply
at the start, then dropped back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAJOR MUNNINGS vied for the early lead from along the inside, opened clear leaving the three-eighths pole and then was fully extended to just last.
SIERRA MELODY was prominent early while four-wide, came in nearing the three-eighths pole causing interference, continued on racing three-wide and
finished strongly to just miss. FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, SIERRA MELODY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND
AND PLACED EIGHTH. WARFRONT FIGHTER was allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. FOSTER BOI steadied
from between horses while in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back slightly, came six-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. HULA
KING was in tight nearing the three-eighths pole when Sierra Melody came in, then raced two-wide and finished willingly. ROUSING RUBBLE was in tight
along the inside nearing the three-eighths pole and went evenly when clear. KINGSTEN'S GOLD dropped back early and failed to threaten. NATIONHEART
was forwardly placed early, checked from between horses nearing the three-eighths pole when Sierra Melody came in and was unable to recover.
FOREVER GOLD rushed up along the outside to dispute the pace for three furlongs and tired.
