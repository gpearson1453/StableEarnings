TOVIA dueled two wide down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn and widened under intermittent urging in the lane. ROMASHKA
stalked the pace three wide, could not gain on the winner but won the place duel. RUN FOR COVER raced in range in the two path and was one-paced
through the lane to just miss second. BIOTECHNOLOGY lacked speed in the two path, tipped out nearing the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. BREAKING
BULLET failed to menace while racing three wide. LEMON LUSH was outrun while racing in the three path. ADIOS JUDE vied inside of the winner down the
backstretch and retreated inside.

Footnotes
AVELLINO set the pace from the three path into the turn, shrugged off an outer challenger and opened up from the four path into the lane, and was driven
clear. FLORINDIA prompted the early pace along the rail, lost ground and was put to a ride early around the turn, under right handed urging entering the
stretch, and chased on for place. SUGAR N SPICE stalked in the four path, bid under coaxing but was a bit green and swishing her tail rounding the turn,
tipped out to the five path into the stretch, continued to swish her tail and run greenly down the stretch, and flattened for show. SWEET JUDY BLUE trailed
from the three path into the turn, tried to lug in while still in the three path down the lane, was one paced and just missed getting up for show. LAS COLINAS
broke in at the start, chased from the four path into the turn, advanced while floating out around the turn and was in the seven path at the top of the stretch,
lugged in twice thru the stretch, and faded. BRISEIDA was hustled along off the pace in the two path but was empty turning into the stretch.

RACHEL'S ROCK stalked in the five path, bid under a nudge from the four path around the turn, took the lead and opened up into the lane, and held sway.
PRACTICA CAT (CHI) had a slow start, chased along the rail, angled out to the five path at the top of the stretch drifted out under left handed urging into the
final furlong, but kept on to hold place. ADIOS BABY raced off the pace in the five path, was under a heavy drive around the turn, floated out to the seven
path into the lane, and ran on but hung for show. SOY UNA DAMA (CHI) set the pace in the three path, was cued from the two path midway around the
turn, but faded in the stretch. BEATIFUL KARLA trailed in the six path early and was no menace. ANNA'S DREAM prompted the pace in the four path but

BUILT DIFFERENT saved ground in midpack, angled three wide near the quarter pole, took over between foes in upper stretch, kicked clear nearing the
eighth pole and held safe between rivals late. ZISISIT (IRE) saved ground in range, slammed into the rail nearing the three-sixteenths pole then rallied
inside for the place. COUNTRY JEWEL saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled out and bumped RECONNECTING
turning for home and finished well outside of the winner. RECONNECTING raced off the pace three wide, was bumped turning for home and was one-paced
from there. BEASTIE GIRL was unprepared for the start then broke in a tangle, saved ground well back, swung six wide late on the turn and improved
position outside. WICKLOW GAL set the pace in the two path, yielded in upper stretch and was not urged while drifting out through the lane. ONE TRACK
MINE was firmly rated four wide and faded through the lane. MAJOR PRYCE stalked the pace in the three path, was shut off in upper stretch and was
eased from there. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RECONNECTING, COUNTRY JEWEL WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH.

Footnotes
TAPPLE CIDER stalked in the five path, moved up and stuck a head in front while shifting to the three path into the far turn, was cued passing the quarter
and opened from the four path into the stretch, inched away and was wrapped up late. BELLA MIURA was fractious in the gate, rated in the five path,
ranged up under a drive in the four path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. KATZ THAT
GAL trailed in the three path into the backstretch, was ridden along while circling inner foes from the five path rounding the far turn, tipped back in to the
three path into the stretch, and was one paced for show. RISING HEAT was unhurried in the four path, roused between foes early around the far turn,
swung out to the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. SHEA D SECRET tracked in the three path, but lost ground while driven along the rail
around the far turn, and did not threaten. SOUTH PACIFIC raced wellback to the inside of rivals and was no menace while going wide into the lane.
HOLLYWOOD HONEY raced up close under a hold from the four path down the backstretch, but faded from the three path down the stretch. VALIANT
MISS set the pace in the two path but yielded rounding the far turn.
