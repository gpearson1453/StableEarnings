Footnotes
MANO DURA stalked the pace from the fence to the top of the lane, snuck through on the rail as the early pacesetter dropped out and finished gamely up
the inside to prevail in the final strides under good handling. BIG BERNIE pressed the pace from two wide to the far turn under stiff restraint, edged to the
lead on the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch but could not hold off the ground saving closer. FLASH OF GENIUS tracked the leaders into the
first turn from two wide, was kept off heels as the pace slowed checking briefly, ranged up turning for home to threaten but could not gain on the top two.
GOLD PRIZE well placed in mid-pack down the backside and failed to mount a rally finishing evenly. KLIMTOMANIAC saved ground most of the way and
showed mild late interest. STAR SAILOR reserved off the pace down the backstretch and lacked a response when called upon into the turn. EASY BIG
BOY sped to the lead into the first turn, dueled from the lead to the three-eighths pole and gave way. UPTOWN BIGBADJON trailed throughout as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
U. S. ARMY was under a steady drive to duel for the lead with in inner foe throughout then edged clear in the home stretch and held on to prove best in the
end. ALTO ROAD stalked the pace while three wide, then menaced on the turn and was closing grudgingly but could not catch the leader in the end and
was second best. AARON'S SPIRIT chased the pace from the inside, then closed willingly in the homestretch to be up for show. I'M A COWBOY raced from
the inside, then bid on the turn to rally in late stretch and closed gamely just missing the show prize. TEAM LEADER raced behind the field then came out
five wide to bid on the turn and passed tiring foes in the stretch. SOUL SACRIFICE dueled from the inside, was in a hard dive throughout the turn, then gave
way in the late stretch. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL stalked the pace while four wide, then bid gamely on the turn, was used up and then flattened out in the
stretch.

Footnotes
BAY BE GONE settled off the pace near the rear of the field for the first half mile, rallied into the turn closing the gap, angled five wide at the top of the lane
and closed with a rush to be going away late. MOR VICTORY saved ground most of the way against the rail, always well positioned in striking range, angled
out to the clear late and finished well as second best. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS dropped back in the run down the backside losing position, saved ground
into the lane and finished willingly. CINCO RICHIE pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole, took a brief lead in the stretch while drifting out and
back in and finished evenly. MOROLICIOUS tracked the leaders in striking position to the head of the lane and lacked a late response for the drive. CRAZY
RIDGE set the pace for three quarters of a mile, responded when challenged but tired late in the stretch. PHARME'S PHAITH chased the pace from three
wide to the far turn and faded in the stretch. WITT AMERICA stalked the pacesetters through the turn and faded turning for home. FANDO went evenly as
no factor. GOLIATH RIDGE never menaced and failed to mount any threat.

Footnotes
PERFECT WISH chased the pace from the inside under a steady hand drive, then dug in gamely in the stretch and kicked clear of the dueling rivals and
was up late to prove best. D'ORO STREET vied for the lead early from the three path, then tracked the pace on the turn, was moving up gamely to duel with
an inner rival in the late stretch but was out kicked in the end and was best for second. COUSIN KRISTI vied for the lead while two wide, then inched away
to duel on the turn with an inner foe, shook clear of that foe in the early stretch, then dueled again with an outer foe in the final furlong but gave way in the
end. ACCELERATE JUDY raced in the middle of the field while three wide, then rallied on the turn to close well in the stretch. SAN MATEO KAT settled in
the three path then made a mild bid on the turn and was no threat. GATHER THE FACTS settled in the two path then bid in the early stretch and was no
threat. JUMPIN JUDY vied for the lead early, then dueled with an outer rival on the turn under a hard drive, was used up, then weakened in the late stretch.
BODI ODI settled along the inside and was flat throughout and needed rally. COPELANDER was fractious prior to the start, then trailed throughout and was
no factor.

DIVINING HUMOR broke alertly to take the lead in hand quickly away from the gate, set a measured pace the first quarter and drew off at the top of the lane
and continued to widen as much best. CRESSONS LIL CHARM sped up to engage the winner under early urging, dueled into the turn with that one, failed
to keep pace but continued on as a clear second best. COPPER KAN hustled away from the gate to maintain position, exchanged bumps into the turn from
two wide, kept to task and closed ground late. DULCE AMANECER YG rated in mid-pack early, ranged up four wide turning for home and rallied mildly late.
LITTLE ELLIE raced three wide in to the turn, drifted in bumping rival and went evenly from there. SHAKE THOSE DICE backed out after the first sixteenth
of a mile to trail the field by many and showed late interest passing tired rivals in the lane. TAPITSGOTAPISTOL close up to the pace early on and steadily
faded in the stretch. CREAM PUFF REAPER dropped over leaving the gate squeezing rival, raced up the fence only to be crowded into the turn and
flattened out in a tough trip.

STRICTLY CONFIDENT tracked the pace while three wide, was urging on the far turn to menace gamely mid stretch and was up in the final strides to prove
best. BIG WAVE JAMES set the pace while two ide, was in a long drive entering the home stretch but was out finished in the end. SUMMER LOVER
tracked the pace while three wide, then rallied on the far turn from the four path to close gamely for the show prize in the end. SUPREME CAPO vied for the
lead from the three path, then settled back on the backstretch, bid on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it wasn't enough in the end. GOLDBRIDGE was
unhurried early, then saved ground throughout then surged down the home stretch to close belatedly. CAPITAL JOKE raced in the middle of the field while
two wide, made a mild bid on the turn and was closing well but it wasn't enough. PITALE vied for the lead from the inside, then settled back in late
backstretch, bid on the far turn then flattened out in the end. THISGUYCANFLY settled in the two path, was moving up heading into the far turn, then rallied
in the early stretch but came up empty. TREASURE COAST chased the pace from the inside, then gradually lost ground throughout and was no menace.
DENS DEVILLE steadily dropped back along the inside and was no factor. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race, THE RIDER OF BIG
WAVE JAMES CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF STRICTLY CONFIDENT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW, THE
CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. DUE TO A MISPLACEMENT OF THE STARTING GATE THE RACE WAS RUN AT ABOUT 7 1/2 FURLONGS.

Footnotes
AMERICAN XPERIMENT stalked the pacesetter to the top of the lane, was set down for the drive, collared the frontrunner inside the sixteenth pole and
drew clear to win going away. TODDCHERO sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage turning for home but could not hold the
winner off while clearly second best. PINCH ME A PENNY reserved off the early pace, circled into the turn to range up to engage the leaders but could not
gain ground down the lane. UNION DATA chased the leaders to the stretch and failed to mount a rally. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL prompted the early pace
and gradually dropped off the leaders. DISCO DANZING slow early to be at the back of the field and was never a factor. CROOKED FELLOW was never a
serious threat.

CLASSIC KING chased the pace while four wide, vied for the lead from the three path on the far turn, moved up to duel grudgingly down the lane and was
up late to prove best. HOT STOVE LEAGUE chased the pace while three deep down the backstretch, then vied for the lead on the far turn, inched away to
duel gamely with an outer rival down the homestretch but hung in the end. BIG ROJO raced behind the field while saving ground down the backstretch, then
came out four wide on the far turn to surge down the lane and finished gamely for show. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY broke outwardly and bumped rival, then
chased the pace from the inside, rallied from the two path on the far turn then raced evenly throughout the stretch. FRA MAURO settled along the inside
down the backstretch, then bid while three wide on the far turn and closed well in the stretch but it wasn't enough. MAX PANDOWDY was bumped at the
start, then settled in the two path and was no threat. EYES ON RED chased the pace while three deep then dropped back in in the middle of the backstretch
and had no final bid. IRISH EXPECTATIONS set the pace from the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive, then vied to keep the lead on the far turn,

Footnotes
VIOLIN MAKER tracked the leaders from the rail to the far turn, waited for room to angle out at the head of the lane, surged through the opening in
mid-stretch and closed with a rush to overhaul the pacesetter. CAJUN EDDIE sped to the lead into the first turn, rated kindly on the lead to the top of the
lane controlling the pace, dug-in when called upon but could not hold the winner off in a good effort. READY TO ROLL stalked the pace from three wide the
entire trip, loomed boldly turning for home but hung down the lane never gaining ground. EXETER well positioned in striking distance of the leaders but
failed to mount a closing rally. HOLY EMPEROR reared leaving the gate dropping to the back of the field while racing rank, settled on the run down the
backside, swung way wide coming home and showed good late interest with a closing kick. CANATLAN raced wide into the first turn, gained some position
in the backstretch from between horses but lacked a closing response. OPTIMAL TRIP saved ground along the fence but went evenly in mid-pack. MOUNT
KENYA raced five wide for most of the way and never presented a threat. SINGING DIXIE raced near the pack throughout and was no factor. BRATTON
