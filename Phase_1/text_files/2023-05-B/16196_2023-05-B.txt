Footnotes
LOVE UNLIMITED had a rank start, stalked along the inside, angled out and was coaxed from the three path midway around the far turn, took aim from the
five path at the top of the lane, rallied past a pair of inner foes, and was up in the final sixteenth. RANSOM STYLE settled in range from the four path, stuck
a head in front early around the far turn, was under right handed urging from the three path into the stretch, but was caught passing the sixteenth pole to
place. KIT CAN RUN prompted the pace while under a hold in the three path, bid under a drive around the far turn, kept on while shifting to the rail down the
lane, but evened out late to show. REACHING STRIDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, was roused while tipping out to the five
path into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and mildly improved. CARAVANA was held up in the two path, cued midway around the far
turn, angled out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly. WITCHING HOUR travelled in the six path around the first turn and raced in midpack
from the five path down the backstretch, was driven from the six path into the stretch, but faded. ANTRIM tracked in the three path but dropped back around
the far turn. I LOVE IRELAND set the pace in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the far turn, but gaveway. HEART OF THE BEAST broke slow,
trailed in the four path down the backside, and never menaced. GLACIE INHERITANCE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was wellback along the
inside early and could never get involved.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY NIGHT rated in range between foes early, vied two wide into the turn, kicked clear around the bend, opened up in upper stretch and held safe
under a drive. MABEE LUCKYNWILD vied inside of the winner, could not match strides leaving the three-eighths pole, angled out near the quarter pole and
kept on to be a clear second. DOMINEERING bumped soon after the start, chased the pace three wide, angled in leaving the eighth pole and was
one-paced to hold third. DIVINE EXCHANGE had early speed four wide, could not keep pace late on the backstretch, chased four wide around the turn and
churned on through the lane. HARDLY SOCIAL failed to menace while racing five wide. CAPRIDREY played no factor while racing three wide.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE had brief speed two wide. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL was bumped soon after the start, saved ground, stopped midway around the turn
and was eased.

Footnotes
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND stalked in the five path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn, floated out top the seven path into the stretch, bid while
drifting in slightly passing the eighth pole, and was up passing the sixteenth. T VILLE set the pace in the two path, was driven along while floating out to the
six path into the stretch, dug in while being carried in slightly inwards passing the eighth pole, and was caught passing the sixteenth to place. CUPID'S
DUDE chased in the five path, ranged up from the four path around the far turn, angled out to the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show.
FORTY FLASH settled up close in the four path, but flattened from the two path down the lane. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE had his head turned at the start,
raced wellback in the three path but did not factor from the four path in the stretch. DUNNIGAN trailed in the four path early and never threatened. POWER
(BRZ) tracked in the three path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
KHOZEIRESS dueled in the three path, took command from the two path rounding the turn, floated out to the five path into the lane, opened up slightly, and
held sway. DIAMOND COOL stalked from the six path into the turn, ranged up in the five path around the turn, took aim from the six path into the stretch,
and chased home the winner for place. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU prompted the leading duo in the five path, received right handed cues between rivals in the
four path around the turn, and was one paced down the stretch for show. PRACTIKO dueled for the lead in the two path, but faded in the stretch.
POUNCIVAL broke slow, trailed in the three path early, and did not threaten. SUPER UNISON chased while shifting inside into the turn, but was empty
entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LANCELOT pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew clear under a drive. TAPIT BRIO raced in range inside
early and three wide around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner in the lane but stayed on well for the place. STORMY VICTORY raced off
the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. I AM THE GAME was unhurried while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. WORLDS ON HIGH chased the pace inside and tired in the final furlong. MINELLA set the
pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. THIRD MOON failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BLACK SEAL had early
speed four wide and steadily faded.

Footnotes
DAVID'S ROSE stalked in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane, bid under left handed urging inside the
final furlong, and was up in the final strides. OH DARLIN tracked in the four path, was stymied between foes in the three path around the turn, swung out to
the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. GUNESH pressed in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, kept on and took a narrow lead
passing the eighth pole, but was caught by a pair of outer rivals to show. FRENCH KISSING chased in the two path, was under coaxing around the turn,
floated out to the ten path into the stretch, and stayed on down the center. CHLOE'S TOY set the pace in the three path, tipped to the rail and was roused
when challenged around the turn, fought on from the two path in upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. PUPPYMONKEYBABY trailed along the rail
early, shifted out around the turn but was very wide entering the stretch, and did not factor. MISS DOMINA rated in the three path, tipped out to the eight
path into the lane, but flattened. TOQUETHER (IRE) raced off the pace in the six path but never threatened. FAWNING was hustled along in range from the
five path but came up empty.
