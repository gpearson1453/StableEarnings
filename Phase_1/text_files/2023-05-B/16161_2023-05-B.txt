Footnotes
VICENZA GOLD hustled from outset, established an inside stance and denied all challengers for a wire to wire score. COMPUTATION showed reserve in
the early stages by tucking to save ground behind front runners before angling out at upper stretch and earning the place with a late surge mid track.
MISSWISH pressed the early pace from a three wide pose, swung to four wide nearing the quarter pole, rated close up and widest of all at upper stretch,
but was unable to run down the leader in final strides. BLAKE FROM TISH lacked a needed rally after stalking the pacesetter from a ground saving pose.
STAY STRONG loomed off the pace from a two path stance through the opening half, rated three wide at upper stretch and failed to match strides in final
furlong.

Footnotes
SWEET MEDICINE settled in behind frontrunning duo while saving ground, was boxed in along the backstretch, maintained the inside stance into the
homestretch, locked into a stretch duel and rallied along the rail for the victory. SWING WEST rushed from outset and led the field through the opening half,
met a challenge near the quarter pole, locked into a stretch duel , then couldnt fend off the rally of the inside rival in final sixteenth. NOMOREMRNICEGUY
was unhurried from outset, chased the pacesetter from a two path pose, and finished willingly to secure the show. ROYALLY stalked the early pace from a
three wide stance, rated close up at upper stretch, angled out at top of lane, but was unable to gain on the leader. NEEDABETTERJOCK pressed the pace
from a two wide stance, was in concert for command at upper stretch, but retreated in the final furlong. JACKS SPRING BREAK gave chase from a wide
position and lost ground to front runners while doing so.

Footnotes
EURA NORTHERN SKY rated close up between rivals through the opening half, locked into a four way stretch duel, and proved best in the end. SWEET
ATTITUDE trekked four wide along the backstretch and around the bend, rated on even terms for command at top of stretch, then was outdueled in the
stretch duel and forced to settle for place honors. HOORAY FOR CREDIT rushed away from the break, set the pace in concert from a three wide stance,
was amidst the four way stretch duel, but was outfinished by top pair in final furlong. MYSTICAL CODE broke alertly and set the pace in tandem as the inner
rival of four abreast around the turn, was on even terms for command at upper stretch, but backed out of the duel in closing strides. AUNJANUE gave chase
and failed to threaten from a back rated stance. GRAY PEARL trailed the field from outset and passed a tiring foe in late stages. SURFER GIRL retreated
rapidly after pressing the early pace from a three wide pose along the backstretch.

Footnotes
SWEET BAKER rushed from outset to duel for command through the opening half, maintained the three wide pose at upper stretch, was briefly headed
near the eighth pole, then dug in to get the bob at wire for the score. LOVE MY RIDE pressed the pace from a ground saving stance, locked into a stretch
duel at top of homestretch and was outnodded at the wire. STEPPIN SHEP hustled along the backstretch and led the field into the turn, rated between foes
at upper stretch, but failed to match stride with those two rivals in crucial portion of contest. DIXIELAND QUALITY was tardy from the break, trekked wide at
upper stretch, and finished willingly but was unable to run down lead trio. RAINBOW GOLD pressed the pace along the backstretch, rated in the second
flight between rivals at upper stretch, and finished evenly in closing strides. PRAIRIE DOLLAR settled into the second flight, trekked the two path around the
bend, and weakened in final strides. SMOOTH OPERATOR failed to threaten while being unhurried and tucking to save ground. CRAFTY HEAT travelled
wide, lost ground to front runners and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPANISH HOMBRE rushed from outset to share the lead as the inner most rival of four abreast, saved ground through the turn, then refused to lose the
stretch duel and secured the score. MEGA BOND rushed from outset to establish a front running stance along the backstretch, rated up front as the outer
most of four abreast through the bend, locked into a stretch duel, matched strides, but was outdueled for the honors. REMEMBER ME TONY was unhurried
along the backstretch, tucked to the inside to save ground around the bend, then rallied mildly along the rail to procure the show. WIN FOR FUN pressed
the early pace from a three wide pose, trekked three wide around the bend, then gave way to dueling duo in closing strides. TOAH stalked the front runners
from a five wide pose, was asked for more inside the quarter pole, but was unable to run down leaders in final furlong. RONALD DALE trekked the three
path, was reserved behind the front runners, and menaced mildly. MORO MERICA failed to threaten while trekking wide. CATALE STORM gave chase from
a back rated stance, swung wide at upper stretch, and tired in closing stages. YOU SEXY BOY hustled from the break and set the pace in tandem from
between rivals, rated on the front end and two wide at upper stretch, then was pulled up near the eighth pole and vanned off.

and kicked clear in final sixteenth for the score. CONTEMPO GRAY was unhurried in the opening half, circled rivlals through the closing bend and rallied
from a wide stance to earn the place. MY GOLDEN PRIZE trekked wide early, gained command along the backstretch, rated close up from a rail pose at
upper stretch, but failed to fend in final furlong. OKIE HEAT settled into a three wide position and stalked the front runner through the opening half, was
between foes in the second flight at upper stretch, and lacked a needed rally. DARETOCATCHLOVE pressed the early pace from a ground saving position,
lot ground to front runners along the backstretch, trekked the two path at upper stretch, and lacked a needed rally in homestretch. ENVEY N ICE trailed the
field through the opening half, travelled the three path and passed tiring foes in late stages. SWEETASLIFECANBE flashed early foot, led the field from a
ground saving stance through the first turn, then eclipsed in latter half of contest. LIL' BIT OF CHROME settled into mid pack, trekked three wide through the

Footnotes
FRIGERATOR rushed from outset and down the backstretch to establish a two path pose through the turn, gained command at upper stretch and kicked
clear in final furlong. CHEROKEE LEGACY was reserved early on and loomed the front runner from a four wide position before closing with a rush to earn
the place. CINCO STEVE hustled from the break, established a ground saving pose, led the field through the bend, locked into a stretch duel, then was
nipped for place by the late charging rival. HOPGUN gave chase from a four wide pose along the backstretch and through the bend, then gained mildly in
the homestretch to improve placing. AWESOME OUTLAW lacked a late kick after stalking the early pace from a three path stance. HIT ONE OUT was
unhurried along the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and finished evenly. CHARM THE LADIES lacked a late bid after settling into mid pack and
trekking the three path. HUNTER QUICK gave chase from a wide pose and was of little impact. TAG ME settled into mid pack, trekked the two path, and
weakened in closing stages. CANONIZE failed to threaten from a back rated stance. CUATRO MADRES trailed from outset and was no factor.

MAGGIE D'CAUSE rushed from outset, shared early command, gained a slight advantage at upper stretch and finished under a stiff drive for the victory.
SPLITSECONDECISION stalked the pace from between rivals, swung to be widest of all at upper stretch, and finished a clear second. SEATTLE WILDCAT
held on to the show after looming on the heels of the pacesetting duo and trekking the two path around the bend. SANDY CREEK was unhurried along the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, shifted out near the eighth pole and was gaining on leaders at finish. SUPRISING CODE hustled from outset
and established a ground saving stance while chasing front runners from second flight, then lacked a needed rally in closing portion of contest. MS.
MORENA failed to threaten while rating back and trekking the two path. OKIE ATTITUDE travelled wide and lacked a serious bid after breaking tardy at the
start. COMPUTER VIRUS pressed the pace from a three wide stance, lost ground to front runners around the turn, then tired in closing strides. GOLDIE'S
