Yooou Know and just got up under strong handlling. YOOOU KNOW prompt the early pace three deep from the outside of rivals early on, took command
into the upper stretch, had a clear lead near the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the winner near the wire in a game effort. SHEMADEMEBLUSH settled
off the early going, made an advance towards the leaders around the far turn, raced five to six wide into the upper and finished willingly to the wire while
racing from the outside. LADY LANCER dropped back off the early pace, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole, raced three to four wide around the far
turn and raced evenly late. JOB'S NOT FINISHED settled off the early going, raced four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a rally. ARIANA VALENTINA
was hard sent while racing near the rail and faded.

place position late while racing from the inside. SHELLEY'S SONG stalked the dueling trio down the backstretch, raced near the rail past the quarter pole,
shifted out four deep to race off the inside the stretch run and was outkicked to the wire. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was slow early on, raced near the inside
down the backstretch past the quarter pole, angled widest through the stretch run and raced evenly late with no final winning bid. ANIMAL PRINCESS

Footnotes
MISSION KEY showed good early while being handled nicely from the inside to set the early pace, had clear lead past the quarter pole and widened late
under steady handling. ALVY raced three deep through the first turn, angled in to race in rail down the backstretch under a firm hold, hard ridden near the
seven sixteenths pole, raced two to three deep in the stretch and was no match for the winner. ESPRESSO LUNGO settled off the early pace along the
inside, angled to race off the inside near the three sixteenths pole, lugged in thereafter to the rail and had no late gain. HOP AND SCOTCH stalked the early
pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. BLACKWATER FALLS dropped back early, raced three wide past the quarter pole and lacked a
bid. NEVER SILENCED pressed the pace, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

handling. INDEFATIGABLE chased the early going from the inside, checked sharply near the three eighths pole, jockey of Indefatigable claimed objection
for interference against the winner, stewards ruled no change, raced two to three wide in the lane and kept on willingly to the wire. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY
dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, was three to four deep in the drive and noved up. REDEEM EDDIE was void of
early speed, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to improve position. TRULY AMBITIOUS sprinted clear early, raced
near the rail and was empty the final eighth of a mile. REFUND RIGLER chased the pace from the outside, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole
and had no response. TIGER BLOOD raced mid pack early on, was five wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY was slow
early and trailed. Fractional times were unavailable.

BROTHER BRAD tracked the early leader along the inside, shifted out to make a three wide near quarter pole between rivals and finished well to prove best
under strong handling. CONSPIRACY FACT rated along the inside under a firm hold, made a two wide to take command to lead near the seven sixteenths
pole and finished gamely to the wire while racing from the inside of rivals. SUPREME BEING raced off the early going, circled wide into the upper stretch
and finished willingly to the wire. STEADY JOHN stalked the pace, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. STARDUST ZIGGY
dropped back early and failed to respond. WHAT SAY YOU tracked the early pace three deep from the outside of foes and tired readily. ELUSIVE IMAGE
showed good early speed, stopped early and was eased up on in the stretch.
