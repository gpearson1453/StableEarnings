three path, continued close up into the lane then weakened late. GIFT WRAPPED was in the two path through the turn and into the lane, moved closer to
the rail through the lane and finished evenly. SWEET GINGER vied for the early lead along the inside, settled back into the turn and was done in late turn.

Footnotes
LEO'S ROAR was steadied off the inside into the turn, chased the dueling leaders from the three path through late turn, bid into the lane from the four path,
caught the leader near the eighth pole and edged clear late. SECRET RENDEZVOUS was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from
the three path, gained momentum through the lane and could only gain the place spot. WHOSFORJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path into the
turn, moved to vie for the lead in mid-turn, gained the lead in late turn, continued with the lead to the eighth pole when caught by the winner then yielded
late. GOLDEN RAPPER chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, was steadied nearing the eighth
pole when another came in and was not a threat. RUNNING SMART was two wide through the turn when at the back, came into the lane from the four path
then drifted to the rail through the final sixteenth. JACK THE BIRD never a factor while along the inside. JENNY'S BEIGNET chased the pace from the two
path into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn then was empty through the lane. MAS ORO set the early pace while in the two path, vied for the lead
into late turn then was empty.

Footnotes
MILLION DOLLAR CAT chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved three wide through the turn and into the lane, bid when straightening,
gained the lead late and gamely held. AGENT was unhurried while off the rail, raced in the three path through late turn, bid into the lane three wide and
finished willingly from the four path. MISCHIEF LILY chased the pace from the two or three path into the turn, moved closer to the inside for the drive, lost
her path nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed on. DELOVELY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path
as a contender, shifted out inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining to the end. TRIBEST (ARG) set the pace along the inside while on a clear lead,
continued clear with an eighth to go then could not hold sway. COZEE MAGIC stalked the pace from the three path into the lane then weakened in the drive.
PALETA raced in the four path through the turn when asking for more then flattened. ACCIDENTAL ICON was never a factor while near the inside. MISS
LIBERTY BELLE chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then faded rail. DEE DEE B trailed throughout while off the inside.
