Footnotes
ACT THREE settled inside early, moved into range in the middle stages, chased along the inside then tipped two wide into the lane, moved out further in
upper stretch, bumped with rival near the eighth pole, drew alongside SMOOTH SALUTE midstretch, led into the final sixteenth and held YELLOW BRICK
at bay. YELLOW BRICK tracked outside a rival in the two path, inched clear up the backstretch before lacking room behind rivals at the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled out on the far turn and entered the lane four wide, drifted in to bump ACT THREE at the eighth pole, rallied in tandem with that rival and was
outkicked for the victory. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) unhurried from inside, drew closer without being asked on the final turn, cut the corner into the lane,
altered around ADVENTURESOME in upper stretch but still lacked room room behind SMOOTH SALUTE, angled to the inside to find space but had to
steady when that hole close, altered back off the rail late and gained the show. SMOOTH SALUTE came out leaving the gate, chased three wide early, bid
three then two wide outside the leader with a quarter mile left to run, cleared briefly in upper stretch, then was challenged by rivals in midstretch, lost
command at the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the place and show. FOREIGN INFLUENCE sat off the pace in the two path, moved out three deep
on the backstretch, came out further on the far turn and entered the lane five wide but failed to rally when called upon. FAST CHAD dropped back early and
moved inside, ridden along two wide into the far turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. ADVENTURESOME set the pace along the inside, challenged by
SMOOTH SALUTE at the quarter pole, clung to a narrow lead entering the lane, was overtaken soon after, was forced to check by MALTESE FALCON
(IRE) coming over at the eighth pole and weakened. FLAT ON was closest in pursuit from the two path early, chased between foes on the far turn, got
crowded entering the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
MR. SUDS up close early to the outside of the pacesetter, chased two wide through the turn, drifted out a bit from the left hand in midstretch, switched to the
right hand with a sixteenth remaining, came with a late bid and got up at the wire. MR. CHIVAS was away quickly to take control set all the pace on the
inside to the stretch, continued clear under a drive into the final sixteenth, then got nailed a the wire. MIDNIGHT LOVE broke a step slow, chased the top
pair from outside early, rounded the bend three wide, lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong but kept on for a clear third. HANDSOME HARRY was
off slow and shifted in at the start, tracked off the pace along the inside into the turn, tipped out and came entered the lane three wide but failed to rally.
DAWSON was off slow from inside, traveled at the back under coaxing and raced greenly into and early on the turn, settled into stride and trailed four wide
into the lane and was not a factor.

KUORA (PER) was off slow and bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked from inside then challenged leaving the bend, cleared CLASSICAL ROMANCE
in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. CLASSICAL ROMANCE showed early foot to gain command, set the pace off the rail up the backstretch,
led two wide into the turn, drifted to the three path past the quarter pole, lost command at the top of the lane, chased the winner through the final furlong and
held the place. KRISTI'S TIGER stalked from outside early, bid three deep into the turn, could not keep pace with CLASSICAL ROMANCE around the bend
and chased four wide into the lane, finished willingly to close the gap late and almost got up for the place. SWEET HEIDELBERG chased early then went up
to press the pace from between rivals, lost ground around the bend and moved into the two path, then weakened in the lane. YOUTEYOURHONOR broke
slow and bumped inner rival at the start, pulled early and became rank early behind rivals when taken hold of, was guided to the outside, took the turn five
wide and had little left for the drive.

MACADAMIA (BRZ) settled near the back off the inside, moved into range in the middle stages, was on the move three deep on the far turn, engaged
QUEEN GODDESS at the eighth pole, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. QUATTROELLE (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and
moved inside, trailed to the far turn, eased out and came three wide into the lane, moved out further in the drive, rallied and edged QUEEN GODDESS for
second. QUEEN GODDESS bumped leaving the gate, stalked three deep early, drew alongside the leaders in the middle stages, vied for command three
deep on the far turn and gained the lead with a quarter mile remaining, cleared into the stretch, challenged by MACADAMIA (BRZ) at the eighth pole, lost
command with a sixteenth left to run and got edged for second. VIAREGGIO (IRE) was a bit keen early then tracked between rivals or two wide on the
clubhouse turn, chased along the rail then two wide on the second bend, chased in range entering the final furlong but finished evenly late. BELLAMORE
got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside early, dueled into the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole but was
soon overtaken approaching the quarter pole, stayed within range to midstretch then weakened in the final sixteenth. CLOSING REMARKS tracked inside a
pair of rivals and got crowded a bit along the rail on the first turn, continued inside to the second bend, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, lacked room
when running up behind rivals and clipped heels entering the stretch and could not rally after. SCHOOL DANCE broke out and bumped BELLAMORE, went
up to take the lead and set the pace under pressure, dueled into the far turn, lost command near the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the inside into the
lane and faded.

REIQUIST pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader at the quarter pole, dueled three wide into the lane, put away UNCLE REG in upper stretch
and drew off under a drive. UNCLE REG broke a step slow, sent for the front and set the pace under pressure from REIQUIST early, dueled two wide
leaving the bend, could not match strides with the winner approaching the eighth pole and stayed on to hold second. HAPPY TEARS was up close briefly
before dropping back off the pace, raced between rivals into the turn, went two to three wide into the lane, steered out in the drive and was along for the
show. EXTORTION was bothered by TRUEHOOD coming in a bit at the start, chased three deep into the turn, four wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. TRUEHOOD chased the top pair off the rail under coaxing into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened in the stretch run. EMERALD
UNION was off slow to begin, chased a the back inside rivals into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty.

out further and could not make an impact. FLAVIUS was closest in pursuit from the two path early, bid outside at the five-sixteenths pole, took over

Footnotes
DEFUNDED brushed inner rival at the start, took control early inside a pair of rivals, cleared briefly into the backstretch, pressured again from outside rivals
up the backstretch, maintained a short advantage over PIROLI through the far turn and into the lane, responded well to right then left handed
encouragement and edged clear. PIROLI pressed the pace between rivals early, lost touch momentarily into the backstretch, re-engaged DEFUNDED in the
middle stages, stayed alongside through the far turn and into the stretch, fought into deep stretch and could not summon the needed late kick. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE was prominent early three deep first time through the stretch, stalked in the three path around the clubhouse turn, moved up to press three deep
up the backstretch, could not keep up with the top pair and chased three wide around the far turn and into the lane, kept on through the stretch run and held
the show. COUNTRY GRAMMER bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, chased between then off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. SENOR BUSCADOR got bumped and crowded between rivals leaving the gate, trailed two wide early, angled out on the far turn and entered the lane
five wide and failed to threaten. YES THIS TIME got brushed from outer rival then bumped with inner rival at the start, stalked on the inside, dropped back
around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ANISETTE (GB) was off slow to begin and steered to the inside quickly at the back, began to pull and had to steady off heels early, went between runners
on the backstretch, was along the rail into the lane, rallied between foes then inside LADY JAE and drove past late. ULTIMATE HY bumped with outer rival
at the start, raced along the inside and got shuffled on the first turn, blocked and checked behind troubled rival at the three-eighths pole, swung out around
the far turn, tipped out further in the lane, flew from outside but was too late. UNFAITHFUL WAYS stalked three then two wide early, angled to the fail on the
last turn, tipped out and was hemmed in briefly at the eighth pole, finished willingly once in the clear and gained the show. LADY JAE showed early speed
then stalked on the first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backtstretch, reeled in the leader on the far turn and took over late on the bend, put away inner
rival and led clear into the final sixteenth but could not fend off rivals in the late stages. REBEL GIRL tracked along the inside, moved closer around the far
turn, came two wide into the drive, tipped out in the lane to take aim at the leader but finished evenly late. ELEUTHERA got bumped between rivals leaving
the gate, traveled two wide near the back early, moved outside rivals on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GLENALL (IRE)
was off a bit slow to begin, chased five deep early on the clubhouse turn then angled over to the three path while advancing, chased three to four wide on
the far turn and lacked a response when called upon. SPEED LANE broke a step slow, moved to a forward position three deep into the clubhouse turn,
cleared LADY JAE and crossed over to the inside, opened up on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead on the far turn and was collared with a quarter mile
remaining, relinquished the lead back to LADY JAE leaving the far turn and weakened in the drive. EMERALD LAKE pulled and became rank early, took the
clubhouse turn four then three deep, raced between rivals on the backstretch, traveled inside to two wide on the far turn, angled out and went between foes
in upper stretch but lacked a rally in the final furlong. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER bumped leaving the gate, raced three deep at the back early, continued
outside rivals on the far turn and three wide into the stretch, angled inward in the lane and also failed to rally. MAGIC LIGHT stalked three then two wide
early, remained off the rail and spun three wide the stretch and weakened in the stretch run. MA FRANCE (IRE) settled in the two path then moved inside,
got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole, trailed into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
KID AZTECA traveled near the back early on, moved out on the turn and came five wide into the lane, tipped out widest to unleash a rally, flew late and
inhaled the runner-up. KING APOLLO was caught in a bit tight early and had to pause, chased four deep into the turn, entered the lane five wide, lugged in
while taking over at the eighth pole, inched clear into the final sixteenth, had the rider put the whip away prematurely and was run down in the final strides.
VANCOUGAR unhurried in the beginning at the back, raced on the inside then two wide into the stretch, altered out in upper stretch, came out and bumped
rival midstretch, rallied three wide and finished a game third. DANCING RINCA chased three deep into the turn, traveled outside a rival then three wide into
the lane, took over at the top of the stretch and drifted in shortly after, then yielded in the late stages. NERO TULIP (GB) stalked in hand early and moved
inside, tipped two wide across the dirt, bid between foes at the top of the stretch, got floated in shortly after, fought inside a pair of rivals in the final furlong
and faltered late. SUBSIDIZE reserved in the early going, went five deep into the turn, five wide exiting the bend and finished evenly late.
DOITFORANDREW (GB) tracked between rivals into the turn, got blocked behind a rival and had to check around the bend, angled out and came four wide
into the lane, tipped out further in the drive and lacked a rally. AUGUSTA MELODY tracked inside rivals into the turn, saved ground through the bend, asked
at the top of the stretch but got stymied by MASTERMIND, gained a clear path and could not regain momentum. WYFIRE had to steady off heels early,
chased three deep into the turn, four wide into the lane, got bumped by inner rival in midstretch and could not rally. BRADY BOY stalked two wide into the
turn, raced two to three wide into the lane and weakened. MASTERMIND cleared early, moved over to the set the pace on the inside through the turn,
shifted ground and was overtaken at the top of the stretch, then gave way in the final furlong.
