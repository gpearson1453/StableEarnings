Footnotes
TUFANI broke out, stalked the pace, rallied into the stretch, dueled three across late and prevailed in a game effort. SUN BEE was never far off the pace,
rallied into the second turn, bid willingly, dueled between horses late and was outnodded to just miss. CREOLE was a bit crowded at the start, set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. RAGTIME BELLE broke slowly, was unhurried early, advanced
outside, bid and came up empty. DETERMINED GOLD was a bit crowded at the start, was slow early, advanced to the turn, bid inside and had little left for
the drive. GOOD ACCELEBRATE was void of early speed, saved ground to the turn and improved position in a steady effort. CHEZ SOLEIL was reluctant
to load, went six wide on the first turn, raced outside to the second turn and tired. FORTUNE TELLER was fractious loading, went five wide on the first turn,
showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way. MONTANA ROSE raced close to the pace along the inside, tired into the second turn and stopped.

WICKED FINN was never far off the pace, rallied into the far turn, bid between horses in the upper stretch, dueled late and proved best. ROYAL LUCK
(CHI) raced close to the pace, saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid willingly, dueled late and was outfinished in a game effort. BODE'S MAKER stalked
the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, bid gamely, dueled late and was outfinished. FORTUNE'S FOOL pressed the pace, challenged between
horses on the backstretch, got a head in front on the turn and yielded near the sixteenth pole to lose position. MIRACLE SILVER was off a step slowly and
crowded at the start, lacked early speed and closed well late. KOBLA MAS was void of early speed, rallied around the turn and finished well. PETIT FILS
(FR) was crowded at the start, bid inside on the turn and didn't have enough late. SAMUI SUNSET came out at the start and failed to menace in an even
effort. GUNSLINGER (IRE) was sent to the front to set the pace while racing in hand, tired on the turn and faded. MINECRAFTER trailed the field.

Footnotes
R AVERIE LYNN set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead under urging. CABRA CHICA stalked the pace, fell back on the turn, lacked a
stretch response and was no match for the winner. TRUE ATKA raced close to the pace towards the outside, put in a steady effort and earned show while
no threat to the top two. PROSPERA was slow early, rallied into the turn, bid inside and came up empty. MAVILUS was void of early speed, offered a mild
bid inside and improved position. LET'S BE HONEST stalked the pace along the inside to the turn and gave way. TAK E LADY was not a factor. KAREN'S
WAY showed good early speed while racing between horses, fell back, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way.
