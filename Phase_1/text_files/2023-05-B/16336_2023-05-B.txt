Footnotes
SEA HUNTER (IRE) stalked in the five path, was coaxed into the turn, took aim and was cued left handed from the six path in upper stretch, and drew past
a pair of inner foes passing the sixteenth pole to win. MARLEY LUCK set the pace from the two path into the turn, was headed nearing the quarter pole, dug
in from the three path down the lane, but was overtaken by a late charging outer rival passing the sixteenth pole to place. NO NAME DUDE travelled up
close in the four path, bid rounding the turn, headed the leader passing the quarter and was in the five path at the top of the stretch, kept on but was
outfinished by rivals on both sides to show. BART'S DREAM had his head turned at the start, rated in the two path, was under urging while floating out to
the seven path in upper stretch, drifted back inwards, and flattened. CHEERFUL CHARLIE chased in the six path but was empty at the top of the stretch.
VIDIANO trailed throughout from along the inside to around the four path.

TYPEY settled off the pace pace while racing four wide, advanced three and four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and
kicked clear under a drive. KARA AND COLLEEN stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, drifted out turning for home, led to
midstretch, was no match for the winner from there but held for the place. STARSHIP AGENDA was forced out early, raced off the pace three wide, was
bumped and forced to check near the three-eighths pole, made some progress three wide around the far turn, lugged in through the final furlong was up for
the show. PRINCIPIA set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. GOLDCREST raced in range two wide, bid three wide
around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. MADAKET'S ARROW was getting out nearing the first turn, was corrected and angled in
soon after, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. IMAGE OF LOVE chased the pace inside, steadied entering the far turn and retreated. BELLA
FACCIA played no factor while racing three and four wide. DANCING DEB checked entering the first turn and again soon after, raced off the pace three
wide, checked off heels and bumped near the three-eighths marker and had no further bids. WRITTENINTHESTARS advanced four wide around the first
turn, pressed the pace down the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn and faltered.

ORDER OF MAGNITUDE tracked in the five path, circled an inner trio took take the lead midway around the turn, was cued nearing the quarter, opened
slightly from the five path in upper stretch, and was going away late while under a drive. FIRST TEAM stalked in the four path, was ridden along between
foes and bid into the turn, tipped inside and stayed on into the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong to place. AWESOME FLAY settled in range around
the three path, was cued while tipping out midway around the turn and was out in the seven path at the top of the lane, and was one paced for show. CAMP
DADDY prompted the pace in the three path, headed the leader while in the two path early around the turn, but lost ground between foes passing the
quarter, shifted out to the six path into the lane, and faded. SHA TIN rated in the six path, was under coaxing into the turn, fanned out to the nine path into
the lane, but flattened. LEOPARDI set the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail and was challenged by an outer trio early around the turn, and yielded into
the stretch. GOTTA GO GATOR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THATAINT TOOSHABBY rated in the three path, tipped out and ranged up in the five path around the far turn, took aim from the six path into the lane, and
drew past an inner foe nearing the final sixteenth to win. TOWSER was brushed by an inner foe just after the start, stalked in the three path, took the lead
under a nudge early around the far turn, was put to a ride from the five path into the stretch, but was caught by an outer foe nearing the final sixteenth to
place. SENSITIVITY was held up in range around the two path, roused into the far turn, under left handed urging from the two path into the stretch, bumped
twice with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. DOWNBURST got bumped between foes at the start, trailed in three path around the
first turn and shifted inside into the backstretch, tipped back out to the three path around the far turn and was urged into the lane, bumped twice with an
inner foe passing the eighth pole, and evened out late. CINDY'S SONG bumped with an inner foe at the start, then brushed with an outer foe just after,
tracked in the four path, bid early around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. NO DECAF broke out and bumped an outer foe, pulled while setting the pace
in the two path, but gaveway early into the far turn.

Footnotes
THE SKIPPER TOO stalked in the five path, bid under coaxing in the four path around the turn, was under left handed encouragement while back in the five
path entering the lane, took the lead just before the eighth pole, and was driven clear. BIG DADDY DAVE prompted the pace in the four path, took the lead
in the three path passing the three eighths pole, was immediately challenged by an outer foe, stayed on under left handed urging in upper stretch, but
yielded to that outer challenger just before the eighth pole, and was second best. MAGIC ECLIPSE chased in the five path, was driven around the turn,
floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. ANTHRACITE set the pace in the two path, shifted inside and was challenged by an
outer duo early around the turn, lost the lead midway around the turn, and faded in the stretch. UNBRIDLED HONOR trailed along the inside, was under
urging around the turn, angled out to the seven path into the lane, but made no impact. BAILADOR tracked in the three path but was empty turning into the
stretch. GOLDEN TONE was wellback in the seven path early and never involved.

Footnotes
STARSHIP TANGO set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside early around the far turn, dug in gamely under steady encouragement down
the lane, and inched clear in the final furlong. CHANGEORDERSONNY travelled up close while under a hold in the three path, bid under a ride in the two
path around the far turn, ran on under left handed urging from the three path in the stretch, but was repelled to place. ORGANIST travelled in the five path
around the first turn and raced in midpack from the four path down the backside, circled inner foes while driven along rounding the far turn, and kept on for
show. DONTONIO was unhurried in the five path early, roused into the far turn, advanced while tipping out to the six path into the stretch, and finished
evenly. ROUGH AND ROWDY trailed in the three path early, was coaxed between foes into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, drifted
in slightly, and was one paced. AWESOME CITY raced wellback along the inside, dropped further back and was last early around the far turn, angled out to
the seven path into the lane, and was no factor. GUSTAVOR bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path but faded turning into the lane.
STORM BRAVE rated in the four path but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. MUNTALIQ got bumped between foes at the start, moved up
around the first turn and prompted the pace while under a hold from the four path into the backstretch, but gaveway turning into the lane. ENSIGN SKIP
brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path but was empty into the stretch.
