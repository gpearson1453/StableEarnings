Footnotes
GRAND GIZMO sped clear early, set the tempo loose on the lead, began to shorten stride in upper stretch, was put to urging and desperately held on to
prevail. HEART BOY tucked in to the two path early, advanced up the backstretch moving between runners three furlongs from home, advanced on the
leader into upper stretch three wide, loomed a threat but was only second best. STREET MAX got away very slowly spotting the field about seven lengths,
moved up near the inside on the first turn, switched outside foes heading up the backstretch, came into the stretch four wide and ran on to capture show
honors. RARE DISCOVERY raced mid-division between runners two to three wide early, dropped back up the backstretch and into the far turn, kept on
between runners in the stretch to improve position. MANETKA chased from outside rivals mid-pack three to four wide, failed to rally. DOC FISHMAN broke a
step slowly, raced toward the back off the inside, failed to menace. DYNA'S BOURBON settled off the lead racing inside, weakened. BEYOND TALENTED
chased the loose-on-the-lead eventual winner, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
WALTER ME LAD had a good tracking position three wide watching the contesting pair into the turn, bid four wide at the top of the lane, took control at the
furlong marker and was drawing away at the wire. SECRET STORM had a good spot inside watching the top two battle on the turn, waited for a seam as
they straightened out, slipped up the fence at the eighth pole and closed in to be a clear second in the end. BIG RANSOM was away alertly leading the field
in the early going, was pressed outside for the front on the turn, continued to battle on inside for the top spot in upper stretch and finished up willingly
holding onto the show award. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER broke outwards at the start, was on hold between rivals in the early part of the backstretch running,
began to rally three eighths from the prize between runners, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane and closed in for a minor role. YORKVILLE
hounded the pace in the beginning, pressed the issue up front throughout the turn in the two path, was in the mix with horses on either side as they entered
the stretch and faded in the final sixteenth. WICKEDBLACKBULLET stalked in mid pack with a half remaining, advanced nicely on the rail running on the
turn and could only offer an even effort to the finish line. PREETZAH'S STAR was fractious at the break, travelled in midfield four wide on the turn and made
little impact running to the finish line. DEFOGGER broke out at the start, travelled outside near the rear in the backstretch, could not get involved running on
the turn and was not a factor in the late stages of the race. PASSIONPLATE settled in midfield on the rail at the half, was shuffled back inside entering the
turn, was ridden to keep up with runners three furlongs remaining, offered little response and made no impression in the stretch. ARNIE P was void of speed
on the rail down the backside, trailed throughout and could not be a presence in the stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #6 PREETZAHS STAR
AT THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN #6 PREETZAHS STAR BE DECLARED A NON STATRER.

Footnotes
ONE BAY HEMINGWAY tracked the leader in behind near the rail, bid inside foes coming to the quarter pole while coming off the rail a bit leaving the turn,
quickly kicked clear and was kept to the task late. CRUDEN BAY stalked early then edged forward to apply pressure to the leader from outside by the half,
went three then four wide on the turn challenging for the lead late on that bend, chased the winner home and was second best. SOONER LUNAR bumped
with a rival at the start, was encouraged forward between runners, stalked the leading pair from outside three then four wide on the turn and put to urging by
the quarter pole, moved out a bit into upper stretch, ran on to get show honors. KEEP GRINDING bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward inside,
raced mid-pack, asked for more about the five-sixteenths, kept on evenly. POINT TO THE STARS settled toward the back racing outside, shifted six wide
into the stretch, ran on. UNCLE JOE set the pace racing off the rail in the two to three path, steadily weakened from the quarter pole on. GUNS N' ROJAS
shifted in to trail the field near the inside, was encouraged a bit on the turn but had no response.

Footnotes
KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled near the rear on the inside going into the first turn, advanced smartly on the rail down the backside, had a good position patiently
waiting on the fence through the far turn, burst up the inside at the furlong marker and was going away comfortably at the finish for the win. C C'S
KINGDOM cleared the field to lead the pack on the rail into the first turn, set the fractions down the backside, was collared by the winner shooting up the
fence at the eighth pole, offered little resistance and held easily for the runner up position in the end. CHAIRMAN BOB settled on the rail seeing the field into
the first turn, had one rival beat running down the back straight, took closer order inside following the path set out by the winner on the far turn and closed
well in mid stretch passing tiring foes to capture the third money in the end. BET tracked the leader in the beginning, was coaxed to go after the frontrunner
at the half, could not gain on the leader in the far turn, was four wide between foes at the top of the lane and finished evenly holding for a small share.
SOLAR stalked in the second flight outside running down the backside, could not quicken with other runners through the final turn, angled out to be five wide
for the stretch run and could not offer a finish in the end. SHANGASSAH travelled three wide into the first turn, trailed the field at the half, was quite far back
from the pack running on the far turn and showed some good energy through the lane to be not that far off the pace for a minor share in the end.

Footnotes
PENNICK was bumped into a rival at the start, vied briefly inside foes before moving to the lead to dictate terms, was clear on the turn, widened into upper
stretch and held sway while being kept to the task. PARTY was forced in at the start and bumped a rival, outsprinted early, advanced rapidly outside foes
early on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. CALLE REINA was bumped at the start, settled off the pace, raced outside three then four
wide on the turn, ran on to get up for show honors. MIRAMICHI broke inwardly, vied briefly then moved in and chased the eventual winner just off the rail
through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, weakened in the stretch. DYNAMIC STRIKE was ridden along racing off the leaders, came out at the quarter
pole, needed more in the stretch. BOSTON MABEL advanced inside on the turn, came off the rail for the stretch run and flattened out. DANCING
DUCHESS was reluctant to load and fractious behind the gate, bumped outward at the start and continued outward, spotting the field about six to eight
lengths, moved back in and was encouraged forward, was hard to control into the first turn, shifted in at the quarter pole and advanced up the rail in the
stretch. TAPROOM raced off the early leaders between runners, continued from off the inside through the turn, ran evenly and made no bid. UNDER
BUDGET veered in at the break, lacked early speed racing at the back, came off the inside turning for home then moved back to the rail to advance inside a
tiring rival and appeared to hit the rail at that juncture. GOINGTOARUBA bumped the outside rival at the start, chased the leader three wide into the turn,
dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
KAUKOKAIPUU pressed the early lead on the outside, took control with three furlongs from the finish, opened up at will turning for home and cruised to the
finish line for the easy victory. SAMMY STONE stalked on the rail at the half, waited patiently going into the turn inside, was ridden hard two furlongs
remaining, slipped up the fence in upper stretch and closed well to be a distant second at the wire. MAGIC TOMAHAWK was under a good hold in the
middle of the pack early on, picked up the bit between rivals three wide at the quarter marker, loomed five wide when they straightened out for the drive and
closed well just missing the place award in the end. AMAZON FORESTER had a good spot in the second flight tracking the leaders on the outside, took up
the chase midpoint on the turn, threatened four wide at the top of the lane and faded in deep stretch. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE tracked on the rail behind
the early speed duo, switched outside off a fading rival midway on the turn, bid three wide between foes as they turned for home and weakened with
runners on either side at the furlong marker. TIBURON settled in the middle of the pack four deep down the back straight, was roused outside of horses
throughout the turn, offered little run , angled widest to be seven wide for the drive and had no response. C R HOT SHOT stalked near the rear at the half,
was ridden hard on the rail to go after the field three furlongs from home, made little gain on others and finished up inside down the lane. NATURAL
ENERGY was off slow and headstrong in the early going, trailed the field down the backside, could not get in touch with the field running through the turn
and was not a factor in the drive to the line. MUSICAL STRIDE battled for the lead inside in the beginning stages, surrendered the top spot on the rail three
furlongs from the finish and stopped on the fence at the top of the lane.

RYDER RYDER RYDER settled mid-pack inside, shifted out coming near the quarter pole while advancing willingly, was four then five wide leaving the turn
and put to urging, struck the lead outside the furlong marker and was soon well clear while being flagged before being eased up near the wire while much
the best. LAST CALL stalked well back of the dueling leaders racing just off the rail, moved nearer the inside late on the turn before coming out in upper
stretch, was no match for the winner but held the place. ATTABE was allowed to settle at the rear, swung six wide turning for home picking it up and
advancing on the leaders, couldn't reach second but secured show honors. COLLECTING FLATTER was urged forward at the start and immediately
engaged in a duel with an outside foe well clear of the rest of the field, took over from that one with a narrow advantage coming near the seven-sixteenths,
moved clear past the three-eighths, came off the fence a bit turning for home and starting to weaken, was overtaken outside the eighth pole and tired
thereafter. BULSARA switched outside a rival racing outside foes up the backstretch off the leaders, moved in while dropping back on the turn, failed to rally.
RENEGADE REBEL was urged forward from the break and dueled outside a rival with a narrow lead early, began to drop back off that one leaving the
backstretch and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
HEY CUE broke out and stumbled mildly after the start, was relegated to the rear while patiently handled down the backside, circled around rivals at the
quarter pole, was five wide at the top of the lane, full of run to take command at the furlong marker and kept to the task holding safe at the wire.
COHERENCE was content on being near the rear in the early stages of the race, nudged along two furlongs to go, shifted out to the six path for the drive to
the line and offered a solid late run closing well to be a clear second. MOON OVER EGBERT stalked three wide down the back straight, put in an early
move four wide around challengers three eighths from the line, bid four wide turning for home and ran evenly to the finish passing tired runners to get the
third money. MIAH SAID was hustled for the lead leaving the chute, set the fractions down the backside and turn, was collared outside turning for home
,gave way to the leaders in upper stretch and resurged on the fence late to get up for a minor role at the wire. PROUD RONIN tracked three wide in the
early going, moved smartly for the front midway on the turn, had the lead as they straightened out for the drive and weakened in deep stretch. DIRECT
DRIVE broke outwards to begin, tracked inside close to the pace, was roused five sixteenths from the line, offered a brief turn of foot and then stalled
through the stretch drive. ERNIE'S MARTINI stalked midfield while under a good hold at the half, put in a mild run up the rail midpoint on the turn, angled out
to the four path for the run to the wire and made little impact to the finish line. MR. RUDY chased the pace down the backside, gave way between horses
three furlongs from the finish, backed through the field on the turn and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
A GAME settled off the pace racing near the inside and unhurried early, came out a bit late on the turn, moved back in once in upper stretch, found room
between runners at the furlong grounds and swiftly moved through to take command and draw clear. LADY BREW settled off the pace, advanced four to
five wide on the turn coming into upper stretch six to seven deep, was no match for the winner but kept on well enough to secure the place. CURLIN
CANDY tracked the leaders from inside, made a mild bid inside in upper stretch, lost second. KITTEN'S ROMANCE was forwardly-positioned just off the
leaders in behind racing two to three wide, came out a bit turning for home before being guided back inside a foe, kept on late between rivals to secure a
minor award. DIAMOND CRUSH moved quickly to the lead willingly and in hand setting the pace from well off the inside, was challenged by an outside foe
and overtaken coming to the five-sixteenths, drifted out turning for home, fought on four to five wide in upper stretch still within range of the lead but needed
more late. TRADING BAY stalked off the leader from outside, ranged up alongside that one three furlong out, took a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths,
moved out with others turning for home, raced five to six wide in the stretch, was overtaken in mid-stretch and needed more late. SPIDER BELLE lacked
early speed bringing up the rear, swung seven wide into the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. LUZ DE LA LUNA broke outwardly, shifted in and
pulled to a closer position between runners, was held up in behind foes from the nine-sixteenths to the half, had room and put to urging after that racing
three to four wide between foes on the turn, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
BLUE MAX had a short lead on the field but was setting a relaxed pace up top, was uncontested through the turn, opened up on the pack at the top of the
lane and was kept to the task winning comfortably in the end. BIG EXECUTIVE had a good spot from the outside watching the frontrunner into the turn,
chased the winner with five sixteenths to go, could not gain but finished up with intent winning the place battle at the wire. CALL MY BANKER tracked on the
rail behind the pacesetter early on, was roused inside two furlongs from the prize, could not close the gap in the stretch and lost the nod fighting for the
place award. AWESOMECREST broke inwards to start, was steadied briefly behind runners at the five eighths pole, waited for a path on the turn, weaved
through traffic at the quarter marker, finally found clear running room at the furlong and finished up well getting a minor role. KID FORESTER settled inside
in the middle of the pack, was shuffled back on the rail through the turn and ran on willingly on the fence through the lane. HIGHLAND SOCIETY tracked
between horses under a snug hold at the half mile marker, waited behind runners on the turn, found a path at the furlong pole but had little run to give in
deep stretch. CANYOUHEARMENOW broke out at the start, settled near the rear in the early stages, was ridden with two furlongs remaining and never
reached contention. CHELSEA DAGGER raced in mid pack in tight surroundings at the half mile marker, was under a ride four deep two furlongs left to run,
angled six wide to be in the hunt for a share at the top of the lane and weakened in upper stretch. THELONIOUS was squeezed at the break, then steadied
leaving the chute, trailed the field down the back straight and passed a tired rival in the stretch. SUPREMEACTION travelled four wide between runners in
the third flight down the backstretch, offered a short burst of speed around horses at the three furlong marker and retreated in upper stretch.
