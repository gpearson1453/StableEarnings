AMIGOS GUITAR vied inside, shook loose on the turn, widened and stayed safe while kept to his task. HEALY'S HOPE lacked speed, began advancing on
the turn and closed well too late. BOURBON MISSION prompted the winner outside to the far turn and continued willingly. SPLITZVILLE dropped back
early, saved ground throughout and rallied mildly. MR. BRIGGS broke slowly and trailed early then failed to threaten. HOPE FOR GOLD was well placed
behind the dueling pacesetters and faded on the turn. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE chased outside and gave way readily.

KOBE B rated early, bid three wide on the turn, dueled the entire stretch and was just up in a determined effort. HOOPLA hustled to the front, moved clear
before half a mile, vied through the stretch and missed in a game effort. PASSAGE OF LINES settled close up inside, was asked for run on the turn but
flattened out. SECRET PATH trailed early outside then narrowed the gap without menacing. JACOHARE forced the pace to the far turn and gave way.

EXPENSIVE CUT controlled the pace inside, remained clear and edged away late under confident handling. EAGLES CRY reserved inside winner, angled
out on the turn, posed little threat but continued willingly. ROAN MOUNTAIN dropped back inside then rallied mildly for the show. TUNE IN raced close up
outside for three quarters and gave way. SUPER JOHN flashed speed outside for half a mile and stopped. NONEEDTOWORRY lagged far behind and
trailed throughout.

IRISH HONOR chased off the pace, steadied to avoid stricken foe at the five sixteenths pole, offered a late surge to get up in time. EXIT RIGHT dueled
outside, inherited a long lead nearing the quarter pole, widened in the stretch but was caught late. MARGIN OF AIR hustled to the front, faded into the far
turn but lasted for the show. CAUSALISTIC trailed early, raced very wide on the final turn but had no bid. GOOD CULTURE engaged the leader on the final
turn, suffered a catastrophic injury to his right front leg and was subsequently euthanized. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the final
turn.
