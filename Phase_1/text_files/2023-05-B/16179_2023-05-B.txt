Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced on the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the lane, closed steadily in the final
furlong and was along late for the win. APOLLO U ANYWHERE set the pace on the inside, responded when roused at the top of the lane, dug in gamely on
the rail and yielded grudgingly. COOKIN ROSES broke outward, stalked close up two wide, bid onthe turn, dug in between rivals in the stretch drive and
then weakened. RANK AND FILE tracked along the inside, chased inside on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. FANCY EMPRESS was
outrun early and did not factor.

BLAME SHIFTER vied inside for the lead, dropped back a bit entering the far turn, chased, came again outside of MINNESOTA MOON in the stretch run,
dug in gamely, wore down that rival in deep stretch and prevailed. MINNESOTA MOON drifted in some in front of rivals nearing the first turn, then vied two
wide for command, shook free entering the far turn, drew clear, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly late. ICE AXE was off a bit
slow, tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied mildly in the lane and bested the others. GOING AT IT steadied nearing the first turn,
settled off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, moved to the rail in the stretch and failed to threaten. GOLD SMOKE steadied entering the
clubhouse turn, then pulled in the early stages, dropped back on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and passed tired ones. ARMAVIR stalked two wide,
chased on the far turn and gave way. BORDER SPIN steadied nearing the clubhouse turn, went four wide into the turn, then raced off the pace inside and
gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of BORDER SPIN against MINNESOTA MOON was dismissed.
