CHANNEL FURY never far back, rallied three wide through the turn and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew clear under right
handed urging. AYE AYE SIR broke sharply, set a rapid pace along the inside for a half, steadied entering the stretch, altered course to the five path giving
up ground then came on again late. SO DIALED IN settled outside and closed some ground late. LIBERATE pressed the pace two wide, dropped inside at
the top of the stretch and was outfinished. BEER CHASER failed to menace. SHY GUY was no factor. ITASCA had brief speed.

MR. BOUMA pressed the early pace three wide, made the lead entering the turn, shook clear in the four path in upper stretch and prevailed under right
handed urging. AGNELLO'S DREAM never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path and got up for second. GUN LAP had speed from the start four
wide, loomed boldly into the turn then was outfinished in a game effort. CENTSOFWANDER failed to menace. CHROMED IMPULSE battled for the lead
two wide into the turn then weakened. UNCLEJACKOMO dueled for the early lead along the rail, checked entering the turn and dropped back.
