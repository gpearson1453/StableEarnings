Footnotes
ANITA GRIGIO broke sharp to lead soon after the start, travelled kindly up front running on the turn, was headed outside at the top of the lane and battled
stubbornly down the entire stretch to hold safe at the finish. MISS BOBBIT was between runners in the tracking flight with three eighths left to run, took up
the chase with two furlongs still to go, headed the pacesetting winner in upper stretch and dueled to the wire outside making little gain while on the wrong
lead to the line. WAKE UP MAGGIE travelled in mid pack in this small field early on, was shuffled to last while inside entering the turn, angled three wide
outside five sixteenths to the finish, began to find her best stride in the five path turning for home, passing tiring runners and finished up a non threatening
third. J M R BOLD VISION broke slow at the start, then was hustled between runners to chase the loose frontrunner inside on the turn and finished up
evenly to hold for a minor role at the wire. STORMY SUZIE settled near the rear with rivals on either side down the backstretch, made little impact
throughout the turn and had nothing to offer in the drive to the finish line. CARLA'S HONOR was outside runners stalking four deep with a half mile
remaining, offered a brief rally three wide midpoint on the turn and retreated between foes in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SONET'S NAME took control up front leaving the chute, was comfortable dictating the pace on the turn, opened up when asked in mid stretch and held well
in the end for the victory. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was off slow to trail the field in the early stages of the race, started a rail move midpoint on the turn,
shifted out splitting horses three wide at the quarter marker, continued to rally five wide in upper stretch, angled in to the two path for the final eighth and
closed well to be a solid second. STOLE THE RING tracked in the second flight on the rail down the backside, chased the winner on the fence through the
turn and upper stretch to gamely finish up inside to the wire being a clear third. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ settled inside in midfield at the half, roused on the rail
with three eighths remaining advancing up the fence and showed good late interest to pick up the pieces for a minor share at the wire. MAKES SENSE TO
ME pressed the pace three wide at the half mile marker, was nudged to go after the frontrunning winner three furlongs from the finish and was outside in the
five path through the lane to finish evenly in the end. NICOLE'S SONG was in the tracking flight three wide outside of rivals down the backside, coaxed
three furlongs out in the two path on the turn, had no gain on the leaders and faded between runners at the quarter pole. CLIFF'S HEAD was stalking in
midfield outside of horses at the half, was asked through the turn and could not find more to be involved down the stretch. ABSOLUTE JEWEL settled
outside near the rear down the backside, was ridden midway on the turn, offered little acceleration and could not play a part through the stretch.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT VIXEN was relaxed in the middle of the pack on the rail down the backside, circled three wide with three furlongs remaining, assumed command
when the straightened out for the drive and was going away comfortably when crossing the wire. COURTINGCOURTNEY forced the issue on the rail
entering the backside, was reined in nearing the five eighths marker, roused on the fence three furlongs from home and battled between in the four path to
win the place duel in deep stretch. CHEEKY PINT trailed the field into the first turn saving ground, began to pick up the pace inside at the half, waited
between runners with three furlongs from the prize, angled four wide to rally at the quarter pole and lost the battle down the lane for the place share late.
TEXT ME UP had a good position watching the top pair outside down the backstretch, was ridden hard trying to close distance on the leader midpoint
through the far turn and levelled out down the stretch for a small award in the end. FORESTERS PRINCESS led the field in the two path entering the first
turn, opened up some on the pack with five eighths left to run, continued to improve on the lead under a drive at the quarter pole and was swallowed up by
the field in mid stretch. AMI'S LINK threw her head at the break, travelled near the rear three wide into the first turn, was relegated to last down the back
straight and could not improve her position though final three furlongs.

SPRING HIGH broke a step slowly, switched outside rivals and made an early advance outside to maintain contact with the field but still racing off the
leaders, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, rallied widest to take the lead seventy yards from home and drive clear. SMILES FOR DAVID was lightly
bumped into a rival at the start, outsprinted early, shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved some ground near the inside early on the turn, angled out six
wide past the quarter pole, rallied along with and inside the eventual winner but was no match for that one while second best. SPEED CHESS prompted the
pace from outside, went two to three wide on the turn taking command coming past the quarter pole, was clear through upper stretch, collared nearing the
seventy-yards marker and outkicked. GIVE ME THE BOOTS broke a step slowly, was coaxed forward inside, chased from in behind the leading pair inside
foes in the second flight into the turn, moved out four wide leaving that bend looming a threat at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit in the lane and flattened
out. ASHLEE'S RING was just lightly bumped at the start, chased from between runners in the second flight about three wide into and on the turn, moved
out five wide leaving that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SWEET BOMBOLINI broke a bit awkwardly, brought up the rear racing off the rail, moved in a
bit in upper stretch and ran on. FRAC TALES bumped a rival lightly at the start, set a pressured pace racing inside, came up empty.
DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE raced outside the second flight mid-pack into the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
JMR PURE SENSATION settled mid-pack racing two to three wide, was between runners midway up the backstretch, switched outside foes leaving the turn
coming five wide into upper stretch with aim on the leader, drifted in just the slightest bit in upper stretch but rallied to take the lead a sixteenth out and drive
clear. NIKKI NOOTS attended the early pace from outside then took charge to force the issue from outside, moved clear turning into upper stretch, drifted
out just a bit at that juncture, was outkicked by the winner but kept on and just saved place. GROOM LAKE was held up in behind runners in the early going
racing a bit awkwardly in that position, settled down soon after to track the leaders mid-pack and inside foes, moved out three wide turning for home, was
guided out a bit further at the eighth pole as the leader drifted out some, kept on while trying to collar that one for the place but missed. STRONGER
TOGETHER was bumped at the break and a tad slow to gather, gained forward position outside the second group on the first turn, advanced to the flank of
the leading pair three to four deep on the far turn and was ridden along from the five-sixteenths, steadied slightly when in tight near the furlong marker and
altered outside the eventual winner at that juncture, ran on but needed more. I AM RESILIENT raced off the pace inside, came out in upper stretch, was not
a threat. ROBITAILLE was in just a bit tight between runners at the start, steadied on heels soon after just prior to heading iinto the first turn, trailed the field
and was never near enough to threaten. BAYTOWN ELVIS bumped a rival at the start, was coaxed forward to clear and angled to the rail entering the first
turn setting the early pace, was soon overtaken and pressed from inside up the backstretch, steadily weakened. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF STRONGER TOGETHER AGAINST JMR PURE SENSATION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND
RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH VINO broke out on the start to trail leaving the chute, put in an early four wide move around runners nearing the half, was outside taking
command at the midway point on the turn, opened up on the field turning for home and increased the lead crossing the wire. FOREST MAIDEN had a good
spot watching the contesting leaders at the four furlong marker, was ridden to go after the top pair nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to be four wide at the
top of the lane and ran on well edging away for the place share at the finish. WAR'S END KISS broke out to begin, settled near the back of the pack with a
half remaining, was on hold on the rail into the turn, found a seam on the fence two furlongs out, shot on through, shifted out to the three path between foes
in the stretch and closed in for third money. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN travelled in mid pack between horses down the backstretch, found a seam four wide
with rivals on either side two furlongs from the finish, was in the mix in upper stretch for a share and finished evenly getting a small role in the end. CELTIC
REVIVAL set the pace down the back straight, put away an early outside foe at the seven sixteenths marker, braced for the challenge outside by the winner
in midturn and yielded on the fence at the furlong marker. A GAL FOR T J trailed the field four furlongs from the finish, travelled three wide making little
impression outside on the turn, angled out five wide at the top of the lane and passed tired runners in the stretch. GOLDEN TRAIN was pushed out at the
break, kept the early leader honest just outside running in early backstretch, began to give way seven sixteenths remaining and weakened between foes at
the quarter pole. MORE GELATO travelled in the middle of the pack three wide in the beginning, was scrubbed on five sixteenths from the line, made no
gain and was a non factor down the lane.

Footnotes
FEDALIA missed the break to trail at the start, patiently settled at the rear down the backside, began to pick up runners midway through the turn on the rail,
found a seam shifting out to the three path in mid stretch, burst between horses to the lead at the sixteenth pole and was widening in deep stretch.
CHASING JOY lead from the onset, kept an outside challenger at bay throughout the turn, continued to gamely battle up front in upper stretch but could not
find more to repel the late surge of the winner in the final stages. BABY MO sat just outside hounding the frontrunner into the turn, closed in to be a head off
the lead when turning for home and could not find more late to threaten the top pair at the finish. CEDAR VALLEY was situated on the rail watching the top
pair in the early stages of the race, waited behind the leader on the fence running on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and when clear had
no run to give. SUBZERO PLUS travelled in the middle of the field racing inside down the backside, was ridden for more between foes halfway through the
turn, offered a mild turn of foot and could not be a presence five wide running to the wire. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD stalked three wide outside near the back in
the beginning, made little impact four wide on the turn, was six wide for the stretch drive and came up empty down the lane.

Footnotes
MY GIRL GABBY chased the early speed, accelerated three wide when the pace quickened at the two furlong marker and wore down the leader through
the entire stretch to get up for the prize just before the line. GETTING AHEAD set the fractions from the onset, stubbornly battled up front with pressure on
either sides turning for home and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch to the winner. SWEEPING PASSION had a good position on the rail watching the top
two into the turn, waited for the right time to pounce inside at the quarter pole, made a gutsy stretch run at the furlong marker to bid for the lead only to come
up short settling for a solid third placed finish. SANDY GRACE settled near the back of the pack with a half mile remaining, put in a middle move around
foes running on the turn and was one paced in the stretch drive. MISS MOLLY LALOU tracked three wide in midfield going into the turn, loomed four wide
when straightened out for the drive to the wire and stalled in the final eighth. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE had a poor start, broke inwards, head cocked trailing
the field considerably in the early stages, was ridden to get into contention at the half and had nothing to offer in the stretch due to trying to overcome her
bad break. PRINCESS DIDI travelled just off the rail midfield down the back straight, could not make any headway on the turn and was not involved for the
stretch run.
