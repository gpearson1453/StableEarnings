Footnotes
LUV MAP was off a step slow at the start, rushed up while racing five wide into the first turn, took over the lead near the midway point, lost command turning
for home, stayed within striking distance, dug back in gamely and got up late. HOT SUMMER DREAM led the way in early stages then lost command to
LUV MAP midway up the backstretch, remained up close then took back control entering the lane, led the way by a slim margin then got denied in final
strides. SAENGER STAR settled through early stages, saved ground around the final turn, raced in contention and sustained a steady bid. BOOTLEGGING
GIRL tracked the early pace, hustled up two wide late on the far turn then flattened in the lane. COWGIRLLOVER raced four wide around the first turn and
raced in range up the backstretch, given cue late on the far turn and failed to respond. SOPHIE'S STAR raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
DEMIDANU quickly advanced to duel inside of GIRLS IN CHARGE shortly after the start, battled on around the turn, shook free turning for home, had plenty
left in reserve and pulled away. GIRLS IN CHARGE broke on top then quickly took on the challenge from DEMIDANU, dueled with rival into the turn, could
not match strides entering the head of the lane, stayed on and just lasted for place. TAPTHATLUCK tracked the top two embattled leaders, launched a three
to four wide bid late on the turn, sustained action into the lane and just missed place. PEGGY RULES bobbled slightly at the start and raced off the top trio,
hustled up three wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. BUG A BOO trailed in early stages, hustled along three to four wide into the
lane and failed to threaten. BAYLEYWICK raced in early contention tracking the top pair, given cue two wide near the quarter pole, failed to respond and
gaveway in the lane.

Footnotes
BREW CASA was allowed to settle through early stages, made a move near the three eighths pole, quickly advanced four wide late on the turn, took
command near mid-stretch and finished going away. SOCIAL CIRCLE advanced along the rail just after opening stages and remained forwardly placed, cut
the corner entering the lane, held the lead in upper stretch then failed to be a match when the winner took over. CHAMPAGNE BLING bumped with rivals at
the start, raced in early contention then lost a couple spots entering the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with response. BOLD LEGEND
raced in range between rivals in early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane but lacked the needed kick for impact.
JACK'S PARTY GIRL bumped with rivals at the start, advanced near the three eighths pole, came two to three wide into the lane and evened out. GAME
TO PLAY showed brief response then retreated. JAGGED ARROW showed brief speed then came up empty.

KOSELIO was allowed to settle near the inside in early stages, picked up the pace and shifted out near the quarter pole, swung five to six wide into the lane,
rallied along the outside and got up in final stride. GALACTIC EMPIRE was nicely rated racing along the outside not far from the frontend, moved up four
wide to race within striking distance, dueled for the lead in upper stretch, edged ahead then got nailed by KOSELIO. MORANT vied four deep for the lead in
early stages, battled on three wide into the stretch, dueled with GALACTIC EMPIRE past the furlong marker then weakened in final stages. ASHWINS ORB
saved ground racing in the second flight, shifted out late on the turn, hustled along into the lane but lacked the needed response for impact. BRILLIANT
COLORS vied three wide in early stages, battled on around the turn then tired in the lane. AMBASSADOR MIKE was unhurried, swung wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. SKYLINE dueled between rivals into the turn then came up empty in upper stretch. SPRY CHARLIE dueled inside rivals for the early
lead, battled on around the turn then retreated in the lane.

SNAP'N TAP tracked the early pace, advanced four wide into closer contention near the quarter pole, rallied along the outside through the stretch and got
up late. KNIGHT COMMANDER tracked in good position, raced up close two wide around the turn, launched a bid upper stretch, steadily edged up closer,
finished gamely and just missed. CHOOS UR ADVENTURE set a pressured early pace, shook clear around the turn, held clear command at the eighth
pole, weakened late and got denied. SMART N INTUITIVE raced off the early leaders, swung four to five wide into the lane and needed more for impact.
SCRUTINIZER raced in contention, hustled up three wide at the quarter pole, failed to kick on and weakened in the lane. UNCLE CHAD trailed through
early stages, raced three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. SHUT UP MAN raced up close in opening stages, steadied, faded and showed
little after. SHIP BOSS vied two wide for the early lead, could not match strides around the turn and tired in the drive.

BODE BY YOU held a slim lead shortly after the start then edged ahead and set the uncontested pace, continued on top and remained unleashed around
the turn, saved ground entering the lane, roused for more, responded willingly and pulled away. R ONE WINE tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch and
edged a bit closer around the turn, hustled up two wide entering the lane, sustained a steady bid but was no match for the clear winnder. CHAI TEA hopped
and came away slowly spotting the field several lengths, trailed through early stages, picked up the tempo heading into the lane and gained a share.
SABRIA raced off the early pace, cut the corner entering the lane and ran along evenly through the stretch run. TRIP TO FREEDOM showed brief response
in early stages then steadily retreated.
