CAJUN LOVER quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn, tired in the stretch and just lasted while kept to a drive. DALTON angled inside rallying on the
turn then closed strongly just missing. DATHOSS moved four wide down the backstretch and continued well to the finish while no threat. IMA PHAROAH
chased the loose pacesetter between rivals and came up empty. LITTLE HARBOUR was urged close up in the opening quarter then began fading on the
turn. FIRST RULE trailed early then narrowed the gap while no threat. REJECTED AGAIN was in tight just after the start, moved inside on the turn and was
outrun. MACH TRIAL lacked speed and trailed much of the trip.

STARSHIP BLANCA settled behind the dueling leaders, split rivals into the stretch and clear driving. VALERIE FIRST broke slowly, saved ground, faded on
the turn then came again in the stretch to gain place. SIZZLING ROMA angled inside early, loomed a stretch threat but was outfinished. SUGAR STREAK
settled off the pace, moved very wide on the turn and tired. GAVICHI alternated for the advantage inside and gave way stretch. BOCA ROYALTY trailed
briefly, swung very wide on the turn and lacked a bid. LIL MISS HOTSHOT led narrowly outside and stopped after half a mile.

LONG LEGGED BOY shook loose after a quarter mile, began widening on the final turn and remained well clear through the stretch. SIR CUPID settled off
the pace, moved inside in the stretch was just up for the place. SENSIBLE JIM trailed early, moved wide, went after the winner on the final turn then faded.
KING SWANSBORO rated close up inside for half a mile and gave way. BLACKWATER FALLS lacked speed, raced very wide on the final turn and was no
factor. SHOW EM THE LIGHTS pressed the winner for three furlongs then stopped abruptly.

back inside, split rivals rallying in the stretch closing the gap too late. SHETALKSTOMUCH trailed in the opening quarter, advanced inside and finished well
along the rail. DENALI RAE dueled between rivals down the backstretch and weakened late. SKERRETT alternated for the lead inside to midstretch and
faltered. PEYTON'S COLLEGE chased five wide throughout and flattened out in the stretch. CUP OF LIFE forced the pace outside, was in tight tiring on the
turn and had no further response. XENATOWN lacked speed and was never in contention. WISHING ONA PRAYER raced just off the pacesetters three

Footnotes
BEACHWALKER settled off the pace, swung wide rallying on the turn, bid extremely wide then surged away in the final furlong. GOLDEN SPOKE outrun
early, advanced four wide on the turn and closed well. KHOZY MY BOY broke very slowly, rushed to contention inside and continued willingly.
JEBOLOGIST hustled to the front, dueled through the turn then tired through the final eighth. FAST BOB lagged far behind then passed fading rivals.
ABUELO NUNO raced just off the pace four wide and faltered. CLASSY AMERICAN forced the pace outside for half a mile and faltered. STONEGATE
raced just off the pace between rivals and gave way. HIDDEN PROMISE raced wide and weakened steadily. PER THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, FAST BOB HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

HENRYTHETHIRD rated inside, took over after half a mile then widened quickly and pulled away driving. FORMAL ORDER dropped back early, rallied
inside to gain the place. SCOOP DAWG settled off the pace three wide and lacked a solid rally. FIRE'S FINALE led early inside then began fading on the
final turn. STRUM AND PLUCK lagged far behind then passed tiring rivals. MARKET DEVELOPMENT raced outside and weakened steadily. CAPE MAY
STYLE trailed for three quarters and was never a factor. LARGE pressed the pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly.
