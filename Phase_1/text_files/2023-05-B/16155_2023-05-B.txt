Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY rated from outside early, took the advantage outside G CITY WARRIOR when allowed on the bend, steadily opened up under urging in the
lane and was kept to task until nearing the wire. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was steadied when her path was taken before finishing the first furlong, altered
out, found herself boxed in approaching the turn, stayed in path three through the bend, was forced out some upper stretch, rallied the last eighth and drew
away for second the final sixteenth. G CITY WARRIOR vied for the early lead from outside, angled in nearing the quarter pole, could not stay with LIL BIT
TIPSEY upper stretch, angled out some inside the last eighth and began to gradually drift out as she wore down in the late going. SWEET JUSTICE was
hustled to contest the pace from inside but began to wear down before finishing three furlongs. ROMANTIC BEAST broke well but soon trailed and steadily
retreated after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
CAMARGO shared the lead in hand between horses, was let out two wide on the second turn, battled outside ZARMAE in the lane and began to edge
ahead the final sixteenth. ZARMAE moved to the inside on the backstretch and soon shared the lead, fought gamely through the stretch, did not have
enough left the last sixteenth but stayed clear for the place. INDEFENSIBLE was settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, angled out approaching
the quarter pole, rallied in the stretch, took over third inside the final furlong then gradually drifted out the last sixteenth under left-handed pressure.
SHANGHAI SILVER bumped with FUTURE VISION at the break, vied for the lead briefly outside CAMARGO, moved to the inside after a half mile, swung
out to path three for the stretch run and ran evenly. FUTURE VISION bumped with SHANGHAI SILVER at the start, contested the early pace from outside
but began to steadily yield before finishing three furlongs.

FASTNFURIOUS soon took a clear lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was let out nearing the end of a half mile, drifted out to path four
entering the lane and gradually opened up under a drive. CHEEKERS broke alertly but outward, was straightened, soon overtaken from inside, went for the
lead outside FASTNFURIOUS on the turn, was forced out some into the stretch, no match for the latter but proved easily second best. KITTEN'S CLOWN
failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY steadily yielded from outside.

BETHY shared the early lead in hand from just off the inside, was roused leaving the quarter pole, floated out to path four entering the lane, edged ahead
upper stretch and kept TROUBLE FINDS ME under steady handling. TROUBLE FINDS ME shared the lead, also in hand, outside BETHY from the
beginning, put to urging leaving the bend, forced out to path five into the stretch, retreated slightly, did not relent the rest of the way but lacked the needed
late kick. MARIA'S GIFT hesitated then appeared to make a small leap just after leaving the gate, did not recover quickly, though urged along, picked up her
pace after two furlongs, had the rail on the turn, floated out for the stretch run, moved back toward the inside inside the last eighth and was closing in on the
top pair.

Footnotes
MAZLAN shared the early lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, floated out some into the lane and maintained control under steady
urging. OH LA DE DA was a step slow at the break then brushed by DARK ATTACK a few strides from the gate, advanced from outside, lost ground four to
five wide through the turn, lugged in some upper stretch and steadily drew away from the others the last furlong. DART ATTACK drifted out a bit to brush
with OH LA DE DA just after the start, settled inside, lodged her bid along the rail upper stretch to gain third and a striking position with a furlong left then
could only just hold her position. W W VALID raced in the second flight from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, angled in some into the stretch and
gave way. BEE A WINNER chased from just off the inside, was in path three on the bend, lost considerable ground staying outside PRINCESS MAE
entering the lane and only passed tired ones from the middle of the track. GULF BENDER displayed early speed outside MAZLAN, did not keep up on the
turn, began to fade as she floated out leaving the bend, was checked quickly when her path was taken upper stretch then continued to yield. PRINCESS
MAE hustled along early, helped prompt the pace from between rivals on the backstretch, gave way on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and steadily
faded.

Footnotes
SNOOZER moved up quickly between rivals to gain the lead after a furlong, was roused from just off the rail on the bend, lengthened command, floated out
some for the stretch run, slowly drifted out despite right-handed pressure inside the final eighth but maintained control. EMPTY HOLSTER advanced from
inside on the turn, battled for second in the lane and narrowly kept MON AMI FUZZIE at bay for the place. MON AMI FUZZIE in contention early from
outside, angled in beside EMPTY HOLSTER to take the bend, fought gamely for second through the stretch but did not have enough in the waning yards.
DEMAND RANSOM broke in stride and was hustled to the inside, lost the lead after an eighth, moved outside SNOOZER at the half mile marker and
flattened out for the drive. STORMIN EL PRADO was an early factor but faded from outside on the bend.

Footnotes
MISS KITTY PIE broke a bit inward, was kept close, moved outside the early speed after a furlong, quickly advanced three wide on the turn, angled in
beside NAPABIT midway on the bend, moved clear entering the stretch, lengthened command under urging and was kept to task until the waning yards.
LUTION chased from outside, retreated further from just off the rail on the bend, angled in some for a clear path at the top of the lane, made a strong move
and edged ahead for second the final seventy yards. COMMISSIONER GULCH slow to find her stride early, came into contention between rivals on the
turn, fanned out to path four into the lane, drifted out some upper stretch, was straightened then could only widen her hold on third late. NAPABIT vied for
the lead from inside, could not stay with MISS KITTY PIE leaving the bend, swung outside the latter for the stretch run and flattened out between horses the
last furlong. REBA ATTACK moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, reached contention along the rail on the turn, fanned out to path four entering
the stretch and also flattened out. MADELYN ATTACK displayed early speed outside NAPABIT, slowly began to yield after three furlongs, was checked
briefly when MISS KITTY PIE took her path midway on the bend, floated out leaving the turn and steadily gave way. TINA'S TAPIZAR was a factor between
horses on the backstretch, faded three wide on the bend, swung out widest into the lane and lugged in as she was coasting in the late going. The rider of
MADELYN ATTACK lodged an objection alleging interference from MISS KITTY PIE midway on the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that
claim of foul.
