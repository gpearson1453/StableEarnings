Footnotes
CRYO rated between rivals while in range, tracked the trio of leaders while confidently handled leaving the three eighths, angled four wide approaching the
stretch, responded when shaken up and forged to command nearing the furlong grounds, eagerly kicked away under right handed asks and was kept alert
to the wire. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI broke sharply and dueled to the inside of rivals, came under a serious ride entering the lane, lost command nearing the
eighth pole but kept on with interest and held down the place. GREAT DAYS AHEAD rated inside and off the contested pace, edged up along the rail in mid
stretch, angled out and finished up with good energy. SPONSORED , brushed at the start, raced three deep nearing the turn, was pushed along mid turn,
dropped back some into the lane, altered out but failed to drum up a serious run. ZEN MASTER broke a step slow, lost ground four to five wide and failed to
menace. PHRA PHROM , three deep contesting the pace, failed to kick on with the leaders soon into the stretch and gave way through the final furlong.
MOCEPHUS brushed with SPONSORED leaving the gate, vied between rivals to the head of the lane then retreated.

Footnotes
OUR LIBERTY BELLE well off the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path turning for home, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. DAISY
MY NAME , a forward factor three deep around the turn, gained the lead outside horses near the eighth pole and continued willingly. LADY ENSIGN
bumped NAMI when drifting in soon after the break, prompted the pace outside CORA'S CHOICE around the turn and weakened the final furlong. NAMI ,
jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, angled to the five path in upper stretch, failed to e a factor and drifted in near the
sixteenth pole. PEACHESSWEETNOTION , fractious during the post parade, was outrun and raced between horses in the stretch. GAVE , along the inner
rail entering the turn, gave way leaving the turn. CORA'S CHOICE bumped NAMI when bearing out leaving the starting gate, sped to the lead, hugged the
inner rail and faltered after a half mile.

IT'S VIPER rated off the rail into the first turn, dropped in some nearing the backstretch then steadied off heels nearing the five and a half furlong marker,
came out some around the final turn, angled five wide into the stretch, gobbled up ground under strong handling leaving mid stretch, forged to command in
deep stretch and drew clear. ADERO prompted the pace between rivals, gained a slim lead near the five sixteenths, shifted in and was driven clear soon
into the lane, kept on under solid asks past mid stretch, kept on gamely and held down the place. ELDEST SON , forced out entering the first turn,
regrouped then edged up between rivals, pursued the leading trio past the five sixteenths and churned on. TIME TO CRUISE broke a step slow, raced three
deep in range heading to the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and continued with effort. MORETHANREADYEDDIE steadied soon after the break,
steadied off heels and got out bothering ELDEST SON into the first turn, moved up three deep and attended the pace, dropped in a path pressing into the
stretch, stayed willingly past mid stretch then weakened. NO EASY DAYS set a pressured pace towards the rail, took more heat leaving the far turn then
dueled, stayed on to upper stretch then weakened. MASTER OF NONE , tucked up inside tracking the leading trio, was pushed along trying to hold position
past the three eighths, failed to kick on and dropped back through the lane.

SOLVING PROGRESS , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, gained a short lead
approaching the eighth pole then drew out under pressure. BROOKLYN GIRL , outside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung to the four
path leaving the turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and passed tired foes. DETERMINED EMPIRE , bumped by ZIPPY DO DA DAY, saved ground on both
turns, eased off the rail entering the stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and passed tired horses. HIGH STICK chased the pace, bid for the lead in the two
path between horses leaving the far turn, remained in contention to mid stretch and gave way. ZIPPY DO DA DAY bore out at the break, made the early
lead, hugged the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch. NONNA'S TIRAMISU , never a factor, dropped back entering the stretch and was eased. SMOKE N
SIN trailed.

Footnotes
PRAY FOR THE U S A , well off the rail on the turn, was in hand waiting for room approaching the stretch, moved to the four path at the head of the stretch,
swept to command under urging in mid stretch then readily drew off. QUEEN OF CLASS , four wide on the turn, rallied. EXTRA CRUNCHY , three wide on
the turn, opened up mid way on the bend and gave way the final furlong. O SHAUGHESEY , a forward factor in the two path between horses entering the
turn, was in narrow quarters near the three eighths pole, chased the pace and weakened. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL was outrun. SALAMINA showed speed
along the inner rail and faltered entering the stretch.
