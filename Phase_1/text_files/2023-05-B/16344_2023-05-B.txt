Footnotes
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , showing improved speed, set the pace outside CALL ME MAESTRO down the backstretch and around the turn then drew off
with something in reserve. CALL ME MAESTRO bumped NO ME DIGAS when bearing out at the break, was sent down the backstretch, hugged the inner
rail, prompted the pace and weakened late. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung outside in mid stretch and
passed tired foes. HIGHLAND DREAM , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. NO ME DIGAS , bumped leaving the starting
gate, was outrun and swung to the four path approaching the stretch. LITTLE BAY , along the inner rail most of the trip, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
ACT OF CONGRESS was guided inward in the opening furlong, cleared and set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when set down in upper stretch,
spurted away leaving the eighth pole and continued with good energy to the wire while kept to task. GIFT OF GAB broke a step slow, was sent up between
rivals soon after and gained a forward spot, rated close while saving ground leaving the far turn, eased out to pursue past the quarter pole and gave game
chase to the wire. GATITA SUAVE was hustled up between runners early then prompted outside the winner, chased three wide into the lane then went
evenly through the final furlong. LITA , in close at the break, steadied when in tight quarters in the opening furlong, saved ground leaving the far turn, raced
two wide into the lane, dropped back in and finished with good energy. MYSISTERNANCY , three to four wide pursuing the pace, faded a bit through the
drive. CAROLINA SUN was checked sharply when put in tight leaving the four and a half furlong marker, dropped well off the pace leaving the three eighths,
swung out in the lane but failed to seriously respond. STORMIN' AMANDA was lightly steadied along the rail nearing the half mile marker and came up
empty. REVEILLE SONG was shuffled soon after the break then steadied near the half, dropped back, raced four to five wide nearing the lane and failed to
recover. LADY CINCO DE MAYO , two to three wide, gave way. An objection by the rider of CAROLINA SUN against GIFT OF GAB for alleged interference
through the backstretch was not allowed

POLSAR bore out leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch, brushed with MOONSET when drifting
out in mid stretch and drove clear. MOONSET dueled outside the winner, brushed in mid stretch and finished willingly. LONG RAP SHEET , taken to the
inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained near the rail thereafter and failed to menace in an even effort. SOLOMON'S CHOICE bore out leaving
the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and was outrun. LONGWORTH , steadied behind the winner soon after the break, raced in the two path
between horses on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER rated inside and behind rivals leaving the far turn, moved between runners past the five sixteenths, shifted four to five wide in upper
stretch, responded to some right handed asks nearing mid stretch, brushed with CLAIRE'S DARLING advancing towards the sixteenth marker, sustained
under solid hand encouragement through the final sixteenth and forged ahead in the final yards. FAST LANI sped clear nearing the half mile marker, set the
pace two wide, moved away a bit nearing mid stretch, wandered outward through the final seventy yards and gave way grudgingly. RAISE YOUR GAME ,
off the pace while saving ground leaving the far turn, worked outward in the drive and finished well between rivals. KLAYTON'S KANDY settled off the pace
while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, worked between runners past the sixteenth marker and churned on. EVER SO D'WILD drafted back off the
pace while about four wide, angled six wide for the drive and closed steadily. GOLDEN CAN prompted the pace while saving ground and faded. CLAIRE'S
DARLING stalked two wide, angled three wide in upper stretch, had aim in mid stretch, brushed with the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and faded.
ROMANTIC COMEDY broke a step slow, raced five wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. GRAND SKYLARK chased outside a rival, shifted four wide
in upper stretch and gave way. MAP EM UP lagged back while saving ground and failed to menace.

CHARGE TO VICTORY hopped at the break, raced in the two path on the turn, drifted to the three path in upper stretch, angled outside inside the eighth
pole and was up near the finish. DIALING DIXIE sped to the early lead, opened up near the inner rail on the turn and weakened late. TOM TERRIFIC circled
the turn three wide, was floated to the four path in upper stretch, remained on his left lead, was well placed in mid stretch and weakened. OUR HOISTED
MAST lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and passed tired foes. BACKATYA , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch,
moved to the two path mid way on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch, weakened and was checked in tight quarters behind the winner inside
the eighth pole. BAHAMA CHANNEL , four deep on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN BELIEF rated forwardly while saving ground, edged closer than sat patiently leaving the three eighths, eased out around a foe then dropped back
towards the rail to advance past mid stretch, kept grinding under a drive and inside rivals departing the sixteenth pole, took over late and prevailed. KRONE
settled in range and towards the inside, moved up under pressure nearing mid stretch, brushed with GOLD DIGGING BROAD when challenging between
runners near the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely. GOLD DIGGING BROAD lodged a two wide bid outside the leader in early backstretch, dueled leaving
the far turn, gained command past the five sixteenths, ceded to a rival to her outside leaving the three sixteenths, brushed with KRONE when between foes
near the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. TANKA TOUGH stalked outside the winner, angled out and ranged up four wide into the stretch, moved
to clear lead in mid stretch but failed to last. HAZELMOOR BEACH saved ground under rating, edged up leaving the far turn, steadied briefly near the five
sixteenths, eased out in the drive and churned on. CUSH EFFECT settled off the pace, saved ground into the far turn, swung wide entering the lane but
lacked a bid. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS , wide through the backstretch, failed to menace. TIME GOES FAST , between rivals early, failed to menace. MISS
ANTIETAM moved clear heading to the first turn, dropped in and set the pace, was joined near the five eighths, sparred to the quarter pole then weakened.
SMOKE N SIN saved ground early and was not a threat. MONDEUSE refused to break. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start of MONDEUSE.
No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
CAJUN DREAM , confidently handled four deep entering the turn and around the bend, battled outside DART through the stretch and drove clear. DART
disputed the pace between horses around the turn and fought gamely inside the winner through the stretch in a sharp effort. RASCALLY REBEL , bumped
by LORD UHTRED leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch and rallied.
GENERAL NOOZ lacked speed, was along the inner rail entering the turn, swung to the three path entering the stretch and failed to rally. ISLAND D'LITE ,
fractious in the starting gate, failed to be a factor and was four deep entering the stretch. LORD UHTRED bumped RASCALLY REBEL when bearing out at
the break, was rushed to the lead down the backstretch, dueled inside horses into the stretch and gave way. GRAND ESCAPE showed speed along the
inner rail to the turn, rated back near the three eighths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
IT'S VIPER , bumped soon after the break, edged up three to four wide into the first turn then steadied off the heels of BATON when a bit keen nearing the
backstretch, raced four wide past the five eighths, dropped in to advance inside rivals nearing the quarter pole, swung back out to the center of the track and
closed strongly under right handed asks, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew away. DOLICE VITA saved ground while within range early, saw the
leader get away past the three eighths, responded to asking and took closer order nearing the lane, swung out, closed in to take a brief lead leaving the
furlong grounds, failed to contain the winner but kept on well to be second best. BATON , four wide to a forward spot into the first turn, remained off the
inside stalking past the five eighths, came under a ride into the far turn, remained well wide for the drive and churned on. JARDANI , off the pace two to
three wide, altered out to about the seven path nearing mid stretch and closed steadily. WHAT DOES IT TAKE cleared early and set the pace two wide,
drew out to a long lead leaving the far turn, saw his lead diminish in upper stretch, ceded command while drifting out leaving mid stretch and weakened
through the final seventy yards. HOT N SPICY LOVE stalked off the rail, raced three deep past the half, steadied when in close leaving the three eighths,
regrouped to chase, swung out very wide in the drive and kept on with effort. SHADY MUNNI prompted the early pace off the inside, was under pressure
between runners leaving the far turn, gave futile chase and tired through the drive. OMO DADA clipped heels soon after the break and bumped with a rival,
regrouped to settle off the pace while saving some ground, failed to go on around the final turn and faded. MR JEFFERSON , bumped after the break, raced
wide and failed to respond.
