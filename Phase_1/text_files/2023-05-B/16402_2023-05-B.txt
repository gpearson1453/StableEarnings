SCAMP WALKER broke slowest, saved ground, angled out on the turn, rallied inside leader and was up in the final yards. BLUEY settled outside the
dueling leaders, bid to the front in the stretch but was nailed. JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN dueled between rivals, faded on the turn then came again for the
show. THE BOATMAN led narrowly outside in three way duel then proved empty in the stretch. JUST DIVINE dropped back early, moved outside and
lacked a rally. EL GRAN CUYAYA prompted the pace inside to midway on the turn and stopped. DOOQ flashed speed in the two path then gave way
readily.

COUNTRY CAPTAIN stalked the pace inside, awaited room on the turn, moved through inside and drew away in the stretch. MR. TUTTLE dueled along the
inside with a narrow lead, lost the advantage but continued willingly. DADASHEV battled for the lead outside and weakened slightly in the stretch.
WHERESTHEPASSION saved ground, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. VERO SUN dropped back early then passed rivals inside while no
factor. BODE O trailed briefly outside and was never in contention. CELTIC HEART lacked speed, returned lame and was vanned off afterward.
JAY'STALKER flashed speed wide then gave way.

FORMAL ORDER settled close up inside, split foes advancing on the final turn then outdueled rival to the wire after a stretch-long battle.
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM stalked the pacesetter outside, took over at the three eighths pole but was outdueled. TRUE DAKOTAN rated three wide off the
leaders, bid at the quarter pole but weakened. SPLITZVILLE dropped back along the inside and was never a factor. CONNOISSEUR set a clear pace to the
final turn then stopped abruptly. STRUM AND PLUCK dropped back early outside and trailed throughout.

CAPTAIN COURTNEY well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch then surged away under moderate pressure. VANILLA BEAN settled well
behind, advanced on the final turn, closed well to get up for the place. WHATSAGIZMO led inside to the stretch then weakened in the final eighth losing the
place. THEARCHERORTHEPREY dropped far behind then passed rivals while no threat. TEMPEST RISING trailed early outside then moved very wide into
the stretch. GRYPHON'S WINGS chased off the pace inside and faded after half a mile. MY HUNNY BUNNY broke slowest, moved closer before half a mile
and gave way. NOW ACT SURPRISED prompted the pace to the final turn and stopped. PER RULING #23194PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, MY HUNNY BUNNY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 7th TO UNPLACED DUE TO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR A STATE BRED RESTRICTED
RACE.

Footnotes
POSSIBLEMENTE far behind early, advanced inside, angled out on the final turn, offered a stretch surge and rallied clear. SOVEREIGN CHANGE lacked
speed, bid into the stretch, altered course inside to get up for the place. DALTON set pressured pace inside, was collared again in the lane and continued
gamely to the wire. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid to the front in midstretch but yielded in the final furlong.
HOMETOWN HERO dropped back near the inside, moved closer on the final turn and lacked a response. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE offered a menacing
wide move on the final turn and faded. KODAPENDENT trailed far behind then passed a stopping opponent. RYAN'S FLEET prompted the pace to the far
turn and stopped abruptly.
