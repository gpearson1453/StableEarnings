Footnotes
BREAK THE ICE bobbled at the start but broke towards the front, was well placed just off the pace, drafted behind the leader while inside on the turn, was
asked in the two path into the stretch, gained to make a bid at the three-sixteenths, took the lead under a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker
then quickly switched to a left-handed crop, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole then was given one final pop of a left-handed crop and proved best under
a strong hand ride to the finish. STEADY PROGRESS was taken in hand early, tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, was asked in the three path while
outside on the turn, chased into upper stretch then made a bid near the three-sixteenths, battled outside of two foes under a drive into the final furlong and
was outfinished while clear for the place. OLD POINT broke a step slow then was taken in hand with the left rein, settled on the inside, angled out near the
three-quarter pole then raced between foes, was urged three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. BOLD HONOR moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the
turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the lead to the winner coming to the furlong marker and weakened. DISTURBED settled
off the pace, was urged along passing the three-quarter pole, went two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
SHARPOON broke in at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back outside the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. JETER
AND JUDGE was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, settled well back on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, went five then
four wide on the turn and had nothing left. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and
reloaded, became nervous in the gate then was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled quickly to the outside then advanced to race up close,
came up empty while moving from four to six wide on the turn and retreated then was eased but walked off. MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE A
POSSIBLE TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA STEWARD

Footnotes
MURSAL stumbled at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to get up in the final jumps and score. YOGI vied
early on between foes among a trio, then got shaken off and settled in closest aim of the leader before advancing to prompt that rival half a mile from home
in tandem with K D KAKES to her outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in trading command with
CHASING DAYLIGHT until establishing sole command a sixteenth out, then got caught when running on to the finish and was forced to settle for the place
honors. CHASING DAYLIGHT vied early on inside a pair before establishing sole command safely in front along the inside, came under challenge from a
pair half a mile from home and clung to the front until headed spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, took back the front straightened away, dug in
dueling with the aforementioned through to the sixteenth marker, then got shaken off in the late stages while safe for the show honors. K D KAKES hustled
from the gate, vied briefly outside a pair before chasing three wide in aim of the front, advanced into the turn and prompted the pace outside a pair coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. SUSIE'S SAVER broke out at the start bumping JOEY THE
FISH, came under coaxing and chased two to three wide, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a bid but
was outkicked. HYPNOCURRENCY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. JOEY THE FISH got bumped at the start by SUSIE'S SAVER, who broke outwards, conceded eight lengths to the front before settling into a
sluggish stride and chased three wide down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field and continuing to lose ground, tucked to the two path through
the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch well behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CANISY showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under threat from a pair, had the runner up and barn mate get on near even terms through the final sixteenth and gamely lasted on the wire.
MYRISKYAFFAIR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying through the final furlong to get on even terms a sixteenth from home and just missed on the line. ARINA (GER) forwardly placed tracking the
leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
loosely between foes from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker before weakening in the late stages while safe for the show honors. TIC TIC TIC BOOM
had the saddle adjusted behind the starting gate, settled two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish. PEACE SEEKER tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and was outkicked. WHIMSICAL DANCE brushed the off side stall at the start, tracked the front two then three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
NO REGARD settled on the inside, was roused while saving ground on the turn, moved to the two path under a drive in upper stretch, rallied to make a bold
bid between horses inside the furlong marker then took the advantage and proved best under strong urging. MYLES bumped with a rival at the start, was
well placed while settling behind the solo leader, came under urging in the two path on the turn, gained into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid inside
the furlong marker but was outfinished while able to get the place. MAYTHISBETHEONE settled on the outside without cover, was roused three wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. IN MY SHADOW made light contact with a rival
at the start, was taken in hand early then reserved towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came four
wide into the stretch and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. AULA settled while off the inside, was roused on the turn, dropped to the rail
outside the five-sixteenths, gained in the stretch and just missed the superfecta. AWESOME FORCE sped to the front from the outside, angled in while
going clear leaving the initial dogleg, opened up a sizable advantage, was asked while inside on the turn, saw the lead diminish under a drive into upper
stretch, was collared inside the furlong marker and tired. OCTOBER BLISS broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground behind horses
early on the turn, was asked while moving to the two path outside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. METAMORPHOSES bumped with a
rival at the start then dropped back early, settled well off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CAMPBELITO bumped lightly
with a foe while last to commence, lagged at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
ROTKNEE chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, kicked clear inside the
three-sixteenths and drew away under strong urging. WHO HOO THATS ME was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and safely secured
the place while no match for the winner. ROMANTIC GAMBLE was hustled from the gate then ridden along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and just got up for the show. IKIGAI showed speed then chased the pace, traveled around the turn in the three path,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired then just lost the show. TWELTH MAN broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths as the
field left the gate in two flights, was urged along well off the pace, dropped from the four path to the two path early on the turn, continued in the two path into
the stretch and failed to threaten. EXCELLENT TIMING displayed good speed then showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn,
lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. DIGITAL FUTURE was urged along off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and came up empty. WATASHA was ridden along well back in the field, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor.
VARATTI was hustled from the gate, moved out while ridden along off the pace, angled in late on the backstretch, raced in the two path early on the turn,
was guided to the five path while dropping back at the three-eighths and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
FATIMA'S BLESSING three wide in pursuit, altered out with a large portion of the field just inside the three-quarter pole when KAZ PALACE began to hurdle
light lines across the course, tucked back three wide into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then dug in to inch away in the late stages and prevail.
CONMAN just off the inside early on, altered out to the four path inside the three-quarter pole before tucking back to the two path into the turn, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, got collared a sixteenth from home and
ran on safe for the place honors. BE OF COURAGE ranged up shortly after the start to briefly duel from the three path with KAZ PALACE to his inside
before that rival went rogue and hurdling just inside the six furlong marker and then once more five and a half furlongs out, tucked inside at that juncture now
on a lone lead, showed the way through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the show honors clear of the rest. NOBLE HUNTSMAN just off the inside in the early stages,
altered out to the four path with most of the field to avoid the hurdling KAZ PALACE, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. BARREL OF QUESTS chased two then briefly three wide when altering
out a path inside the six furlong marker, tucked back to the two path into the turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home
and offered no response. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT two to three wide in pursuit, tipped out altering four wide briefly midway down the backstretch before tucking
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PLAYINGWITHMATCHES four wide
early on, tucked inside to the two path when a larger portion of the field was altering out, tucked to the rail into the turn and came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. COPPER CHALICE chased three then two wide, came under coaxing inside
at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, made no impact. KAZ PALACE away well and to the front, hopped along seven and a half furlongs out
seemingly eyeing the marks of the grass lanes from the mower before settling into brief head to head combat with BE OF COURAGE to the outside,
abandoned that duel when hurdling over a line across the track where it dips just inside the six furlong marker, lost two to three lengths of ground to the front
forcing the field in behind to alter outwards in caution, hurdled once more the next light line coming out of the dip near five and half furlongs to run, steadily
faded into and through the turn before taking the two path into upper stretch and giving way.

Footnotes
BUCKORTWO showed speed on the inside of two foes, vied inside to the two path on the turn, shook clear under a drive inside the three-sixteenths,
remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. BRENNAN'S WAR bumped with a rival just after the start, bumped with that same
foe early, was rated just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch then was roused with dead aim on the leader outside
the furlong marker, chased into the final sixteenth, gained on the winner late and just missed while clear for the place. TIE BREAKER showed speed
between horses, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the show. VAUNTED
showed speed on the outside, was roused for more while three to four wide on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in near the
sixteenth-pole and weakened. BIG BOULDER was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch, dropped in near the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. IMPULSIVE SPENDING was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased
into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. THE MIGHTY DON was hustled from the gate then bumped with a foe after the start, slipped past the fallen
rider near the eleven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. STRATEGYFORYOU settled
on the far outside, was roused four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond. BOINTHEBACK was bumped very hard near the eleven-sixteenths then
steadied, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. SUBVERSIVE bumped hard with foes on both sides after the start, bumped with a rival early,
settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn and also failed to respond. UNCLE TACO showed no speed, dropped well behind under
urging, saved ground on the turn and showed little. MILAGROSO shied significantly near the eleven-sixteenths then ducked in sharply, unseated the rider
then bumped hard with a foe and was walked off after being apprehended by the outrider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
ON THE BACKSTRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH
