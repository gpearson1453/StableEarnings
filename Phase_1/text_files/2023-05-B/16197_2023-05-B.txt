Footnotes
OUR GREAT NOTION pressured the pace from the three path, drew to even terms at the quarter pole but dropped back approaching the top of the stretch,
dug in leaving the eighth pole and took over late yards. ESSENTIAL MAGIC exchanged contact with Xtended Streak leaving the gate then pressured the
pace inside, took the lead at the rail approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear into the lane but was caught flattening stride late yards. FOXY SISTA came
in and made contact with Xtended Streak leaving the gate then engaged in close chase through the backstretch, dueled to near even terms past the quarter
pole then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. SHEWEARSSTILETTOS chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly in the
stretch. PHANTOM QUEEN was hustled to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met past the five sixteenths pole
and dropped back from between horses leaving the quarter, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. XTENDED STREAK became fractious in
the gate, was jostled on the chute then gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened in the lane. ITSUPTOME briefly gave chase, showed
little response past the five sixteenths pole and was taken in hand at that point.

Footnotes
FREE SAILIN bobbled leaving the gate but closed to the lead approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside on the first turn, came under
pressure past the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to draw clear mid-stretch. FANCY
CONCHO rated close off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced in range at the rail on the far turn, then dug in under steady
encouragement to take second the final yards. NICO settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and contested at
a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but relented second in the final yards. SOCIAL CHIC rounded the opening turn about
the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. NO CHANGE rated
close inside, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but dropped back approaching the head of the lane and
flattened in the lane. COMMAND THE CAT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. ISHIHARA
rounded the first turn about the five path and never factored. HERO'S MAN settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
but weakened off the rail on the far turn.

leaving the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and passed rivals in the lane. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY saved ground racing well
back, gave chase toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and passed rivals in the lane. OFFICER STONE rated close in the three
path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three and four paths on the far turn but showed little more. RIVER
