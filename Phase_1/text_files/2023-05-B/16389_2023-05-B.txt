Footnotes
WILLOW WOOD rated kindly three wide stalking the pace, moved in hand to engage the leader into the far turn, vied outside COSMICALITY while
confidently handled past the five sixteenths, took over soon into the lane, kicked away after being put to a left handed ask, switched over to his left lead
inside the sixteenth pole and proved clearly best while kept to task. BALLYHOO PRINCE , snugly rated early on while saving ground, edged up behind
runners around the final turn, snuck through along the rail when advancing in mid stretch and kept on with good energy to be second best. HUSBAND
MATERIAL , bumped at the break, angled out to about three wide into the backstretch, brushed with ROAN BURGUNDY when giving hard chase of the
leaders past the five sixteenths, angled five wide in upper stretch and churned on. ROAN BURGUNDY led early then was rank when being rated back off
the leader into the first turn, settled better nearing the five eighths and stalked, eased out then brushed with HUSBAND MATERIAL when pursuing past the
three furlong marker, raced between runners in mid stretch and kept on with some effort. COSMICALITY , bumped leaving the gate, moved up then pulled
his way clear heading to the first turn, set a rated pace towards the inside, was joined by the winner around the far turn, sparred to the head of the stretch
while two wide then weakened through the final furlong. MY MAMBA lagged back, swung wide entering the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
VALIANT VINNY cleared early, set a rated pace towards the rail, kicked away after being set down leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under solid asks
past mid stretch then held firm to the wire. PAPAL LAW checked soon after the break, steadied behind foes leaving the half mile pole, eased out and
gathered momentum three wide nearing the stretch, altered out past the three sixteenths and finished nicely. BOSS IS A PAL prompted the pace outside the
winner, was put to asking into the lane, gave willing pursuit past mid stretch then flattened out late. HEADS OR TAILS rated in range while saving ground,
stayed inside for the drive and kept on with effort. BOMBOLONI chased three wide leaving the far turn, circled four wide under asking into the stretch but
came up empty through the final furlong. BOURBON CURRENCY , forward early while along the rail, drafted back and appeared to bobble slightly entering
the turn, came out in the final furlong but could only muster a mild response. AMEDEUS MUSIC broke slowly, raced wide in the drive and failed to menace.
E J'S REVENGE gave early chase between runners and tired.

Footnotes
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , four wide the first turn, was rated off the duel down the backstretch, entered the far turn behind horses, eased out to the four path
mid way on the bend, took command in upper stretch, lugged in a bit and drew off under steady handling. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , three wide both
turns prompting the pace, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished willingly. JASONTAKESLONG set a pressured pace along the inner rail and
weakened late. BADGER TOOTH , well off the inner rail down the backstretch, circled the far turn five deep and failed to rally. NORTHERN THUNDER ,
four wide both turns, drifted out entering the stretch and was not a factor. HONOR THE FLEET prompted the pace outside JASONTAKESLONG and gave
way turning for home. ANTIPOISON dropped back and was eased.

ROYAL VELVET broke outward, corrected and dropped in to save ground early, took to rating and settled off the quick pace, edged up in hand into the far
turn, angled four wide approaching the lane, surged clear under brisk asks in mid stretch then held firm while being taken in hand the final yards. HARD
TRAVELER broke a bit slow, settled off the pace and outside a rival early on, angled four wide gathering momentum into the lane and continued with good
energy to be second best. OCCASIONAL MOON tracked the pace two wide, moved up into the far turn and joined SIG, vied outside that one then poked a
head in front soon into the lane, failed to resist the winner leaving the three sixteenths and weakened through the final seventy yards. MENO settled off the
pace two wide, angled out wider for the drive but failed to make an impact. SIG , a bit keen into the first turn, drifted off the inside then straightened to set a
strong pace, met an outside challenge around the far turn, battled to the head of the stretch then gave way leaving the three sixteenths. BLAME B B failed
to menace. BUSTERMARTIN BROWN saved ground off the pace and retreated in the lane. SJO AMERICANEMPIRE had speed and stalked three wide to
the far turn, failed to keep pace from there and faltered.

EVERETT'S SONG stalked two wide outside TAPPIN CAT, was coaxed along and went after that one leaving the far turn, dueled under a hearty ride past
the five sixteenths, took over in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong to go, kept on under strong handling and proved resolute denying GALERIO through
the final seventy yards. GALERIO , keen to go while saving ground around the first turn, pulled his way forward and gained a stalking spot, was snugly rated
off the leaders heading to the half, angled four wide soon to the lane, ranged up to loom a serious threat past mid stretch, kept on with effort but was unable
to make inroads in the final yards. DOUBLE CROWN broke inward, corrected and rated three wide behind rivals heading to the half mile pole, angled to the
rail leaving the far turn, moved up while saving ground past the three sixteenths, shifted out for the final furlong and closed steadily. TAPPIN CAT was
nudged clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the far turn, battled inside the winner to upper stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch
and weakened. SPA CITY , fractious in the gate, raced between foes while close up past the seven eighths, raced two wide past the five eighths, saved
ground leaving the far turn, angled four wide for the drive but came up empty. SOUTHERN DISTRICT hopped at the break and was away last, was used
five then four wide around the first turn to get within range, continued well wide and faded. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , three wide stalking the early pace, failed
to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
STAR SHOPPING , in hand behind horses around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch, closed steadily, brushed with BOURBON READY in deep
stretch and got up in time. BOURBON READY , two wide on the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, brushed with the winner when drifting out late
and just missed. GOLQUIST showed speed along the inner rail, battled to mid stretch and finished willingly. SUPER JORDAN saved ground on the turn,
swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. KENNER stalked the pace well off the rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch,
drifted in and gave way. BODYSLAM , outrun, drifted to the six path turning for home. THANK YA PETE , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch,
faltered.
