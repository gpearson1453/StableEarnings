Footnotes
SOUND DOCTRINE vied three wide down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn and held well clear while in hand in the lane. TOP
MAVERICK raced in range four wide, was no match for the winner but stayed on outside to be clearly second best. VANISHING INTEREST lacked early
speed, raced in the two path around the turn, angled 4wd turning for home and was along for the show. THE DOORMAN bobbled at the start, raced three
wide and never threatened. SOLOMONS GOLD hesitated at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. BOLD ADVANCE had speed between foes
early, rated back nearing the turn, re-bid three wide around the bend but came up empty in the lane. CASH IT was off slow and outrun while racing three
wide. KHOZIE RED had speed at the rail and was through after a half.

Footnotes
HOLY COFFEE broke a step slow but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, was roused and opened up midway around the turn, received a right
handed cue while remaining in the two path at the top of the lane, stayed on and was driven out. CASUALLY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked
in the five path, circled an inner trio around the turn, and chased home the winner down the stretch for place. ELOPER raced off the pace in the three path,
was driven around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and mildly kept on for show. APRIL APRIL rated in the three path, was cued midway
around the turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but drifted inwards, and finished evenly. CORINTH got pinched just after the start, trailed in the
two path early and did not factor around the six path down the lane. APRIL'S DIAMANTE chased along the inside but was no menace. SKY DIVINE bumped
with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was ridden in the five path turning into the stretch, but faded. PANDA PEAK got bumped between foes
at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, was under coaxing into the turn, and gaveway along the inside into the stretch.

TIZ IMPRESSIVE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms in upper stretch,
dueled outside and narrowly prevailed. CHESS NOT CHECKERS stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, dueled inside of the
winner while holding a narrow lead through most of the stretch and just missed. FORBIDDEN DREAM set the pace along the to midstretch, could not match
strides with the top two from there but held clear of the rest. WHAT A KNOCKOUT saved ground off the pace, made some progress inside down the
backstretch, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole and went evenly. SWEET ACTRESS pressed the pace two wide, briefly led down the
bacsktretch, continued two wide around the far turn and faded through the lane. KATIESDREAMGIRL chased the pace two wide and was through after a
half.

Footnotes
JONAS' DREAM bobbled at the start, stalked in the four path, bid under a nudge from the three path around the turn, took a short lead passing the quarter
and was in the four path entering the stretch, and held gamely under steady urging. SEDONA RED bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five
path, floated out to the eight path after a left handed cue into the lane, and ran on while tipping inwards for place. BLACK FURY set the pace in the two
path, shifted inside under coaxing early around the turn, lost the lead passing the quarter, dug in and fought on from the two path down the stretch, but
yielded in the final sixteenth to show. TO THYSELF B TRUE was reluctant to load, trailed in the four path, shifted out to the six path into the lane, mildly
stayed on, but was no factor. MOTIVO was also reluctant to load, hopped at the start and bumped with an outer foe, prompted the pace inside, was briefly
stymied just before the three eighths pole, and yielded into the stretch. RULE IT raced off the pace in the six path but never menaced. PER RULING FROM
HIWU, JONAS' DREAM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

ahead under a drive. YOU TALKIN TO ME was off a step slow, raced off the pace three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, bid between foes
nearing the sixteenth pole and was outkicked by the winner late. TREASURE KING vied in the three path around the first turn and two path around the far
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and led to the sixteenth pole. SPEEDY HANS stalked the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. A ROSE
FOR RAVEN vied inside of TREASURE KING and tired weakened through the stretch. PARKLAND was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
CORDUROY ROAD set the pace in the three path, was roused when challenged by a pair of outer rivals midway around the turn, stayed on under right
handed encouragement into the stretch, but began to shorten stride late, and just held on. COMPETITIVE SAINT stalked in the three path, tipped inside
under coaxing midway around the turn, ran on from the rail and bid into the final furlong, but just missed. NO ANGEL prompted the pace in the five path,
was under a heavy drive between foes in the four path around the turn, and fought on from the five path in the stretch to hold show. STRAIGHT SHOT
tracked in the six path, ranged up under a ride in the five path around the turn, took aim from the seven path at the top of the lane, but hung to miss show.
EXECUTIVE SEARCH chased in the two path, but lost ground around the turn and was no factor from the five path in the stretch. SLIPPIN JIMMY raced off
the pace in the two path, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and did not threaten. MAILBOX MONEY trailed throughout from the two to five paths.

STARSHIP AURORA rated in range inside, waited for room at the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide turning for home and burst clear under a drive.
TREASURE TAILS steadied entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole and ran on to gain the place
late. ZOSTEROP raced well back two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. KITTY QUICK stalked the pace two and
three wide and weakened in the lane. PRETTYKEEN was outrun while racing three and four wide. SHE'S A JOY failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. PRINCESS BLAKELY set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired in the final furlong. TIZ ENOUGH raced in range
three wide, angled to the rail near the eighth pole and was taken firmly in hand while in somewhat tight through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MOOR STRENGTH chased in the five path, was ridden from the seven path into the stretch, rallied passing the eighth pole, and drew past the inner
pacesetter passing the sixteenth to win. PARCHITA was prompted along inside early, tipped out under right handed urging around the turn, was in the
seven path in upper stretch, and ran on to get up for place late. MY LADY JAMES had a contested lead from the four path into the turn, was cued and
opened up slightly from the five path into the stretch, drifted in against left handed encouragement, and yielded late to show. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL rated
inside, was roused from the three path midway around the turn, shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and stayed on mildly. GIRL BYE vied from the
three path into the turn, but flattened down the lane. BABY'S DIALED IN trailed in the four path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, but was
no factor. GET A GRIP MARILYN stalked in the two path but backed up around the turn. LADY LIV pressed around the six path into the turn, but faded in
the stretch.
