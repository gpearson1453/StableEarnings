BELLAROO tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to take command late and inch clear. ARIKARA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, controlled the pace from just off the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch, but battled
gamely to prove clearly second best. WALKINTHEWALK settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. BAKFIRE BABY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

entering the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage in the lane while being ridden out late. HE'S RELENTLESS stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing just out from the rail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and battled on willingly from along the rail in
the drive to get up for the place. BLACK METAL broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide while unable to keep pace with the leader entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. JUST JIMMY
away alertly but steadied sharply off heels entering the first turn, and trailed the compact field into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact while finishing from along the rail in the drive. STAR ENTRY chased the pacesetter three wide entering
the first turn to assume a tracking trip two out from the rail in the run down the backside, continued three wide into the final turn, but was outfinished over the

BAKKEN OVERDRIVE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from just off the rail in the run down
the backside, held a clear advantage into the final turn, and widened his margin over the final furlong while being kept to task. STORMY BLUE away well,
but was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final
turn, tipped four wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. PRINCE CAIRO unhurried early while
dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late from along the rail
in the drive to get up for a share. AROLLERCOASTERRIDE ducked out at the start, and was forced to chase three wide into the first turn to gain a stalking
trip entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four out from the rail in the drive. EDDIE WHO
tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon late.
MAJESTIC STREET tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond
with a closing kick when called upon.

LEGACY SQUARE broke sharply and eased off the leaders midway through the first turn to take a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and quickly disposed of field late while under
confident handling. ROCKCLIFFE rushed up between rivals in the run to the first turn to take a narrow advantage, set a pressured pace in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, put away his pace rival leaving the turn, but was no match for LEGACY SQUARE entering he lane, but finished willingly
from just off the rail in the drive to hold on for the place. TIME TICKER away alertly and was allowed to settle at the back of the field while saving ground
entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished gamely two wide in the drive to just miss the place.
ARISTOCRACY away well and pressed the pace from the outside of ROCKCLIFFE entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, struggled to hold his position leaving the turn, and was outfinished in the drive.

FORCE TO REKN WITH broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of MILO'S
COMMAND entering the backstretch, sprinted to a clear lead approaching the final turn, and continued to widen her margin late while being kept to task.
PURSUE lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance smartly midway to the final turn, rallied
four wide through the turn, and closed steadily three out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. TEXAS LEGACY settled mid pack while
racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. MILO'S COMMAND away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of FORCE TO REKN WITH entering the backstretch, was
unable to match strides with his pace rival in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide from between rivals through the turn, and finished from along the rail in
the drive. BORROWED EQUITY was slow into stride and raced greenly early while trailing the field into the first turn, rallied with interest one out from the rail
entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in deep stretch. BARBERRY BANDIT away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing out from the rail, dropped back in the run down the backside, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, steadied sharply when
running up on heals midway through the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, but was unable to mount a serious late bid. SETTEBELLO stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. WELLSLEY was off a
step slow, but saved ground through the first turn to race into a stalking trip entering the backside, continued to save ground entering the final turn, but
weakened in the stretch drive.
