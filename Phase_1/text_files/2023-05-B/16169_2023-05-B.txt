HE'S A GOOD DANCER bumped at the start, moved up quickly to track the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and drew off inside the furlong marker. ITALIAN SYMPHONY unhurried, moved up inside through the turn, steady for racing room into
the stretch, angled widest and closed well for the place. CITY OF CLOUDS set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then
weakened the final furlong. I STRONG stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to vied for the lead through the turn, bid outside into the stretch and
flattened out. GRAFT fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly, bumping HE'S A GOOD DANCER, rushed up to position, then had no rally.

BRADITUDE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and held. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES
bumped at the start, was allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then closed well late, gaining the
place. WILLIE WANDO broke in, bumping and causing a chain reaction, moved up and angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then
flattened and held the show. TURNS knocked in at the start, bumped a rival, was unhurried to the turn, moved up two and three wide through the turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch and evened out. LEGEND OF CHARLIE well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path
and weakened in the lane. PURE SPRING rated close up, faded after a half.
