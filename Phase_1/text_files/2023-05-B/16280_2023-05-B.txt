SWEET MOBILTEE quick outside speed, dueled to quarter pole, roused to go clear in the final furlong under stout handling. WHYNAUGHTY broke a bit
tardy, rushed inside to duel winner, could not stay on and held the place spot. KISS THE RED HEAD no speed to the turn, came widest into stretch while
rallied on late for show spot. SISSY'S MAY unhurried to the turn, improved position only in the stretch run. EMERALD EYES raced along evenly throughout
with no late kick in the stretch run. DESDEMONA KAY broke slow and never menaced thereafter. HEIDI'S SHADOW tried to keep up for the half but gave
way readily in the stretch.
