Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP tugged his way to the lead under a snug hold with five eighths remaining, continued to set the fractions up front easily racing on the turn,
repelled a mild challenge under left hand urging with a furlong to go and held safe at the wire. FOUR ACES HIGH was unhurried early outside to see the
field after the break, took up the chase with seven sixteenths to go outside, continued to keep a close eye on the frontrunning winner on the turn, loomed the
threat in the four path in upper stretch, but could not gain on the winner running to the wire and had to settle for second best. GALVASTON tracked in hand
on the rail down the back straight, had to tap on the brakes mildly on the rail into the turn, chased the top pair as they turned for home and showed some
late energy to win the battle for third with an outside rival at the finish. SOUPER RIVER settled near the back three wide in a tight compact field at the half,
offered a mild run outside of horses midpoint on the turn, was in the five path battling for the show award at the top of the lane and was outkicked by his
inside competitor down the lane for the show money. EXCEED tracked in the two path with runners on either side down the backstretch, was shuffled
between rivals to trail at the seven sixteenth marker, could not keep pace with foes running on the turn and was never a threat through the stretch drive.

Footnotes
COLEYVILLE was bumped at the start by an outside rival and was content with being near the back into the first turn, began to lengthen his stride inside at
the half taking closer order to the leaders, angled out to the three path between foes midway on the far turn, was five wide turning for home and
determinedly ran on in deep stretch for the victory. NATIVE PRINCE was situated three wide in the tracking flight into the first turn, had good position on the
outside with a half left to run, bid four wide with rivals on either side turning for home and could not match strides with the closing winner late.
BLOCKBUSTER took control from the start, was the pacesetter on the first turn and through the backside, was collared outside by runners in upper stretch
but ran willingly to the wire rebidding for third money. PAPA'S PLACE broke outwards to start, settled just off the pacesetter into the first turn, rated on the
rail keeping his sights on the frontrunner, travelled inside on the far turn, had a clear path at the top of the stretch, could not accelerate through in mid
stretch and stalled while on the wrong lead to the finish. UNILATERAL was allowed to settle into stride trailing in the early going, began to pick up rivals
outside at the three furlong marker and passed tired foes in the lane. BLONDEONAMISSION broke in at the start, tracked on the rail in the second flight in
the early stages, was roused outside on the far turn to keep up with runners, offered little response and was not a factor through the lane. DUKE OF MIAMI
settled in midfield all alone into the first turn, lost ground to the field down the back straight, was ridden for more with three furlongs remaining and was
empty down the lane.

Footnotes
MANITOULIN ISLAND hounded the pace on the rail in the beginning, angled off the fence midway down the backstretch, continued to watch the leader on
the turn, rallied four wide between horses in upper stretch and drew away in the final furlong for the wn. SOME LIKE IT HOT took command from the start,
opened up on the field with two furlongs from the wire, was collared outside by the winner in mid stretch and gamely hung onto the place award at the finish.
SHE'S SO COLD brushed the gate and could see the field after the start, caught up to the pack three wide into the turn, rallied around runners five wide at
the quarter pole and was gaining slowly to the leaders while finishing on the wrong lead to the line. DON'T MOVE had good position inside behind the leader
at the half mile marker, saved ground on the rail but made little advance inside through the turn and ran evenly to the wire to garner a minor role. PANIC
SWITCH travelled near the rear between rivals down the backside, was shuffled three eighths to the finish trailing the field, could not gain on runners
through the turn and passed a weary runner in mid stretch. SMART IRENE broke outwards at the start, settled three wide near the back down the
backstretch, offered a mild run three wide at the three furlong marker and weakened between runners at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BODACIOUS MISS chased the pace just off the fence down the back straight, was in range three wide at the top of the lane and wore down the leader right
at the wire winning the nod in the end. MISS BRENTWOOD was hustled for the lead down the backstretch, set the fractions comfortably leading through the
turn, continued to keep the field at bay at the furlong marker and got tired in deep stretch to be caught right at the line. NO WHAMMIE settled near the back
of the field in the beginning, waited behind a wall of runners into the turn, split foes while rallying five sixteenths from the finish, was in with a chance two off
the rail for the drive and was closing well late between foes just missing in the three horse photo at the finish. KHOZZY VALINTINE settled in mid pack five
wide at the half mile marker, put in an early move five wide around rivals to bid midpoint on the turn, was in the mix at the top of the stretch and levelled out
in the final eighth. MIDNIGHT MEADOW tracked in the three path in the early stages of the race, could not keep up with the outside flow on the turn, losing
position as they turned for home and could not be a factor in the stretch drive. CALL ME BROOKE tracked four wide at the half, travelled five wide on the
turn to trail the field with a quarter to go and made little impression running to the wire. TICKLE HER TOE was void of early speed and trailed the field in the
early going, began tp pick up runners inside throughout the turn and gave way on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
PLEASURE'S GOLD broke in at the start, settled in midfield all alone rating nicely down the backside, began to rally three furlongs left to go up the fence,
switched outside at the quarter pole, cruised up for the lead in upper stretch and easily drew away in the late stages of the race. WINYAH BAY was
squeezed soon after the start to trail the field down the back straight, split foes rallying midway on the turn, was running well five wide turning for home ,
could not catch the long gone winner but besting the rest comfortably in the end. SWIRLING DANCER chased the frontrunner on the rail through the turn,
could not match strides with the closing winner two furlongs from the line and stayed on through the lane well enough to hold for third in the end. SPANISH
BEAUTY took command leaving the chute, dictated the pace down the backside, opened up on the field through the turn, was collared by the winner in
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. NADIABIZNIZ stalked near the back of the pack down the backstretch, made little headway travelling inside
through the turn and could not get involved running on the fence to the wire. PERFECT PROVISION hopped slightly at the break, tracked three wide at the
half, was coaxed for more run three furlongs from home, offered little response and backed away at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SIX SENSE had a good spot watching the dueling pair battle down the backstretch,, began to run down the duo four wide turning for home, took control at
the furlong marker and was kept to the task late edging away in the end. SIGN OF BEAUTY was steadied while in tight quarters at the eleven sixteenths
pole, was on hold behind a wall of runners on the rail through the turn, found the seam up the fence at the top of the lane and finished up strongly chasing
the winner who got the jump on her on the outside in mid stretch. GAMBLE'S ORB pressed the issue on the rail early on, took control at the five eighths
pole, was collared inside at the quarter marker, regained the lead in upper stretch and stubbornly finished up between rivals holding third. PROUD
SPEAKER broke out at the start, travelled four wide outside in midfield down the backside, continued five wide around horses making gains on the outside
in upper stretch and closed in for a minor share in the end. ADMISSIBLE was quickly angled to the rail after the start, slipped up the inside commencing a
run midway on the turn, angled four wide in mid stretch and needed more running between horses in the final eighth. CALABRIAN QUEEN had the lead
after the start, played the chaser on the turn, rebid outside for the top spot two furlongs left to run and retreated between foes in the final furlong. WHERE'S
SAMNBAILEY was bumped by her inside rival at the start to be near the rear, stalked three wide with runners on either side at the half, was ridden between
foes at the quarter pole offering a mild spurt of energy and was empty for the stretch drive. TIME FOR AN ANGEL settled four wide near the rear in the
beginning stages, could not make any gains on rivals early on the turn and gave way at the quarter pole.

SARAH'S DANCER had a good trip outside watching the top three fight for lead on the turn, took command four wide at the top of the lane, briefly opened
up a touch in mid stretch and drifted in late under left handed urging to win in a photo at the wire. MACHINA settled near the back of the pack in the
beginning, rallied three wide around runners midway on the turn, was brushed by an inside rival in upper stretch and closed late losing the nod in the photo
at the wire. HOLIDAY WITH AMY had a good spot on the rail watching the contesting trio at the half, waited inside behind the battling threesome through
the turn, angled outside looking for a seam at the top of the lane, was brushed trying to get a clear path in mid stretch and was then steadied between
runners with seventy yards to the wire. BLUEBERRY DOLL tracked three wide early on, took up the chase three wide on the turn, bid in the four path
turning for home and raced evenly to the finish holding for a small role. TAKE CHANCES lacked speed and was relegated to trail on the rail down the
backside, could still see the field running on the turn, angled to be seven wide at the top of the lane and passed some stragglers in deep stretch.
ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH chased the pace between rivals down the backside, continued battling up front in the two path through the turn, was nudged on
for more run turning for home and retreated in the last eighth. MISS BIKINI had a slim lead from the onset, was pressed outside while up front all through
the turn, was collared by numerous outside rivals at the top of the stretch and stopped the final furlong. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #4 HOLIDAY
