CONNELMAURA stalked the pace, took over when ready at the three eighths pole then drew away eagerly while ridden out. ONLY GIRL dropped back
early, raced inside throughout and finished gamely for the place. AZTEC QUEEN advanced wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. DONS LAST
CALL lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO trailed far behind then moved past foes while no factor. NO SUGAR
PLEASE was urged close up down the backstretch then retreated. COUSIN MARIE raced just off the leaders outside and gave way readily. KINDNESS IS
FREE angled inside sprinting clear early then stopped abruptly.

furlong. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE lacked speed, faded on the final turn and was no threat. OMERTA CODE trailed along the inside early and lacked a
solid rally. VERBIER chased very wide and was never in contention. RUNNIN JOKE reserved three wide raced close up for half a mile and stopped.

FRIAR TUCK dueled along the rail, edged clear into the stretch and kept his advantage while under a drive. POLAR WIND lacked speed, advanced wide
and finished willingly. AMITY ROAD chased three wide off the dueling leaders and continued well. MY LAST MISSION moved closer on the turn and
flattened out in the stretch. DONT BREAK THE LAW dwelt at the start, raced far behind then finished well inside. SUIGU STAR broke sluggishly then
narrowed the gap without menacing. FORTY COMETS dueled outside to the three sixteenths then weakened in the stretch. DOCTOR DOOM dropped far
behind and gave way readily. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. PER RULING 23261PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING
COMMISSION, POLAR WINDWAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

FRENCH TOAST hustled to the front inside, pulled away after half a mile and remained clear driving while drifting out. AWESOME LAUNCH raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued gamely while no threat. YES SIR COLONEL reserved far behind inside then split foes with good late energy.
PRIME TIME PLAYER raced three wide just off the pace and finished willingly. SPEIGHTSTER RED chased between rivals then inside and ran gamely to
the finish. OLYMPIC ROMP was fanned extremely wide into the first turn, remained wide then tired. WIZARD SERRAT four wide on the first turn, angled
inside with a mild bid. FAST BREAKIN CASH flashed speed outside and was finished before half a mile. PLAMEN saved ground off the pace and steadily
weakened. MAXIM MOMENT raced five wide opening half mile and gave way.
