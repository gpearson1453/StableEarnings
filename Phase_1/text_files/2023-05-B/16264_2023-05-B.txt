Footnotes
GALLANT STAR settled off the pace from the four path, was allowed to relax until the half mile pole, was given the cue and responded well and started
closing from the outside, circled his rivals through the turn, had his aim on the in the leader in the stretch, collared that foe by the sixteenth pole and
proceeded to drew away with a game win. OPTIMISTIC shuffled back after the break and settled well off the pace, started chasing the eventual winner after
the half mile pole, followed that foe through the turn was three wide in the stretch and was kept to task, closing strong, couldn't beat the winner but was
second best. SHARK HARBOR showed natural speed and went to the front willingly, showed the way until the half mile pole, was joined by an outside
contender at the half mile pole, matched strides into the lane, and weakened late. CAYMANS COBRA stalked the early pace while racing three wide, was
rated just off the leaders hip until the half mile marker, was given the cue and urged through the turn was in front for a few strides at the five sixteenth pole
but then was joined by the early leader to his inside, battled, was run down by an outside attacker and tired mid stretch. MR. PRIORITY was off slow, and
raced from off the pace , angled down to the rail and saved ground, but to no avail. CORVETTE SPIRIT was never involved. ROCKDALE was sent to the
lead along the rail, was quickly joined by an outside competitor and matched strides with that one while attending the pace, gave way at the five sixteenth
pole and tired.

CAVIAR RESOLUTION settled off the pace early on while racing in the six path, was asked and improved position at the half mile marker drawing beside
the early leaders, continued to be urged, applied pressure to her inside rivals through the turn, was in a three way battle down the stretch and past the last
sixteenth of a mile where she put the rest away and went on for the win. JOANIE GAL sent early to be forwardly placed, gently took back and rated just off
the early speed, stalked that leader and was joined by an outside attacker at he half mile pole, these two drew along the side of the early leader and
launched a three battle into the furlong ground, and tired. Though she was pressured and battled in between two competitor through the lane JOANIE GAL
ran a game race and was up for second. CUSTOM MAIDEN vied for the early lead, secured the rail and set the pace, showed the way into the furlong
ground faded late. SIMPLE SUNDAY raced mid pack early on from the three path, was urged in between horses and improved position into the second
flight of horses, maintained position through the turn edged out in the upper stretch into the five path, was encouraged with clear racing room, but to no
avail. BEAUX TOX was off slow and while racing wide was no factor. WHO DAT GREY saved ground along the rail, was urged to move up into the second
flight on the rail inside of other rivals, was placed well through the turn but faltered. LIL HOT TODDY was no menace.

RICKY RIGHT was four wide going into the first turn, pulled against the bit getting to the front, took the lead at the six furlong pole, angled closer to the rail,
entered the top of the stretch in front was slightly pressured by a closing rival before he drew away gamely in the deep stretch. RONALDS GATSBY raced
off the pace along the rail, gained ground at the half mile pole, shifted out five wide while chasing the leader into the furlong ground, where he was putting
pressure on the eventual winner but could not secure the win and had to settle for second best today. STAR READY stalked the early pace from the rail,
improved position while being two wide moved in between foes, was in contention by the quarter pole but did not have enough today. CLEARLY A JET
raced mid pack while taking a ground saving trip, maintained that position through out and finished with a mild bid. FLAT OUT FABIO showed little.
ADDISONS WARRIOR was forwardly placed and faded. VERO CAMPIONE was no factor. OWEN THE ICE MAN was never involved. TRIPLE trailed.

NO WHITE FLAGS stalked the early pace setter while he rated waiting for the cue, happily took command and by the last sixteenth and drew off gamely.
LUNAR MODULE battled for the lead, set the pace from the inside and gave way late. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced along the rail in the middle of the
pack, advanced along the rail while improving position, started to drift out at the five sixteenth pole and drifted out further in the stretch but did not have
enough to overcome the first two finishers and settled for third. STOCKPILER settled into the middle of the pack, maintained his position. FAR BEYOND
showed little. BREAD WINNER was never involved.

and was up for second. CALICOCO raced mid pack, patiently waited, then closed well. KING OF CONTRABAND was off a tough and slow and made a mild
