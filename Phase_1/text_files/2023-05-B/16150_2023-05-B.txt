RUSTY MY BROTHER hopped at the start, moved up quickly inside, saved ground and was boxed on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path, then split foes and drew off late. ZIP CODE ENVY well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position through the turn, bid three wide outside the
leader, then lacked the needed kick and held the place. HEAVENLY HASH unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and flattened, missing the place. ANA L allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room and gained a share. JAZZ TIME GIRL well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the turn, then
weakened the final furlong. IRON LOTUS allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. LT. LYDIA sprinted to a
clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded. MIMI'S GOLD well placed and inside, faded through the turn.

ENJOY THE MUSIC well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then drove clear. GRAINGER COUNTY allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and closed well for the place. TAPSOLUTION tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out three wide into the stretch, then
lacked the needed late kick and held the show. LONTANI sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held sway to the final furlong, then weakened and held a share.
AMERICAN UNION unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and had a mild gain. HIGH HEAT
rated close up and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. QUARTERMASTER ran evenly for
a half and had no stretch rally. FUEL THE BERN well placed, faded two and three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
CATCH ON EMOTIONAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to
the task. PUTTHEPASTBEHIND mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the place.
UNCLE JOCK well placed and off the rail, angled in through the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
NORTHERN SPY well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. CAMINO DE
SANTIAGO allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn and improved position in the lane. CITY TRIPPER unhurried, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside and passed a tiring rival. UNCLE REMI tracked the pace, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then had
no stretch rally.
