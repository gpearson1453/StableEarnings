PINEDALE prompt the leader from the outside, raced four to five wide in the lane and got up under strong pressure. DRIVEN ONE showed good early foot
from the inside and gave way grudgingly late. WELLER ROGUE raced mid pack early on, raced three to four wide between in the drive and moved up to
improve position. SUPER WISE stalked the pace from the inside and weakened a bit late. GLOBAL EMPIRE stalked the pace, raced four wide around the
far turn and weakened while racing from the far outside. BEEALEA stalked the early going, raced from the outside in the stretch and had no late rally.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS dropped back early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. BALADINE tired readily to lose ground,
was eased and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
RONAN settled off the early going, moved up from the far outside and surged clear late under strong encouragement. RAINY MOUNTAIN raced off the
early going, moved up four to five wide and rallied gamely for the place position. AVASARALA pressed the lead from outside of foes, led narrowly near the
eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. DREAM STREAK vied for the early lead between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CRYSTAL SNOW
stalked the pace, raced four to five into the upper stretch and weakened late. I DON'T KNOW MARGO vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way.
STORMY EMPIRE raced mid pack early on, saved ground and never threatened. MYSTIC STORM was slow early and trailed.
