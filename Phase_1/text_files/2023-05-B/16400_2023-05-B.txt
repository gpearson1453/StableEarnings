Footnotes
ICONIC BONNET broke into the four path a bit was quickly corrected, vied for the lead, took the rail and was matching strides with another foe to the out
side, these two raced as a set past the half and three eighths poles, the rail gave ICONIC BONNET a slight edge entering the stretch, her company was still
a threat, with some encouragement from the right handed crop she was kept on point and continued to battle with her rival until the furlong ground where
she was finally able to shake the rival who had been by her side through out and drew away for the game win. VALENTINE ANGEL raced two wide, vied for
the lead, matched strides with an inside foe and raced as a set through out, was asked and responded at the quarter pole, but she couldn't over come the
eventual winner and tired late. LOVELY JOYCE was off a step slow, found her best stride after the half mile pole, was racing three wide then shifted into the
five path where she was kept on point and drive, was able to pick up the pieces and score third place honors. ROSALIE'S DESTINY was off a bit slow,
raced on the rail but made no impact. BLUE COWGIRL raced three wide, challenged for the lead and tired by the quarter pole. SPARKLE CITY showed
little.

Footnotes
PIECE OF ME was sharp out of the gated, quicky established the lead on the rail, used her natural speed to establish her dominance and went uncontested.
Earning a very nicely done win. IRISH WRIT was off a bit slow, angled in and raced from the three path while stalking, was encouraged to get involved by
the half, was gaining ground and smartly angled in to the rail, saved ground leaving the the bend, and had clean racing room up the fence and accelerated
like a favorite, chased down the lane but had to much to do and settled for second today. SHESTHEBIGGAME broke into the two path and pushed the two
horse into the three path, was finally pointed down the track and found the rail, settled well off the pace and found her stride inching forward and gaining
ground, was mid pack and gaining as she past the three eighths pole, angled out into the three path att he quarter pole chased the leaders down the stretch,
passed tired rivals and took the third place moey. NOWNOWDANCER broke into the three path, was quickly corrected and showed speed as she gained on
the early leader in the two path, chased the leader through the turn, was well placed and in contentions at the top of the lane but tired in mid stretch. DON'T
LOOK ETHEL vied for the lead three wide on the outside, loomed up close but then tired. LADY KRISTEN showed little. MUCHO MACHO BABY made no
impact. SEE YA BYE awkward start, never involved.

CITY GHOST was fractious loading, broke sharp, angled to the rail, established his position on the rail, set every fraction, won like it was no contest, all
alone on the lead. super game. CINCO GAL chased the winner through out and was second best today. COLLECTED DREAMS was bumped and angled
into the rail in a ninety degree turn by a rival on his outside, was guided by his jockey to stop and then travel down the track and chase the rest of their
competitors, gathered himself up and found his stride, accelerated and improved position along the rail, found clean racing room saved ground the whole
trip but had to settle for third today. Still a game effort. FOREIGN TOURIST maintained position through out. SIBERIANA stalked briefly and then faded.
BETONYA was never involved.

Footnotes
CHIEFWEAVE showed early speed, was racing from the three path, was still out in the three path advancing into the turn, rated a bit and controlled the
pace to his liking, was first into the furlong ground, was driven and encouraged, stayed on point, was threatened in the last few jumps but had done enough
early and held on for a well deserved win. KINGS WAGER vied for the early lead from the four path, stalked the leader from the outside in company with a
rival on the rail, briefly was joined by another foe on the outside and raced in between, was asked at the half mile pole and advanced still in a set with his
inside rival chasing the leader, entered the stretch, shook the inside rival, angled down to the fence, had aim on the leader, was closing in with each stride,
but the eventual winner reached the wire before he could over come him and had to settle for second. MAGIC LIGHTNING raced along the rail in a stalking
position, was joined by an outside foe, raced in set chasing the leader into the stretch, tired late. KINGPRIN raced in between horses off the pace but made
no impact. FLASHBACK WIND was off a step slow, raced in the two path, saved ground and improved position in the stretch but to no avail. FLASHBACK
WIND WAS VANNED OFF AFTER THE WIRE. JUDGMENTAL was well off the pace early, saved ground and raced along the fence throughout, was
gaining ground and had improved position, was slightly steadied going into the turn, raced flat through the stretch. DARK MATTER showed little. YOU
YOUR DADDY SON flashed early speed, raced three to four wide, then tired.

Footnotes
SATURDAY'S GOLD vied for the early lead, matched strides on the from end with another rival from the three path, accelerated through the turn, cornered
beautifully entering the stretch and took command, then drew off to win easily. MORRICONE raced mid pack in between horses, improved position, racing
in the three path, battled in the stretch and prevailed for the second. BISPING stalked the early leader, stayed in contention through out, was in a battle
coming down the stretch and was up for third. SABER RUN raced from off the pace, closed with a mild bid. GOLD MERRITT vied for the early lead, settled,
stalked, tired late. PEPPER JACK was off a step slow, gathered himself up and found his stride, improved position late. TARGET PRACTICE stalked the
early pace while racing in the three path, maintained position until the sixteenth pole, but had no late kick. MR. FOUR SEVENS was off a bit slow, raced four
wide and made no impact. JAKE THE BAND MAN showed little.
