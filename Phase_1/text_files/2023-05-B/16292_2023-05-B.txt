Footnotes
SIR WELLINGTON set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely inside of CHICKS DIG SCARS passing the furlong marker, battled with
that rival and inched away late in a determined effort. CHICKS DIG SCARS pressed the pace racing close up outside of the winner, bid on the turn, dueled
with the winner in upper stretch, dug in gamely to the finish and earned the place spot. FIVE DREAMS stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn,
dueled, dug in gamely outside rivals in the stretch drive and continued willingly to the end. ALWAYSINAHURRY raced off the pace inside, advanced at the
quarter pole and rallied mildly on the rail. CHIEF RON raced two wide off the pace, chased inside on the turn and rallied mildly in the two path. CLASSIER
hopped at the start, stalked outside, chased four wide on the turn and had no rally. AL LOVES JOSIE stalked the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally.
YODEL E. A. WHO was outrun early and did not factor.
