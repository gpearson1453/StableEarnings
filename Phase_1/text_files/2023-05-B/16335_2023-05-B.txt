Footnotes
SIR GREYSON away a step slowly, was asked to show speed leaving the break, established the early lead and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions
while hand urged along the bend, drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong pole and drew off under hand urging in the final sixteenth to be much the best.
HYDRO FROST close up in the early running, saved ground along the turn while chasing SIR GREYSON, was outrun by that rival in upper stretch, was no
match for the winner in the final stages and was well clear of the rest. ALWAYS PERFECT unprepared at the start and was off slowly, trailed while saving
ground into the turn, was not able to impact the top two in the final stages but ran on in the stretch to secure third. MIGHTY RULER chased the pacesetter
while outside of rivals early on, ran in pursuit while three wide on the turn, shifted in in upper stretch, gave way in the drive and was outfinished for third.
WESTERN SIERRA chased the quick early pace while two wide, came three wide into the stretch, lost position at the furlong grounds and tired.

Footnotes
SHANAGOLDEN allowed to settle in the early running, was well placed through the backstretch run, was steered four wide along the far turn, was roused
four deep into the stretch, rallied to come within aim at the furlong marker, battled determinedly while vying for the lead to deep stretch, found more in the
late stages, made a final push and won the nod on the wire in a blanket finish. TAKE THE TWO TEN settled just off of the moderate early pace, was well
positioned through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, responded to steady urging and
matched strides with SHANAGOLDEN to the sixteenth-marker, battled gamely to the finish and was bested in the final strides, while getting up in time to
secure second. DANNY MICHAEL settled along the rail early on, was roused into the second turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took a narrow
lead into upper stretch, held that slim advantage to the furlong pole, battled to deep stretch but could not hold off the top pair in the end and was outfinished,
while holding safely for third. THE LONNA RANGER sent leaving the break, dictated terms into the first turn, set modest fractions through the backstretch
run, drew to a clear lead heading to the far turn, came under pressure at the quarter marker, lost the lead in upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker,
could not keep pace in deep stretch and gave way in the final stages. CRYPTO MUNNY took back in the early running, saved ground through the
backstretch run, improved position two wide along the far turn, waited behind runners approaching the top of the lane, was steered three wide into the
stretch and did not offer a response in the drive.

LASMUIGH (GB) rated kindly off of the decent early pace, advanced outside of rivals along the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, came within
aim at the furlong marker, took command at the sixteenth-pole and held in a drive in the final stages to prevail. PINEAPPLE JUICE settled off of the
moderate early pace, improved position from a two wide path on the turn, gained ground and came within aim at mid-stretch, was outfinished by LASMUIGH
in the late stages and closed well to secure second at the finish. JERSEY BABE hustled to establish the early lead, set a decent pace heading to the turn,
was pressed by TEAGANS ATM to the quarter marker, shook free approaching the furlong pole, raced on the left lead while fending off rivals to the
sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch, remained on the left lead into the final stages and was outfinished for second, while holding
safely for third. TEAGANS ATM forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace into the turn then pressed the pacesetter to the quarter
marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. DARK MYSTERY lacked early speed, trailed along the turn, was steered four wide into the
stretch and did not factor. RIVER'S BENCHMARK off a step slowly, rushed up in the early going and chased the pace into the turn, lost position
approaching the quarter marker and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
RIVIERA SUNRISE hustled to establish early position leaving the start, set a pressured pace to the turn while carving decent fractions, was confronted by
HAUGHTY KITTY on the turn and dueled with that foe to the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch and took a slim lead to the furlong pole, battled
two rivals to deep stretch while racing along the rail, held a narrow lead to the final strides and determinedly held on at the wire to prevail in a blanket finish.
HAUGHTY KITTY prominent in the early running, pressed the decent early pace while outside a rival, advanced to duel with RIVIERA SUNRISE to the
quarter marker, lost a step to that rival in upper stretch, re-bid inside of the furlong marker, dueled between runners to deep stretch, could not get by the
determined winner in the final strides and was gamely bested, while just holding for second. BIKINI NATION chased the decent early pace, advanced three
deep on the turn, engaged with the leading pair in upper stretch, battled three wide to the sixteenth-marker, could not get by the game top two in deep
stretch and missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for third. MORO FIRST CLASS chased the decent early pace, advanced approaching the
turn and raced between runners into the bend, checked and was shuffled back leaving the three-furlong marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole and was
outkicked in the final stages. PAPER TIGER chased the decent early pace from the inside, lost position on the turn, was coaxed along two wide into the
stretch and tired in the drive. CHANTELLE was away slowly, lacked early speed and did not factor.

Footnotes
BIG STRIKE settled off of the solid early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, made a steady gain to the furlong
marker, took command inside of the furlong pole, kept to task under steady urging and held in a drive to prevail. KERRYGOLD LADY broke a bit awkwardly
and was off slowly, chased the solid early pace from the rear, advanced while saving ground on the turn, waited behind runners in upper stretch, came
within aim at the furlong marker, was outkicked by BIG STRIKE in the final sixteenth and ran on in deep stretch to secure second. CREATIVE MOTION sent
to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, dueled with LADY GREGORY along the bend while carving quick fractions, continued to battle
that rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished for second in the final strides. LADY GREGORY prominent
in the early running, pressed the solid pace while on a hold into the turn, dueled for the lead while between runners nearing the quarter marker, continued to
battle with CREATIVE MOTION to mid-stretch, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. JAYS ANGEL bobbled leaving the start
and was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear in the early going, gained ground two wide on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong marker, offered a late rally but was not able to threaten in the final stages. SNIP close up in the early stages, pressed the solid pace into the turn,
advanced three wide on the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SATANTA unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, closed with a rush inside of the furlong pole,
surged in deep stretch and was up in time to nail his stablemate for the win. STANFORD BAY broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms to
the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker while carving solid fractions, shook free in upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker,
began to weaken in deep stretch, was all out in the final strides, was nailed by his stablemate on the wire for the win and held for second. HARBOR SKY
settled just off of the fast early pace, saved ground into the turn, improved position heading to the quarter pole, swung two wide into the stretch, could not
keep pace with STANFORD BAY in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the sixteenth-marker, came within aim in deep stretch, was outclosed by SATANTA
and just missed for second, while well clear for third. MUAY THAI (IRE) took back off of the fast early pace and tracked outside of a rival heading to the turn,
gained ground while two wide along the bend, angled four wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally. COPPER
HALO was forwardly placed in the early running, attended to the pace down the backstretch, pressed STANFORD BAY along the turn, could not keep pace
in upper stretch, dropped back approaching the furlong marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ENOS SLAUGHTER well placed in the early stages, settled in the second flight while two wide along the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run,
continued to make a steady gain into the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, overtook
ANITANEWMERCEDES nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. ONE FAST BRO unhurried in the early running, saved all
of the ground through the backstretch run, raced two wide along the far turn, improved position heading to the furlong marker, rallied through traffic into
deep stretch, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished by ENOS SLAUGHTER in the final stages and missed for the win, while
getting up in time to secure the place. ANITANEWMERCEDES conceded the early lead to PARK ROAD COWBOY and stalked that rival into the first turn,
attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, advanced to vie for the lead at the quarter pole, took command into upper stretch, was set down
at the furlong marker, could not hold off ENOS SLAUGHTER nearing the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished for second in deep stretch, while holding safely
for third. TABLE FOR TWO allowed to settle in the early running, raced two wide into the backstretch run, improved position three wide on the far turn,
swung five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and closed willingly in the late stages. CAISSON forwardly placed in the early running, was
a bit keen along the first turn while stalking the pace, moved up while three deep along the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker,
chased ANITANEWMERCEDES to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the drive and weakened in the final stages. HEAT N REHEAT hard to load prior to
the start, settled in the second flight early on, raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained his position to the half-mile marker, made a steady gain
to the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and was gaining in the final sixteenth. SEA OF LIBERTY allowed
to settle early on, was well placed through the backstretch run while saving ground, advanced three wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
did not rally in deep stretch. AGATINO (IRE) settled off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained that inside path to the far turn,
trailed approaching the furlong grounds and did not offer a late response. PARK ROAD COWBOY broke alertly, showed early speed and dictated terms into
the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure at the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the
furlong grounds and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
ROY HOBBS bumped with MY BUCKET LIST right after the break, quickly recovered to joined the early fray on the outside, raced four wide down the
backside, engaged with TOWN PERFORMER through the turn, got the better of that one turning for home and ran on well under strong handling to prevail.
MEGA MOON was off a step slow and raced behind horses but close down the backstretch, awaited room through the turn, was in a bit tight down the
stretch, got clear late and surged to gain second. SLEW'S JOY broke outward at the break, fell behind early, gained several lengths on the field with the
sustained run through the turn while racing wide, made a nice run through the stretch when set down but was outfinished for the place. BLUEGRASS GO
GO broke sharply and joined the early pace battle, held position through the turn racing in the two path, tipped out for the stretch run, got in a bit tight near
the furlong marker to lose all chance but managed to hold position to the wire. TOWN PERFORMER sent for the lead right from the break, led the field to
the top of the stretch with several in close pursuit, held on well to mid-stretch then weakened passing the eighth pole. RESERVE PROOF unseated the rider
and ran loose prior to the start, broke a bit slowly, chased the pacesetters down the backstretch, came under a ride early, made some forward progress then
had to steady going into the turn, lacked room through the turn, came into the stretch with clear run on the rail but was spent from earlier efforts and was no
factor late. RAYS REGAL struggled to keep pace early on, fell back then moved to the rail for the run into the turn, made a tepid bid from the three furlong
marker when asked to pick it up and improved position a little bit. ZEE PERFECT STORY outrun from the break then fell well behind the field after a quarter
mile, chased the field to the stretch, kept to task and managed to pass one in the late stages. MY BUCKET LIST broke out and made light contact with ROY
HOBBS, raced between horses while part of a quartet contesting the early pace, was squeezed, then bumped by ROY HOBBS when that one shifted in,
then bumped BLUEGRASS GO GO, backed out that situation then moved to the outside of the duel, reralllied briefly on the turn then began to weaken as
the field turned for home and faded.
