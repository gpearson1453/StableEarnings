Footnotes
REBECCA G showed early speed and found herself on the front end attending the pace, while she ran in the three path, showed the way around the course
until she was briefly threatened by an outside foe at the five sixteenth pole, was able to keep that challenger at bay, drifted in and out a bit in the late stretch,
still raced a game a race and was up for the win. SEE SASSY RUN left a bit slow, was rushed onto her feet and put into the race right away passing horses
from the five path, was cued at the five sixteenth pole but didn't have enough to over come the eventual winner and chased through the lane but was able to
earn place honors. NEW YEAR'S PARTY stalked the early leader from the four path, was in contention early but had no finish. A. K. A. GRAMS was off a
step slow, then was keen in the bridle for the first quarter of a mile, settled along the fence and tracked the early leaders, maintained her position into the
furlong grounds then gave way. COMMERCIAL FLASH showed little.

Footnotes
CHIEF CHARLIE was strong out of the gates was determined to be near the front of the field, was angled into the three path saving ground in the first turn,
while being rated off of the early leader, settled into a stalking position and was patiently waiting for the cue by the half mile marker, launched a bid after the
three eighths pole, easily took command of the race by the quarter pole, and drew off willingly. ELUSIVE D'ORO was mid pack early on, raced in between
foes and had to steady for a stride, started to slowly gain ground and improve position with every stride while racing in the four path, was stalking the early
leaders by the second bend and was able to continue to gain momentum and close deep into the stretch, couldn't get to the eventual winner but was up for
second. HELIOCHROME took the early lead and comfortably set the early fractions, saved ground through out, was challenged after the quarter pole,
battled with and outside foe, was over come by that challenger but kept on gamely until into the furlong ground where he gave way late but had done
enough work early to sustain the show spot. OBVIOUSLY TOO stalked the pace from the two path, was briefly joined by two other competitors and
advanced after the half mile, sustained a mild bid. DECLARE WAR raced off of the pace from the two path, improved position and was mid pack by the half
mile pole, took a ground saving trip, but had no late kick. MOUNTAIN BREEZE raced off of the pace, advanced into mid pack by the half mile pole, while
racing from the outside, but was never a threat. MAGAZINE STREET showed little. NO KA OI was racing wide and was never involved.

Footnotes
LIONS NOT SHEEP was rated just off the early leaders and stalked from the five path, gained ground and advanced at the seven sixteenth, was
accompanied by an inside foe briefly, passed the early leader, repelled his company challenger and drew off as he pleased in the stretch. ROOSTER RUN
had an awkward start, lost ground in the first few jumps, was allowed to settle a bit and find his best stride, then was encouraged to make up ground from
the four path, continued to be pushed and driven to keep improving position, gained momentum through the turn and was in contention after the quarter
pole, though he could not get near the eventual winner, he was able to pass the other early leader and finish with a game second. BIG SCULLY was
forwardly placed early on, raced in between foes after the half, advanced along with the eventual winner through the turn but could not keep pace with that
rival and gave way late. SHADY GRADY was never involved. NOOGE vied for the lead, set the pace, was collared by outside rivals and tired.

BE BO vied for the lead, settled just off the pace in hands while racing in the four path, patiently waited until she was asked at the three eights pole,
responded confidently as she collared the early leaders, took control and easily drew away. PAYNT THE MOON vied for the early lead, matched strides and
co led with another contender while being on the inside, saved ground through out, was collared at the three eighths pole by the eventual winner, but was
allowed to catch her breath leaving the second turn giving her the edge after the sixteenth pole where she was able to repel and outside challenger and out
finish the rest of the field and earn place honors. BISTINEAU BELLE was allowed settle clear off the pace early, raced at her own pace until the half mile
marker where she was edged into the four path and launched bid, gaining ground and improving with every stride, was in touch with the field at the three
eighths pole, was asked and responded with a nice turn of foot as she closed in on the eventual winner but tired late and had to settle for third. GREER
CROSSING vied, matched strides with an insider rival from the three path as they set the pace, was caught by an outside challenger at the three eighths
pole and gave way. MALLORI'S MAGIC broke a bit slow, raced well off the pace early along the inside, was asked at the half mile marker, inched out into
the four path as she launched a late closing bid, but it wasn't enough today. SENSING GOLD was racing mid pack, was pushed to start gaining ground
down the backside, was gaining momentum with every stride, but then had to steady into the turn and was through after that.

the quarter pole, angled in entering the stretch, continued to close while splitting horses at the sixteenth pole caught the early leader within the last few
jumps and was up for a very nice win. AMALFI SKY took advantage of the one post position and went to the front, attended the pace while saving ground,
led all the way into the furlong ground where she was caught by another rival late and had to settle for second place today. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE raced off
the pace while saving ground, was able to improve position through the turn and out finished the rest. CONDESA'S HANDMAID vied for the early lead,
raced in between foes while being forwardly placed in the three path, maintained position until she tired late. SAY WHAT was mid pack through out but to no

Footnotes
DARE TO FAIL raced from well off the pace early, moved at the half mile pole, closed and was up just in time. BELLO CREEDO set the pace while saving
ground, led throughout and was caught late. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE raced mid pack and maintained that position through out. DARK MATTER was no
factor. MAKE YOUR DESTINY was no menace. WESTERN STAR showed little. PINK HIGGINS brief speed, faltered.
