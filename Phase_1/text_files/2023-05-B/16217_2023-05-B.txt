Footnotes
SMART ACT tracked the leaders four wide outside rivals, bid through the far turn and edged clear through the lane under steady handling. AUNT CARI
moved inside leaving the first turn to stalk in close position, made a mild bid through the lane but could not get to the winner. CHAMA forced the pace
outside CLASSIC FAREWELL throughout and was overtaken by the top pair through the lane. O. D.'S ANN BABY was never a factor. SAY WHAT YOU
WILL floated out into the first turn, trailed and gave way. CLASSIC FAREWELL made the pace while pressed throughout, went wrong straightening into the
lane and was vanned off.

MILLI STARR moved to a clear lead going to the first turn, made all the running about the two path and held a clear margin throughout under steady urging.
ZIPPORAH saved ground back off the early pace, angled out in the far turn to move three and four wide and rallied to gain the place while no threat to the
winner. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY tracked the winner's pace three to four wide and lacked a closing rally to lose the place late. AUNT IRENE saved ground and
failed to mount a rally. DIVA DE KELA was always back. STARLIGHT TWIST was not a factor. LOVESAFLYIN pulled up in the far turn and walked off under
her own power.

three and four wide then continued on to gain the show while no threat to the top pair. CHERUBIM prompted the pace outside the winner to the far turn and
had nothing left nearing the lane. GAINER was always back. FERRARI ROAD followed the pace three wide and tired.

SHIPMAN'S SONG tracked the leaders three and four wide to bid into the far turn outside MOST AMUSING then slowly edged clear through the lane.
MOST AMUSING was on the pace three wide outside a rival, continued about the three path while challenged by the winner in the far turn and could not
handle that one late. THORNISH dropped off the early pace three to four wide and rallied to clearly best the others. CREATIVE LETTERS was not a factor.
MY BOY GUS showed speed inside the runnerup to late backstretch and dropped back while drifting out into the far turn.

FAYETTE WARRIOR was on the pace inside a rival to kick clear nearing the lane and was kept to task in the lane. SANCOCHO (MEX) saved ground to the
far turn, rallied three and four wide into the lane but could not get to the winner. TIGER THE MAN moved up four wide while no threat late. MASTERPIECE
DAY forced the pace outside the winner to the far turn and weakened. BIG BIZ settled back off the two leaders going up the backstretch and tired.
MATRICULATE raced wide in the first turn and was always outrun.

DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR was on the pace three and four wide outside rivals to the far turn, shook free through that bend and held a comfortable margin
through the lane. RECKLESSNESS went with the winner early, settled back inside and regained the place but could not threaten. NO LIMITATION moved
up four wide to bid in late backstretch and weakened. KEARNEY tracked the pace from three wide and weakened. POVERTY FLATS was not a threat while
four and five wide in the far turn. GERDY'S BOY was not a factor. NUGGET OF GRACE was three to four wide and weakened. THE GREATEST EAGLE
took a bad step leaving the gate and was pulled up before going a quarter then walked off under his own power.

could not get by the winner in the drive. OREGON COUNTY was on the early pace inside the winner then held position through the lane. THREE BALL
stalked the pace three and four wide to be in reach turning for home but lacked a final closing run. LARCH saved ground and lacked a final closing run.
SCOOTER'S BOY was not a serious threat late four wide. KNIGHTED failed to mount a bid two and three wide. JUST ASK JOEL was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUEENSCABALLO stalked the early leaders three wide to bid between rivals in late backstretch, moved clear into the far turn and held sway under steady
handling. P R ODDS SETTER tracked the early pace four wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn then could not go with that one in the lane.
TELLITTOTHEJUDGE settled back off the early pace, rallied four wide in the far turn but could not get to the top pair. ZIBBY TOO was off the early pace
two and three wide, moved up through the far turn but was outfinished for position late. SING CHARMER SING moved up late three wide while not a threat.
JUDGE ON THE RUN saved ground to move up going to the far turn but weakened. JOY FOREVER was with the early leader three to four wide and
weakened. JUST LUCK made the pace along the inside for a half and tired.

Footnotes
KENHEDOIT stalked the early pace three to four wide, rallied through the lane and went clear under steady handling. LUCKWOULDHAVEIT stalked the
pace three to four wide and made a late run through the lane to pick up the place while no threat to the winner. PICKELJUICE prompted the pace outside
the winner and lacked a final closing bid. NAME THE PRICE made the pace along the inside and came up empty in the drive. PAISANO JIM followed the
pace four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. L B GOLD was not a serious threat three and four wide. REPORT TO DUTY was always back outside.
LITTLEBIT DON saved ground and was not a factor four and five wide. MISS ADDISYN K saved ground and tired.
