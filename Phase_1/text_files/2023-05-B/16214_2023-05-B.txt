Footnotes
MILEYS BLUECAT prompted the pace from the two path then fell back on the turn but made a rebid from the inside in the stretch to draw clear in the late
stretch. ABRAAJ MIRAGE vied for the lead from the inside then checked slightly at the three furlong pole and dropped back but was able to pass tiring ones
in the stretch. WARRIORS HERO broke out slightly at the start but showed no early speed through the turn, went four or five wide in upper stretch for a late
run and was just up for the show. BARBARIAN went to the front to set a pressured pace from the three path then was headed at the quarter pole and fought
off DECIMATE on the outside but was not able to fend off the inside rival and tired. DECIMATE was off the pace in the early stages then made a three to
four wide bid on the turn to engage the leader but was empty in the drive. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE
NEAR THE THREE FURLONG POLE, THE JOCKEY OF ABRAAJ MIRAGE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MILEYS BLUECAT FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOULS WAS DISALLOWED AND NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SILVERY ORB prompted the pace from the two path then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and gave a late effort to prove best. MISS DYNAMIC was
rushed to the lead from the inside was challenged at the quarter pole and fended off the challenged until the final sixteenth then gave way grudgingly. DADS
ESTRELLA was within striking distance from the inside but was no match for the top two. ALICESHOUSEOFHEART showed no early speed then saved
ground around the turn but was not a threat. PRINCESS PAYTON tracked the leaders from the three path but never made a bid. CHIC SAMARAI was
forwardly place in the two path to the five sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
PISTOL POWER was hustled to a clear lead to the final turn then was challenged near the quarter pole and fought gamely down the stretch and dug in late
to prove best. NEW EAGLE was off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then split horses at the three furlong pole to engage the leader at the
quarter pole and matched strides down the stretch but couldn't over take the leader and was second best. OUTRIGHT was allowed to settle around the first
turn then made a rail bid going into the final turn but lacked the late response but proved to be the best of the rest. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT was unhurried
down the backstretch then moved up from three wide into the final turn, moved out to five or six wide in upper stretch to make a mild rally. ATOMIC CANDY
was forwardly place in the two path to the final turn but never made a bid. BABY FRANKIE raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail but was never a
threat. AFFIRM CHIEF tracked the leader through the final turn from the three path but had no response in the drive.

MS PARKSIDE shot to a clear lead then was challenged in upper stretch, dug in and held well. YOU GO GIRL was off the pace through the turn then
engaged the leader and fought gamely in the stretch but couldn't over take the leader and proved second best. MS LYNN was pinched back and bumped at
the start, trailed through the turn then angled out to four or five wide at the eighth pole and made a late run to be up for the show. OREO'S DREAM saved
ground to no avail. PEARL RIVER DELTA bobbled at the start and was bumped two times then rushed up to be off the pace through the turn, moved out to
three wide in the stretch but was out finished. CIELO DIAMANTE raced near the back to the turn the made a mild bid from two wide but was empty in the
stretch. IN THE RED broke in at the start then chased the leaders from mid pack and was never a factor. FRISCO FRILLS raced wide throughout and tired.

Footnotes
COASTAL JAZZ was off the pace on the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and took over in early stretch and drew clear. CLAYTON
DELANEY last away and trailed the field, gained momentum going six wide around the turn and made a late rally to be up for the place. CODY'S CHOICE
prompted the pace from the inside but had to steady slightly at the three eighths pole and made a rebid from the inside and just missed the place.
FANTASTIC DAY saved ground from near the back around the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch for a late run. MUNCEY raced in the middle
of the pack, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. CAPITAL EXPENSE had good speed but was collared in early stretch and weakened. PICK
YOUR BID had brief early speed and retreated.
