Footnotes
PURRFECT MOON brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the three path
coming around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong to go and just held off a closer to the wire. JERUSALEMA (IRE) trailed the field up the backstretch, raced
in the three path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to just miss. GRANDIOSE SUMMER tracked the pace setters
between horses through the early going, came around the bend in the four path and chased the winner home in the lane. DIXIE GIRL TO dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. PAT'S
GAL brushed with the horse to her outside at the start, recovered to chase the leaders between horses up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two
path and was outkicked in the lane. SMART LEAH dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the five path and
tired in the stretch. SKEDADDLE'S LEGACY raced off the pace through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CHIVE UP was sent to an early lead up the backstretch, opened up further while racing in the three path around the turn and held clear to the wire.
SAILSINTHESUNSET chased the leader through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the three path and kept on to the finish. LYRICAL
raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late, angling out in
the final strides and just missing second. BETTY'S BAR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
four path and improved position in the stretch. BRAHMS IS WHO trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made up some
ground in the stretch while never threatening. ATLANTIC PRINCESS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the early going, came around the
turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. PEPPERMINT SISTER raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the bend
in the two path and made no bid.

UNIFIED DREAMS raced in the five path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the four path coming around the far turn and dueled down the lane to just get up for the win. THOUGHT saved ground around the first turn, tracked the
pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to just
miss. OUT RUN'M raced in the two path early, chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the three path
and kept on in the stretch. WORDS OF WISDOM led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way
while racing in the two path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. COUSVINNYSACANUCK raced in the three path early, settled off the
pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was not a threat. MENDELSSOHN JOY raced in the four path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the second bend in the three path and made no bid. GHOST
STALKER trailed far back while racing inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and was not a factor.
