Footnotes
VANISHING FAITH pursued outside, went after the winner on the turn, took over into the stretch and drew off driving. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY quickly
sprinted away, was collared into the stretch and just held on for the place. REID'S FANGIRL chased within range in the two path then went evenly in the
stretch. TOTAL DISCRETION stumbled at the start, lagged far behind, made a rail trip and finished with late energy. ONE PAIR OF HANDS saved ground
off the leaders and began fading on the turn. BLANCHIMENT raced off the pace inside and gave way readily. INCOMPARABLE dropped far behind outside
and was never in contention. LEAPING FOR CANDY lacked speed and raced far back throughout.

Footnotes
MS. MALEVOLENCE settled inside, angled out advancing at the quarter pole, collared the leader at the top of the stretch and pulled clear. GIA'S FUEGO
prompted the pace early, led at the five sixteenths pole then weakened. KENAI COOL moved inside close up down the backstretch and faltered.
ADVOCATE HARBOR dropped back along the rail and lacked a solid rally. HEY DEWZPOTS broke sluggishly then passed fading rivals. ANGINETTI
chased near midpack and was never a factor. QUASAR dropped far behind and was always outrun. JULIET'S MUSIC hustled to the front off the inside then
was finished after half a mile. TIZ GRACIE was urged close up wide down the backstretch, stopped abruptly and returned bleeding.

Footnotes
FLASHNDYNAMITE vied inside early, was collared at the quarter pole, faded briefly in midstretch then came again in a determined score. BABY GUNDIN
moved up inside before half a mile, led into the stretch, bid clear but was nailed at the wire. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED broke slowly, advanced inside then
raced evenly through the stretch while no threat to the top pair. MISS DILLINGHAM lacked speed, angled inside, moved back out on the final turn and was
no factor. WONDER CITY pressed the winner for five furlongs and gave way. CONFIRMED GENIUS chased off the leaders outside and was never
involved. SOLEMN OATH broke alertly then lacked speed and gave way readily. TOMARIE dropped back wide early and stopped abruptly.

FORE HARP quickly took control, was collared in midstretch, resisted a strong challenge and held on gamely. RECYCLE pursued the winner, reached near
even terms in midstretch but could not get by the winner. SACHMO saved ground off the pace then went evenly in the stretch. MARGIN OF AIR raced
within striking range outside and lacked a solid rally. MEET THE ELITE dropped back early then moved very wide into the stretch. ET'S MAGIC MAN was in
tight soon after the start then failed to menace. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA dropped far behind and was never in contention. NORTHERN EXPRESS settled
three wide off the leaders and gave way in the stretch. CIRCLE ME MADDEN dropped far behind losing contact with his field.
