CALI stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, assumed command, inched clear and held well. LIL DITTY'S KITTY came out at the start, raced in the back,
angled out for the drive, closed willingly and was gaining late. MUSTANGMAGNA set a pressured pace, was unable to sustain her bid and held safely for
show. COZZOLANI was never far back, raced inside, angled out mid stretch and failed to rally. TWO ANGELS got away well, pressed the pace, challenged
on the turn, fell back and leveled off.

WEST TEXAS RAIN set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and was all out at the wire. MISTER WAYSIDE bumped and was squeezed at the
start, raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn, bid six wide and closed willingly. DOCTOR TINK pressed the pace, challenged for the lead between horses
on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded. WRANGLERED broke in and bumped at the start, went five wide entering the stretch and closed steadily.
CRAZY LOVER showed good early speed, fell back, was blocked and awaited room on the turn, bid once clear and hung late. ROMANCER broke slowly,
trailed early, bid inside on the turn and failed to menace. PORTSMOUTH broke out and bumped at the start, bid between horses into the turn and fell back.

Footnotes
SEARCHIN SAFARI came in at the start, veered back out, set a pressured pace and drew clear in the drive. OUR MOON PIE pressed the pace, went four
wide entering the stretch and closed to get up late for place. BABY LIAISON pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, vied, didn't have enough
late and was caught for second. NIGHT VISION saved ground, bid inside on the turn and lacked the needed late rally. STORMS LAST showed good early
speed, raced between horses on the turn, went five wide entering the stretch and dropped back. QUALITY BLASTOFF broke awkwardly to be off slowly,
was taken wide, advanced to the turn and faltered. MAJESTIC LOVER showed little. TRUE DOMINUS was steadied after the start, crowded into the turn
and raced wide.
