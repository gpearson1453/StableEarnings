Footnotes
TURIAF showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and held safe under strong pressure. MY YAMMY LADY lunged at the break, was
allowed to settle early on, moved up five to six wide through the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. SMART KITTEN stalked the pace, raced three
wide between rivals and finished willingly to the wire. BOURBON GLAZE rated along the inside under a firm hold, raced near the rail in the stretch and was
outkicked through the stretch drive. THREAD COUNT was unhurried early on, fanned six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.

under a firm hold, asked near the five sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire racing three deep in the drive. BLAZING JAMIE settled early on,
moved up from the outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. OH GREAT (IRE) stalked the pace, raced four to five wide and kept on willingly to the wire.
CARDIFF CRACK raced mid pack early on, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. TEX HANLEY was
unhurried early on, raced three to four wide and had no response. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) stumbled at the break and unseated his rider.
