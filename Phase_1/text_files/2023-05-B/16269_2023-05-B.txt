SABELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace, dug in gamely when challenged by the runner up and proved best by the narrowest of
margins under right handed urging. ROMANTIC JEWEL drifted out soon after the start, start, chased the winner from the inside through the turn, angled out,
loomed boldly while drifting out under right handed urging to the middle of the racetrack and just missed. GRAND PRIZE stalked the pace two then four
wide into the stretch, angled inside the runner up and finished with good courage in the six path. TUFFIAN never far back, swung wide and closed some
ground late in the middle of the racetrack. LUCKY TO HAVE ME was squeezed a few strides out of the gate then failed to reach contention. BISCOTTINI
was no threat. ANDIAMA failed to menace. EASY EYES saved ground and weakened in the stretch.

PATIO PARTY sprinted to a narrow lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace under relentless pressure from the runner up, drifted from the four
to the eight paths while under left handed urging through deep stretch and prevailed by the narrowest of margins. HIPPODROME matched strides with the
winner two wide into the stretch, was carried out by that one to the nine path and just missed in a game effort. MY BROTHER CAM with the second flight
along the inside, angled out entering the stretch, drifted to the middle of the racetrack under left handed urging and was steadily gaining ground late.
MOESTER never far back moved up three wide on the backstretch, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then finished evenly. TIP SHEET was no factor.
RAMIRIN close up into the stretch, gave way. SCORSESE failed to menace. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW
