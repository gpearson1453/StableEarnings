Footnotes
NICO took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths and contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn, then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. NO CHANGE rounded the opening turn about the
three path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and contested the far turn at a close disadvantage, but ultimately,
had to settle for second. CANDY INVASION settled off the rail the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, raced a close factor in the three
path of the far turn and dueled through the stretch for third. NEVER COMPROMISE stalked inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and loomed a close
factor near the rail on the far turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. J J WEDGIT MAN saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the half mile
pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. CRYPTOSONDE rounded the first turn in the three path and raced well back.

Footnotes
THE EXCEPTION was taken well back from early contention while saving ground, started a steady bid leaving the half mile pole, raced two deep through
the far turn, angled four wide from the heels of rivals mid-stretch, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear toward the wire. STEPHANOPOULOS saved
ground through the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole then steadied midway on the far turn, angled to the five path entering the stretch and dug in
to take second the final yards. GREY INVASION stalked three wide the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested the far turn at even terms,
dug in to take a brief slim lead in later yards but relented nearing the wire. PRINCE VALESKI stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths
pole and dueled at even terms from that point, continued two deep on the far turn and had a slim brief lead inside the eighth pole, but relented later yards.
DOMINATOR saved early ground while racing well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed
rivals down the lane. STROLLANOTHERTIME settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn near the rail then weakened. LUNAR IMAGE raced wide and was never a factor. MUSTA NEVER MET U rated the pace inside, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the five sixteenths pole and contested the far turn nearest the rail, then weakened through the
lane. I'D LIKE TO KNOW raced off the early pace about the three path and left the first turn outside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths
pole, then weakened in the four path of the far turn.

Footnotes
NOCASHREFUNDS rated a short lead inside then drew clear of Foggy Attitude at the five sixteenths pole, came under pressure to widen at the rail on the
far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rated close inside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved
at the rail on the far turn, but was no match through the lane. CRISTIANO BOY saved ground off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and raced at the rail on the far turn then dueled through later yards for third. FOGGY ATTITUDE broke awkwardly and made contact with Raspberry Tea,
bobbled as a result and entered the first turn in the five path, stalked two deep from the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths, but
dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn. JAXJAXXORJACKS stalked the earlier pace in the two and three paths, gave chase into the
backstretch but flattened in the four path of the far turn. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN saved ground well off the pace, eased out into the backstretch and gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. RASPBERRY TEA saved ground the first turn then
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but showed only mild response. AZURE FIRE was bumped at the break, raced in the four path the first turn then
gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, faded toward the far turn.

Footnotes
GANDHI'S CASTLE rated a clear pace through the backstretch, was urged away at the rail on the turn then steadily handled down the lane. SILKEN BELLE
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, was no match in the stretch but held on for second. STOP TALKING chased through the
backstretch and raced in the three path on the turn, took third mid-stretch and was gaining on the runner-up. FINDER ANGEL R V F chased inside, raced
near the rail on the turn and finished evenly to improve her position. LA DUQUESA was unprepared for the break and ducked to the outside, gave chase
through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened in the stretch. SHANNA'S GRAY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then
weakened. VILLAMOURA was roughed on the chute and veered to the wide outside, was not a factor, though, saved some ground on the turn. GINGER IN
DISGUISE gave chase and rounded the turn in the three and four paths. KISSES FOR HEIDI was pulled up nearing the three eighths pole and walked off
post race. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MADDEYE MOODY rated close in the two and three paths the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and closed on the pace-setter in the
three path of the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole, drew clear approaching the sixteenth and was taken in hand late. RIVER WARRIOR RVF
stalked inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished well to take second later yards. A GREAT
AFFAIR broke a step slow then accelerated to the front while tapering toward the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths
pole, was headed a furlong away, dropped back toward the sixteenth pole and weakened. C R'S MANDATE entered the first turn about the five path then
angled in midway on the turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane.
JACKSON MAN rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and was well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the half mile pole
then flattened at the rail on the far turn. MY BOY STRYKER saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn,
drifted toward the head of the lane and passed rivals. MODERN DAY ROMANCE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. GHOST MINE saved ground. DISONESONTHEHOUSE saved ground on the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. COUNTRY OUTLAW bore out and appeared a bit rank through the first turn, raced wide into the backstretch
then saved ground on the far turn.

Footnotes
NORTH ATLANTIC saved ground through the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, circled rivals four wide on the far turn, dueled for the
lead mid-stretch and dug in under determined handling to inch further ahead late yards. FINAL SAY stalked off the rail the first turn, started a bid nearing the
three eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to take second the final strides. WILLIAM AND MARY
rated the pace inside, came under mild pressure leaving the half then driven into the far turn, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was
steadily encouraged through the stretch and dug in gamely, but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. OPERA NITE stalked from the
three path then moved to striking position into the backstretch, gave close chase from the half mile pole and contested the far turn at a close disadvantage
two deep, then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. AWSOME FAITH saved early ground and raced well off the pace through the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and raced in tight quarters in the upper stretch, but came back to finish evenly. BUFF'S
EYE VIEW bobbled at the break and rounded the first turn off the rail, was eased out into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths,
raced two deep on the far turn then flattened the final furlong.

turn and held on well under steady stretch encouragement. WALK A FINE LINE chased and rounded the turn about the four path, then dug in from the top
of the stretch to take second later yards. TAPTAP gave chase through the backstretch and raced two deep on the turn, was carried outward toward the
head of the lane and took over third from GLOBAL EMPRESS in the final yards, while the latter, pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole then
checked at the rail past the five sixteenths, recovered stride off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch then flattened later yards. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED
chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, angled to the seven path approaching the top of the stretch and ran evenly through the lane.
POWER SONDE chased and raced near the rail on the turn, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and finished evenly. COOK THE BOOKS
gave chase toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. LIL SASSY GIRL stumbled to her nose leaving the gate and dropped well
back, then left the turn about the eight path. BADS FREESPIRIT gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path then flattened.
