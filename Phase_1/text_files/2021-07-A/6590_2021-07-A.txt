Footnotes
LUCKY PERIDOT raced in range outside a rival through the early stages, entered the stretch three to four wide, drew alongside FLATTERWITHJEWELES
at the quarter pole, grabbed the lead at the three-sixteenths pole and kicked clear. SUGARY stalked along the inside the shifted to the two path on the far
turn, lacked room behind the top pair at the quarter pole, steered outside and finished well but had to settle for second best. FLATTERWITHJEWELS broke
out, dueled for the lead from outside, inched clear around the second bend, was overtaken by the winner at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened to third.
TIZNO'S DILEMMA settled off the pace, traveled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and never responded when asked. PAIGE RUNNER dueled for
the lead from inside to the far turn, lost contact with the leader into the stretch and gave way.

WATCH THE FED raced off the pace early on, went four wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, angled out and surged late to overhaul the runner-up.
CASILLALATER dueled for the lead from outside to the stretch, cleared inside rival and held command into deep stretch but was run down by the winner.
LISTEN LINDA well placed behind the top pair early, angled four wide leaving the turn, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch, continued willingly under
hand urging and held third. MISS LADY ANN got bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival then moved out on the turn and entered the stretch six
wide, finished evenly in deep stretch and missed the show. EXCHANGE VOWS got bumped on both sides in the beginning, went three wide into the turn
then angled to the rail, tipped out in upper stretch then came back in approaching the eighth pole and kept on through the final sixteenth. NIP NAP dueled
from inside to the stretch, could not keep pace with CAILLALATER in upper stretch then weakened in deep stretch. PASITO raced at the back early, moved
to the inside, angled out to three path on the turn, steered out further in upper stretch and failed to menace. NONE OF YOUR BIZ broke out and bumped
rival at the start, stalked three wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and failed to respond. GODDESS APHRODITE chased along the inside then
shifted to the two path leaving the turn and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DANCER sped to the front to obtain control, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, clear at the half-mile pole, showed the way two to three wide
into the drive and powered away. RAILSPLITTER pressed the pace from between rivals, chased the winner past the half-mile pole, entered the stretch four
wide and churned on for a clear second. ABSOLUTE UNIT attended the pace outside the top pair, chased the pacesetter four wide into the far turn, exited
the bend five wide and flattened out. SIGALERT stumbled badly at the start, stalked the pace from inside to the head of the stretch, tipped out at the quarter
pole and could not rally. KENNEBEC trailed the field into the stretch, came out in the lane and never threatened. DR. HOFFMAN went two wide around the
first turn, two to three wide around the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCKY LONG LEGS raced up close from outside, moved up to dueled for command around the turn, grabbed the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, continued
to battled with BIG PASSION through the drive and inched away late. BIG PASSION chased early then went up to take control nearing the nine-sixteenths,
dueled around the turn and down the stretch and yielded grudgingly late. LADY O'PRADO stumbled and brushed inside rival at the start, angled to the
inside and moved closer to the top pair, saved ground along the rail into the stretch and bested the rest. BLUEGRASS SKY brushed from outside leaving
the gate, showed early speed along the inside, could not keep pace with the leader then checked between rivals entering the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and continued on to improve position. WILD ARCH chased between foes, was in tight and checked entering the turn, exited the bend four wide and
could not rally. HEART RIVER tracked off the rail, traveled five wide around the turn and weakened. NORTHERN GEM went four deep into the turn, exited
the bend four wide and weakened.

IM STILL THIRSTY broke in and brushed rival, stalked the top pair early on, angled out on the turn and went up to challenge then got floated six wide
leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely under urging. THIRSTY CHAPO chased outside a rival, traveled two wide into the turn, came
out into the four path leaving the bend, closed well and was clearly second best. SMOKEN SHADOW bumped at the start, chased from inside and churned
on through the final furlong to earn the show. TAKEITTOTHEBANK raced up close outside the pacesetter, challenged for command into the turn, dueled
around the bend then got floated five wide into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner and flattened to a minor award. BLAZING CANDY away
quickly in the beginning, dueled around the turn, drifted out into the drive and weakened in the late stages. SOCAL RED hit the inside portion of the gate,
got bumped by rival and steadied early, raced near the inside through the turn and could not threaten. MESA EMPIRE hesitated and was bothered from
outside at the start, saved ground through the turn and never rallied. LOUIE ZAMPERINI fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped rival, came in and
bumped again early, went three wide into the drive and failed to menace. PRIMED FOR DRINKS was always outrun.

Footnotes
HARPER'S GALLOP dueled from inside into the first turn then ceded the lead to SHE'S A DIME, switch outside that rival chasing off the rail, bid alongside
on the far turn, drifted five wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear. SHE'S A DIME dueled for the lead from outside around the first
turn the assumed control into the backstretch, met the bid from HARPER'S GALLOP on the far turn, drifted four wide into the lane, lost command in upper
stretch and stayed on to secure the place. RISEN LADY went four then three wide around the first turn, trailed up the backstretch, navigated the far turn two
wide, summoned a mild response in the lane and gained the show. FEATHERS (IRE) was off a bit slow and hit the outside of the gate at the start, moved
closer up the backstretch, entered the lane two wide and failed to respond. ARCTIC ROLL (GB) sat off the pace early on, angled five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed late kick. 7/8'S TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
PRINCE RICKY dueled for the lead from outside, shook free from inner rival near the three-sixteenths pole and held well in the closing moments. SUPER
CLASSIC tracked off the inside, traveled four wide into the stretch, closed in deep stretch but was not enough. IT'S FITTING raced off the pace, traveled
four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch, finished well outside the top pair and proved a game third. VEGAS MOON chased three wide into the turn,
came out into the five path leaving the bend and bested the rest. CALDER VALE angled to the inside early, moved into the two path around the turn and
failed to threaten. DESERT SWARM dueled for command from inside, lost touch with the winner at the three-sixteenths and weakened. ARRIVEDERCI
ROMA showed early speed from inside then chased the top pair to the turn, navigated the turn in two path and could not rally. WESTERN SMOKE hopped
slightly at the start to come away last, raced five then four wide around the turn and had little left for the drive.
