into the stretch then was outfinished in the final yards. DILLY DILLY PHILLY dueled between rivals, loomed a stretch threat, continued willingly but could bet
get by. BLUE SHINE angled inside while outrun early and lacked a solid rally. CARMELTINI broke slowly and raced far behind throughout. CORN OFF THE

TOOK A CAB saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and edged away under steady handling. WEST FORK dueled along the inside, drifted out into
the stretch, lost the advantage but finished willingly. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE stalked the leaders three wide. moved closer quarter at the pole then tired. EL
FENOMENO forced the pace in the two path then weakened slightly in the stretch. THE REIGN MAN dropped back outside and lacked a rally. EL
DULZURA saved ground off the leaders and was never a factor. DOUGIE chased wide down the backstretch, moved inside on the turn and failed to
menace. LITTLE VINNIE was pinched back just after the start and raced far behind. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD dropped back in the opening quarter and gave
way readily.

YOU MUST CHILL awaited room inside, angled out on the final turn, collared the leader, edged away and held off late challenge. SHOOGER RAY TOO
settled at the back of the pack inside, moved out in the stretch and rallied well too late. HEROS REWARD hustled to the front inside, was hooked midway on
the final turn and continued gamely. IRISH MEADOW chased outside, was asked for run into the far turn and flattened out. LUCKY HERO prompted the
pace for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
HEART RHYTHM angled inside moving clear then remained safe under steady a drive to the finish. SUBSTANTIAL chased wide throughout and finished
willingly to earn the place. DROPPED ANCHOR raced in midpack outside then then finished gamely between rivals. KNOW IT NOW broke very slowly,
rushed to contention inside then raced an erratic course in the stretch. NAUGHTY PRINCE dropped back early, moved very wide into the stretch.
SOUTHERN BRIDGE lacked speed along the inside and failed to respond. ARRECIFE lagged far behind then closed the gap without menacing. CLASSY
AMERICAN pursued the winner outside and stopped after half a mile. CHAMPERS saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.

GINGERS WISH pressed the pace outside, took over nearing the quarter pole and pulled away under moderate urging. TALE OF KITTEN trailed far behind
then advanced inside to gain the place. SWEET SAMURAI fractious in the gate delaying the start, chased wide and flattened out. LADY LYNNE set a
measured pace inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened. SHARON'S LAW settled close up between rivals then proved empty in the stretch.
MARIANNA QUEEN dropped back inside, moved wide on the final turn and was no factor. OUI MADAME lacked speed inside and gave way readily. HOPE
TAKES OVER saved ground close up for half a mile and stopped.
