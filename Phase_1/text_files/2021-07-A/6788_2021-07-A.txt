Footnotes
GO FOR A RIDE, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, turned back a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and edged clear
late under firm handling. TOIL AND TROUBLE angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn
to upper stretch but proved no match late. SOVIET tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and
improved his position racing through the stretch. STONE SECRET tracked the pace between foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide
nearing the lane but had no closing bid. MY DOMINATOR, reluctant to load in the gate, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the first turn, continued
near the inside throughout and passed some tiring rivals. OWN THE TOWN raced in the four path three deep tracking off the first flight to the backstretch
and faded racing into the far turn. STAR MISSION settled into stride off the inside early and proved no threat.

Footnotes
STAR OF THE NORTH, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage racing into the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and
held sway to the end under firm hand urging while her rider flashed his whip. OWEN'S PLEASURE came under some prompting in the opening stages while
dropping off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch and produced a late response to edge a rival for the place honors
on the wire. HELL OF THE NORTH broke sharply, tracked just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, then weakened through the stretch while just
missing for the place honors. SAILING ALONG angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, shifted off the inside racing into
upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final bid.

Footnotes
GOTHAM CITY QUEEN was urged through close quarters to join the first flight four wide between foes pressing the pace into the turn, gained a narrow
advantage while shifting to the inside racing into upper stretch and held CYNICAL GIRL safe to the end under firm handling. The latter, in touch with the first
flight five wide in early stages, pressed the pace between foes into upper stretch, lost some ground to the winner midstretch but continued willingly to close
the gap late. FADED ROSE, slow into stride, settled well off the leaders to the turn, switched outside foes entering the stretch, then improved position three
deep between foes in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. KNIGHT'S HONOR, urged to terms with the first flight three wide between foes
pressing the pace, weakened in the drive. SHEDIALED BURREAUX, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes while being urged to
lodge a brief, six wide bid entering the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN ducked out at the start crossing into the path of the
eventual winner and dropped back early. PRINCESA DEL SOL was urged along the rail pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. WHAT NOW MY LOVE flashed brief pace between foes racing to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
CAMPS BAY, bumped at the start, settled last racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum angling outside foes on the far turn, swung four wide racing
into upper stretch advancing smartly on the leaders, took over leaving the furlong marker and went well clear under pressure. CANDY COVE, urged along
the inside prompting the pace racing into the first turn, was eased off the pace entering the backstretch, shifted outside the leaders to advance three wide on
the far turn, moved to gain the advantage between calls in upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. LIBERTARIAN tracked off the
first flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to gain contention three deep between foes nearing the lane but
lacked the needed final kick while continuing well enough to earn a share. MORE THAN A. P. joined the pace three wide racing to the first turn, pressed the
issue outside a rival gaining a narrow advantage on the backstretch, dueled between foes into the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. LAST PROMISE,
urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. JERRYS PRIDENJOY proved no
factor .

Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER angled inwards prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out under
pressure racing through the stretch but steadily kicked away. KID'S INHERITANCE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, saved
ground on the bend, shifted out racing through the stretch to the four path in late stages but finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors.
BAYOU BENNY, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, weakened midstretch. THICK HAZE tracked off the second flight
racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and passed tiring rivals. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY, bumped, then stumbled at start dropping off the
leaders early and never gained contention. GOLDEN GULLEY tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the bend but gave way early. WESTA WAVERLY
broke in bumping a rival, was switched out three wide to briefly challenge the leaders racing into the turn but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
CINCO STAR, prompted to a forward placing three deep racing to the first turn, tracked just off the leaders through the backstretch, advanced between foes
bidding for command midway through the far turn, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch, went clear under pressure and was taken in hand late
once the issue was decided. TWOKO BAY settled last outside a rival racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the lane gathering momentum
and continued with a steady late response to gain the place honors in late stages. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN, urged along the inside prompting the pace into
the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the winner to upper stretch but faded late. FIREMAN OSCAR, squeezed between foes at the break, settled along the
inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes to race three wide through the far turn, then shifted inwards entering the lane but had no rally while his rider
gathered up his mount in the final sixteenth. DAME PLATA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight to the backstretch but offered no rally. HOT SHOT
KID tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. MR. JAGERMEISTER went up to force the pace
outside a rival racing to the backstretch gaining a narrow advantage, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and abruptly gave out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
READY TO RUNAWAY broke readily to gain the advantage along the rail racing to the first turn, conceded the lead nearing the backstretch, switched
outside the pacesetter to bid between foes racing into the far turn, gained the advantage nearing upper stretch, then held CLICKBAIT through late stages
under firm encouragement. The latter tracked well off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, steadily gained position along the inside entering
the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing the lane while being roused to challenge but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC
angled inwards racing to the first turn while being urged to the lead outside a rival, shifted to the rail once gaining the advantage, set the pace along the
inside racing into the far turn, then gave way midstretch. GRAND PRIZE settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and continued
evenly to late stages. FIRSTMATE tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped outside foes after a half, was
fanned four wide racing through the far turn and came up empty in the drive. DIVA DE KELA settled between foes, then dropped out last on the backstretch
and passed some tiring rivals late. RENTAL POOL, urged along three wide tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted inwards to race between foes
after a half, then gave way between foes racing into the far turn. DOUBLE BEE STING, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, never gained contention.
TWO BE ROYAL settled along the inside early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RUSTY CAGE exchanged brushes with KIERKEGAARD at the start, was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, then
maintained a clear advantage to the end under firm encouragement. OUTERBANKS angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing into
the turn, was fanned three wide in the closing stages but continued with a determined effort to narrowly prevail for the place honors. DEUCE angled to the
rail tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, shifted out to bid between foes nearing midstretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while just
missing for second. KIERKEGAARD exchanged brushes at the start, tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide in the closing
stages but finished with interest to just miss for a share. I'M A SPECIAL STAR angled to the rail early, saved ground to upper stretch but failed to menace.
CINTAROSA RANCH switched outside rivals in early stages and trailed throughout.
