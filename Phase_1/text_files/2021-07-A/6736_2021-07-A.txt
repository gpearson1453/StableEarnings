JOVIAL DESTINY sat in striking position while two to three wide, drove between rivals at the head of the lane, responded to steadily handling late stretch
and inched up for the win. IMPOSING CAT set a pressured pace, was under attack into the stretch and was wore down. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT broke
inward, angled to the rail at the head of the stretch, shifted out to the four path and was along late for show honors. YORKTOWN prompted four wide,
moved up alongside IMPOSING CAT and was edged out late. PACIORETTY chased outside and faded.

KENSINGTON MARKET tracked inside, chased the leader into the stretch but was unable to reach the winner and held firm. MARYAM tracked the
pacesetters, rallied four wide at the quarter pole and was unable to improve her position through the stretch. PRINCESS ROBBI sat just off the pace while

CHICKALETTY vied for the early lead while three wide, gained a slim advantage through the far turn, responded to looming threat and stayed clear.
AWESOME GIGI reserved off the pacesetters outside, moved up closer fanning three wide into the far turn, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the five
sixteenth marker but was unable to reach the winner and finished up clearly second best. CUVEE TEE sat behind the pacesetter along the rail, was set
down for a drive at the quarter pole, angled out to the three path and held position. BOUND TO BE SMART took a hold leaving the chute, settled mid pack
in the three path, encountered some traffic in the final turn, rallied outside then weakened late stretch. BIG AND FLASHY raced from the back of the path
outside, bid outside then drifted inward under right handed encouragement and yielded under after no response from urging. SAYGE'S SPIRIT pressured
the pace outside, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and dropped back through the field nearing the quarter pole. TOP DEMON last away,
chased outside and gave way. MISS DIRECTED saved ground and was done early.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT last away, advanced steadily outside quickly overtook the leaders, remained unasked through the stretch and was ridden out with
confidence. SMART PLAY saved ground while setting the pace from just off the rail, dueled for the lead through the far turn inside of WALKTHELINE, was
overtaken approaching the stretch, was kept under steady handling and held sway. COZY BEAR was gapped in the early stages, gained closer order
leaving the far turn, closed determinedly outside late stretch and missed out. SIR MIEZIE reserved the early pacesetters, roused nearing the quarter pole
and lacked a closing response. WALKTHELINE sat just off the pace early then moved up alongside SMART PLAY with four furlongs remaining, pressed the
issue through the turn and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. DOUGS PAL sat in range, rolled up quickly outside the pacesetters under a strong hold,
after the five eighths marker, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
LA CHICA DE FUEGO hopped leaving then was allowed to settle in stride, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, waited briefly in traffic then shifted out
closing ground and dug in late nipping COUNT ON IT before the wire. COUNT ON IT hurried inside, angled out to the three path, chased the leader into the
stretch, got by that one then was caught. NO BAKK TALK broke inward bumping into SHANNON'S SECRET then vied for the early lead, showed the way
through the turn, was confronted by COUNT ON IT near the three sixteenth and gave way grudgingly late. SHANNON'S SECRET bumped leaving the gate,
hurried inside but clear lacked running room, chased along the rail through stretch but was unable to improve position through drive. MUSIC AT WORK
broke alertly away from the gate then contended the pace while four wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and dropped back. CARAT'S SONG
tracked outside, circled wide into the lane and failed to threaten. LIGHT FAST FEET sat in range while three to four wide and lacked response when called
upon.

RYANWATER raced wide through the backstretch, took closer order leaving the backstretch, drove four wide into the lane, reached the front and won
driving. NEVVARE reserved off the pacesetters from the three path, bid three wide leaving the final turn and lacked the rally needed. POOR RUBEN saved
ground from a rail position, bid steadily through stretch and was along in time for show honors. KICKEN WEST G. sat three wide off the pace, matched
strides through the far turn outside of ARCHIEWAY and faded on the rail. SALTY LITTLE DOG tracked the pacesetters from the rail, chased hard through
stretch then lost his path late stretch. HUERFANO G. trailed and passed tiring rivals late. OUR MONEY CAT raced five wide into the opening turn and
lacked a serious bid. ARCHIEWAY contested the pace through the backstretch, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole and gave way soon after. IGNITE
THE MOON raced in close quarters leaving the opening turn, chased four wide through the backstretch then was through early and was reported the official
veterinarian as having bled. THE TRUTH PROJECT raced wide through the first turn, chased the pacesetters through the backstretch while four to five wide
and stopped with two furlongs remaining.

Footnotes
SLEW'S BAK allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, found running room inside just after the five sixteenth pole, rallied gamely inside of SOLO RING and
drove clear. SOLO RING set the pace under a snug hold, turned back challenge from TRIPLE POWER then was soon confronted by SLEW'S BAK but was
out finished to the line. WAR GIANT raced three wide through the backstretch, drove four wide at the three sixteenth pole and finished evenly. ZICATELA
tracked outside, roused into the lane and passed tiring rival late. TRIPLE POWER broke well, prompted outside of SOLO RING, was headed into the lane
and yielded. REGAL MAX sat in striking range outside, fanned four wide and tired. WEEKEND WIZARD saved ground, dropped back quickly leaving the
final turn and gave way. PORT PROTECTION offered little.

Footnotes
BRING HOME STANLEY broke outward into FORTITUDE, hurried inside, shifted out to the two path nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead into the
stretch and drove clear. PADDYSDAYCHARM quickest to the turn, showed the way through the turn, was overtaken and held on for place. TANGERINE
TAXI bumped leaving, chased through the turn, closed late and missed. EVIL TERROR showed outside speed then raced four wide through the turn and
lacked the rally needed. ALYS CODE vied five to six wide and faded steadily. ARCTIC REIGN angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, lodged a mild
bid and weakened late. SILVER PRAIRIE lacked a serious bid. JIMMY FLASH hurried early and yielded. FORTITUDE bumped repeatedly leaving and
dropped back to trail through the turn. TINY TYCOON never reached contention.
