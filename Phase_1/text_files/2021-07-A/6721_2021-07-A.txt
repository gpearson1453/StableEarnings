Footnotes
CAYENNE CREEK rounded the first turn in the three path and rated close into the backstretch, closed to a boxed in position nearing the five sixteenths
pole, recovered stride past the quarter and took aim two deep approaching the head of the lane, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and was drawing away later
yards. ELLIE'S LIL MAN rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure at the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug
in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. BLACK STEEL raced between horses
through the front stretch and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase past the three eighths pole, ran five wide on the far turn then dueled through the
stretch for third. GOLDEN APPEAL raced off the rail on the first turn and ran outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and had range
on the leaders while four wide on the far turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MORGAN COUNTY stalked the earlier pace in the three path then
challenged at the three eighths pole, dueled close to the far turn but dropped back at the quarter pole, ran in the three path of the turn then weakened.
SIENTE EL VIENTO raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn toward the outside and gave chase through the backstretch then saved ground on the
far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
AMBER ROSE ADAM stalked inside then rallied to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear toward the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the
far turn and was maintained with a vigorous hand ride through the stretch. ENOUGH KISSES settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started
a bid leaving the half mile pole, improved off the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET saved ground off the pace, picked
up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BROADWAY TROUPER saved
early ground then picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, came through the far turn in the six path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
COFFEE AND HER raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn off the rail and showed little more. UNEXPECTEDLY raced well back from early contention, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the
turn about the four path and could only improve her position. RAVIOLI MAMA rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole then weakened four wide on the far turn. CHERISH YOUR DREAM saved early ground and never factored. TRIVATI settled back in
the three path the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn in the seven path. ANSHI took the lead approaching the
three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, was caught toward the three eighths, dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on
the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CHINA CAT settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide at the quarter
pole, dug in from the head of the lane to draw clear, and widened through later yards. UPSY DAISY DO saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole
then angled out at the five sixteenths, raced four wide on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and closed well to take second the final strides. KATIE'S
BAYOU took a quick lead and rated the apce inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was headed at the rail into the far turn, continued a
strong factor through the upper stretch though flattened the final sixteenth. ADIOS HILLARY steadied soon after the start then saved early ground and
settled back leaving the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved her position at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. PUT
POSITION stalked the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and dueled to even terms while between horses
at the quarter pole, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. YOUR EYES TO MINE raced off the pace inside the first turn,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. COOL MO raced wide and never factored.

Footnotes
AMERICAN PIPER angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was
steadily encouraged to hold off the challenge of DEJOHN, who broke a bit awkwardly then closed to contention and stalked two deep, gave chase leaving
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then couldn't improve significantly in the lane. TOPPSGOLDENTICKET raced well off the pace about
the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, bore out on the far turn and ran wide into the stretch, then steadily improved to
take third later yards. NEW SOUTH rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. FASHIONABLE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened three wide on the far turn. INDY DEL SOL raced well back in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid
leaving the three eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn and passed rivals in the stretch. R H F SPECTRE showed little response. BURN
THE SHIPS rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened on the far turn. D' WICKED steadied in tight
early then rated just off the pace in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the far turn. FIXATION
rounded the first turn in the three path, showed no response through the backstretch, ran wide on the far turn and was eased in the stretch.

TAKE ME HOME stalked then closed to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn and dug in under all out
stretch handling to hold on. BIRD TRAFFIC rated close about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, dug
in from the head of the stretch to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. MARY'S JEWEL saved ground close to the pace, bid leaving
the three eighths pole then eased to the three path on the far turn, was outfinished in the stretch duel for second, but just up for third. EARNED THE SHOT
settled off the pace saving early ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the five path toward the top of
the stretch and finished well. DAZZLE ME raced in the three path the first turn and was rated close into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole,
dueled at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. LIKE ME OR NOT rated a slim lead inside, was pressured
nearing the three eighths pole, caught toward the five sixteenths, dueled close nearest the rail on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. UNION
SONG broke a step slow and rounded the first turn in the three path, eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the six path

widened on the far turn then further extended his lead with steady stretch handling. MELTECH rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and settled
just off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved to take second midway on the far turn,
though, couldn't gain on the winner. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved early ground then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
then dug in to duel for third. EXPLOITATION settled back off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the
far turn, then outfinished in the later duel for third. RUM RUNNER RED ran in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. FLASHY READY RICK took the lead nearing the three quarter
