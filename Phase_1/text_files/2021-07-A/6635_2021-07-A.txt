IM JUST JOKIN raced in striking position and kicked well clear while three wide in the stretch. LEGIONARY was outpaced along the inside and rallied
strongly in the stretch. ESCROW STYLE hesitant to start, moved closer on the turn and made a belated rally in the stretch. BITTEN led early, was brushed
aside leaving the turn and kept on well. THREE FOR THREE never menaced. NOT ACCREDITED stalked the early and weakened. WIN FOR FUN veered
in at the start and was no factor.

WINNING MOMENT chased the pacesetter, responded to brisk pressure in the stretch and finished well. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP forwardly placed, moved
three wide into the stretch and finished willingly. EAST MOON LAKE awkward at the start, made up on ground on the turn, lodged a three wide bid but was
not good enough. MACHO MADNESS chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and managed a mild rally. PRIVATE TRUTH veered in at
the start and failed to threaten. DRIVER was always outrun. DAZZLING DIABLO led early, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. BIKER TIM
retreated.

DISCREET INVASION settled well, advanced turn, closed ground late and was along in time. SHIP BOSS led early, held well into the stretch, got headed
and stayed on well. JUSTA STREAK raced forwardly while three wide, moved closer on the turn, led late and was worn down. JAYSKER attended the pace,
remained in contention for the stretch run and lacked the needed bid. ITSALLABOUTYOU reserved, commenced a bid on the turn, was angled five wide late
and kept on well. STORMIN' J. J. outrun early, was swung six wide approaching the eighth and offered a late bid. GIO NASTY ONE was off slowly and
proved no factor. MOLLECK never menaced. OSCAR WINNER WALLY dropped back on the turn.
