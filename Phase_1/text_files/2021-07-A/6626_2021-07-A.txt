Footnotes
CANELITA set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. GRAZARION was unhurried early
and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MIDSUMMER BIRD was away alertly and a factor on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. SWEET FINALE was off slow and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat.
CEEBETT'S BOW was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

A GERSHWIN TUNE settled off the pace, had a bid on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. BREAD CRUMBS was hustled
early and dueled from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. KEEP GOING stalked the leaders from the
inside and was a factor on the turn but had no late kick. SOUPER DEPUTY was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch was empty. GHOST ISLAND was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

MAHONE BAY was well back, closed the gap on the turn and angled out at the top of the stretch to get up in time. STRIKING RED was in range, a bid on
the turn and had the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch but was outgunned late. WHO'S WHO INTHEZOO was in touch and raced evenly on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. SAN NICOLA PRANCER showed speed from the outside and had a slim lead on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. MARTINA'S GALS tracked the leader and dueled on the turn but was all out through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPRINGMEIER set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure in upper stretch prevailed. OPTIC stalked the early leader, dueled on the turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. WATER POLO showed no speed, was hustled along on the turn and from the three path at the
top of the stretch finished evenly. AMNESTY was off slow and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. J M R
VICTORY LAP was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. SEAL TEAM TWO was away alertly and had a good
position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. TOBRUK was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch came up empty.
