Footnotes
PRETTY CREATIVE prompted the pace around the first turn, vied for the lead outside of JJ HUNDRED PROOF through the backstretch, held a slim lead
turning for home, found more in reserve, repelled bids nearing the eighth pole and kept clear. SKYPED raced outside of rival in the second flight through the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, remained in striking distance in the upper stretch, failed to reach the eventual winner then but
stayed on with response and edged foe for place. ANICLUDE was allowed to settle through early stages, loomed up four wide at the quarter pole, remained
in striking distance in the upper stretch, could not reach the eventual winner but sustained a steady bid through the lane and just missed place. OGRE'S
LION KING was unhurried through early stages, saved ground then waited for a clear path at the quarter pole, tipped out two to three wide in the upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally. J J HUNDRED PROOF held a slim lead around the first turn, vied for the lead inside of PRETTY CREATIVE through the
backstretch, fought back around the far turn then tired in the drive. SERBIAN SAILOR raced off the embattled duo through early stages, urged two wide
near the quarter pole, shifted out wider for the drive and failed to move on.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BOGEY held a slim lead in the opening quarter then held firm around the turn, widened to a clear advantage under a strong hand ride near the
furlong grounds, felt SWEET RACHAEL edging up closer deep stretch, was put to a drive in final strides and held clear. SWEET RACHEL raced off the
clear top pair in early stages, hustled along three wide into the lane, came under strong left handed urging in the upper stretch, drifted out wider and was
gaining on the winner to the wire. KITKAT KITTEN raced off the clear top pair, saved ground around the turn then sustained a steady inside bid through the
lane and prevailed for a share. SWEET LEVI raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact.
CROWN ROCKET was urged into a forward position out of the gate, remained up close around the turn then came up tired in the drive. TANS SECRET
SHANCE raced off the early pace, moved into stretch run four wide and lacked a needed rally. FREE ONE lacked early speed, saved ground around the
turn and had no response.

the stretch run, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp under a mild drive. CABEZA DE TORTUGA was forwardly placed around the first turn and
tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch, lacked a clear path along the inside entering the far turn, got shuffled back near the five-sixteenths pole,
tipped two wide for the drive then angled to to the rail and produced a solid finish. C. F. SHELAUH was allowed to settle through early stages, coaxed two to
three wide near the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the rest. EM'S MISS PRADO floated out five wide around the first turn
then rated off the early pace, loomed a threat at the quarter pole, sustained bid into the upper stretch then gave way. MISS LAUGHALOT tracked near
mid-pack through the backstretch, came under a ride two to three wide around the far turn, failed to kick on and steadily weakened. VALADON took over the
lead leaving the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch then came up empty and retreated around the far turn.
