Footnotes
EXCALIBUR tracked outside the early leaders, ranged up four wide to challenge outside BLAKENSTEIN after six furlongs, jumped back to his left lead
approaching the sixteenth-pole and edged away. BLAKENSTEIN set the pace slightly removed from the rail, could not fend off EXCALIBUR through the last
eighth of a mile but held well to be clearly second best. MALIBU MANDATE hopped up at the break and came out slowly, got a bit closer around the turn
four wide, but lacked a finishing bid. SAMARONTI broke awkwardly and checked at the start, prompted the pace for six furlongs, and faded. PERUVIAN
DANCER bumped with ROAD TO PEACE shortly after the start, and was outrun toward the inside. SMOKEY SONG stumbled at the start, stayed close for a
half-mile, and tired. ROAD TO PEACE bumped with PERUVIAN DANCER a few strides from the gate, dropped far back after six furlongs and jogged in.

BAHAMIAN BEAUTY stumbled at the start, tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth
pole and quickly cleared. MISS YAYA stalked the pace three wide, struck the front near the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, was collared
near the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner while holding second. BELLA SOFI vied between foes down the backstretch and along the rail
around the turn then stayed on inside to hold third. SCIENCE dueled three wide down the backstretch and two wide around the turn and tired in the lane.
DOITTOGETHER had brief speed inside, angled four wide midway around the turn and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
LOVIN LIVIN saved ground nicely settled off the battling threesome up front, shifted out four wide approaching the top of the stretch, took over outside JEDI
JANE through the furlong grounds and drew away merely flashed the crop. JEDI JANE vied outside WE BLESS LUCK and TRINNI BEAUTY early, got the
best of those two after six furlongs, proved no match for the winner coming to the eighth-pole and ran on clearly second best. ASPROPODIA went along in
the second flight for a half-mile, moved out four wide advancing mildly late on the turn, but lacked a solid closing bid while able to get up for the show
outside. WE BLESS LUCK vied inside rivals for six furlongs, and faded. BUNNY PRINCESS broke a bit slowly, and never factored near the three-path.
TRINNI BEAUTY contested the pace between rivals for five furlongs, and dropped out of it soon after that. SWEET ACTRESS broke slowly, and was
through early three wide.

FARM STRONG stalked the pace three wide, seized command turning for home, vied through midstretch then drove clear. BAD BOY E. J. settled off the
pace while racing two wide, angled four wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished willingly outside of the
winner to be clearly second best. FEELING DANGEROUS pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. MACHO REAL tracked the pace inside,
angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. NOT SO EASY set a pressured pace along the rail and faltered in the lane. BODIE CODY was outrun while
racing three wide.

Footnotes
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL tracked from close range outside the leaders, challenged for command between horses three wide past the quarter-pole, dueled
inside KOZY DREAMS through upper stretch, and proved best through the late stages. KOZY DREAMS advanced to contention past the midway point of
the turn, reached even terms outside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL after straightening away for the drive, but was outfinished. BAHAMIAN GIRL dueled inside
TREVESS early, came under fire from PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL and KOZY DREAMS after a half-mile, and faded into the stretch. TREVESS argued the pace
outside BAHAMIAN GIRL for nearly a half, and weakened. MISS MIAMI saved ground outsprinted early, moved out four or five wide approaching the
stretch, and had no closing response. DOMINEER was finished early two wide. SALSA RITA broke a step slowly, and was outrun two to three wide.
OBLIO'S WISH broke a step slowly, and raced far back inside.

DAHLONEGA raced off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command leaving the eighth pole, switched back to the left lead near
the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. KIFFLE stalked the pace three wide, moved to the front leaving the quarter pole, led to midstretch and was no
match late. J'S INDIAN CHARM set the pace inside and weakened in the drive. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT failed to menace while racing four wide. THE
GREAT KATH pressed the pace two wide, was in a bit tight while unable to match strides nearing the lane and came up empty in the stretch. STORMY
NELLY broke a bit awkwardly but on the lead, was outsprinted down the backstretch, checked near the half-mile pole and made little further impact while
saving ground. DISTINCTLY BLUE chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
DOCTOR D J was outrun early, began taking closer order two wide approaching the top of the stretch, rallied through an ample opening between the
leaders coming to the sixteenth-pole and edged away staying on his left lead. CANDY CRUSHEM vied early inside KEEPSAKEKITTEN while off the rail,
moved clear before going a half-mile, dug in to turn back a challenge from GREEN MANSIONS after six furlongs, and stayed on with good courage inside
the winner. GREEN MANSIONS advanced four wide getting alongside CANDY CRUSHEM a quarter-mile out, but could not sustain the rally and yielded
through the closing stages. DARK AGES saved ground early in midpack, moved up under urging on the turn while shifting out to the three-path, and
flattened out through upper stretch. KEEPSAKEKITTEN vied outside CANDY CRUSHEM before letting that one go midway up the backstretch, remained in
pursuit entering the turn, and gave way before completing six furlongs. AYCAPOTE went along in the middle of the field for a half, put in a mild run five wide
approaching the stretch, but had nothing more. SAINT LARNED hit the left side of the gate at the start, and never factored inside.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM vied two wide down the backstretch, drew off around the turn and widened under a drive. PHILO raced in range two wide, continued
on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. AMBASSADOR JIM chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. ALL GOOD was outrun
inside. NOTSOSUBTLE led early inside of the winner, appeared to take a bad step near the three-eighths pole, lost the rider when trying to pull up soon
after, galloped across the finish line and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD tracked from close range outside the early leaders, ranged up three then four wide to go after WILLY BOI with a quarter-mile remaining,
reached the front coming to the furlong marker and edged clear, then held off CHANCE IT to the finish. CHANCE IT was never far back, advanced after a
half-mile shifting out five or six wide, had aim outside MILES AHEAD through the lane, gradually whittled away the margin but did not have quite enough.
DIAMOND OOPS was a half-step slow to begin, took closer order after a half while following behind MILES AHEAD, came six wide into the lane and rallied
mildly. WILLY BOI set a pressured pace near the inside for a half, yielded to the winner once straightened away for the drive, and faded through the last
eighth of a mile. DOUBLE CROWN bobbled at the break and was slowest away, went to the turn at the back three wide, shifted out a couple more paths
approaching the stretch, stayed on his left lead and finished one-paced. FROSTED GRACE was slow into stride, and remained outrun toward the inside.
OURNATIONONPARADE stumbled sharply at the start, and began to fade inside before completing a half. SHIVAREE pressed the early pace between
horses, and gave way past the five-sixteenths under heavy pressure.

Footnotes
CE CE settled off the early pace while racing two wide between horses, split rivals three deep near the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and
powered clear under right-handed urging. ESTILO TALENTOSO was off slowly, angled out soon after, advanced three wide between foes around the turn,
bid four wide just outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to win
the place duel. SOUND MACHINE stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, turned for home on even terms inside of winner,
could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, stayed on well and just missed second. HALLAWALLAH raced off the pace four wide and passed tiring
rivals in the lane. PACIFIC GALE vied two wide down the backstretch, cleared early on the turn, led to upper stretch and tired through the lane. LAURA'S
LIGHT stumbled at the start, recovered enough to get into position just outside of the winner down the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn and had
no response. HEIRESSALL played no factor while racing three wide. THISSMYTIME set the early pace along the rail, chased inside around the turn and
stopped after a half.

Footnotes
GRRR pressed the pace three wide, took over from outside in upper stretch and pulled clear, and widened while drifting out some. THE GLADIATOR (CHI)
set a pressured pace near the inside, was no match for the winner coming to the eighth-pole, and ran on clearly second best. JARLIAN raced four to five
wide around the turn, and finished evenly to best the remainder. CAMPEADOR stumbled at the start, pressed the early pace between horses, and drifted
wide tiring past the quarter-pole. SMART SOLDIER was never prominent. TINTORERO got brushed by PRAKRITI at the start, showed some early foot and
faded after a half-mile. DUEL FUEL bumped with AUTHENTIC HEART at the start, and was always outrun. PRAKRITI broke in brushing TINTORERO,
raced wide and was outrun. AUTHENTIC HEART got bumped between horses and was slowest to begin, and never got close. COMMANDER TRUMP was
finished early inside. BLUE TEQUILA bumped with AUTHENTIC HEART and was off slowly, and trailed far back.
