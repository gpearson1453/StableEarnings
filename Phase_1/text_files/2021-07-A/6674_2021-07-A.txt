NURSE RACHETT sluggish early, angled out on the turn, moved extremely wide into the stretch then surged to get up in time in a blanket finish.
MELODIOUS SINGER vied in the two path between rivals and continued gamely to the finish just gaining the place. RICA CHICA moved to the inside early,
dueled throughout and finished willingly. MOON ME AGAIN prompted the pace three wide, poked her head in front on the turn then tired slightly. SPIRIT OR
SPITE raced close up in the two path in the opening quarter, moved wide in the stretch with a mild rally. THEA BEE raced just off the leaders outside and
faded steadily. KEFALIANI dropped back at the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT alternated for the lead outside, took over into the far turn, drew away in hand then was kept under moderate urging. TINK stalked
the leaders three wide, went after the winner on the final turn, but proved no match. IZZADORA BELLA lagged far behind then advanced very wide into the
stretch. HETTY G. saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. BETTER YET was fanned four wide into the first turn and never a factor. HIDENSEEK
SALLY dueled along the rail to the final turn and gave way readily. MARVELLA displayed poor action from the outset and was eased early and was walked
off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. PER THE DELAWARE RACING COMMISSION, WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT HAS BEEN
DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

fractious in the gate prior to the start, settled inside, bid in the stretch and just missed. FLOWMOTION reserved inside to the stretch then closed well while
no threat. JACK THE UMPIRE chased off the leaders between foes and continued willingly. WEATHER WIZ dropped far behind three wide then offered
some late energy. TOSS saved ground well behind and lacked a solid rally. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT settled in midpack and was never a threat.
CALIFORNIA SWING trailed early then passed faltering rivals. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN fanned wide into the first turn, remained wide and was no factor.

TRIFOR GOLD broke alertly and was rated outside, led in the two path before half a mile, moved clear to midstretch and held on gamely in a narrow
decision. CANNON'S ROAR settled off the pace between rivals, bid in the stretch, appeared a threat but could not get by the winner. INDIAN LAKE in tight
into the far turn, recovered, was blocked near the top of the stretch, angled in and rallied. ASPECT trailed long way then moved wide in the stretch closing
the gap. MARKET MOVER dropped back early and continued willingly while no threat. SAMEDI NIGHT alternated for the lead inside early, eased back after
the half and faded on the final turn. TAXABLE GOODS fanned five wide into the first turn, remained wide and faltered.
