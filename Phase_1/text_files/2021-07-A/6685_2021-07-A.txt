SUPREME AURA tossed his head when taken under a tight hold near the five-eighths then moved forward to prompt the pace on the outside, vied in the
three then four path under urging on the turn, took over while floating five wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop into the final furlong,
continued to drift out while moving clear into the final sixteenth then was switched to a right-handed crop and proved best. HEIRLOOM KITTEN went to the
front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path under coaxing on the turn, came under stronger encouragement under threat outside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole then turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out into the final furlong and was outfinished while
clear for the place. HEAVY ROLLER settled nicely on the outside, was urged along while floating from four to six wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL settled towards the rear, was roused while saving ground on the turn
and failed to respond. DARK STORM was unsettled in the gate then off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two
path on the turn and came up empty.

STAR COMMAND established the front and showed the way in hand briefly five paths off the inside before tucking four then three wide, continued three
wide through the turn widening away under her own power, swung four wide into upper stretch, went clear in hand and had the rider take out the crop to the
left side flashing it just once inside the eighth pole, continued to slip away through to the finish prevailing comfortably at the end. HALO CITY chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on well clear
of the rest for the place honors. PENDOLINO six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. CREATIVE LEGACY four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from
home, spun three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
BOURBON'S HOPE disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, responded well
when put to a drive into upper stretch, repelled the runner-up into the final furlong and drew clear under steady handling. ROTKNEE was hustled from the
start, chased the leading duo on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match
while clear for the place. BOINTHEBACK dropped well back under urging, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch
and finished with late energy to just garner the show. SPETTRO was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied inside to the
two path under urging while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired then just lost the show. RESILIENT COURAGE was
urged along while well back on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came out some in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and failed to
threaten. SUNDAESWITHSANDY was hustled from the start then urged along well off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, turned into the
stretch under the crop and was no factor. LORD BROWNIE was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, saved ground on the turn and never
reached contention.

to the finish to prevail. KNOW IT ALL RED six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, ran on to

home, dug in under a near side crop and drifted out inside the eighth pole under threat, got collared near the sixteenth marker, weakened in the late stages
while along well clear for the show honors. CAPTIVATING CARA seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun six wide for home and weakened in the late going. SPUN FOR LU LU hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide

DREAMS OF TOMORROW was reserved at the rear on the outside, went three wide early on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths then moved
to four wide, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong then gained the advantage and proved best under
steady urging. LOST IN ROME was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path on the turn, was roused while a
length in front into the stretch then was quickly challenged by the winner, fought on with that foe into the final furlong then lost the advantage, battled to the
wire and missed while clear for the place. DANNY CALIFORNIA settled just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path while roused
at the three-eighths, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the top two into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for third. BLEWITT
showed the way while off the inside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, was urged along while inside on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-eighths and
faded. BLIND AMBITION was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path early on the turn, dropped back at the three-eighths then fell back
quickly while floating wide and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
THREE JOKERS forwardly placed just off the inside early on, advanced to take over command six and a half furlongs from home and showed the way
patiently handled tucking inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused just outside the eighth pole coming under threat to
the outside, widened away from the rest as a tandem and dug in gamely to get the nod on the wire. TOO EARLY three paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing just outside the five-sixteenths and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge a furlong out, latched on outside the leader and dug in gamely to the finish knocking heads through the final sixteenth but lost the bob on
the line while well clear of the rest. BOURBON BAY showed the way narrowly early on four paths off the inside, got headed for the front six and a half
furlongs from home and chased in closest aim, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing midway and faded, spun three wide for home,
weakened in the stretch while passing tired rivals who backed away quicker nearing the finish. I LOVE JAXSON seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. DANEBURY five
paths off the inside in aim of the front, tucked three wide through the turn and was placed to urging five-sixteenths from home, went four wide at the head of
the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS settled well back in the field, was roused while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the crop,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up in the final sixteenth under strong urging. STAND FOR THE FLAG stalked the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, shook clear when asked coming to the quarter-pole, responded well
under the crop in upper stretch, remained well clear into the final furlong, led while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was caught while well clear
for the place. ALWAYZ LATE settled on the outside, was asked while four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response while able to get the show. SECURE CONNECTION settled towards the rear, saved ground under coaxing on the turn, turned into the stretch in
the two path and failed to threaten. FOXTAIL pressed the pace loosely between horses, vied in the two path while between foes on the turn, dropped back
under urging at the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and tired. KILKEA set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the
turn, lost the lead under urging passing the five-sixteenths and faded. QUARTER-MILE FRACTION ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.
