sixteenths pole and gained ground while drifting out mildly in the final furlong, pulling clear late. MEDAL OF FACT dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. COCO

ground on the outside down the lane. TWO COOKIE RULE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path, made a mild improvement in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. RIP IT RYAN hit the gate and was away slowly, trailed the field up the

MONGOL BULL was sent for speed, took early pressure from SEANSHINE to his outside, saved ground on the lead through the turn, kicked clear when
shaken up into the lane, and held safe while kept to the task late. BOOM BOX raced three wide in the chasing flight down the backstretch and four wide on
the turn, bid in tandem with EASTER MUSIC to his inside approaching the quarter, proved no match for MONGOL BULL when he kicked away in upper
stretch, but kept on with interest between horses got up for the place near the sixteenth, and kept on willingly to the wire. RIPE ATTACK settled at the rear,
raced four to five wide on the turn, continued five wide into the lane, rallied, and got up for the show in the final jumps. EASTER MUSIC was herded in by
MONGOL BULL in the opening strides and grazed CONTRACTION as a result, raced two wide between horses in the chasing flight down the backstretch
and into the turn, was driven for a bid outside of MONGOL BULL and inside of BOOM BOX near the quarter, proved no match for that one when he kicked
away in upper stretch, chased on with continued interest, but was outfinished for place by BOOM BOX in the final sixteenth and lost the show in the final
strides. CONTRACTION was grazed by EASTER MUSIC in the opening strides after that one was herded in by MONGOL BULL, raced at the inside of the
chasing flight, saved ground in range on the turn, began to flatten approaching the quarter pole, was driven two wide in upper stretch, but came up empty.
SEANSHINE pressed the pace outside of MONGOL BULL, emptied out from the three eighths, weakened three wide, dropped inside to turn for home, and
had no response in upper stretch.

BACKSIDE BEAUTY bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, was urged to the lead, opened up under a hold while saving ground around the
turn, continued to extend his lead down the stretch and won under wraps. OZETTE bumped with the horse to his outside and was forced back leaving the
gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground steadily on the inside down the
lane, no match for the winner. IRISH HALO trailed the field on the outside in the early going, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wider still
entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. GODSGIFT hopped up and was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a mild bid near the quarter pole and was outkicked from there.
ANTECEDENCE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and weakened late.
HOODWINK chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced wide into the turn, ran in the three path from there, swung wide entering the stretch
and faded down the lane.

TOUGH TO TAME broke inward, tracked the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, raced inside of DEGREE OF RISK and NO
MORE Z U in the tracking flight in upper stretch, dropped to the rail near the three sixteenths, rallied under a drive inside, and caught the leader near forty
yards out. SPORT PEPPER broke inward, was sent for speed, set the pace while pressured by DEGREE OF RISK to his outside down the backstretch and
in the three path on the turn, kicked away from his foes into the lane, was clear midstretch, but was caught by TOUGH TO TAME on his inside near forty
yards out. NO MORE Z U tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, was urged for a bid past the five sixteenths, loomed
near the quarter, proved no match for SPORT PEPPER into the lane, was driven four wide in upper stretch, and chased on with interest to prove best of the
rest. RUSSIAN TANK was anxious in the gate, broke slightly awkwardly, trailed into the turn, was pushed along near the three eighths and began to improve
while angling out, raced six wide into the lane, continued to rally under a drive outside, angled in late and sustained his rally. DEGREE OF RISK was sent
for speed, pressed the pace outside of SPORT PEPPER down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, proved no match for SPORT PEPPER into
the lane, was in tight between horses in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. MR CREED was pushed early, nonetheless raced at the rear of
the main group into the turn, chased three wide on the turn, was swung out and driven six wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MAGICIAN
STONE was shut off in the opening strides and then grazed by RICHIE'S PALACE after that one bolted inward, , raced at the rear early, passed RUSSIAN
TANK into the turn while still well behind the rest, was urged past the seven sixteenths and quickly responded with a bid, split horses at the five sixteenths,
swung five wide into the lane, chased to midstretch but weakened in the final furlong. RICHIE'S PALACE hopped at the start, bolted inward in the opening
strides and was difficult to settle, chased near the rear of the main group into the turn, saved ground around the bend, was driven in upper stretch, veered
inward and weakened.

Footnotes
CLEMSON TIGER was bumped by ROCKET HOTSHOT in the opening strides, sent for speed inside, settled well on the lead, continued to set the pace in
the two path on the far turn, carried a clear lead through midstretch, was confronted by EYE OF THE CAT to his outside for the final sixteenth, dug in and
got the nod. EYE OF THE CAT chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase midfield down the backstretch, rallied between horses in
the four path on the clubhouse turn, sustained his rally persistently between horses in the lane, engaged outside of CLEMSON TIGER near the sixteenth,
vied with that one late but missed the bob. ADMIRAL RETURNS settled three wide near the rear around the clubhouse turn, inched forward into the
backstretch but continued to race toward the rear of midpack, made a circling bid in the five path on the far turn, sustained that rally into upper stretch,
loomed three wide near the sixteenth but flattened late. NEW YEAR SURPRISE settled between horses near the rear on the clubhouse turn, inched forward
into the backstretch and chased midpack, saved ground around the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, and chased on mildly to prove best of the
rest. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC was fractious in the gate, settled toward the rear, continued patiently in second last down the backstretch, began to take closer
order approaching the half mile mark, improved under a drive three wide on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, and continued willingly past tiring
horses. ROCKET HOTSHOT broke in and bumped CLEMSON TIGER in the opening strides, soon trailed, took closer order approaching the half mile mark,
made a mild bid two wide on the far turn but could not sustain that bid in the stretch. CONI'S COUP was fractious in the gate, raced at the inside of the
chasing flight through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, weakened along the rail on the far turn and had no more in the lane. DREAM KEEPER
tracked the leading pair while racing keenly through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch, was pushed along into the
far turn, offered a bid in the two path, saved ground into the lane but emptied out. OL GREY GHOST attended the pace outside of CLEMSON TIGER
approaching the clubhouse turn, tracked the pace through the first turn and while racing keenly down the backstretch, emptied out from the three eighths,
weakened between horses, came three wide into the lane and continued to fade.
