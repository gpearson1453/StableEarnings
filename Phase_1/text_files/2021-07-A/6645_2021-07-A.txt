Footnotes
DETROIT STEEL (IRE) stalked the early leaders, dueled on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. FOREHEAD FRED
was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FIRST CRUSADER was away alertly
and set the pace but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. GOLD VENTURE was well back, hustled along on the far turn and from the three
path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. DEN OF THIEVES was hustled early and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor.
ATLANTIC CROSSING tracked the early leaders but lost ground on the far turn and was outdistanced.

ARCELOR settled off the early leaders, raced evenly on the turn, angled out through the stretch and drew off. TROPICAL JOY was in touch, a factor on the
turn and had the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch but failed to hold. SNELL FLICKA showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the
turn but gave way. FINDING PERFECTION was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing
left. DANZIG RAINBOW was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response.
