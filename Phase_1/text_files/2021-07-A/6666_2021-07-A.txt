SOPHOS broke slowly, advanced inside to the stretch, angled out rallying and edged by the runner-up following a long drive. DON'T RECALL saved
ground, went after the leader on the turn, battled late but was nailed nearing the wire. SPEIGHT dueled briefly inside, moved clear on the turn to midstretch
and tired. BLAZING ISLAND chased inside off the pace and lacked a rally. ON TEMPLE HIGH pressed the pace through the opening quarter and was
finished after half a mile. IMMINENT DANGER lagged far behind then passed fading opponents. OPIANA dropped back three wide and weakened steadily.
BIZZY GILLESPIE lost position early and stopped abruptly.

MUCHO MAS GRANDE settled at the back of the pack, advanced wide on the final turn, closed strongly and was up to earn a dead heat. DUBROVSKY
saved ground, slipped through to the lead quarter pole, drifted out through the stretch and lasted to finish on even terms. TAP THE MARK broke a bit
awkwardly, stalked three wide and flattened out through the stretch. THREE PHASE dropped back early, advanced inside then lacked a solid rally. SPARTY
pressed the pace in the two path to the stretch and yielded. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY dropped back early and was never a factor. KID MAC COOL moved
clear inside early, vied through the final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SHANE'S JEWEL angled inside setting a clear pace, repelled challenges on the final turn and widened under moderate urging. BIRD KING was urged from
the gate, stalked inside and proved no match for the winner through the stretch. IRISH CORK settled close up three wide, was asked for run on the final turn
but flattened out. SENIOR INVESTMENT bid closer outside before half a mile then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
RULES bobbled while breaking alertly, controlled the pace inside and remained safe while kept to his task. CAUSE I SAID SO pursued the winner inside
and continued willingly to the finish. SAILOR AGAIN tugged his way closer on the backstretch and flattened out late. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD trailed far
behind, raced wide and showed some late energy. RACEHORSEINARED bumped at the start, prompted the pace outside and faded late. JOHNNY
WISHBONE chased wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. SECRET MAGICIAN dropped back inside and failed to menace. PRINCE ORB lagged
far behind and was never in contention. UNCLE MANNY chased just off the leaders three wide and gave way.
