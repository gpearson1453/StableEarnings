Footnotes
J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY followed the early pace outside, reeled in the leaders going to the far turn to bid four wide, edged clear nearing the lane then drew
off some under steady handling. CLINE TIME rallied three wide into the far turn to bid then could not go with the winner in the drive. ALWAYS A TIZ showed
the most early speed to gain a clear lead in the first turn but came up empty once headed in the far turn. INDY N ROSES tucked inside off the early pace,
moved up in the lane but could not threaten. MARY HELEN chased the pace along the inside and had no bid. SHE'S THE BOSS saved ground while
trailing, angled out into the lane and could not threaten. WITCHY WINDSOR was not a factor.

LIKE A CAT was taken outside early to stalk the leaders, bid four wide into the far turn, continued outside SWEET CAPRI through that bend into the lane
and kept that safe to the end. SWEET CAPRI moved three or four wide to bid into the far turn, continued inside the winner into the lane and could not
handle that one late. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL stalked the pace in good position three wide but could not produce the needed late run. PASSION RIDE
was just off the pace three wide and lacked a final closing run. BUTYOUCALLEDME showed some early speed along the inside and weakened.
TAKEAGAMBLEONME failed to threaten four wide.

FAYETTE WARRIOR reeled in the leader going to the far turn to bid and move clear then held safe in the lane under steady handling. TIGER THE MAN
settled off the pace three or four wide, rallied five wide into the lane and gained the place but could not get to the winner. SCOOTER'S BOY angled in going
to the far turn to rally through that bend but could not close the gap on the leaders late. BLABIMIR moved to the front racing about the three path, made the
pace to the far turn and weakened. ALL SHACKED UP chased the early pace out from the rail and weakened. UNBROKEN SONG broke in the air and was
always back. MR. MIKE saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MILLI STARR dueled on the early pace outside SYLVIA'S ROCKET to edge clear and shake off a bid into the far turn then drew off under steady handling.
PRUD AS PUNCH rallied four wide in the far turn and was up for the place. WRINKLED ROSE stalked the early pace inside, angled three wide into the far
turn and lacked a final run. KURIOUS KENNEDY lacked a rally three wide. SYLVIA'S ROCKET showed early speed off the rail and tired. MISS ORATORY
was always back. DECADENT DIAMOND tired racing three or four wide.
