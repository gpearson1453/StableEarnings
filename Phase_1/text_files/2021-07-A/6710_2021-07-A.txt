Footnotes
DOCTOR JEFF bumped with a rival at the start but came out in front, showed the way with strong strides, controlled the action while inside on the turn,
came under light coaxing late on that bend, spun into the stretch in the two path then easily disposed of the runner-up, responded well when shaken up at
the three-sixteenths, drew off under a very mild hand ride into the final furlong, had the rider take a peek back while widening outside the sixteenth-pole then
was completely geared down while racing with his ears pricked and won as the rider pleased. FORT TICONDEROGA was hustled from the start then
out-sprinted along the rail early, picked up stride leaving the backstretch, traveled well behind the leader while inside early on the turn, was roused while
shifting to the two path outside the five-sixteenths then driven three wide into the stretch, dropped well behind the winner as that foe accelerated away
outside the furlong marker and proved no match but finished with good courage while gaining on a heavily geared down victor. FLIP THE SCRIPT chased
the pace from third, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, lugged inward in the drive and weakened while far clear for third.
STARTING UP broke a half-step slow from the outside post then was hustled, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, dropped back into
the stretch and faltered. ANY MINUTE bumped with the winner at the start, showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path,
dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and retreated. FIVE-EIGHTHS TIME WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

most of fhe turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch between rivals, dug in under a drive taking
command nearing the eighth pole, then edged away under a drive kept to task. FINANCIALSTABILITY coaxed from the start, vied inside a trio down the

five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors. VICAR'S LEGEND chased along the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and offered up a mild
bid. HOORAY FOR HARVEY broke out a step at the start placing rivals in tight and forcing them to jostle for position at the start against pressure from

angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. CLEAR THE MINE got pinched at the start due to pressure inside and outside, chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages.

Footnotes
TRINNI LUCK disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear while put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. COFFEE BAR broke out at the start, was ridden
along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, came out four wide under a drive into upper stretch and just got up for the place. BEAUTIFUL
KAREN showed speed between horses then dropped just behind the leading duo, moved out leaving the backstretch, was asked three wide while in
dead-aim of the leaders on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, pursued the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the
place late but was clear for the show. FAIR LASSIE lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. QUEEN ARELLA broke out then
was corrected by the rider, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch under the crop and came up
empty. MY BEST FRIEND bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back
under some urging into upper stretch and tired. STIMULUS CHECK broke very awkwardly then bumped with a foe and was grabbed by the rider, settled in
the back half of the field, went three then two wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond.

seizing command, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. CHROME DIXIE three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came

Footnotes
SANTA BARBARA (IRE) was rated in hand while traveling mid-field in the two path, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to inside the
three-sixteenths, altered course out a few paths for room coming to the furlong marker, rallied between horses and closed fast to get up under good
handling. CON LIMA strolled to the front, set an easy uncontested pace on the inside through tepid fractions, responded well when asked turning into the
stretch, was put to a right-handed crop just inside the furlong marker, led determinedly until the final strides but was denied while just able to get the place.
HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, came under some urging while behind horses into upper stretch, tipped to
the two path while asked for her best into the final furlong, rallied to make a bid into the final sixteenth but missed while showing good courage for the show.
GAM'S MISSION went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under coaxing leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far
turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. PLUM ALI moved in early, was keen under restraint into the
first turn then reserved in the two path, remained in hand on the far turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, was roused five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. NAZUNA (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, traveled three wide while stalking the leader on the far
turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and was also out-kicked. CIRONA (GB) was keen under tight restraint while
inside through the first turn, remained under tight restraint towards the rear on the backstretch, saved ground in hand on the far turn then moved to the two
path late on that bend, shifted four wide into the stretch, raced behind horses past the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SPANISH
LOVEAFFAIR stalked the pace on the outside while in the two path, was asked at the top of the stretch then chased the leader, dropped back into the final
furlong and weakened.

the first turn, was reserved near the back, steadied along the rail early on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and finished willingly but lacked the needed kick. HARD LOVE easily went to the front, set the pace through slow fractions while a bit off the inside,
dropped closer to the rail on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. SAFE CONDUCT
was taken under a tight hold early then rated on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE)
bumped lightly with a rival early, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside without cover, came under urging in the four path on the far turn,
spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

dropped back under urging, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on the far turn, moved out six wide in upper stretch and
finished fast to just miss while up for the place. CASTAGNO stayed out four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in
the two path on the far turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, led into the final
sixteenth but was denied while able to get the show. BORU broke in and bumped with a foe, remained five wide though the initial turn, settled on the
outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch but was outfinished then missed the trifecta. COUNTER OFFER
settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. NOBLE THOUGHT was bumped at the start then taken up while in tight, spotted the front a few lengths, went three to four wide on the turns,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ACKER settled off the pace in the two path, was asked on the final turn, spun three wide into the
stretch under the crop and failed to rally. REJECTED AGAIN veered in at the start then was corrected by the rider, traveled around the first turn in the two
path, was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and came up empty. HONORABLE HERO was brushed in the hindquarters at the
start then hustled to the lead, set the pace through tepid fractions on the inside, was headed approaching the quarter-pole and gave way.
