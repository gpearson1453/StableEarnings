MULBERRY dueled for the early lead, took over on the turn, responded to brisk left-handed pressure in the stretch and was all out to hold the persistent
RAGATAGTAG safe. The latter chased while three wide, moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. CHAMPAGNE BLING saved ground, was
angled out five wide during the stretch run and rallied. MEAN ERIKA attended the early pace and lost her position on the turn. FIVE QUEENS was outpaced
and no factor.

DOMIKATE reserved early, commenced his bid far on the turn, rallied and was going away at the finish. IOWA NATIVE attended the pace, led around the
far turn, dug in gamely for the stretch run but could not fend off the top one. BACK THE BLUE settled well, advanced on the far turn, led into the stretch and
flattened out in the final furlong. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was outpaced while four wide and showed some mild late interest. THAT'S WHAT I SAY was
always outrun. SHWEET PERSUASION led early, was headed on the far turn and yielded.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE seized command after breaking sharply, was challenged leaving the turn and held her chief rival safe in the stretch under intermittent
urging. BLINKERS advanced to stalk the pacesetter in the opening quarter mile, dueled with that one leaving the turn and stayed on gamely in the stretch.
QUICK DECISION bobbled at the start, was settled behind the pacesetter and lacked a rally. SAGUARO ROW was angled out early, got outpaced and
offered no response when asked.
