Footnotes
MAJESTIC DAY settled inside of ROAR OF THE LION in the rear flight well behind the leading trio, improved in the two path from the three eighths before
being asked, swung four wide into the lane while in range, was shaken up approaching the three sixteenths, took the lead past the furlong pole while still
under a hand ride, and ran clear while ridden out. CHAPEL BARN led into the clubhouse turn, was engaged by RIVER FINN near the seven eighths, briefly
dueled inside that foe, pressed inside as RIVER FINN forged to a narrow lead into the backstretch, dueled again inside that foe from the nine sixteenths,
edged clear from the seven sixteenths, shook off JETTIN OUT and RIVER FINN for good from the quarter, was driven inside in upper stretch, kept on
doggedly, could not hold off MAJESTIC DAY past the furlong mark but proved clearly second best. JETTIN OUT was off a bit slowly, steadied while in tight
between MAJESTIC DAY and the rail into the first turn, was urged to track the leading pair, chased them through the clubhouse turn and down the
backstretch, bid three wide approaching the five sixteenths, loomed at the quarter, proved no match from the three sixteenths and weakened. ROAR OF
THE LION settled outside of MAJESTIC DAY in the rear flight well behind the leading trio, trailed in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven in the
four path into the lane, and lacked the needed rally under a five-wide drive in the lane. RIVER FINN prompted the pace outside of CHAPEL BARN early,
engaged to duel briefly outside that foe from the seven eighths into the backstretch, led narrowly while pressed by CHAPEL BARN into the backstretch,
dueled again outside of CHAPEL BARN from the nine sixteenths to the seven sixteenths, proved no match for CHAPEL BARN from there, tracked her while
two wide around the rest of the far turn, had no further response when driven in upper stretch and weakened inside.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, began to edge ahead while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. TRIPLE SCOUT bumped with the horse to horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside early, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and improved position between horses in the final
furlong. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the two path around the turn, and gained
ground on the outside in late stretch. STOPSHOPPINGAMY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn, changed lanes in upper stretch to find racing room and finished evenly while drifting out slightly late. PASSION'S IMAGE tracked
the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and weakened outside in the final furlong. WILLOW MOON
bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground
around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and tired on the rail from there.

SHE'S HOT TODAY settled near the rear inside of BALLYBRACK LASS through the clubhouse turn, inched forward into the backstretch to track the leading
pair inside of GOLDEN LILY, tracked the leader while saving ground inside of CATNIP KITTEN through the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, continued
to rally under a drive three to four wide down the lane, and took the lead in the final stride. SEVEN SEVENTEEN was sent for speed, dropped to the inside
into the clubhouse turn, was passed by CATNIP KITTEN near the seven eighths, attended inside that foe until keenly retaking the lead near the three
quarters, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, remained clear past midstretch, kept on under a drive inside but
was nailed in the final jump. GOLDEN LILY tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, chased four wide down the backstretch, was urged in the
three path through the far turn, floated four wide into the lane, and rallied mildly to prove best of the rest. BALLYBRACK LASS settled two wide near the rear
through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear well off the inside, angled closer to the inside approaching the far turn, chased in the two path around
the far turn, was driven two wide into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. WILDWOOD MAGGIE
settled at the rear, continued to trail in the four path on the far turn, swung into the lane five wide under a drive, and offered no rally. CATNIP KITTEN
pressed outside of SEVEN SEVENTEEN from the fifteen sixteenths, took a narrow lead past the seven eighths, was headed for good at the three quarters
and tracked the pacesetter two wide from there until flattening out three wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
RICHIESGOTGAME saved ground around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid approaching
the three eighths pole, took control quickly from the three path entering the stretch and drew off to the wire, much the best. GHOSTLIGHTER trailed the field
from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and
chased the winner home while drifting out in late stretch, the best of the rest. COMMANDEER raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path at the five sixteenths pole, and was outkicked in the stretch while
finishing evenly. MARESONOFAGUN raced in the two path in the middle of the pack around the first turn, dropped back while racing on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. VALIANT VINNY hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to lead
the field on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground while dueling around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
WESTWARD LOOK raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the
three path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
GET NONE chased outside of LIPLINER behind the leading line down the backstretch and through the turn, swung out and was driven four wide in upper
stretch, rallied, and took the lead near fifty yards out. MIZ BLUE was put on the lead, set a pressured pace early, disputed the pace inside of MY SWEET
KAT through the turn, shook off to a defined lead in upper stretch, dug in under a drive inside but was caught near fifty yards out. BELLE BREZING soon
trailed, saved ground through the turn, waited in upper stretch behind traffic, steered five wide for room midstretch, found her best in the final sixteenth and
got up for the show in time. CHROME ATTACK settled at the rear of the main group, chased in the two path on the turn, was urged for mild improvement up
the rail in upper stretch, kept on evenly late inside and narrowly missed the show. LIPLINER tracked the leading line inside of GET NONE, was driven for a
bid between horses in upper stretch, loomed outside of MIZ BLUE midstretch, but flattened out between horses late and lost the show. MY SWEET KAT
pressed the pace outside of MIZ BLUE early, dueled with that foe while racing between horses on the turn, proved no match for MIZ BLUE approaching the
three sixteenths, chased on under a drive to the furlong mark, but emptied out in the final furlong. SAVVY ALLY came away last but ranged up to hound the
pace three wide into the turn, continued to attend three wide to the quarter pole and weakened.

MARK OF THE Z chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge nearing the quarter
pole, wore down his rival down the lane and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. CHINOBE led the field on the inside up the backstretch and around
the turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way while drifting out late. ALPHALFA tracked the frontrunner on the inside in the early going, saved ground
around the turn, and gained ground on the outside in the stretch while finishing evenly. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) broke poorly, hitting the gate on the way
out, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, trailed the field while saving ground around the turn and rallied
between horses in late stretch. STAR OF KODIAK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and
faded on the rail in the final furlong. ROYAL COMMISH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the
three and four path, gained ground mildly in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. OMAR ATTACK raced off the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three path and made no bid. STURGILL raced outside early, moved up to press the pace headed into the
far turn, came around the turn in the two and three path and tired between horses in the stretch.

HALO HUNTER disputed the pace three wide in the opening quarter, edged clear from the half, set the pace in the two path on the turn, opened up further
in upper stretch when shaken up and shown the crop, continued to draw off under a hand ride, and was wrapped up inside the sixteenth after his rider
looked back to see he was well clear. YOU'RE KILLIN ME tracked the leading line down the backstretch, continued at the rear as the field strung out into the
turn, began to improve in the four path past the three eighths, swung into the lane in the seven path, rallied and cut into HALO HUNTER's advantage late
after that one was wrapped up. RIO SECO was hustled to show pace inside early, disputed the pace to the nine sixteenths, tracked the leading pair from
there, chased the the three path on the turn, swung out and chased in the five path in upper stretch, kept on under a drive and was outfinished for place
between horses. CROCE D'ORO showed speed between horses and disputed the pace to the half mile, tracked HALO HUNTER from there while saving
ground through the turn, was pushed to keep him in range near the three eighths, was driven in the four path in upper stretch but proved no match for HALO
HUNTER, and weakened.

began a bold move between horses approaching the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. PERFECT DIVA saved
ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the next quarter of a mile, launched a bid while saving ground around the
far turn, battled for the lead on the inside down the stretch and gave way late. READY AT MIDNIGHT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued
up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and gained ground on the outside from there while never
threatening the top two. MY TOMMY LEE hopped up and was pinched back leaving the gate, angled over sharply to save ground around the first turn,
trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced five wide around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, improved position quickly in upper
stretch and was outkicked from there. IMAGINE GOLD raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on
the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, raced into traffic coming off the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and flattened out in the final
furlong. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS saved ground around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field on the inside while racing up the backstretch and around
the far turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MISSEN THE POINT raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle
of the pack on the inside, continued around the far turn still in the two path and weakened between horses midstretch. MAMA LOU saved ground around the
first turn, settled in between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded entering the stretch. VALERIE
VALESKI shot to a clear early lead while saving ground around the first turn, extended her margin while racing up the backstretch, began to drop back
around the far turn and continued to tire from there.
