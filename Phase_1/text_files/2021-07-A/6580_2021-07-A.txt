Footnotes
CREST DRIVE broke sharply to stalk the pace of PURE PURSUIT while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied and proved best through a prolonged drive. PURE PURSUIT sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by the winner and IRON ROB nearing
the five-sixteenths marker, vied with that tandem and just missed in a game effort. CATS SURFIN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. IRON ROB was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied
and gave way late. CODE CHARLIE was off slow and bobbled, raced just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the three-eighths marker and did
not threaten in the drive. MR BINGLEY lagged throughout.

second turn and finished with some late run. TURNAROUND lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. GENTLE

Footnotes
MR. ATLANTICO was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held off the
closing PROUD LION to prevail. PROUD LION pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and was gaining on that
foe late. COASTAL BUZZ chased the leaders while racing four-wide and finished willingly. FIELD OF HOPE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the
turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. STANDING ROCK settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. IOWA KID
raced off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BEX lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid. RAZACAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
