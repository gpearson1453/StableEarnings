Footnotes
HONOR THY SECRET Unhurried along the rail into the turn, eased out some, gained between and bested EVRYBODYLUVSNORMAN for the win while
drifting out late. EVRYBODYLUVSNORMAN Tracked along the two path into the turn, challenged, took charge and then could not handle the winner.
STORMY NEW YORK Broke in the air, rushed out to be a factor, dropped back some into the lane, responded inside and earned a share. NEVER
EVOLVED Broke slow, lagged back along the three path into the turn, angled out and made a late bid. CASPER JOE Unhurried along the three path, four
wide into the lane and made a mild bid. STARSHIP OREO Ducked out at the start, four wide into the turn, was not a threat. GIERHART Well placed along
the three path, took the rail midway on the turn and tired. CHAPPY'S BREEZE Broke awkwardly, two path on the turn and tired. ADIRONDACK TALES Set
the pace along the rail and gave way.
