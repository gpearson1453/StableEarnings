Footnotes
PARK RIDGE BENNY last to leave, off the pace along the inside, moved closer in the two path late in the turn when negotiating around a tiring rival,
challenged closest to the inside upper stretch, drew out strongly under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. COLONEL PIKE with the pace while between
horses, narrowly held the advantage into the stretch just off the inside, allowed the winner the inside soon after, briefly dueled with that one then proved no
match late, comfortably held the place. LITTLE TOE back off the early pace outside, advanced four wide midway on the turn, challenged on the outside of
the first flight late in the turn, could not keep up with the top two the final furlong, saved the show. STORMATION in the second group while racing three
wide, lacked a closing response in the drive. GREELEY'S BANKER set or forced the pace along the inside for three furlongs, was giving way on the rail
when steadied with a quarter mile remaining, continued to back up through the stretch. BAYOU BODE narrowly showed the way into the turn when three
wide, also gave way when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
SECRET BLARNEY in the second flight toward rail, angled out to be three wide turning for home, roused soon after, closed with good resolve to be up at
the wire. CIVIL SERVANT in the second group outside the winner, advanced in the three path turning for home, well clear past the furlong marker, could not
contain the winner at the wire, well clear of the rest. MAJESTIC SOCIETY lacked early foot, set down into the lane, staged a mild rally from between horses
to be clear for the show, no match for the top pair. LOVE THAT WARRIOR devoid of speed, steered out to be four wide exiting the final turn, improved a bit
upper stretch then flattened out to finish up evenly while remaining widest. AND YET ANOTHER closest to the early leader, dueled in the two path the
middle half mile, weakened in the drive. OOPS WEDIDITAGAIN last to leave, remained always back while in some traffic turning for home in the three path.
SHAR'S TREASURE clear when showing the way through the first turn, dueled the next half mile closest to the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SEMI CHARMED LIFE forwardly placed while racing off the inside, crept closer three wide in the turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, kicked well
clear under steady handling. SPECIAL STORM settled off the pace and the inside, three wide turning for home, proved no match for the winner, rallied clear
for the second spot. PERMANENTDETENTION broke in good order, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way through the turn, offered brief
resistance to the winner when entering the stretch then could not keep up, continued to gradually weaken to lose the place. UNBRIDLED PULPIT brushed
at the break, lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. LIGHTNING HARBOUR chased in the
early going, began a steady retreat in the turn. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT hopped at the start, raced back, four wide into the lane, failed to menace.
WHEELS TURNING last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
FORESTDUNGONE broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the lane, roused, held sway in the late
going under a firm right handed crop. LOUISIANA MOON unhurried early after being last away, three wide first turn, closer far turn, emerged from between
rivals into the stretch, dropped inside past the furlong marker, could do little with the winner to the wire. CHAOSMOS lacked speed toward the rail early,
moved out early backstretch, roused when moving a bit closer four wide late in the final turn, lacked a serious closing punch to finish up best of the rest.
CHOP CHOP CHARLIE reluctant to load, second flight off the in side, remained within striking distance middle half, closest to the winner late in the second
turn, came up empty for the drive. HERO OF THE HOUR also in the second group, saved ground through the second turn, had little left for the stretch run.
MR. GRACEFUL void of speed in trailing much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. MISTAKE PRESENT remained
back in failing to threaten. EBRIO dueled up front off the inside, stopped in the second turn, finished far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
KENSLEY'S HIPPIE close up from the start off the inside, took over from the outside to narrowly show the way into the lane, drove well clear under a brisk
left handed crop. FAZIO pressed the issue early from along the inside, fell back before a quarter, moved out, came three wide into the lane, rallied to be up
for the place. ICE PEAK back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, mild late interest while outkicked for the place. CAJUN BERTI forwardly
placed early while off the inside, roused for the drive three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE narrowly set the pace along the
inside for three furlongs and began to falter when headed by the winner turning into the stretch. GOLDEN HEAT lacked speed in trailing, five wide out of the
turn, failed to muster a rally. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES forwardly placed out of the chute up the backstretch, continued to prompt the pace into the turn, ranged up to challenge four
wide early in the bend, held a narrow advantage in the three path exiting, clear when straightened for home, continued to hold a daylight advantage late,
enough left to last. SWANEE BEACH settled in mid pack, came four wide out of the turn when still well back off the inside, roused, accelerated in the run to
the wire finished up willingly to narrowly missed. ROSE CROWN moved up to vie soon after the start, dueled with the winner in the two path exiting the turn,
could not keep up with that one or prove to be a match for the runner up, narrowly saved the show. SILENT TRICK void of speed for well over a half, moved
out a bit for the drive, finished willingly down the middle of the strip while too late. MISS GURETTA last away, trailed out of the chute, continued to lack any
speed into the lane, improved position with some modest late interest. MATT'S PRIDE in the second flight early, advanced with the winner inside that one
challenge three wide and between rivals in the turn, weakened in the drive. KEHRON'S CREED settled off the early pace, lacked a closing response when
called on for the drive. LUCKY LINZ dueled in the early going in the two path, stopped.

Footnotes
YES BAB void of early foot, bit closer early turn, made a winning move through traffic into the stretch, kicked well clear. CUSTOM KAT broke back, also
lacked speed, followed the winner through along the two path into the lane, proved no match for that one the final furlong, clearly second best. PALACE
WIND within striking distance well off the inside, floated out four wide turning for home, finished up best of the rest. WESTERN STAR void of early foot,
continued back into the lane, passed tiring rivals while not a threat to the top three. NINE SHOTS away well, chased the leader from toward the inside,
weakened in the drive. FLASHBURN in mid pack early while outside, fanned five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. MUSADA sprinted clear through a
lively opening quarter, stayed clear until turning for home, caved when headed by the winner. SIR ETNEY JOHN finished early, trailed home.
