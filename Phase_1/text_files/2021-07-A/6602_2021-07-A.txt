Footnotes
LASTING LIGHT broke well from the gate then moved forward to dictate the pace on the backstretch, extended the lead under mild hand urging past the
quarter pole and was much the best. SECOND GRACE tracked the early pace on the inside, saved ground through the bend and passed tiring foes to gain
place in the final sixteenth. MIZONEY chased the pace on the outside down the backstretch then failed to match strides past the quarter pole and weakened
in the lane. ARNOLD'S PATSY tracked the early pace three wide, continued three wide through the bend and failed to respond in the stretch.

Footnotes
TWO DRINK MINIMUM, bumped at the start, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin inside foes racing into the bend, turned back a rival's
challenge racing into upper stretch, then met the late challenge of INNOVATE to prevail under firm handling. The latter tracked the leaders from just out of
striking distance four wide in early stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, tipped out in upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter in the three path and
continued willingly to the end to close the gap nearing the wire. INCLUDEANATTITUDE broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was settled near the
inside racing to the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and was making a steady gain inside the top pair late. PLATINUM HALLWAY, forwardly placed
three deep attending the pace in the opening quarter, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch and gave way leaving midstretch. LAURA N
LUKAS, in touch with the pacesetter between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. BRIAR THICKET settled five wide in
early stages and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BOBBY BABY broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage remaining a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled for command outside a
rival nearing upper stretch while being headed racing into the lane, turned back that foe, then gamely held NOBLE PURSUIT to the wire under strong
handling. The latter broke slowly, tracked off the second flight while shifting outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the far turn,
steadily gained position along the rail racing into upper stretch, altered course abruptly three deep midstretch momentarily crossing into the path of RIVER
ECHO (GB) but continued with a steady late response to just miss. CHEST CANDY angled to the rail racing into the first turn, stalking just inside the
pacesetter to the backstretch, came through inside that foe racing into the far turn to challenge for command, struck the front between calls racing into upper
stretch and lacked the needed final kick. RIVER ECHO (GB) switched out three deep racing to the backstretch prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, lost
some ground to the leaders entering the lane, was momentarily cut off midstretch by NOBLE PURSUIT, then gave way in late stages. TASHKENT was
rated off the second flight while angling inside in early stages, dropped out last while switching outside foes to race four wide into the lane but had no rally.

TOP STAR, shuffled a bit when caught in tight quarters at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, then made a steady
gain inside foes to wrest the advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. NEVERBLINK settled outside foes in the opening stages, tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch and made steady late progress while outkicked by the winner. FLORIDA
TWO STEP, carried out by ONE TOUGH CHARLIE in the opening stages, was righted to track that rival outside a rival racing to the turn, advanced three
wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE sped clear in the opening stages while getting out despite his rider's
correction in the opening quarter, angled to the rail racing into the turn setting the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch, then drifted off the inside and
gave out late. J J'S CROWN, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the leader on the turn to track that rival between foes and gave way
midstretch. DYRDEK dropped out early.

Footnotes
IMMINENT THREAT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gained on the leaders three wide between foes racing into upper
stretch and edged forward in time under firm handling. HURRICAIN HUNTER was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped
out entering upper stretch awaiting an opening, then altered course to the rail to challenge for command late while just outkicked by the winner. DREAMING
BIZ settled well off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out making steady progress into the lane and split foes four wide in the final
stages to prevail for a share while closing the gap on the top pair. FLASH FLOOD, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace after the opening quarter,
pressed the issue into upper stretch and weakened between rivals nearing the wire. VIKKIS ROCKSTAR, urged to the lead along the inside to the first turn,
set the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch and yielded between foes late. ALL NATIVE
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, gained striking distance four wide nearing upper stretch but drifted out through the final
furlong while steadily losing momentum. TANTIMA tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch but offered no closing bid. SHAY'S
GLORY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. STEAL THE THUNDER hopped at the start while
breaking slowly and failed to menace thereafter. GOING RUNNING TOO proved no factor.

Footnotes
SHARP ART, three deep between foes in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders between those rivals racing to the turn, shifted out nearing upper
stretch, altered course slightly outside the pacesetter racing past midstretch but produced a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm left
handed pressure. MOST AMUSING broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival racing in the three path to the turn, edged forward racing into upper
stretch, drifted out under left handed pressure nearing midstretch grudgingly resisted the winner's challenge but just failed to contain that foe. COLORFUL
COLORADO was rated off the first flight while angling nearer the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane and continued with
interest to prevail for a share between foes late. WATER PATROL settled outside foes while carried out slightly by MADELYN'S WILD MAX in early stages,
angled to the five path racing through upper stretch and continued evenly. SHANGHAI MIKE, urged inside a rival prompting the pace from the outset into
the turn, proved no match after a half and gave way midstretch. MADELYN'S WILD MAX, going erratically in early stages while coming under correction
from his rider, soon dropped out and was gathered up in late stages.

Footnotes
MIZZANNA was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide after a half advancing readily to challenge, took
charge entering the far turn and held sway on a comfortable margin to the end under firm encouragement. LITTLE MISS BELLE, reserved along the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched off the inside after a half, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner into the lane but proved only second best.
TRENDY NEVE, reserved outside foes in early stages, angled out three wide nearing the lane and continued well enough to earn a share. LOYAL AND
TRUE, reserved last to the far turn, angled out four wide entering the lane and made some belated progress. WAR FALCON angled to the rail racing to the
first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to make a brief bid for the lead between midway through the backstretch but soon emptied out.
PAYTIENCE PAYS tracked the leader outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. GRAND SLAM HOMERUN, urged to
the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, was spent after a half, lost contact with the field racing into the stretch but walked off the course under
her own power.

Footnotes
THAT'S ALL RIGHT broke readily, was urged dictating the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear on the backstretch, widened the
advantage on the far turn, then held sway through the stretch while fully extended to the wire. FIREMAN'S LIL SIS, off last, was reserved along the inside to
the first turn, swung outside foes to race four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. TIMBER LADY raced three
wide between foes to the first turn, angled inwards tracking off the second flight to the far turn, shifted out to the five path midstretch and found her best
stride late while gaining a share. SHE APPEALS HOLY, caught four wide racing through the first turn, made brief progress outside a rival racing into the far
turn but came up empty nearing midstretch. ADRIANNA JOY tracked off the first flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside a rival while being
prompted in pursuit of the winner to upper stretch but came up empty late. HOLY STAR, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch,
gave way after a half. CLASSIC WHISKEY dropped out early.

Footnotes
BIARRITZ ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to track off the first flight racing to the turn, advanced three deep to challenge for command in upper
stretch, then wrested the advantage and went well clear under firm encouragement. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY, under pressure in early stages to gain
contention outside rivals racing to the turn, angled to the rail entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail for the place honors
nearing the wire. KHAKI JACK, urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out entering the lane, couldn't match the
winner leaving the furlong marker, contested second in late stages but faded nearing the wire. XTREME MAYHEM settled last off the inside racing to the
turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest outside foes to improve position. JIMMIE T tracked the leaders along the inside racing to
the turn but never gained contention. TEQUILA TIME was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset to upper stretch and gave way between foes
leaving the furlong marker.
