Footnotes
WAY TOO SMARTE rated off the pace in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths
pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and wore down her rival in the final strides. SATIATE pressed the pace on the outside through the
opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the turn, took over the lead entering the stretch and dueled to the wire, getting caught late. CATNIP
KITTEN bobbled leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack up the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and
gained ground on the outside from there. LITTLE CHICK dropped back to trail the field early, navigated the turn from the three and four path and gained
some ground between horses in late stretch. TINDERELLA tracked the leaders on the rail up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began
a mild bid nearing the quarter pole, couldn't go with the frontrunners entering the stretch and faded in the stretch. VEGAN GOES BEST broke quickly, led
the field up the backstretch and around the turn, saved ground throughout, gave way entering the stretch and continued to tire down the lane.

Footnotes
AGGRESSIVITY settled near the rear outside MERLIN'S SONG down the backstretch, came into the turn toward the rear between horses, advanced
steadily two wide between horses on the turn, raced just behind the leading flight near the five sixteenths, was driven between horses in upper stretch,
headed KOSHER COWBOY past the three sixteenths, cleared past midstretch and held. MERLIN'S SONG settled near the rear early, came into the turn
inside toward the rear, saved ground through the bend, began to rally approaching the quarter pole, was urged inside into upper stretch, split horses past
the furlong mark, dropped inside at the sixteenth, and missed. TRAPPE VALLEY tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the four path on the
turn, bid three wide past the three eighths, raced three wide in range in upper stretch, but ran only evenly in the final furlong. LOST IN MANHATTAN chased
down the backstretch, entered the turn three wide toward the rear, continued patiently in the three path on the turn, swung out to the five path in upper
stretch and was driven, and offered belated outside gain. BABA LOU was off a beat slow, settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, swung out to
the seven path in upper stretch, went to a drive, and passed tiring horses. KOSHER COWBOY was sent for speed, set the pace down the backstretch and
in the two path on the turn, was confronted by AGGRESSIVITY in upper stretch and headed by that foe past the three sixteenths, and weakened inside past
the eighth. RED HOT DEVIL tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, bid outside of KOSHER COWBOY past the
three eighths, but came up empty between horses approaching the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CAVE CREEK stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, opened up while saving ground
up the backstretch and around the turn, and continued to draw off down the lane. MI ENLACE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled
at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased
the winner home from there. LASKA trailed the field in the early going, raced outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, made a mild
gain of ground down the lane and was outkicked in the final sixteenth of a mile. LA GUERRERITA hit the gate leaving it, tracked the leaders on the inside
through the opening half mile, began a mild bid while saving ground nearing the three eighths pole, and flattened out in the final furlong. FULL OF HEART
raced off the pace in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. IRINA'S HERO
bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, veered in sharply a furlong into the race, raced inside off the pace from there, dropped back back to
trail the field while saving ground around the turn, and was not a factor. SUPREME IRENE dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of
a mile, began to drop back headed into the turn, continued to fade while saving ground around the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

DRAFT CAPITAL tracked the leading flight inside of GAGOOTS through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, tracked in the two path behind the
leading line on the far turn, was taken four wide into the lane, was bumped in upper stretch when GAGOOTS came out, nevertheless rallied, took the lead
outside of RELMBUNKUS SYR with a sixteenth remaining and held firm to the wire. RELMBUNKUS SYR settled near the rear inside, was pushed along in
the three path on the far turn, rallied into the lane, split horses past the three sixteenths, took the lead inside of GAGOOTS with a furlong to go, was headed
at the sixteenth pole but continued gamely to the finish. GAGOOTS tracked the leading pair two wide, was pushed along for a three wide bid into the far
turn, took a narrow lead at the five sixteenths, came out and bumped DRAFT CAPITAL in upper stretch, held a narrow lead until being headed with a furlong
to go, and flattened out. ZARMAE settled near the rear two wide, chased in the four path on the far turn, continued to give chase when driven five wide into
the lane, but proved no match for the leading trio in the final furlong. Z U AT THE RACES stumbled in the opening strides, recovered his footing and set the
early pace while prompted by CHRISTMAS PRESENT to his outside, attended inside of that foe when he led past the three quarters, dueled inside around
the far turn, was driven at the inside of the leading flight in upper stretch, but flattened out from the three sixteenths. EGOMANIAC settled at the rear, saved
ground through the far turn and while driven into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. CHRISTMAS PRESENT prompted the pace early outside of Z U AT
THE RACES, was keen to lead past the three quarters, set the pace down the backstretch as Z U AT THE RACES continued to attend inside him, dueled
two wide on the far turn, and emptied out between horses into the lane.

nearing the three sixteenths pole, gained ground quickly between horses while drifting in late, and got up in time. IOYA AGAIN veered in and bumped with
the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn
in the three path, and gained ground on the outside late, just missing. LAND MARK DEAL saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and gained ground on the rail down the lane, getting outkicked late. IWILLPERSEVERE was shoved
back and blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, raced in the three
and four path around the far turn, swung wider entering the stretch and finished evenly. TUFF ATTACK saved ground around the first turn, chased the
leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, raced in tight quarters entering the stretch, took the lead briefly in
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. COMING UP ACES bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the
first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, began to move up from the two path around the far turn and flattened out in late stretch.
INDIAN SIGN led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn,
began to give way coming off the turn, was forced to steady when TUFF ATTACK came into his lane entering the stretch and faded from there.

Footnotes
DADDY'S BOO cleared to the lead into the clubhouse turn, was encroached upon by JOLINA to her outside near the nine sixteenths but quickly repulsed
that bid, cleared further under a hand ride in upper stretch and held safe while wrapped up late. CAROLINE'S STORY tracked the leading pair inside of
RAPID TRANSIT early, continued patiently inside down the backstretch and was relegated to the rear of the main group as others improved position, raced
in the two path on the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, was swung out five wide into upper stretch, rallied under a continued drive, and
finished with good interest. MARY OF BETHANY settled near the rear, advanced inside down the backstretch to chase midfield, continued to chase while
saving ground on the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and proved best of the rest. APRIL'S GEM was hard to settle early, raced at the rear
through the clubhouse turn, continued to trail down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, was driven six wide into the lane and passed tiring
horses. JOLINA broke sharply but was outsprinted to the lead by DADDY'S BOO, tracked the pace through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch,
came out and bumped RAPID TRANSIT while bidding outside of DADDY'S BOO past the five eighths, loomed near the nine sixteenths but was soon
rebuffed, chased the leader in the three path on the far turn and weakened between horses in the lane. RAPID TRANSIT grazed the gate, tracked the
leading pair two wide through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, briefly advanced outside of JOLINA past the five eighths, was bumped when that
foe came out, soon flattened back to midfield, chased in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane, drifted out and proved
empty.

POWERFUL MAN raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing
the three eighths pole, quickly took command, and drew off from there while kept to the task to the wire. ROCKET RIDE raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained some ground on the
outside in the stretch, while proving to be no match for the winner. LORD BOLSTON raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch
off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position mildly between horses down the lane. CACHACO pressed the
pace from the two path around the first turn, dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle on the outside around the far turn and into the
stretch and weakened with three sixteenths of a mile to go. FIFTY ONE NINETY saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch and around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and continued to fade from there. LOOK AWAY raced in the three path around the first
turn, dueled for the lead on the outside through the next quarter of a mile, dropped back behind the leaders entering the turn, tired further while saving
ground around the turn and was not a factor from there. MAGA COUNTRY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path and was never involved.

Footnotes
U. S. CURRENCY chased the leading pair early, tracked the leader in the two path on the turn, raced three wide in range into the lane, reeled in the
pacesetter under a drive, led with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and drove clear. NICE AND TRUE came out and bumped ME TOO MO in the opening
strides, was sent for pace inside, led in the two path on the turn, was driven to hold his lead in upper stretch, was caught at the sixteenth pole but kept on
under a drive to save the place. RANK AND FILE came inward in the opening strides and bumped ME TOO MO, raced between horses in the rear flight
down the backstretch, chased in the three path between horses on the turn, improved between horses into the lane, was taken four wide past the three
sixteenths, and kept on for the show. ME TOO MO was reluctant to load, got bumped between NICE AND TRUE and RANK AND FILE in the opening
strides, raced at the inside of the rear flight early, hugged the rail while chasing around the turn, was driven for an inside rally into the lane, but was
outfinished in the final furlong. HONEY MUG raced three wide between horses in the rear flight down the backstretch, was taken to the rear into the turn,
raced in the three to four path around the bend, passed inside of the chasing flight when entering the lane, swung out five wide in upper stretch, and kept on
without finding quite enough kick to reel in the leader. WINNING QUALITY raced four wide in the rear flight early, chased three deep in the four to five path
on the turn, swung out seven wide for the drive, and chased on evenly. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM chased the leading pair outside of U. S. CURRENCY down
the backstretch, raced in the five path in the tracking flight around the turn, was driven six wide into the lane and flattened. I JUANA HERO was hustled for
early pace but outsprinted by NICE AND TRUE, tracked the pace down the backstretch, continued to track the leader in the four path between horses on the
turn, weakened between horses past the five sixteenths and was allowed to fade in the lane.
