RING LEADER broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace, repelled a challenge from ARIZONA SUN entering the turn, then met the bid of FULL
OF GRACE racing through the stretch to prevail under firm handling. The latter was urged tracking just off the pacesetter outside ARIZONA SUN while
exchanging some light contact with that foe in the opening quarter, was prompted to terms with the leader nearing upper stretch, pressed the issue to
midstretch but proved no match late. NAT GIO settled inside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued with some interest
to improve position. ARIZONA SUN, caught in close quarters nearest the rail in the opening quarter, shifted out making some contact with FULL OF GRACE
after the opening quarter, was prompted between foes into the turn, then came under rating midway through the bend tracking just off the leaders to the lane
and faded in late stages. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was fanned five wide into the lane but had no
rally.

Footnotes
LA ROSA DRIVE was urged to dispute the lead while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled for command through the turn to upper
stretch, was brushed racing through midstretch but edged clear late under firm handling. BLAZING CHARM tracked off the first flight between foes, then
inside a rival on the turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. TWILIGHT GALAXY, urged forcing the
pace outside a rival from the outset to the lane, shifted inwards brushing the eventual winner racing past midstretch but couldn't match that foe and gave out
late. LASTING INFLUENCE tracked off the first flight in the three path racing to the turn and continued evenly between foes to late stages. FAIRLY
HONEST, balked, then refused to accompany the pony in the post parade, was off slowly, came under pressure to make a brief gain four wide racing into
the turn and flattened out in upper stretch. MEMORABLE ANGEL raced inside foes and dropped out early.

AUBEY RIDGE, off a step slowly, was prompted to terms with a rival in the second flight racing to the first turn, angled inwards to track off the first flight
between foes racing to the second bend, continued in hand awaiting an opening racing into upper stretch, then split foes three wide in the closing stages to
narrowly prevail in time under steady handling. OVERLY LUCKY, reserved off the second flight between foes racing to the first turn, switched out three wide
nearing the backstretch taking up a position outside rivals in second flight, was urged to advance in that path racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by
the winner while finishing on even terms with a rival for the place honors. CERNAN, urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue between foes into upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner while finishing on even terms with a rival for second. DRAMA CHORUS
sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival along the rail through the backstretch to the lane and weakened
late. NORTHCUT tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled to the five path entering the lane and finished evenly late.
NORTHERN PLAYBOY tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. POINT OF IMPACT, off slowly, was
settled near the inside racing to the backstretch but offered no rally.

SHE'S FIRE AND ICE, in touch with the leaders three wide between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command through the
turn, shifted out four wide midstretch disputing the issue inside a rival and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement in a prolonged drive. BENTLEY'S
DREAM attended the pace four wide racing to the turn, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner past midstretch while being fanned five wide late but
was just outkicked. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR, bumped at the start, settled last tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening quarter,

Footnotes
SONNY SMACK, reserved along the inside dropping into last racing to the first turn, continued unhurried into the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering
the far turn while being prompted to advance, steadily gained position in that path racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the
advantage in the final sixteenth under firm handling. BRING ME A CHECK was urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the
backstretch, edged forward to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. GIANT PAYDAY
tracked the pace outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, then
continued in that path through late stages but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. HOT SHOT KID was rated between foes in the
second flight racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance nearing the lane, then shifted out four wide late while continuing with interest to gain some
position. DYNAMIC RULER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages. SEBASTIAN'S BOY was
urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way into the far turn.

MAY WE ALL was rated along the inside dropping into last in the opening quarter, switched out entering the turn while being prompted to advance, split foes
three wide in upper stretch, then edged forward through the last furlong to prevail between foes under firm encouragement. WESTONS WILDCAT, in touch
with the leaders three wide stalking the pace racing to the turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch but continued with a steady late effort to edge a rival
for the place honors at the wire. GONE A LIL LU HU tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and
continued with interest inside foes to the end while being just outkicked for second. CANDY PRINCE was urged disputing the pace inside foes through the
backstretch into the lane but weakened leaving midstretch. DARE FELIX broke sharply, prompted the pace between foes through the backstretch into upper
stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
LADY HIDEAWAY was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum shifting off the inside leaving the
far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure racing through the stretch but edged forward late under firm encouragement.
PRANKED tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, tipped outside the pacesetter to bid for command between foes racing into upper
stretch but couldn't match the winner's kick. FALL MOON, caught in close quarters at the break, was held up last racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while angling to the inside on the far turn and continued with a steady effort along the rail in the closing stages to prevail for a share. MEDALLA
MATCH switched outside the pacesetter stalking just off that rival between foes racing to the far turn, then faded three wide between foes into the lane.
DEFEND THE ROSE sped to the lead along the inside pulling against light rating, dictated the pace through the far turn to upper stretch but gave out
leaving the furlong marker. BEAUTY DAY, pulling against restraint along the inside while going a bit erratically into the first turn, never gained contention.
MY HEART SINGS tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch but offered no rally. IN THE RED urged to contend four wide, then three
wide tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, emptied out racing into the far turn. HOTASAPISTOL tracked the leaders outside a rival in second
flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
LET'S SKEDADDLE, three deep between foes racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals midway through that bend, then pulled her way to terms with
the pacesetter three wide entering the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the far turn to press the issue outside a rival, kicked clear in upper stretch,
drifted out under left handed pressure in the closing stages crossing the path of MOLLY'S ANGEL but maintained a safe margin under pressure. IMMINENT
THREAT settled well off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide racing
into upper stretch while being roused to advance, was carried out avoiding some traffic in the final stages but continued with solid momentum to prevail for
the place honors. MOLLY'S ANGEL, four deep, then three deep racing to the first turn, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to track just off the
pacesetter just outside a rival, was prompted between foes to contest the issue midway through the backstretch, conceded some position to track just off the
leaders into the lane, weakened leaving midstretch, then was forced out by the winner late while crossing into the path of STYLIN N PROFILIN nearing the
wire. MINNESOTA NICE, pulled her way to contention between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside on the backstretch to track just off the
pacesetter under rating, shifted out in upper stretch while being urged to advance but had no final kick. ROZEY CHEEKS, urged to the lead along the inside
racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner through the far turn to the lane and gave way late. MISS BROOKSIDE settled last
racing to the far turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. STYLIN N PROFILIN was rated off the second flight along the
inside early, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters in the final sixteenthe.
THAT WOULD BE NICE tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. AKSARBEN SUMMER
settled into stride while shifting just off the inside racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF STYLIN N
PROFILIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MOLLY'S ANGEL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM
WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BOBBY BOOTS angled to the inside in early stages stalking just off the first flight under light rating, awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, angled to the
rail entering the lane, drove through close quarters to challenge for command inside foes in the final stages and narrowly prevailed in time under firm left
handed pressure. DEVOTED TO YOU, in touch with the first flight three wide prompting the pace into the turn, edged forward racing past midstretch but was
collared nearing the wire. J J'S WILDCAT, urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the inside, dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch
but yielded between the top pair late. GABRIEL'S LEGEND switched out in early stages tracking off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out
four wide nearing the lane but had no late kick. ROVERTON, urged between foes prompting the pace, dueled for command through the turn and gave way
nearing midstretch. ROARING SAILOR broke slowly and never gained contention. HEAVENLY GAZEBO tracked off the first flight five wide in the opening
stages but retreated early. HILLBILLY CHARM trailed throughout. Races times updated after data review.
