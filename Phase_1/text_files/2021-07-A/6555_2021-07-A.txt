Footnotes
O FIRST SWEET HEART gained outside early stretch, was given cue and sped clear to a convincing win. OBSESSED BUG stumbled leaving and was
outkicked. DESTELLO DE LUNA responded to steady right handed encouragement and got by late for show honors. BEARCAT BILL stumbled then
bumped into OBSESSIVE GAMBLER leaving gate then recovered quickly and weakened late stretch. FIRST GOLDEN ROSE stumbled at the start and
offered a late mild bid. OBSESSIVE GAMBLER bumped hard from the gate and was outrun. ARCHIE ROYAL FIRST offered little. NOT GOOD ENOUGH
stumbled away from the gate, angled in at the head of the stretch and failed to threaten. A VERYGOOD MOONSHINE reluctant to load, veered in leaving
the gate and was not a factor.

KNOCKOUT edged out late. TIMBERS EXPRESS drifted inward early and missed in a multi-horse scramble to the finish. ULNVME TO interest late.
NORTHFORKHIGH late mild bid. BOUND TOO BE FIRST away well and lacked rally. JESS BE FIRST raced evenly. SHAMOURA outrun and steadied late
stretch. ROYALE RUNAWAY lacked running room early, angled towards the rail and yielded.

CAGEY quickly took control, held good margins through the far turn, saw margins decrease late stretch and held safely. ABERDEEN ANNIE sat in striking
distance from the two path, chased in vain through the stretch but was no threat to the winner and finished clearly second best. SCARLETTE ROSE trailed
behind the field, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. I'MAMUDDERTOO broke alertly, tracked four wide then was done
early and bled. ELECTRIC FEEL saved to no avail. *It was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having I'MAMUDDERTOO bled.

CROSS LADY allowed to settle along the rail, drove three to four wide, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. LITTLE NEW YORK
trailed the field, waited in traffic at the quarter pole, found running room at the head of the stretch in the three path and was unable to stall the winner. DAISY
FIELD raced three wide through the opening turn, dueled through the backstretch outside of TALA and weakened through the stretch. SPANISH DIVA
reserved off the pacesetters early, hustled into the final turn, chased outside but was unable to improve position through the drive. BAINE THE BULL stalked
the dueling pacesetters early, went in pursuit of the leaders and faded. TALA contended the pace from the two path, was unable to move on with rival after
the quarter pole and tired.

OUT FRONT pressed the pace while three to four wide, gained the lead with two and a half furlongs remaining and held on under a late drive. LIL OL
FLATTER never far back while four wide, swung out into the lane, rallied determinedly outside and missed. NO COLLUSION stalked three wide then drove
four wide, and was bested late for place. GLINDA GOOD WITCH trailed wide early, waited for running room into the lane and lacked the kick needed. GO
MAMA prompted between rivals and was unable to keep pace with the field. LADY BENGEL sat just off the pace along the rail and tired early.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK allowed to settle early, was asked to quicken through the far turn, lodged a rail bid through the stretch and won driving. EDDYSHAK sat just
off the pace from the three path, was roused at the quarter pole and was along in time for place. STORMCHASER saved ground while showing the way
through the backstretch and gave way grudgingly late stretch. CHASKA tracked from the two path, chased inside and faded on the rail in drive. STRIDERS
RING raced four to five wide and flattened through the stretch. TRADER LYNN bumped away from the gate and failed to threaten. MR. KALYPSO stumbled
leaving and chased throughout. MY LUCKY MARK squeezed out early and failed to recover from the start.

Footnotes
RIVER HOUSE sat just off the pace, gained the lead at the quarter pole, drifted in early stretch and narrowly prevailed under a long drive. STAPLETON
saved ground while showing the way, was overtaken then lost the inside path, shifted out digging in and narrowly missed. A. F. INDY chased outside
through the backstretch, closed quickly outside and got up late. STEELFORCE raced four wide, gained closer order then rallied four wide through the
stretch, inched up over rivals and was edged out. MOROCCAN WARRIOR fanned three wide in the opening turn, lodged a rail bid in the stretch and
flattened. TRANG tracked inside and raced evenly in stretch. BOLSANO showed a mild interest late. PATRICK offered little. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of STAPLETON against the rider of RIVER HOUSE alleging interference in the stretch run was not allowed after review of the
Stewards. No change made.
