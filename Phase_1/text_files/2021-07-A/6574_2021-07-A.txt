Footnotes
SWEET FRANNY LU went to the front, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked in the
two path at the quarter-pole then kicked clear and drew off under a very mild hand ride to win handily. TO THE TUNE brushed with a foe near the
seven-eighths, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path outside
the quarter-pole and regained the place while no match for the winner. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS was taken in hand early, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, was let out in the two path early on the turn, moved to three then four wide late on that bend, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while able to get the show. BELLA PRINCIPESSA ducked in at the start and was off slow, moved out while advancing then brushed with a
rival at the seven-eighths, pressed the leader between horses then on the outside, vied in the three then two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired. TALES OF MAKENNA broke very slow and spotted the front many lengths, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
DAGGERBOARD hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along lightly in the two path uncontested through swift splits, came under threat spinning
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the final furlong and gamely prevailed at the wire. QUICK RETURN broke out at the start
bumping CAPT' REMINGTON and forcing that foe to steady in behind soon after, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader widening away as a pair from
the rest of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and advanced to knock heads through the final furlong fighting on
gamely to the finish but was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest. CAPT' REMINGTON got bumped at the start by QUICK RETURN
breaking outwards and was forced to steady behind that rival soon after conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and
improved position with a mild bid to secure the show honors in the very last jump to the finish. SECOND FORTUNE chased five wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. UP FOR ADVENTURE chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, angled four wide for home, shied out under a left handed crop through the stretch
and weakened. MY PRIMO coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, went eight wide at the head of the stretch
and tired. PERFECT SYMPHONY three to four wide in pursuit under a ride from midway on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, made no impact.
BOLGHERI coaxed from the start, chased four wide under urging from the three-eighths, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact.
Races with the rail setting at 35 feet are hand timed.

Footnotes
TIERGAN moved up after the start to race just off the pace, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch under a right-handed crop, pursued the leader then was switched to a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, made a bid into the final
sixteenth, went back to a right-handed crop after getting the lead late and prevailed under strong urging. QUICKFLASH was away alertly and went straight
to the front, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, began
to drift out just inside the furlong marker just before being put to a left-handed crop, continued to drift out some into the final sixteenth and was caught while
well clear for second. FOREST SPIRIT tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and
weakened. WORK OUT reared and unseated the rider behind the gate then went a bit under three furlongs before being caught by the outrider, was brought
back to the gate and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came out of the gate in last position, settled at the rear, went four wide on the turn, dropped
back quickly late on that bend and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

weary inside the final sixteenth and held safe to prevail. DOUBLEPOUR four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing just inside the three-eighths and tipped out briefly to the two path before tipping to the three path five-sixteenths from
home, angled six wide into upper stretch, split foes when rallying at the three-sixteenths and closed well through to the finish to secure the place honors
while well clear of the rest and along second best. QUINTARELLI four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn

TRUE PALACE pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging while on even terms for
the lead, gained a short advantage outside the quarter-pole, floated four wide into the stretch then inched clear, drifted out under a left-handed crop into the
final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter and held under strong urging. GOOD CULTURE settled on the outside, came under strong
urging leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, was put to the crop around the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a vigorous
drive and improved position to just get the place in a long drive. REGALITY broke in at the start, moved up to set the pace, vied along the rail on the turn,
was asked under heavy threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole, came off the rail under a strong drive into
upper stretch and was outfinished then just lost the place while able to get the show. TALLAJ showed some early speed then dropped off the pace, was
urged while two path to the inside on the turn and finished willingly late for the last spot in the superfecta. MOONLIGHT NOW stalked the pace on the
outside, chased three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, drifted out while dropping back into the final furlong and tired. HALSTAAT
settled off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. PATTY O'MARC was last to
commence, moved out early then drifted further out, dropped well behind on the turn and was eased through to the finish then walked off.

BODECREAM coaxed from the gate, chased just off the pace three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home
advancing to be the outermost of a trio knocking heads through the stretch and to the finish and was just up in the final jump gamely to score. CHRIS AND
DAVE established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed four then three wide under prompting from CHOCOLATE BAR to his inside, spun three wide
for home, dug in under challenge from flanking foes and clung stubbornly and gamely to the front until nailed in the very last jump to the wire. CHOCOLATE
BAR prompted the aforementioned foe from the inside in the two path, came under light coaxing before being set down spinning just off the inside for home,
dug in under a drive heads apart for command inside a pair through the stretch fighting on to the finish and was shaken off and bested in the final seventy
yards while well clear of the rest. ALKHAATAM coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. TWISTED TOM chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths and made no impact. VINTAGE

ALCOOLS stalked the pace on the outside, traveled around the turn in the two to three path, took over when ready into upper stretch, shook clear into the
final furlong and drew away under strong urging. STROLLING settled off the pace, drafted inside early on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths then
moved to the two path, came four wide into the stretch under the crop and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. VINEYARD SOUND
broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way with company to the outside, vied inside to the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under the crop into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show.
STORM ADVISORY chased the pace on the outside then three to four wide on the turn, spun six wide into upper stretch and tired. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD
settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ
settled off the pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then moved out, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST just off the inside early on, tipped to the three path and advanced loosely between the top pair to take over command six and a
half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand three then two wide and slipped away through the turn patiently handled, cornered two to three wide into
upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and was well clear to the eighth pole, dug in under use of a left handed crop drifting out a sixteenth from
home, while holding well with good energy through to the finish. FOUNDER broke in at the start bumping JOHNNY SACK, chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close stoutly inside the final sixteenths while well clear of the
rest for the place honors. JOHNNY SACK bumped at the start by FOUNDER breaking inwards, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch until
darting to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, rode the rail through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened while along well clear for the show honors. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two
path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and tired. GHAZAALY broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch before going four wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from
home, spun three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. RESTORED ORDER coaxed from the start, was forwardly placed two to three wide, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths as the leader slipped away, went six wide into upper stretch and folded. SPECTATORLESS led early on six then five paths off the
inside before being displaced from command by the eventual winner six and a half furlongs from home, tucked four wide into the turn and retreated under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered. Races with the rail setting at 35 feet are hand timed.

Footnotes
TRUTH HURTS pressed the pace on the outside while being carried well out in the track, drew even with five furlongs to run, gained a narrow advantage in
the four path on the turn, dropped to the three path while moving clear at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop while still on her inside lead in
upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady
urging. PIEDI BIANCHI went to the front, set the pace under pressure from the outside while moving well out in the track, lost the lead in the three path on
the turn, lost touch with the winner near the quarter-pole then was driven four wide into the stretch and proved no match while able to safely secure the
place. VELVET CRUSH tracked the pace on the outside while carried out near the center on the track, was asked in the five path on the turn, chased
outside under a drive into the stretch and tired. HOGANS HOLIDAY settled at the rear of the field, was roused while inside on the turn, came under the crop
outside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAX PLAYER four wide through the first turn, settled six paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader, tucked
three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and cornered four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out
being guided out slightly to get separation as MYSTIC GUIDE came outwards before knocking heads with that rival to take command a sixteenth from
home, then dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. MYSTIC GUIDE three wide through the opening bend, settled four paths off the inside just off the pace,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and advanced on the rail scraping the paint inside MORETTI through the turn trading a light bump with that rival just
inside the three-eighths, took over narrow command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a left handed crop coming out to look MAX
PLAYER in the eye at the eighth pole and had that rival drift slightly to get some separation, dug in under threat and was headed a sixteenth from home,
battled on gamely inside but was ultimately bested at the end. HAPPY SAVER four wide through the opening turn, settled six to seven paths off the inside to
the outside of MYSTIC GUIDE, tucked four wide into the far turn and came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch
placed to a drive, ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors in the late stages while unable to threaten the top pair. MORETTI coaxed from the
gate, established the front and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before tipping four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch
through legitimate splits, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, had MYSTIC GUIDE slip up inside near the three-eighths through a tight seam and
got put to coaxing trading a nudge with that rival just inside that station, got headed for command near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper
stretch loosely between rivals, dug in under a drive getting shaken off nearing the eighth pole, had MYSTIC GUIDE drift out safely in front and weakened in
the late stages getting caught for the show honors in the final jumps. INFORMATIVE just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the
backstretch, the innermost of the field, remained three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing midway, angled out five wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. PRIORITIZE three wide through the opening bend, chased four then five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven
wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.
