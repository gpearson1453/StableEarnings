SOUTHERN WARLORD pressured the pace from the three path, gained the advantage racing into the lane and was kept to task. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR
returned to paddock for equipment adjustment, reserved off the pacesetters, was set down in the drive and gained ground late on the winner. REDNECK
REMARK raced wide through the backstretch and just held on for show. PRESS GANG never far back inside, hustled into the final turn and just missed for
placing. BIONIC BIRD set a pressured pace from just off the rail, was overtaken and faded steadily through stretch.

pacesetters and lacked a serious bid. FIRST BASE outrun throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. After

DAZZLING CHIC allowed to settle in stride, advanced quickly into the final turn, angled inside then found running room between rivals in stretch and was up
late. ASTARTOBE attended the pace in the three path, raced in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, gained a slim advantage over CAN'T TOUCH THIS
nearing the head of the stretch and but was caught. CAN'T TOUCH THIS set a pressured pace along the rail, lacked the rally that was needed in the drive
and weakened in stretch. LIA'S ON TUNE tracked outside while four wide, fanned four wide through the turn and lacked a late kick. SASK LADY chased the
pacesetters early and passed tiring rival. LA MER vied for the early lead, was unable to keep pace with field and tired. FAIRY BARB rider broke on mouth
then was last away and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CIGARILLO vied inside for the early lead, showed the way through the turn, turned back challenge from DAME DEVIL entering the stretch and held. DAME
DEVIL sat just off the early pace racing three to four wide, moved up menacingly under heavy encouragement but was unable to reach the winner and just
held on for placing. CHATTY GAL tracked inside from just off the rail, lodged a rail bid but was unable to improve position through the drive. EMERALD
CANYON chased four to five wide through the backstretch and weakened through the drive. COLLAR ME FIRST sat in range outside and lacked bid.
BREACH OF CONTRACT squeezed out leaving the gate, trailed and launched a late bid into stretch. PUDDLES raced wide through the backstretch and
showed little interest. SALTY O'DAY never reached contention. CALEDON SUMMER tracked outside, was brushed leaving the backstretch, then angled
inward into the turn and chased to no avail.

Footnotes
RED CHOCOLATE settled outside, went in pursuit of the lead from the five sixteenth pole, pushed to the lead and won driving. PERDITION prompted three
wide, dueled outside of J. CRUZ through the final turn and lacked the rally needed when challenged by RED CHOCOLATE into the stretch. VICTORY AT
LAST tracked outside in second flight, took closer order through the turn and was along just in time. J. CRUZ contended the pace inside of PERDITION,
was unable to move on with rival when challenged near the quarter pole and was edged out late for show. REMAIN CALM chased outside and passed tiring
rivals. NODIGGITYNODOUBT tracked outside in the early stages and came up empty for the drive. SPORTSCARR was not a factor. SECRET MEETING
attended the pace between rivals and faded steadily from the three eighths marker. IPAYUBACKPROMISE broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STEAL A KISS bumped leaving, saved ground early, advanced quickly along the rail, angled out to the four path, closed steadily outside and was along in
time. AMBER RIDGE sent for speed outside then quickly angled in to secure a rail position and was run down. RAININ ON BOARD hurried away then sat
just off the pace in the two path, was roused into the lane but was unable to improve position late and held on for show. CRANBERRY CREEK chased
inside and weakened late stretch. WENDY SCHRAMSBERG broke inward into STEAL A KISS, chased three wide and flattened out. DISTINCT LADY
saved ground from the three path and failed to threaten. THREETIMESTHELADY hurried outside, raced four wide through the turn and faded. APRIL'S
IMPERIAL passed tiring rivals. ON ESPRESSO never reached contention. FOOL IN THE RAIN raced five wide into the opening turn and faded steadily
soon after. CMON SHARON was not a factor. JAVA GIRL always outrun. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.
