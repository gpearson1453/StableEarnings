Footnotes
SPECTATORLESS showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested, got asked at the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive holding well to the finish kept to task. PROFUSION chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. BELLAMY DOLCE
broke in at the start brushing MICHAEL'S BAD BOY, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside for home and improved position to secure the show honors. LOKOYA ROAD broke out at the start bumping
GENERALONAMISSION, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. DOUBLEPOUR five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under encouragement nearing
the five-sixteenths, bid into prominence swinging five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive unable to sustain the move and weakened to the finish.
GENERALONAMISSION bumped at the start by LOKOYA ROAD, who broke outwards, chased three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, went four
wide at the head of the stretch and tired. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY bobbled at the start and was brushed by BELLAMY DOLCE, who broke inwards, chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FOTIS coaxed from the gate, showed
brief speed along the inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths in retreat, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CHARLEE O broke in and hit the gate but came out in front, showed the way on the inside with an uncontested lead, controlled the action while inside on
the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, turned back two foes under the crop in the final furlong and held under
strong urging in an excellent debut at big odds. CHAMPAGNE CAMIE tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path outside the
five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid between horses in upper stretch, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place. PAMMY'S
READY stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid into upper stretch, battled
outside the top two under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. HOT FUDGE dropped back then settled off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SHANGHAI SHAMROCK broke a half-step slow, was urged along in the
back half of the field then taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, drifted out
some late and lacked the needed response. CONTINENTALCONGRES broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, dropped from four to three wide
on the turn, moved to the two path into the stretch and failed to respond. UNION DOLLY broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
was asked outside the quarter-pole and came up empty. PACIFIC GROVE dropped back after breaking well, went three then four wide on the turn, moved
to five wide nearing the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
PRETTY CLEVER coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from
SHAMALAMADINGDONG to the outside, had that rival advanced into the turn and knocked heads with that foe through the bend coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide for home and traded a bump with her main danger straightened away, dug in continuing the duel through the
length of the stretch brushing just outside the eighth pole, fought on gamely to the finish clinging to command to ultimately rebuff the challenge to the wire.
SHAMALAMADINGDONG coaxed from the start, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside four paths off the rail down the backstretch before
tucking three wide into the turn advancing to engage the leader in head to head combat through the turn, came under light and brief coaxing near the
quarter pole before being set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, traded a bump straightened away, widened away in tandem from the rest of the
field brushing just outside the eighth pole, dug in dueling to the finish but was ultimately denied at the end in a game effort. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE traded
a brush ta the start with OUT OF SIGHT, chased two then three wide down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. TOWERING ORBIT chased five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. ROAD TO REMEMBER four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and tired. OUT OF SIGHT traded a brush at the start with CONSTITUTIONALRAGE, chased along the inside under a ride from
the three-eighths, cornered into upper stretch from the two path and tired.

Footnotes
RHYTHM SECTION showed good speed, rounded the first turn in the three path, disputed the pace on the outside of DEMO DOCTOR while drawing well
clear of the rest of the field, vied outside in the two path on the far turn, kicked clear under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to the crop
approaching the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. CHULAINN was bumped at the start and forced in, saved ground
while taken in hand on the first turn then was reserved off the pace, was roused while inside on the far turn, came out into upper stretch and finished
willingly for the place. GIRL DAD traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two
path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position for the show. DEMO DOCTOR contested the pace on the inside of the
winner while along the rail, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. SIDD FINCH traveled around the first
turn in the four path, settled in third position while well behind the two leaders, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. FAME
TO FAMOUS broke in and bumped CHULAINN at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without cover, was urged three
wide on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
VOODOO ZIP four paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked to the two path into the turn and was patiently handled until
placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, got herded
out three paths as YES AND YES came out under the use of a near side crop and gamely took command seventy yards from home digging in to inch away
late and prevail. YES AND YES broke out a step at the start bumping and pinching SUPPLY AND DEMAND and RIVER TIBER against pressure outside
from BIG PACKAGE, led early on before settling four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn advancing
to take command just outside the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat coming out to look his main danger in the eye
nearing the eighth pole then drifted out under use of a near side crop herding the aforementioned foe out three paths to the sixteenth marker, got caught
seventy yards from home and fought on to the finish latched on and well clear of the rest. BIG PACKAGE broke in a step at the start bumping and pinching
RIVER TIBER and SUPPLY AND DEMAND against pressure from YES AND YES, who broke outwards a step to their inside, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SUPPLY AND DEMAND
bumped between foes at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home and improved position through to the finish. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS five then four wide in pursuit in range of the leader, got coaxed along
three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. AFTER FIVE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. AMPERSAND brushed the near side stall at the start and got away slowly, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn, went five wide for home and offered no response. ANANROAD forwardly placed from the start under coaxing,
established command five and a half furlongs from home and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked to the inside inside the three-eighths and
came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, yielded the front near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the drive.
RIVER TIBER got bumped between rivals at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. SPARKLING SKY chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide
through the turn, went five wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFIA coaxed from the gate, settled four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to knock heads with that rival through the turn
patiently handled and tucked to the two path, took over command just outside the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused briefly
straightened away for home and drew off widening away from the field placed to a very light hand coaxing a furlong out and continued to edged away in
hand to the finish. GLASS CEILING four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. PRIMACY chased two to
three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, tipped out to the center of
the track and passed tired rivals to the finish. FIERCE LADY coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn, cornered three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MIDTOWN ROSE coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down
the backstretch in range of the front, tucked three wide through the turn and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and tired. RUVIES IN TIME three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the
seven or eight path and tired. HARPER'S IN CHARGE showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch through swift splits and under
pressure from BELLA SOFIA to the outside, dueled through the turn with that rival coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, yielded the front just outside the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. Please note that due to a teletimer malfunction the five-eighths split time
was unavailable.

Footnotes
CALL ME LOVE (GB) was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was passed by both VIRGINIA JOY and DELTA'S
KINGDOM while behind horses coming to the five-sixteenths, came under urging nearing the quarter-pole then swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final strides. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in
the two path, was rated on the outside, went three wide while stalking on the final turn, gained to make a bid when asked at the five-sixteenths, took the lead
between horses into the stretch, led under the crop into the final sixteenth but was denied in the final strides while just able to get the place. MUTAMAKINA
(GB) went to the front, set the pace under a snug hold on the inside, was headed into the stretch then asked for her best, fought back gamely in the final
furlong, reached even terms for the lead again in the final sixteenth but just missed while clear for the show. DELTA'S KINGDOM was taken back to the rear
of the field then angled in, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, was roused with a half-mile to run, advanced four wide on the far turn, made an
outside bid passing the five-sixteenths, battled under the crop into the final furlong and weakened. CIVIL UNION was taken in hand early, went three wide
early on the opening bend then tucked into the two path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back readily
outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. Due to a timing issue the quarter time was re-timed from video.
