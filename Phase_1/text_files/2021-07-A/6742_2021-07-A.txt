Footnotes
GRAN MANNA set the pace on the inside while being well handled, then drew clear passed the furlong marker, then was kept safe to the wire to prove best
under a drive. DORITA'S HEART tracked the early pace four wide, then made a three wide move on the turn, then was gaining late but needed more.
ROMA'S CHOICE was well rated on the inside, then was boxed passed the quarter pole and was hard to corner, then finished well on the inside. FILLY
CHEESESTEAK was in tight into the first turn between rivals, then raced between horses on the backstretch, then moved out on the turn and came six wide
into the stretch, then rallied well. MARLOW was allowed to settle on the inside, then was blocked passed the three sixteenths pole, then had a mild rally
while in traffic in the drive. SATIN ROSE was rated while five wide down the backstretch, then was six wide by the quarter pole and offered no rally. DEDE'S
TRICK was off slow, then was void of early speed, angled out wide in the stretch and had a belated rally. AMANTE DE SARA lacked a rally. D' SPELL ON
YOU was reserved early while two wide, made a mild bid three wide into the stretch but encountered traffic and had no late rally. PRALINE PRALL stalked
the pace three wide and weakened. FLYINGJ CUPCAKE was four wide into the first turn and not a threat. NELLIE DEE dropped back.

Footnotes
BROTHER ROBERT was well rated early, then advanced and came four wide into the drive, continued that bid and got clear with about a hundred yards to
go then held off the late charge of CONATIVE late. CONATIVE was void of early speed, then started to unwind nearing the five sixteenths pole, swung out
six wide for the drive and closed fast late but too late. GOLD ENDEAVOR stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, then drifted in
under right handed urging passed the furlong marker while clear, then raced erratic through the furlong grounds and faded late. UNDERDOG was allowed to
settle early, raced four wide by the quarter pole and had a mild late rally. FIFTYSHADESOPURPLE set the early pace in the two path, then checked by the
furlong marker and weakened. COME ON MIKE was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. JONATHAN WHO stalked
the early pace and made a inside bid by the quarter pole to gain a short lead but weakened. TOUCH AND GO failed to menace.

SWEET PERFECTION vied for the early lead three wide, then rated off to stalk the pace, made a three wide bid when straightened, then drew off in the
stretch to prove much the best under a drive. LEA'S PRINCESS vied for the early lead in between rivals, then went on to set the pace passed the half mile
marker to leaving the turn, then proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. VIRGINIA STRONG was reserved early, then was three
wide by the quarter pole and had no rally while being along for the show award. SWEET SHELIA vied for the early lead on the inside, then moved out
nearing the three eighths pole bumping a rival, then was four wide passed the quarter pole and weakened. KANDI SPUN lacked a rally. LADY ELIANA
chased the early pace three wide, then was bumped and forced out four to five wide by the three eighths pole and weakened.

PIRATE JUNCTION set the pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the quarter pole, then was sent down leaving the three sixteenths pole and
responded well to draw out in the final furlong under a drive. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter
pole to go on even terms for the lead, but flattened out the final furlong while being second best. LETHAL MOVE was void of early speed, came four wide
into the drive to have a late rally. DEANOS CAPE chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. FRA MAURO
was allowed to settle on the inside but offered no rally. SOCIAL AFLEET had no rally while four wide. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE failed to menace.
AVAILABLE STAR threw head at the start, then stalked the early pace, then chased the pace and was between rivals on the turn and tired. THE MILE
SPLIT WAS UNAVAILABLE.

for the lead on the inside and weakened. OUTSMARTED dueled for the early lead two wide, then was between rivals on the turn and weakened. VELVET
CHAINS chased the early pace five wide and then was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened. ORENA STARSHINE chased the pace two wide and
weakened. PHARME'S PHINALE was off slowly and no factor. AWAY DOWN SOUTH was bumped at the start, failed to menace.

Footnotes
KALLINIKI was away alertly and keen early, drew off on the backstretch, then was tiring the final furlong but held sway late to prove best under a drive.
SIAMESE was settled back early, advanced on the turn and came six wide into the stretch, closed well to just miss. GASTOWN was reserved early and was
six wide on the backstretch, then was five wide into the drive and rally mildly. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was void of early speed, then advanced four wide
on the turn, angled out widest in the stretch and finished well on the outside but too late. PICK UP THE FONE was allowed to settle early, came three wide
into the drive and made a bid, but was blocked at the furlong marker, then angled out for racing room and had a mild late rally. EMPRESSIVE REWARD
was reserved early and made a inside bid entering the stretch but needed more. MARKUP chased the early pace and made a three wide entering the
stretch but flattened out the final furlong. GREAT IN RED chased the early pace and made a two wide bid to the furlong marker and weakened. MODIFIED
failed to menace. TEXAS RED BEL was bumped at the start, then dropped back after a half mile.
