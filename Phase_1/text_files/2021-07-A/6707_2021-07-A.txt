Footnotes
BLAST IN THE SNOW in mid pack early, closed on the backstretch, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn, drew even at the top of the stretch,
battled gamely but came in despite left hand urging and leaned on ULTIMATE STORM a 16th out then prevailed under a drive. ULTIMATE STORM bumped
at the outset, set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, was headed upper stretch but came on again, was bumped mid stretch but dueled to the wire and
just missed. LOADED SNIPER stalked the pace, saved ground, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. VIATURE stalked the pace, was hustled three
and four-wide on the far turn the closed willingly through the stretch. CARROBIO pressed the pace, moved up between the duelers to have his say on the
backstretch, remained prominent two-wide through the far turn but yielded upper stretch and tired. BREATHLESSNTHESAND was rated off the early pace
then closed to mid pack, was hustled five-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. MR. MAGICAL was off slowly and settled in mid pack, chased from the
rail to three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. AWESOMECREST bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was checked hard four-wide on
the far turn then lacked a rally. TRINITY GOLD broke outward the pressed the pace into the backstretch, dueled, but dropped back on the far turn. DOC
FISHMAN was pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but was never in contention. THE RIDER ON
ULTIMATE STORM LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST BLAST IN THE SNOW FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING THE
STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BLAST IN THE SNOW AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
MOON OVER MONTANA trailed the field into the turn, came two to four wide into range by the quarter pole, out in the five path turning for home with dead
aim on the leaders before the eighth pole, drove by them all at the sixteenth marker and widened while still outside in the final seventy yards.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE lost his path at the start when a rival broke out, trailed midway on the turn, tapped on the brakes behind rivals at that point, came
off the rail into the stretch and ran into traffic twice before the seventy yard pole, staying on his wrong lead before shifting between runners late to get up for
the place. ROCKET PLAN stalked the leader while three wide throughout, bid with another rival top stretch, garnered a short lead at the eighth pole but was
headed by the winner at the sixteenth pole, losing the place spot late as well when tiring. AMBERWOOD two wide and off the pace early, came three to four
wide to loom up turning for home, lugged in by the eighth pole while continuing to inch up but could only garner a minor award while outside runners at the
wire. DUKE OF MIAMI settled in mid pack and three wide, commenced a three to five wide rally outside the winner around the turn and drifted out into the
seven path turning for home, closing mildly in the final sixteenth while widest. DISTINCT PASSION broke in at the start, was hard held while moving up to
stalk the early leader, bid with another rival to his outside turning for home, head and head for the lead in upper stretch but faded in the final sixteenth.
PICCADILLY BEAU broke out at the start, settled in mid pack along the rail and continued on the fence throughout, still in behind the leaders turning for
home but levelled off in the final furlong. FEDERAL LAW lost his path and was bumped at the start, sat in the two path in mid pack around the turn and was
in range at the quarter pole but could not sustain any momentum down the lane. BLOCKBUSTER was along the rail and in mid pack throughout, came off
the rail at the quarter pole but had no response when asked. BE VEWY VEWY QUIET sped to the front, was stalked and pressed by the quarter pole,
dropping back down the lane.

FIELDER pressed the early pace, stalked from the rail on the turn, rallied along the fence and bid a 16th out, battled to the lead with 70 yards on tap and
held under a drive. HITTERS PARK raced in mid pack, rode the rail then two-wide on the turn, launched a furious rally in the stretch, closed fast but missed
on the wire. ALACRITOUS was sent to a clear early lead, set the pace from the rail then held to deep stretch and gave way. STRIKING MOON raced in mid
pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch then angled out to miss the traffic and gained steadily. RECONFIGURE forced the
pace into the turn, was hustled two-wide, chased into the stretch, was determined, but evened out in the late stages. SOUPER SUCCESS raced in mid
pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. WHERE'S ANTHONY raced off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide
through the turn, rallied outside but failed to menace. WHISKEY VICTOR settled off the pace, chased two to four-wide through the turn but encountered
traffic in the stretch and evened out. AWESOME MINER pressed the pace briefly then dropped back along the rail approaching the turn, saved ground and
finished evenly. FORESTER'S TURN stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
FINAL STRIKE showed pace from the inside, saved ground throughout, shook loose on the far turn with light encouragement and was never threatened in
the stretch. SELF INFLICTED raced widest into the first turn, trailed the field down the backstretch, hustled into contention while racing four-wide on the far
turn but was a clear second best in the stretch. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS pressed the pace while racing two-wide, was no match for the eventual winner by
the time they reached the far turn and finished evenly. CAPTURE THE RIDE raced in midpack, was two and three-wide, came under some asking on the far
turn but was empty in the stretch. FRAC ATTACK dropped down to the rail, stalked the pace while racing on the inside and was empty by the far turn.
