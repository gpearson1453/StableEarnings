Footnotes
ZION'S CALL away in good order, dueled up front in the two path through a soft opening quarter, shook clear before a half, continued to maintain daylight
through the final turn, kept to task with steady pressure through the stretch. THE BIG IRISHMAN in the second flight early three wide, chased the winner
into and through the final turn, proved no match in the drive, fully extended to hold the place. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY trailed for five furlongs toward the
inside, moved out to be three wide for the final turn, rallied to be getting to the runner up late while outside that one. I'M A FLASHY KID dueled up front early
along the inside, fell back, came up empty for the stretch run. FREUD WIND broke in the air, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
SOME WOULD SAY stalked the two dueling leaders the opening three furlongs, moved and when preparing to mount a bid turning for home, challenged on
the outside approaching the furlong grounds, edging clear. JOE G'S PAYBACK dueled up front while off the inside, vied between rivals and inside the
winner past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that one, well clear of the rest. I'M ALL MIXED UP bothered, off slow, lacked speed in trailing
early, along for the show, not a threat to the top two. RAISING THE ROOF remained back in failing to muster a rally. MALLORY'S HOME dueled up front
inside the runner up, continued to vie into the lane, first to blink nearing midstretch, continued to weaken to lose the show late to her entrymate. PERFECT
JUSTICE finished early, trailed home.

TRUE DEAL moved up to duel off the inside the opening furlong, shook off the other speed and another rival turning for home, stayed clear to the wire
under a firm right handed crop. GRUNT broke alertly, dueled up front along the rail and inside the winner, could not keep pace with that one through the
stretch, edged away for the second spot. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN off the early pace while racing outside, loomed a threat three wide and outside the top
pair turning for home, flattened out in the drive, remainee well clear of the others. CHIEF KIMOSABI off a step slow, raced back, improved position while not
a threat to the top three. MO CREDO trailed for most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. ISLE CALL U LATER chased the early duel and began a
steady fade before three furlongs. I LIKE DREAMING failed to menace.

Footnotes
SUCRE broke on top, set the pace inside, rated the middle half while shaking clear, drew out through the lane while being kept to pressure. SUPER LEGS
back in the opening quarter, made an early move into contention before a half, closest to the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one in the run to
the wire, fully extended to preserve the second spot. COSTA SUGAR lacked speed for five furlongs, four wide wide turning for home, dueled for the second
spot past the furlong marker, outkicked for that position in the late going. SWEET MILAGROS forwardly placed through the first turn off the inside, fell back
before a half and went evenly thereafter in lacking a closing response. THIS IS MY PRAYER pressed the issue early off the inside, chased the winner up
the backstretch then began to give way late in the final turn. KAYDEES IN TOWN settled off the pace, was finished after a half. MADISON'S WILD ONE
trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OPPS MY BAD prompted the pace along the inside out of the chute and up the backstretch, moved out slightly when making a quick challenge on the
leader with a quarter mile remaining, clear into the lane, held that same foe safe in the run to the wire under steady handling. TYPHOON ZING broke alertly,
showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and through much of the turn, offered little resistance when headed by the
winner late in the bend, chased that one past the furlong marker and then stayed on well to be closing the gap on that one late while well clear of the others.
SWEET AMELIA lacked early foot, moved out and was four wide when beginning an advance turning for home, continued with that mild rally to be in time
for the show late, not a threat to the top two. GRAYFULLY in the second flight while racing outside, also was four wide exiting the turn, closest to the top two
with a furlong to run, lacked any closing punch to be caught for the show. MISSGREELEY'SSONG forwardly placed off the inside for five furlongs, had little
for the drive. SISTER CHLOE away in good order, prompted the pace four a half well off the inside and began to weaken. MISS MABELEE broke back,
improved position without posing a serious threat. BETTY JOY'S STAR made little impact from well back. CANDY CANDY CANDY remained back in failing
to menace. CAJUN SHOTS in mid pack in the run up the backstretch, tired from those early efforts. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK off a step slow, raced well
back, five wide turning for home, failed to rally. SEVEN COME ELEVEN in the main body for a half, beat a steady retreat thereafter.

Footnotes
MIND ON MY MONEY dueled up front out of the chute, continued to alternate up the backstretch, headed far turn, put a head turning for home, steadily
extended that advantage to the wire under firm handling. BIG BOSS MAN alternated up front inside the winner along the rail for almost six furlongs and
gave ground grudgingly to the victor until late. SECRET VISTA broke back, lacked speed, continued back far turn, came three wide into lane, dueled for the
show spot the length of the stretch, proved determined for that position, no threat to the top two. GOTTATAKEHIMTO settled off the top two in the second
flight, had little for that pair in the drive, outkicked for third. SON OF PATRIOT closest to the dueling top two early, came four wide out of the turn when
tiring, continued to weaken to the wire. SHUGS LIL BRO last away, trailed, never a factor.

Footnotes
FAREWELL TIME close from the start, moved up to duel in the two path midway on the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear into the lane, held the
runner up safe late under a brisk right handed crop. LEO DEL REO broke on top, set the early pace, headed by a pair of foes while along the inside midway
on the bend, roused in the two path exiting the turn, slowly getting back to the winner late while holding sway for the second spot. DREWZANO settled
behind the pace off the inside, four racing through the turn, exhibited a moderate amount of late interest while remaining widest of the second flight, not
enough late for the runner up position. PURE VALOR forwardly placed off the inside, advanced to duel outside the winner and three wide through the turn,
chased that same rival past the furlong marker then weakened late to lose the second spot. MUCHO MARVIN last away, trialed early, between horses into
the lane, displayed some, mild belated interest to improve position. LENAPE DRIVE settled off the pace, was never dangerous. PRAY IDE SING tried while
racing wide. KING COOKIE remained always back while racing inside.

Footnotes
LAFITTE'S FLEET allowed to the pace to go early, continued to bide time into the turn while well off the inside, floated out five wide by the runner up
entering the stretch, challenged with that one past the furlong marker and kicked clear. YOUNG BULL closest to the leader, got out when advancing on that
one under a firm right crop, challenged between rivals past midstretch, could not keep up late, clearly second best. CLUB SODA broke sharp, was well clear
in showing the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace through four furlongs through some lively fractions, offered brief resistance to the top two
nearing the furlong grounds, drifted a bit and faltered, saved the show. GALAXY BUILDER last away, trailed early, lacked a closing response in the drive.
SANDYS BLAZE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
TRIPPER JOHN behind the pace toward the inside early, moved out a bit when advancing into contention turning for home, blocked past the furlong marker
from between horses, switched out, closed with good resolve to be up in the final strides. MIZSPELT within striking distance outside, ranged up three wide
to challenge entering the stretch, put a head in front with a furlong remaining, shook clear, could not contain the winner. IMA SUNNY SONG lacked early
foot toward the inside, steered out widest when straightened for home, finished up willingly to earn the show. DA'MONEY ALARM broke on top, alternated
up front closest to the inside, vied past the furlong marker when still with the first flight, faltered. CRESCENT CITY CAT dueled up front off the inside for a
half and gave way the final furlong. ARGYBARGY BUCK fractious in the gate, was not a threat while racing wide. BIG T reluctant to load, was finished after
three furlongs, trailed home.
