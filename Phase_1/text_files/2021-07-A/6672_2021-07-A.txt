Footnotes
NAGINI attended the pace along the inside, wheeled to the outside leaving the turn, loomed large entering the stretch, then was fully extended to wear down
the determined WHISKEY SIS in the final bob. The latter broke awkwardly moved up three wide, came to level terms into the turn, took over and opened
clear nearing the quarter pole, fought on fiercely but was denied in the last jump. GRACE D' ART set the pressured pace off of the inside, disputed the issue
through the turn and tired. AMERICAN VIOLET broke a bit tardy and was slow into stride, lagged well back while wide and was never a factor.
GIVEUSTHISDAY saved ground to no avail.

LUCKY DOUBLE D'S stalked the early pace, made a strong move around the far turn while racing three wide, raced four deep nearing the eighth pole and
drove clear in the final stages. TREASURE WILBURNYA settled off the early going, saved ground down the backstretch, moved up along the rail through
the stretch and made a good late rally. GINGERMYSISTER was forwardly placed to stalk the top pair early on, raced towards the inside and had no final
winning bid. CHLOES ANGEL was fractious in the starting gate, showed good early speed from the inside to set all the pace and gave way in the drive.
EDGE was slow in the early stages, raced four to five wide through the lane and had no rally. NANA ROZE failed to sustain a bid while racing near the
inside.

HOWIE'S ANGEL showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside, raced two wide in the drive, dug in late and just missed in a game effort.
NOPICKINONCHARLIE stalked the early pace, moved up around the far turn along the inside, awaited room into the lane, found room while racing along
the rail and finished willingly to the wire. TEQUILA FLATS settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive.
BELTON AVE was slow early in the early stages, raced near the inside down the backstretch, raced two to three wide through the stretch run and had no
late rally.

BEVERLY PARK showed good early speed to set a quick early pace and built a long lead through the drive under steady handling. NOT NOW RAND broke
awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced towards the back of the pack early, moved up along the rail in the lane and finished well
to get up for the place position late. MOUNTAIN DIVISION settled off the early pace, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in
the drive. DONT ASK KINMON stalked the early pace, raced two to three wide while racing between rivals in the stretch run and had no final response.
PLATINUM MAC was forwardly placed to track the early leader and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing near the inside. LINEMAKER was
unhurried in the early stages, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. QUEEN'S PALACE failed to sustain a bid. AUTOPILOT was slow
early, raced three wide in the lane and failed to respond.

the early going, raced three deep through the stretch and had not enough in the drive. HOOSIER GOLD CASE raced in tight quarters at the seven eighths
pole, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. THREE BIRDS was slow early on, raced five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and had no

Footnotes
MAJESTIC VALLEY was slow early on, moved up six wide through the lane to circle the field while racing six deep under strong handling. MASON A. P.
stalked the early pace, raced four to five wide through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. HIDDEN PROMISE settled off the early pace, moved up while
racing near the inside and showed good late interest. IMPERIAL KING was coaxed along to lay up close, raced three wide in the lane and weakened in the
latter stages. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS settled off the early going, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no final response. CHASIN
CHARLIE was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. POWELL stalked the pace and tired while racing four deep.
ELLE'SBIGSEACRET showed good early speed and gave way.
