Footnotes
TRY ME broke in a bit at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, ran up on heels near the seven-sixteenths pole, remained in range inside, angled
three wide near the quarter pole, steadily shifted further out through the lane, reached near even terms in midstretch and drove clear late. BELLA FUTURE
dueled outside of WEATHERFORD for a half, battled on inside of the winner while shifting well out into the center of the course in the stretch before ceding
in the final sixteenth. CAN'T BE BROKEN came out and bumped EL ZOPILOTE at the start, chased the pace two wide around the turn and rallied inside of
foes for the show. EL ZOPILOTE was bumped then squeezed back at the start, saved ground well back, rallied inside in upper stretch, swung out near the
sixteenth pole and finished well between foes. LUVNMESUMCAJUN failed to menace while racing two wide. WEATHERFORD dueled along the rail to
midstretch and tired. BULK bumped with MISTER FERNANDO just after the start and played no further factor while racing three and four wide. HIGH
PRESS played no factor while racing three wide. MISTER FERNANDO was reluctant to load, bumped with BULK just after the start, raced three wide and
never threatened. MINDSHIP Q chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. FUN LOADED was outrun while racing two wide.

HERE COMES BULLET broke alertly, vied up front inside HARD TEN through a prolonged dispute, drifted out through a hard drive and prevailed. HARD
TEN dueled outside HERE COMES BULLET up the backstretch and around the turn, and could not get by while being floated out through the lane. CAMP
PENDLETON brushed the rail in tight near the half-mile marker, moved out five wide approaching the stretch, stayed on his left lead and was up for the
show with an even finish. PACIFIC LEGEND eyed the battling leaders around the turn three wide, altered course angling inside leaving the furlong grounds
and was outfinished. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE broke slowly and was outrun for a half, came five wide off the turn and finished evenly on the far outside. MR.
EINSTEIN tired after a half two to three wide. EL ROMANTICO was outrun three to four wide, and dropped far back in the stretch. SARATOGA DANCER
was always outrun. JOHNNIE GOT JETS steadied approaching the turn, stopped after six furlongs, and jogged to the wire eased up.

Footnotes
ALLWORTHY prompted the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, quickly drew clear, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while
ridden out. ELUSIVE MOLLY tracked the pace inside, angled four wide turning for home, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to be clearly
best. HEIRESSINDY raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. PERSPIRE set the pace along the rail and gave
way near the quarter pole. MERSEYSIDE had his head turned at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. ADDILYN pressed the pace two wide,
briefly led between foes near the five-sixteenths pole then wilted in the lane.

Footnotes
LADY CLOVERLY was bumped lightly between SPECIAL INCLUSION and SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE shortly after the start, took control through the stretch
the first time, backed down the pace through a leisurely second quarter, widened the advantage after six furlongs, and faced no dangers while drifting out
through the stretch. AWESOME ELLA was reserved early near the inside, advanced after six furlongs being guided out three wide, rallied to go clear for
second through midstretch, and ran on well enough to hold that position. CACTUS KITTEN was slow into stride and outrun early, swung four wide coming
off the far turn, rallied into third through the furlong grounds and finished up evenly. SPECIAL INCLUSION bumped lightly with LADY CLOVERLY after the
start, saved ground in range to the top of the stretch, and faded. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE bumped lightly with the eventual winner a few strides from the
gate, appeared unsettled briefly tossing her head around approaching the first turn, went along in the two-path and faded steadily. BONHEUR was no factor
inside. MISS MORENO raced three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. FIRST GOLD prompted LADY CLOVERLY from outside, and was finished
after six furlongs. LA RUSIA was urged along widest up the backstretch and into the far turn, and had no response.

TONE FEELIN set the pace along the rail, drew off nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and held well clear under steady
left-handed urging. KHOZANDO raced off the pace three wide and was along late for the place. THE ICE BEAST prompted the winner two wide, dropped
back under a drive around the turn and continued to fade in the lane. BIG FRANK failed to menace while racing four wide. BLACK V. K. chased the pace
inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
RED WIND saved ground close up to the far turn, found a seam in the two-path and cruised past KICK OUT THE JAMS from outside on her own courage
nearing the quarter-pole, was roused to open a bigger lead through upper stretch, jumped back to her left lead with a sixteenth to go and was kept to a
drive. KARENVILLE went along in range two wide to the stretch, rallied past KICK OUT THE JAMS into second leaving the furlong grounds but did not
menace the winner. KICK OUT THE JAMS set the pace inside, was powerless to resist the winner midway on the far turn, and weakened through the lane
while able to secure the show. BLAZINONBAYOU was well out of it for six furlongs near the two-path, and passed tired horses for the last major share.
JASIRA was no factor inside. BLUE EYE KITTEN was a step slow at the start, advanced three wide leaving the first turn, but was finished soon after going
six furlongs. BORDEAUX LEGACY pressed KICK OUT THE JAMS from outside, and faltered before reaching the stretch. INPENDING BREEZE was never
prominent. TOOLEGITTOQUIT broke a step slow, raced three to four wide on the turns, and dropped far back through the stretch. SHES SKY HIGH raced
two to three wide, and retired early.

Footnotes
AMERICAN OF COURSE was bumped at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and widened under moderate stretch urging. LEYENDA
broke outwardly and bumped the winner the start, launched a four wide move around the turn to reach a clear second turning for home, could not gain the
on the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best. HAPPY INTEREST chased the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally but outfinished a foe for the
show. QUEEN DOMINA had some speed inside, steadied nearing the five-eighths marker and again near the half-mile pole, chased two wide around the
turn and lacked a closing bid. SNACKSTER had early speed three wide and faded around the turn. YOU'RE THE BEST stumbled at the start and trailed
inside.

Footnotes
JESS'S STRIDE tracked the dueling leaders up the backstretch, edged closer around the turn three wide, took over outside TWICE TOO MANY once
straightened away for the drive and drew clear under steady pressure. STICKY ISSUE hit the left side of the gate at the start, moved closer around the turn
two then three wide, and rallied to overtake TWICE TOO MANY from outside for the place. TWICE TOO MANY vied outside NANTAN LUPAN early, moved
clear coming to the quarter-pole, could not handle JESS'S STRIDE through upper stretch, weakened and remained well clear for the show. PIYPA DE
LYNDA was outsprinted through the opening half-mile, and passed only tired horses. BIG RED STYLE raced three to four wide, and dropped back steadily
through the stretch. NANTAN LUPAN was outdueled inside TWICE TOO MANY before completing a half, and dropped far back. EDMUND FITZGERALD
was outrun three wide. SMALL JOHN broke poorly spotting the field several lengths, and was far back throughout.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S PRIDE broke in a bit and bumped CARIBOU CUB at the start, sped to the front, set a clear pace along the rail, opened up nearing the lane,
held clear to deep stretch then just lasted. TIGER BLOOD settled in range inside, angled three wide turning for home, made little progress in upper stretch,
surged late and just missed. YES I AM FREE stalked the winner two wide and was one-paced through the lane to hold third. CITRUS BURST raced four
wide in midpack and rallied belatedly. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE saved ground in midpack, stayed on but was outkicked for the minor awards. ROMARIO
lacked early speed, raced four wide and finished well outside. CARIBOU CLUB was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide between foes and
lacked a rally. ETE INDIEN was off a step slow, raced well back three wide to upper stretch and never threatened. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR was outrun
inside. BROTHER SATCHMO had brief speed three wide. NITRO TIME was fractious in the starting gate, raced two wide and was through early.

Footnotes
RICKI TICKI TAFFI stalked outside the early pacesetters, ranged up in the four-path coming off the turn, took over from outside through upper stretch and
drove clear on his left lead. STARSHIP TAXI drafted behind the leaders in the two-path through the turn, got steered to the rail coming to the top of the
stretch, loomed a threat briefly but settled for second best. SEA TRIDENT set the pace inside, drifted to the two-path turning for home, yielded to the winner
through upper stretch and was outfinished for the place. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO pressed SEA TRIDENT from outside to the top of the stretch, and
weakened staying on his left lead. ONE TURN JOHNNY was no factor four wide. POWER (BRZ) broke slowly and was outrun throughout. ANDREW THE
BULL showed little inside.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MATTERS prompted the pace two wide while fighting rating around the first turn, dueled outside down the backstretch, took over near the
three-eighths pole, drew clear around the far turn, dug in inside of PLENUM when that foe bid nearing the lane and held off a stretch long challenge from
that rival. PLENUM steadied entering the first turn and again late on that bend, was up close inside, angled three wide to advanced around the far turn, bid
outside of the winner near the quarter pole, fought on outside of that foe through the stretch but was denied. TIMMY M. settled off the pace while racing
three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. TIL THE END saved ground to no avail. DOMINATE
THEMOMENT raced well back two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, fanned five wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. MYSTERY
BANK steadied early, raced two and three wide and never threatened. ZERO GRAVITY was in range while racing two wide and faded through the lane.
WINTER'S WONDER was in tight early, saved ground and was never involved. SOUPER JAGUAR set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far
turn. QUINTO SOL trailed inside.
