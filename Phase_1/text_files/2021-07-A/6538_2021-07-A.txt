Footnotes
MY CANDY BIZ was rated along four wide, made a five wide move on the far turn to assume command passed the furlong marker, then held sway late to
prove best under left handed urging. MUHLENBERG was allowed to settle early, advanced five wide on the far turn, and closed well on the outside but too
late. EPIGRAMMATIST was five wide into the first turn, then prompted the pace four wide and weakened while staying on to best the rest. MAYNOOTH was
settled back early, then was five wide passed the quarter pole and came widest into the drive but offered no serious rally. GOLAZO set the pace while
racing off the rail and gave way. DAVID'S PROSPEC pressed the early pace three wide then tired.

Footnotes
RAPID RESPONSE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn dueling for command between rivals on the far turn, then gained a short
advantage nearing the quarter pole, then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. ANOTHER LULU prompted the early pace five wide, made a bid to
duel for command on the far turn but was outfinished by the winner while clearly second best. REDEEM PETER set a pressured pace entering the turn, then
dueled on the inside on the far turn, faded on the rail in the drive while holding on for the show award. GUNNER PAUL chased the early pace in between
horses, then was four wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally. GREGORIA'S BAY chased the early pace two wide, then was shuffled back on the turn,
eased off the inside and swung out six wide for the drive and showed some late interest. GALILEE chased the early pace in between rivals, then was three
wide by the quarter pole and faded. JUST PICK ONE chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. HARDBLAZE GRAY had a wide trip and was
eased in the stretch, walked off.

the drive, then angled out leaving the furlong grounds and closed the gap fast late. KIT KAT KATIE stalked the early pace five wide and made a four wide
bid on the far turn to duel for command, but flattened out in the final furlong, bested rest. TEQUILA FOG was allowed to settle early on the inside, then came
five wide into the drive to have a belated rally. AWESOME PAL chased the pace five wide and weakened. WEDONTBELIEVEHER was allowed to settle
early and was three wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally. INEDATEQUILA set a pressured pace from the inside and faltered.

MY FREEDOM stumbled at the start, then went up to stalk the pace five wide entering the backstretch, then made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole,
then prevailed late after a long drive. REMEMBER HYMN set an unchallenged pace and was headed around the furlong marker and was outfinished late.
JUNGLE BRIDE was well placed early and came four wide into the drive but lacked a late response while besting the rest. JAQUAVIOUS chased the pace
on the inside and weakened. MARCONIS stalked the pace four wide early and weakened. AUCHINCRUIVE was not a factor. GOLDEN GALLANT stumbled
badly at the start and lost the jockey, walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN ON THE TOTE BOARD CONCERNING THE START

HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC prompted the pace five wide early, then made a four wide bid on the turn to take over and was clear passed the quarter pole, then
widened the margin nearing the furlong marker then maintained that margin to the wire to prove best under a drive, pulled up on the clubhouse turn and was
vanned off. KING NEKIA chased the early pace and made a five bid on the turn but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. TATE chased the
early pace in between horses, came five wide into the drive, lugged in in the stretch and finished well to best the rest. FIZBO was well placed early in
between rivals then faded in the drive. JOHN THE BEAR chased the early pace in between rivals but offered no rally. BECAUSE I CAN set a pressured
pace while racing off the rail and weakened. GALE WINDS pressed the early pace on the inside then weakened. SARASOTA BOY checked after the start
then was not a factor. THIS RACE WAS RUN BEFORE POST DUE TO A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM THAT CAME IN, THE REPLAYS WERE ALSO
HARD TO SEE DUE TO HEAVY RAIN.

Footnotes
KABOD vied for the early lead three to four wide, made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then turned back another bid at the furlong marker and kicked clear
to prove best under a drive. DONTFORGETTOBLINK vied for the early lead towards the inside, then rated off the pace on the turn, then made a inside bid
entering the stretch but flattened out the final furlong. UNDER THE RADAR was allowed to settle early, then finished well on the inside. STORMY BONNIE
was off slowly, then came into the drive five wide while advancing but needed more late. TERP TOWN chased the early pace five wide and was seven wide
by the three sixteenths and had no rally. FIVE STAR PHIL was bumped at the start, then angled out leaving the half mile marker to make a five wide bid on
the turn, then lugged in when straightened and was empty while racing greenly.
