until mid stretch, weakened slightly late. WEEKENDER allowed to settle early, had a mild bid late. MAYNARD G. KREBS never far back, lacked a late
response and went evenly. THANKSDAD broke slowly, had brief foot, then gave way. OLIVER'S ODDS contended early and gave way in the lane. STONE

TIGER JO dueled on the lead for three quarters, shook clear in the stretch and widened late under firm handling. LATE FOR TAPS tracked three wide early,
rallied on the inside on the far turn, finished willingly on the rail but could not gain on the winner. VOL DE SOLEIL was a bit fractious in the post parade,
trailed early, rallied four on the far turn, finished well and was best of the rest. LUCKY SHORE tracked three wide and had no rally. AMARI S. dueled with
the winner for three quarters, then came up empty in the stretch. CHLOE RENE had good position on the inside, lacked a late response. NAUGHTY NELLIE
saved ground and was outrun. OUT OF POCKET never far back early, was through after a half.

Footnotes
MAXI MOON had good position early, rallied in the stretch three wide, closed determinedly and edged clear late under strong handling. DEVILISH TAIL
pressed early, dueled on the lead until late stretch, was outfinished late but was second best. CHEROKEE HAWK set the early pace and dueled on the
lead, weakened late. NINJA pressed the pace until the top of the stretch, then tired. HALABOUTTHAT had brief foot, then gave way. NEW YORK NIGHT
was no factor. HOPE FOR A STRIKE was no factor and galloped to the wire. SOUTHERN OAK was off slowly, took a bad step on the turn, was pulled up
and was vanned off.
