Footnotes
OAKMONT MAGIC set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the stretch and held under steady pressure. SUMMERFEST allowed to settle, eased to
position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. RUNAWAY STAR vied for the early lead on the
outside, bid outside the winner into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. MAGICSTICK mid pack, made a slight gain four wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly. COMMODORE BARRY allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and weakened. MCQUEEN'S BULLITT ran evenly the first half and weakened in the drive. CONCEALED CARRIER broke a step slowly at
the start, rushed up, gaining position three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. SHAENA BUE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals and had no rally. STORMBIRD'S SONG well placed in the early going, gave way.

room and closed well for the place. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) set the pace just off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened
late and held the show. JINGLE BELLS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and had a mild gain in the lane.
GRAY'S IMAGE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the stretch and evened out. OUT ONA LIMB well placed
and three wide, held position through the turn, then had no stretch rally. WHISPERING WIND mid pack, gained position three wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the lane and weakened in the stretch. SUPER STRIKE broke out, bumping a rival at the start, moved up quickly to stalk the early pace, then faded

broke awkwardly from the gate, gained position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. ODIN'S
HONOR well placed and three wide, angled in to the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out late. WHOOPS allowed to settle,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racomg room and closed for a share. BOARDWALK BOB
allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TESTIFIED set the pace on the
inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. SQUIRREL vied for the lead from between rivals, held position through
the turn, then had no rally. OBSESSION'S EMPIRE stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the turn. STARE DECISIS was never involved.

path into the lane, angled out and had a mild late gain. BUGLE BARRY well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid
three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. SEVILLE BARBER was no factor. UNCONQUERED SPIRIT rated close up, saved ground through the

Footnotes
SMOKY BLUES stalked the early pace on the outside, angled in and moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off
under steady pressure. RIDE INTO THE SKY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then could not threaten the winner
and held the place safe. SPICY SHOT well placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and had a mild
late gain. STATION ROCK allowed to settle, save ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled widest and had a mild late
gain. MR. MAGICO mid pack, looped up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed willingly. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO well
placed, held position four wide through the turn, bid on that path and weakened the final furlong. WAPITI WAY rated close up, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. LOWCOUNTRY ran evenly. KRAMMY BOY well placed, steadily lost ground. WILLY'S
CASTLE steadied along in the early going, was no factor. MUTAFAANY was no factor.

Footnotes
DAHOG allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain, drifted in late, dueled and edged
ahead in the final strides. SIGNS OF GREATNESS well placed and outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then
dueled late with the winner and was outfinished. DIXIE HIGHWAY mid pack, moved to position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
lacked the needed late kick. TALE OF KANTHAROS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
weakened late. I'M A COOL MAN vied for the early lead on the outside, lost some ground through the turn, then weakened in the drivve. SAVE THE
DRAMA hopped at the start, ran evenly for a half, then had no stretch rally. DEEP THINKER (IRE) set the early pace inside and faded through the turn.
