MISS YOU MOM was allowed to settle through the early going, was four wide on the second turn while mounting a rally, swung five wide into the drive to
circle the field, collared TAKES A VILLAGE inside of the furlong marker and drew away in the end. TAKES A VILLAGE settled off of the early pace, was
three wide on the second turn while gaining ground, led into the stretch but was caught inside of the eighth pole and could not hold the winner off while a
clear second over the rest. AVALON RIDE pressed the early pace, then led into the second turn while three wide, lost ground off of the turn and while tiring
in the stretch held on for third. PULPIT SINGER bobbled leaving the starting gate then was hustled to set the fractions through the backstretch, was
confronted nearing the second turn, was outrun on the second turn while two wide and tired in the stretch drive. FANTASTIC SECRET attended the early
pace, took the lead on the second turn while two wide but was outrun off of the turn and gave out in the stretch.

Footnotes
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS broke on top and was hustled to set the fractions through the turn, extended the lead off of the turn, drew clear in the stretch and
was geared down in the final yards. PHANTOM DROP settled toward the rear of the field through the turn while three wide and rallied in the stretch to get
second, but was not challenging the winner. BOURBONWITHATWIST chased the pacesetter through the turn while two wide, was outrun by the winner on
the turn and into the lane but held on late for third. TIME IS GONE had no speed early, saved ground on the turn while two wide and rallied in the stretch,
just missing for third. THELUTEISMINE chased the pace through the turn while three wide, lost ground off of the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run.
MY FATHER FOOTSTEP chased the pace while four wide, lost ground off of the turn and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
R M C HOOK'EM sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, angled out in the drive, pressured SILENT MOVIES in the final sixteenth and had
a late push to get by that rival to prevail. SILENT MOVIES stalked the pace through the turn, was five wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn, led into
the final sixteenth but was caught by the winner while besting the rest. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO dueled on the front end with HONEYMOONZ OVER through
the turn, was four wide on the turn, led into the stretch but tired in the drive while an easy third over the rest. ENGRAM had no speed early, was three wide
on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly and set a contested pace through the turn while three wide and
weakened in the stretch drive.
