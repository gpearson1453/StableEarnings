UNCLE BUDDY sped tp the lead at the start, remained on top by a slim margin around the turn, saved ground into the lane, widened to a clear advantage
under left handed pressure in the upper stretch and stayed sharp. LADY G raced in range through opening stages, hustled up three wide around the turn
then sustained a steady bid in the lane and secured second best. JO JO HANS raced in contention along the rail, angled out but lacked a clear outside path
at the five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside into the stretch run and churned on for a share. HOLY LORD chased two wide up close in opening stages,
remained in aim around the turn then gave way. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER raced in the back, went four wide into the lane and had no response.

steady outside bid under pressure and got up late. WARLEGGAN was allowed to settle through early stages, picked up the pace late on the far turn, was
ridden along three wide into the upper stretch, tipped out a path wider, finished game between foes and just missed. INDIGESTION stalked the pacesetter
through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, raced in aim for the lead at the eighth pole, stayed on with response and got edged
out in final strides. DENNIS' DIAMOND set the pace through the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the far turn, vied for the lead in the stretch run
then yielded nearing the wire. QUENCH MY THIRST rated off the clear top trio through early stages, given cue along the rail on the final turn, failed to move
on and steadily faded. BUSTIN THE BANK raced in the back then wide into the lane and had no response.

MY DEVILS CHILD was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked through the backstretch then hustled up around the far turn, was ridden along three to
four wide into the lane, roused forward to engage ROLLING PALASADES for the lead in the final furlong, dug in under firm handling and edged away.
ROLLING PALISADES held a slim lead around the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch, turned back the bid from ALL TACKED UP at the quarter
pole, stayed on gamely, dueled with MY DEVILS CHILD in the final sixteenth then had no final kick left in reserve. SHOWER THE PEOPLE was well
reserved racing in the back, shifted out wide in the drive, responded under pressure and gained show. ALL TACKED UP was forwardly placed around the
first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a bid at the quarter pole, failed to advance on the leader then gave way. LONG TOM raced
three wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, was ridden along two to three wide into the lane and never threatened.

response when called upon in the far turn. YOU CANT CATCH HER was forwardly placed around the first turn, tracked the top two leaders in early stages
then dropped back.
