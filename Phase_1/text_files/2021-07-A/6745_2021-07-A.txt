Footnotes
CHASING ARTIE was in a bit tight on the rail leaving the chute, vied inside for the lead, tracked on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch, finished willingly
and gamely prevailed. MOMOS vied two wide for the early lead, briefly shook free on the turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane, finished well
but needed a bit more. ARZAK steadied at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the lane, closed well outside and
surged late to get third. IT CAN BE DONE stalked three wide early, then tracked inside, raced behind horses turning for home, rallied on the rail past
midstretch and just missed for third. SMOKIN' JAY raced off the pace between rivals, rallied four wide entering the stretch, bid and was outkicked. MAMBA
ON THREE stalked four wide early, bid three wide on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch and was outkicked. FAUCI raced off the rail, off the pace,
went three and four wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and tired.
