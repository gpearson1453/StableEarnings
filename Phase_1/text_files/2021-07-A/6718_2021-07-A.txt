Footnotes
DANG IT CASSIE was kept close from inside, fanned out some into the lane, gained a clear path upper stretch, rallied to gain the advantage inside the last
furlong and kept W W KAN DO at bay under steady handling. W W KAN DO a bit awkward at the start, quickly recovered to share the lead from outside,
moved ahead two wide on the bend, drifted out slightly upper stretch, was all out the rest of the way and proved clearly second best. TIZ APPROVED was
sent to dispute the pace from inside, did not stay with W W KAN DO leaving the turn and gradually flattened out along the rail the final furlong. PERFECT
PIRATE chased running widest of all and failed to menace. MAXXIMUM ENERGY broke with the pack but was soon well back and gradually closed the gap
in a ground-saving trip without threatening.

Footnotes
FAST ONE shared the lead outside HE HAS NO FRIENDS from the beginning, fought through the lane, edged ahead inside the last eighth, drifted out after
entering the final sixteenth but held on under steady handling. BONNIE DANCES settled off the early leaders, picked up his pace from path three on the
bend, drifted out further into the stretch, gradually closed the gap the last eighth but came up a bit short. EUGENE settled inside the first half mile, angled
out to path three upper stretch, rallied, altered out abruptly with seventy yards to go when FAST ONE took his path, continued to close on the latter but was
too late. HE HAS NO FRIENDS shared the lead from inside, battled in the stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. STRATUS STORM
settled at the back, stayed off the inside taking the bend, made a strong move in the lane, angled in inside the last eighth trying to gain a better racing path
and found best stride too late. SHINPURUNA void of speed, though hustled along between rivals in the early going, steadily faded from along the rail once
on the turn.

ATTACK was sent to gain the early lead, challenged from outside on the backstretch and began to yield before finishing six furlongs. CARSON RESERVE

Footnotes
BOWS N LACE forwardly placed between rivals, went for the lead outside ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE on the second bend, edged ahead in the lane, lugged
in some and bumped with the latter at the seventy yard marker and held on. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE moved ahead from between horses on the
backstretch, gained the rail into the second turn, was challenged from outside, fought gamely through the stretch, drifted a slightly as BOWS N LACE came
in, bumped with the latter and had to settle for being easily second best. THE MORE I BURN prompted the pace from between rivals, dropped back to third
from along the rail on the second turn then could only just hold her position through the stretch. BIG LUCK forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch,
was just of the inside on the second bend, floated out some for the stretch run and flattened out. LITTLE MOLITTA displayed early speed from inside, did
not keep up on the backstretch, angled out some on the second turn and had no late bid. LADY OF LAHTI stayed off the inside throughout and showed
little. UNIVERSIADE chased from inside while urged along on the backstretch, began to fade after a half mile, angled out midway on the second bend,
drifted out entering the lane and continued to yield.

Footnotes
TOTALLY DOVISH broke inward slightly and lugged in some leaving the chute, was straightened and hustled up to share the lead inside PALAGO midway
on the backstretch, moved clear on the bend, lengthened command under a drive upper stretch, was kept to urging and held sway. RONAN was soon well
back, picked up her pace into the second turn, lost ground fanning widest entering the lane, made a strong move, was too late but caught PALAGO for
second late. PALAGO also broke inward slightly, displayed early speed just off the inside, did not stay with TOTALLY DOVISH on the bend, floated out
some into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. DIAMOND GUCCI progressed along the rail on the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch, leveled
off in the late going but was easily best of the others. CHARLO raced in contention from outside for a half mile, came four wide into the stretch and flattened.
DIAMONDS AND BOOTS reluctant to load, was an early factor just inside CHARLO once the race began but gave way two wide on the bend. RANGOON
ATTACK soon trailed, saved ground taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
COME ON DOVER shared the early lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused with two furlongs to go and maintained full control
under a drive through the stretch. BEL BIMBO commenced his bid from outside into the bend, took over second nearing the quarter pole, was all out in the
lane, was all out but lacked the extra needed the final furlong and narrowly held the place. COOL AMBITION was settled inside, commenced his bid after
two furlongs, progressed along the rail under a drive on the bend, came off the inside some for a clear path upper stretch, closed well, was too late but
easily best of the rest. SACRA HOXEN contested the pace outside AGGRO CRAG (IRE) on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, floated out some
into the stretch and gave way. B SALTY raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch, retreated into the bend, swung out widest on the turn and
had no stretch bid. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) displayed early speed between rivals but began to fade with three furlongs to go.
