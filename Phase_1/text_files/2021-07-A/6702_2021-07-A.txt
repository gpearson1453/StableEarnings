FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled toward the rear of the field, steadied on the backstretch nearing the five-eighths marker when in tight quarters, was three wide
on the second turn, slipped to the rail for the stretch drive, took the lead and kicked clear in the end. HYDROGEN stalked the fractions by KING EDDIE
through the second turn, pressured the pacesetter on the turn but was outrun off the turn by the winner, tired in the stretch drive but saved second. SIX
POINT RACK was allowed to settle in the early stages, mounted a bid on the second turn while four then five wide but was outfinished in the stretch, just
missing for second. KING EDDIE set all of the pace, was two wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run, just missing for third. TOUGH IT
OUT tracked the pace through the backstretch, lost ground on the second turn while three wide and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
GALLANT GUY set the pace through the second turn while three wide, was confronted off of the turn by FALSELY ACCUSED but determinedly dug in and
kept that rival at bay to prevail. FALSELY ACCUSED sat just off of the winner's pace through the second turn, was three wide on the second turn,
challenged the winner coming off of the turn and could not reel that one in but was a clear second over the rest. J T'S WATCH settled at the rear of the field,
was five then six wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch but was outfinished and drifted out in the final sixteenth. STALKING SHADOW
stalked the pace through the second turn, was five wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. BERNALINHO was unhurried in the early
stages, was two wide on the second turn and did not offer a rally in the stretch run.

WHERE'S FRANKIE contested the early pace with MOON ROCKET, was confronted by the runner-up off of the turn and dueled with that one through the
length of the stretch, found a bit more than her rival and prevailed in the end. THRILL'S LEGACY was hustled to contest the pace just after the half-mile
marker, was four wide on the turn, took a short lead into the lane, dueled with the winner through the length of the stretch while running on the left lead and
could not close the margin while besting the rest. MOON ROCKET broke on top and contested the early pace with the winner, was two wide on the turn
while disputing the pace but lost ground off of the turn and tired in the stretch drive. AROUSE N GO chased the pace while three wide and did not mount a
late rally. CHARGING HOME gained ground on the run into the turn, was two wide on the turn but weakened in the stretch drive. IT'S BIG AINE had no
speed early, was two wide on the turn and trailed throughout.
