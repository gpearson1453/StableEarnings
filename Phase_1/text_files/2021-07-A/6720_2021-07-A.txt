Footnotes
ETHOS vied inside FORTY FLASH early, took over on the far turn and drew away under pressure. HE AIN'T NO SAINT bumped with LORD DARNLEY at
the start, saved ground for six furlongs, moved to the two-path turning for home, and was up outside WARP SPEED BABY for the place. WARP SPEED
BABY bumped with COLONEL JACKSON at the start, hugged the rail on the turns, was under a drive trying in vain to menace ETHOS outside the
quarter-pole, and weakened through the late stages. LORD DARNLEY bumped with HE AIN'T NO SAINT at the start, was briefly in a bit tight between
horses entering the first turn, stayed in the two-path and lacked a rally. COLONEL JACKSON bumped with WARP SPEED BABY at the start, lagged well
back for six furlongs and passed only tired horses. JOYFUL SURPRISE was finished after a half-mile. JARLIAN was four wide into the first turn and never
reached contention. FORTY FLASH vied outside ETHOS to early on the far turn and gave way. TRUE IDENTITY was always outrun. TINTORERO broke
outward and was last away, went to the first turn in the five-path, and stopped after a half.

YES I'M A BEAST settled off the early pace four wide, moved three wide nearing the lane, closed steadily outside and was up in deep stretch. SKIPPERINI
bumped with RUN LEA RUN at the start, dueled outside of that foe to midstretch, drove clear leaving the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. PORK
CHOP lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, shifted into the six path in upper stretch and rallied for the show. EL FANTASMA failed to
menace while racing two wide. RUN LEA RUN was bumped at the start but still away fastest, dueled inside of SKIPPERINI to upper stretch and tired.
MEKANO had early speed three wide, could not keep pace around the turn, angled in near the five-sixteenths and retreated. MIDNIGHT ALIBI was outrun

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON was widest of a foursome scrimmaging up front early, edged away coming to the quarter-pole shifting in a couple paths, and widened
through the stretch under a drive. CAPTURE THE GENIE bumped solidly with BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY shortly after the start and paused losing some
momentum, saved ground entering the turn, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied through between horses late for the place. LA DAME
settled off the leaders near the two-path into the turn, moved out four wide at the top of the lane, and rallied on the far outside for a share. BAHAMIAN
RHAPSODY bumped solidly with CAPTURE THE GENIE a few strides from the gate, saved ground behind the leaders on the turn, rallied on the fence
through upper stretch, then weakened and was outfinished for larger shares. ONE SLICK FACT broke a step slowly, and failed to menace inside. LADY
NOY contested the early pace three wide between horses, and tired after three furlongs. MISS LAMARR argued the pace inside a trio of rivals, and gave

YEARS AGO stalked the pace inside, got through a narrow opening inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, took over near the eighth pole and drove clear.
SOUL FLIGHT pressed the pace in the three path, vied outside of foes through the lane and settled for second late. LULI'S DANCER set the pace in the two
path, continued on the left lead in the lane, vied between to the sixteenth marker and weakened. UNCAPTURED GRACE lunged at the start, raced two to
three wide and never threatened. ALRIGHT ALREADY chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. TEA'S DREAM was outrun while racing three wide.
BRINGTHEWINE played no factor while racing two wide. MALIBU SKY hesitated at the start and trailed inside.

STARRY HOPE was unhurried early inside, moved out beginning to pick it up midway on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, reached the front
outside INDEPENDENCE LAW past the furlong marker and drove clear. INDEPENDENCE LAW bumped with BRODY'S HONOR and steadied first time
through the stretch, crept closer three wide after six furlongs, reached a short lead coming off the far turn, but could not withstand the winner into the last
eighth of a mile. BRODY'S HONOR bumped with INDEPENDENCE LAW first time through the lane, saved ground for six furlongs in striking range, bid in
the two-path turning for home but was outfinished while best of the remainder. ODALEA raced three wide early at the back, moved inside before reaching
the far turn, and went by faders for the last major share. MISS WROTE set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way into the stretch.
THEUNCAPTUREDLADY was four wide into the first turn, and could not reach contention. BROADWAY PEGGY pursued the early pacesetter from outside,
and tired after six furlongs. STREET EXCHANGE chased three wide early, and was through soon after completing a half-mile.

COMPETITIVE SPEED was off a step slow, saved ground off the early pace, angled three wide early on the turn, advanced inside of COACH JER'S JOY
around the bend, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over between foes near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. COACH JER'S JOY
lacked early speed outside, raced four wide around the turn, closed outside of the winner but was outkicked by that foe. RESTOFTHESTORY hopped at the
start then was shut off, advanced outside to clear near the five-eighths pole, angled in to set the pace along the rail around the turn, vied to the sixteenth
pole and held well to preserve the show. SHEA D SUMMER had her head turned and the start and broke in the air, advanced three wide around the turn,
put a head in front between foes in midstretch and weakened late. PRINCESS SECRET stalked the pace two wide, was on heels in upper stretch and
lacked any response once clear. EMUNAH led early, re-bid two wide near the three-eighths pole but tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
DESERT RULER pressed AKINGISALWAYSKING from outside early, took over after three-eighths of a mile, dug in as HEY HIGH POCKETS challenged to
his outside turning for home, drifted out steadily through the stretch and held stubbornly for the decision. HEY HIGH POCKETS was urged along to stay
close three wide on the turn, loomed outside DESERT RULER at the top of the stretch, had aim through a long drive but could not get by while drifting out.
CLOUD PLAY raced in range two wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing response. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING broke slowly, swung four wide
approaching the stretch, and could not gain late outside. KUHL STAR angled inside while being urged along going to the turn, moved back out five wide
near the three-sixteenths, and had no response. GRABBING THE MONEY hit the left side of the gate spotting the field three lengths or so at the break, and
was outrun near the inside. AKINGISALWAYSKING set the early pace hounded by DESERT RULER, yielded to that one on the turn, and drifted out tiring
through the stretch. CUPID'S DUDE bobbled shortly after the start, and was always far back. SOULFUL SONG was outrun four to five wide, and dropped
far back through the stretch.

Footnotes
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE stalked the pace inside, tipped three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, seized command in upper stretch, drove clear in
midstretch and held on under a drive. LYRICAL settled off the pace along the inside, closed along the rail but could not get by the winner late. AUDREY was
devoid of speed, raced four wide around the turn and rallied outside to gain the show. VELVET ISLE raced off the early pace three wide, was in some traffic
between foes late on the turn, ran up on heels and checked in upper stretch, swung out near the eighth pole and finished with interest down the center of
the track. QUEEN ABARRIO saved ground and failed to menace. GRAN MICHELLE pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch and tired. NENITA set a
pressured pace inside and faltered in the final furlong. STRUTTIN had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
LIGHT FURY was keyed up tossing his head going to the first turn, moved inside and settled down tracking from close range up the backstretch, was briefly
hemmed in midway on the far turn, found a seam and was guided out to go after KROY near the quarter-pole, wrested command through midstretch and
edged away. KROY broke on top, rated along on the lead inside to the stretch, got headed with a furlong remaining, then dug in to save the place inside
rivals. SEVEN CHANNELS saved ground in midpack early, took closer order three wide after six furlongs, rallied mildly through the lane and just missed
second. FEAR THE DEER hugged the rail around the turns, had the two-path through the stretch, and could not be fully set down in between horses and
directly behind the winner through the closing yards. LAHINCH lagged well back for six furlongs, cut the corner advancing into upper stretch, then finished
up evenly on the rail. MR TITO'S was two wide early, moved further out in the course around the far turn, and could not gain. SURPRISE FACTOR
prompted KROY from outside ti midway on the far turn, and gave way. NIXON JOY (ARG) made no impact two wide.

Footnotes
BERHANU set a pressured pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and held clear under a drive. JR
SPEED pressed the pace two wide between foes, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on well to be a clear second.
CURRENT HOPE had some early speed between foes, steadied near the five-eighths pole, advanced four wide around the far turn, lacked the needed
stretch rally but was up for the show in the final strides. FOSTER HOPE prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. GEGE CONQUEST was
outrun inside. COTTON JIM had early speed between foes, chased three wide around most of the turn, angled in near the quarter pole and had no
response. FITZ'S MO played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
FRENCHMEN STREET pursued the leaders three wide from the outset, stayed on task with a determined finish and was up outside MALRAUX near the
wire. MALRAUX vied inside LONG BLADE from the start, lost the advantage a quarter-mile out, battled back to regain command from that rival in upper
stretch, drifted out under left-hand pressure and was nailed in the final yards. REAGAN'S HEART broke slowly, lagged well back two to three wide to the
end of the turn, fanned widest for the drive and found his best stride belatedly. GRAN MALBEC was outsprinted two then three wide to the stretch, stayed
on his left lead through the lane and gained only mildly. KOBE FIFTY TWO stayed in range to the stretch two wide, and had no final response. MOON
PISTOL saved ground to no avail. LONG BLADE argued the pace outside MALRAUX to upper stretch, and weakened. APACHE BRAVE lunged slightly at
the break, and was outrun three to four wide. TAAMER steadied inside entering the turn at the back, and remained in arrears.

PAPETU settled off the early pace outside, cruised up three wide around the turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under left-handed
urging. REAL TALK stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes late on the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to midstretch but was no match for
the winner late. MOONLITE STRIKE set a clear pace inside, was collared near the quarter pole then fought on inside through the lane to preserve the show.
AWESOME GERRY broke outwardly and bumped at the start, raced off the pace four and five wide and finished with some interest. TWELVE VOLT MAN
saved ground and failed to menace. LAUDA SPEED veered in and bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. BIG
THORN was pinched back at the start, raced two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
PALEMMA saved ground advancing midway on the far turn, shifted to the two-path to challenge outside ROYAL WAR leaving the quarter-pole, poked a
head in front through midstretch, and prevailed after a stiff drive. ROYAL WAR vied inside LIL CROWN to the end of the backstretch, shook away on the far
turn, dug in when confronted by PALEMMA into the stretch, and battled gamely to the finish. HONESTO was slow into stride, raced near the inside on the
turns, advanced after six furlongs, and gained mildly on the rail through the last eighth of a mile. UNIMPEACHED tracked the pacesetters two to three wide,
and lacked the needed closing bid. CHINA BEACH went along in midpack early, raced three to four wide around the far turn, and finished one-paced
outside. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES became fractious during the loading process unseating the rider, came away in good order but was caught four wide to the
first turn, and posed no threat. CARSON AND I steadied behind ADMIRAL TRUFFLES soon after the start, and was outrun inside. MULSANNE RUN broke
slowly and was always far back. WROTE IN STONE bumped with LIL CROWN at the start, and made no impact two to three wide. LIL CROWN bumped
with WROTE IN STONE at the start, was hustled along contesting the pace in the five-path around the first turn, and was finished on the far turn.
