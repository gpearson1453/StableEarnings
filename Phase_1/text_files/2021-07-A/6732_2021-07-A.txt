Footnotes
QUIET DRAMA came in and bumped FUDGE BROWNIE in the opening strides, led past the three quarters, set the pace the rest of the way down the back
straight and while saving ground around the turn, began to open up when hand ridden into the stretch, and cleared further under a mild late drive.
PRINCESS TINE (FR) settled at the rear four wide down the backstretch, dropped to the inside near the half, saved ground while pushed along on the turn,
rallied to second position into the lane, could not threaten the leader but chased on second best. FUDGE BROWNIE was bumped by QUIET DRAMA in the
opening strides, raced in the rear flight with PRINCESS TINE early, improved to track the leader inside of SHE'S WANDAFUL from near the five eighths,
chased the leader between horses on the turn, was driven between horses into the lane, lacked the needed kick, and drifted out late. SHE'S WANDAFUL
broke sharply, tracked QUIET DRAMA from the three quarters, continued to chase the leader three wide around the turn, was driven three wide into the
lane, mustered no rally and was carried out in the lane as FUDGE BROWNIE drifted out.

STORMINSIDE stumbled slightly leaving the gate, was immediately urged to the lead up the rail, took over while saving ground around the far turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and was kept to task to the wire. NYOMAN was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, raced inside at the back of the pack up the
backstretch, began a bid while saving ground passing the three eighths pole, and chased the winner home, gaining ground steadily from the rail down the
lane. SOUTHSIDER broke quickly, dueled for the lead on the outside in the early going, chased the leader from the two path around the turn, and was
outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. ROAD GAME raced outside at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn
from the two path, made some mid gain in upper stretch and flattened out late. MAGI was taken hold of early and switched to an outside lane to find racing
room, began to drop back while racing in the two and three path around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and made no bid.

HANNITY was bumped by LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, continued toward
the rear inside of SHOBIZ STAR past the seven eighths, chased toward the rear down the backstretch, launched a bid from the half, improved inside of
horses, switched out to the three path past the three eighths to engage outside of DRIVER DAN, dueled outside that foe from the five sixteenths to the
sixteenth, took a narrow lead from there and prevailed gamely. DRIVER DAN was reluctant to load, settled well on the pace, raced in the two path on the far
turn, was engaged by HANNITY approaching the five sixteenths, dueled inside of that foe from the five sixteenths to the sixteenth mark, reluctantly ceded a
narrow lead from there but continued gamely to the wire. PLEASANT MOON tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, continued to track in range
inside of SHOBIZ STAR down the backstretch, chased in the five path on the turn, angled in near the five sixteenths, was driven into the lane in the two
path, and lacked the needed rally. SHOBIZ STAR tossed his head at the break, raced three wide with the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, raced two wide
near the rear from the seven eighths, inched forward to join outside of PLEASANT MOON to track the leader from the three quarters, briefly encroached
outside of DRIVER DAN approaching the half, tracked in the four path on the turn, came into the lane in the three to four path and proved empty.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS broke inward and bumped HANNITY in the opening strides, raced between horses in the rear flight into the clubhouse turn,
settled back to the rear near the seven eighths, continued at the rear down the backstretch and in the five path on the far turn, and offered no bid.

UPSIDE DOWN dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch, pulled clear
with a furlong to go and won under a drive. MISS Z dueled for the lead on the far outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, gave
way with a furlong to go and chased the winner home. NIFF raced off the pace early, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole,
and gained ground mildly in the stretch while drifting late. SIMPLY COMPLICATED veered in leaving the gate, eventually settled to trail the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid from the rail approaching the quarter pole and was no match from there. ANGIE'S REVRAC
chased the leaders through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to fade in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEE HAPPY ATTACK was sent for speed, set the pace while attended by MOON FLASH to her outside, saved ground through the turn, began to open up
past the quarter before being asked, and retained a clear advantage under a hand ride from the three sixteenths. LAST SPRING broke inward, chased
midpack down the backstretch and in the two path around most of the turn, was taken out near the five sixteenths, raced three wide into the lane, floated out
further in upper stretch, rallied to secure the place a sixteenth of a mile out but could not get to the winner. MACHO CLASSIC tracked the leading pair down
the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, proved no match for the leader from the top of the stretch, chased on inside
but lost the place with a sixteenth of a mile remaining. MOON FLASH stalked the pace outside of BEE HAPPY ATTACK down the backstretch and through
the turn, was driven approaching the quarter, could not keep up with BEE HAPPY ATTACK into the lane, and weakened. HALF COCKED settled near the
rear, raced at the rear of the main group in the three to four path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane and carried further out by LAST SPRING in
upper stretch, and weakened. CLEAR TO CLOSE soon trailed, saved ground through the turn, and offered no rally in the lane.

RICHIES GREAT GIRL chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid between horses in the two path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled on the outside in upper stretch, and wore down her rival to pull clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. AIKEN TO BE dueled for the lead on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, showed the way while saving ground around the turn, battled gamely in upper stretch and gave way in the final
furlong, the best of the rest. SISTER RULER stumbled slightly and was bumped by the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead
on the outside early, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and was outkicked further in the stretch. MOON OF LOVE (IRE)
bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and came up
empty.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES was bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled at the rear, was pushed into the turn, improved in the five path from
the three eighths, came into the lane four wide under a drive, sustained his rally, rolled to the lead at the furlong mark and drove clear. GET HAMMERED
was urged for speed inside, took the lead inside of D'FEVER past the eleven sixteenths, set the pace inside while pressured by D'FEVER, cleared past the
quarter mile mark, had no answer when passed by READTHECLIFFNOTES at the furlong mark but chased on a clear second. ARRIVAL settled near the
rear inside of READTHECLIFFNOTES, saved ground with the rear group through the turn and into the lane, proved no match for the top two but found
enough late to hold for show. CITY DRIFTER broke in and bumped READTHECLIFFNOTES in the opening strides, chased well off the leading pair down
the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, began to draw closer to the leaders past the three eighths, raced three wide into the lane, went to a drive in
upper stretch but lacked the needed kick. D'FEVER broke out and bumped READTHECLIFFNOTES in the opening strides, led to the eleven sixteenths,
pressed outside of GET HAMMERED once that foe took the lead inside him, continued to press two wide to the quarter pole and then emptied out between
horses.

HIGH SPIRITS was blocked leaving the gate, angled over sharply to save ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
began a move from the four path nearing the three eighths pole, and gained ground steadily on the outside in late stretch to get up in time. PISTOL BOX
raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path, began an outside bid
