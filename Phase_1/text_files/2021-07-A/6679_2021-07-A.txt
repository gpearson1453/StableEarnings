Footnotes
LANDONS CONGO was well rated along the inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, awaited room in the stretch, split rivals passed the sixteenths pole, got
up in time to win the head bob, driving. AIRLINE DRIVE was well rated early, then was between horses on the turn and by the quarter pole, swung out five
wide for racing room to make bid, hit the front in the furlong grounds but was caught at the wire to just miss, lost head bob. JEWEL STREET was reserved
early, advanced five wide passed the quarter pole, came six wide into the stretch and rallied well. KEEP THE BLING pressed the early pace three wide,
then vied for command between horses, made a bid nearing the furlong marker, then faded late. JAIME'S LIL FEAR tracked the early pace four wide, then
vied for the lead three wide and faded the final furlong. GLITTER BRIGHT was settled back early, came four wide into the drive and showed some late
interest but lacked a serious rally. WHIPUM NAENAE vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. ITS MY MONEY TOO chased the early
pace four wide, then moved up three wide on the turn but was empty in the drive.

settle early and advanced on the inside approaching the three eighths pole, then eased out and made a three wide bid on the dueling leaders, went on even
terms with the winner nearing the furlong marker but flattened out late, held place award. RAMAAH was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far
turn, then eased out leaving the five sixteenths pole and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but hung late. HUNK OF A HIT was settled back early, then
was six wide passed the quarter pole while advancing, then offered a belated rally. RADIANT KITTEN dueled for the lead and was roused passed the five
sixteenths and weakened. ISTAN WARRIOR failed to menace. GUMBO was well placed three wide and tired. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY chased the early pace

Footnotes
POPEYES HEART set the pace from the inside and was well handled on the front end, then shook clear passed the furlong marker and held sway late to
prove best under strong right handed encouragement. HORSE DADDY was allowed to settle early on the inside, then advanced on the inside on the turn,
angled out nearing the three sixteenths pole and closed well. BEYOND HELLO stumbled at the start, recovered quickly to be well placed on the inside, but
lacked the needed stretch bid while besting the rest. CHROME KING stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the
drive. HERN was wide into the first turn when not cornering well, then chased the pace five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn and
weakened. DARE TO BE WILD was a bit rank on the first turn, then raced wide on the backstretch and made a five wide move on the turn and weakened.
MALIBU THUNDER broke awkwardly then raced wide and was no threat.

DIXIE CARROUSEL was allowed to settle early, then made a inside bid leaving the turn, angled off the inside passed the sixteenths pole, and got up in time
under a drive. TEXAS MAMA dueled for the early lead and made a inside bid leaving the turn to shake clear, but was caught late. DANCIN ALL ALONE was
allowed to settle early, then came three wide into the drive and angled out late to rally well late. STORM TRAFFIC was settled back early, then came into
the stretch three wide, angled in by the sixteenths pole and finished well on the inside. GRANNY JEWELL chased the early pace four wide, then made a
mild three wide bid passed the quarter pole and flattened out. THATSALOTOFBLING rushed up to duel for the lead three wide to the top of the stretch and
weakened. MISS YACHTY showed little.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MADE angled out on the first turn, then was reserved while five wide on the backstretch, made a decisive five wide move on the far turn, then
continued that move in the stretch to edge away late under a drive. GOLD VERMILION was rated along four wide down the backstretch, then made a three
wide move on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn, but could not go with the winner late while second best. REMEMBER ME TONY chased the pace on
the inside, then had to checked around the five sixteenths, then swung out four wide fro the drive to have a mild late rally. MISTER STRANGE was allowed
to settle early and came five wide into the drive to have a belated rally. TRUE GLORY chased the pace five wide down the backstretch, then made a four
wide bid on the turn and passed the quarter pole but came up empty. PATRIOT'S WAR was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally while racing evenly.
RESOLVE NOW was allowed to settle on the inside, had to checked around the five sixteenths pole and had no rally. SHAKE IT was void of early speed,
swung out wide for the drive and had no rally. FIRST BUMP RIDGE failed to menace. FLAT OUT AVENGER was not a threat. BERN BAN stalked the pace
three wide and tired. CURLINS CAPO set the pace from the inside and stopped.

sixteenths and gained a short advantage by the furlong marker but was outfinished. MR B QUIET was rated off the duel early, then made a five bid passed
the quarter pole but needed more late. CONSIDERIT DONERON dueled for the early lead in between rivals, then was shuffled back on the turn, then came
again to pass the tiring rivals. SHANGHAI SILVER was off slowly, then offered a belated rally. KOOFI chased the pace five wide and weakened. BIRCH

early lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn but could not hold off the winner late while second best. GOLD CAPO vied for the early lead three wide,
then dueled two wide on the turn and faded, bested rest. ALWAYS ON THE RUN was reserved early and came into the drive five wide to pass the tiring

came into the drive four wide but had no rally. OOBY DOOBY stalked the pace four wide and weakened. SIR JASPER vied for the early lead in between
