Footnotes
HOWIZEE was away alertly and quickly made the lead, repulsed a bid on turn, widened in the stretch under a hand ride to win going away. KOJO'S QUEEN
was allowed to settle early, rallied three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but held place. SONG AND A KISS had good position throughout,
could not challenge the winner and just missed place. TIN CAN ALLIE pressed the winner until the quarter pole, gave way in the stretch and bled from both
nostrils. NEW BLUE CAT was hard to load and trailed.

settle, failed to menace. HEAVENLY MINE was bumped at the start and was no threat. QUEEN CITY KITTY was no factor. STAR'S THALIA raced close up

Footnotes
MAKESCENTSTOUS was well placed on the inside, awaited room at the top of the stretch, split horses and gained the lead after the eighth pole, lasted late
under strong handling PRINCESS ATHENA was never far back, raced four wide on the turn, finished well and was getting to the winner. POLO PLAYER
dueled on the lead until mid stretch, weakened late. UNUNDERSTANDABLE raced mid pack and went evenly. UNTIL NOW broke sharply and quickly made
the lead, gradually weakened and bounced around in the the final furlong while tiring. CHARGE IT ALL was well placed, and saved ground, did not threaten
late. TRUST IN ME was outrun.
