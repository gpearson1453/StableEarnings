Footnotes
CELEBRATORY moved up to prominence early, led into the turn, drew away, set the pace to the stretch then widened under light handling and finished
under a hand ride. SANDY BAY raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining quickly.
CHECKERBOARD FLOOR held a narrow lead, was joined late backstretch and headed quickly, chased two-wide on the turn but evened out in the late
stages. MR. DIFFLEY raced in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and was all out to the wire. PRINCE OF
THIEVES was off the early pace, closed a bit two and three-wide on the turn, finished gamely inside rivals in the stretch but was unable to gain. VICTOR'S
DYNASTY moved up quickly to force the pace, launched a bid late backstretch but was quickly headed, chased three-wide through the turn then flattened
out in mid stretch.

the break and settled off the pace, raced along the rail then rallied between rivals in the stretch. DESERT EAGLE stalked the pace, was hustled hard two
and three-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch but did not menace. TAPE TO TAPE pressed the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn then

Footnotes
ROMANTIC GAMBLE broke on top and allowed a pair of rivals the front, moved up two to four wide turning for home and engaged the pace survivor inside
the eighth pole, driving past that one by the sixteenth pole and opening up in the final seventy yards. SILENT RUNNER rushed up the rail to the front, was
immediately pressed by a rival down the backstretch and around the turn, repulsed that foe and opened up a length at the top of the stretch but was passed
by the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, holding the place spot safely. SAILOR'S PASSION followed the winner's path while a few lengths back of that foe
throughout, could not match that one's energy but closed resolutely for the show spot showing long strides in the final sixteenth. SMART BIRD leapt up just
as the gate opened and had one beat early, closed under no urging into mid pack while two to three wide on the turn, lugged in upper stretch but found her
best stride late and was closing with good energy for a minor award, the rider shutting her down in the final yards when no further placing could be achieved.
ULTIMATE ANSWER rushed up to engage the leader shortly after the start, dueled with that one to the turn for home and began to drop back, losing ground
and positions in the final sixteenth. THANKS LAURA started sluggishly and advanced to chase the leaders inside the eventual winner, failed to match the
energy of the top five down the lane when the real running began. INCENDIO settled off the pace and was two to three wide around the turn, came into the
stretch on his wrong lead and managed to pass a few stragglers late. STRAPPING broke out at the start but recovered to run in midpack along the inside,
no response when the rider asked for run late on the turn and upper stretch. PERFECT PLAY settled off the pace and along the inside, no run evident when
asked mid turn. SANTIAGO SALSA showed no early speed and trailed by a good margin throughout.

INFAMOUS COVERT stalked the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, led at the top of the stretch, widened, then held under a drive. SOUL
FREEDOM stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely through the stretch. CORRELATE forced the issue,
raced two to four-wide through the far turn, challenged at the top of the stretch but was outkicked by the winner and lost the place as well. SUIGU STAR
raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the final turn then closed gamely but late. BLUE SNOW set a pressured pace, was headed
upper stretch and chased to the end. PAPERBACK HERO broke inward and bumped the beleaguered EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY, settled off the pace, was
hustled three to five-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. JUSTALITTLEHYPER away slowly and off the pace, raced two to four-wide on the far
turn but never reached contention. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY was bumped hard leaving the gate by THE BAND IS COMING, was hustled three and four-wide
from off the pace but flattened out in the final 16th. THE BAND COMING broke outward and bumped EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY, settled in mid pack, saved
ground on the far turn but lacked a closing response. BLACK HILLS BRONCO away slowly, stalked the pace, dropped back on the far turn and trailed
home.

EASY TIME stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, took command upper stretch and held under a strong hand ride. KEEP GRINDING
broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn and rallied gamely through the stretch. HADDASSAH forced the pace
on the first turn, took command entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch then gave way grudgingly. FROSTED OVER
stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn, was blocked a furlong out and rallied when clear in the late stages. TIDAL FORCES assumed
the early lead, was pressured on the first turn by HADDASSAH and was headed by that one entering the backstretch, moved outside quickly, stalked the
pace, was hustled on the far turn then finished evenly. CANDY OVERLOAD settled well off the early pace, closed on the far turn but never reached
contention.

Footnotes
TIO MAGICO broke outward but was up to lead quickly, set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn and was all out to hold sway in the stretch. ARTIE'S
STORM raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. RED RIVER REBEL was rated in
striking range early, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. DEL GRIFFITH got away
slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled three to two-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. MASTER SPY stalked the pace, forced the issue
on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. DOWNLOAD stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the turn but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GORGEOUS KITTEN settled off the pace along the inside, got a nice run up inside rivals on the far turn and came off the fence at the quarter pole, had
dead aim on the leader in upper stretch and changed leads right on cue at the eighth pole, driving to the front by the seventy yard marker to finish off the
perfect trip winning journey. COURTLY MANNER on the rail throughout, came out turning for home and had dead aim on the pace survivor in upper stretch,
got by that rival for a brief lead at the sixteenth pole but was immediately tackled by the winner, hard used to hold the place spot late. EPILOGUE trailed
until midway on the far turn, came up in behind the winner along the fence into the stretch, waited to shift out by the eighth pole and was closing best of all
late but ran out of real estate. TOLD IT ALL sped to the front quickly, was dueled through fast fractions by a pace rival, shook that one off by the quarter pole
and held the lead to the sixteenth pole, tiring from there to the wire but holding on for a minor award. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL was off the pace and along
the inside until taken off the fence into the far turn and circling three to four wide to seem contentious by the quarter pole but stalled while still widest at the
eighth pole. FIRE FOR EFFECT off the pace and on the rail through the first turn, was between rivals outside the winner on the second turn and gradually
faded back from that point to the wire. ANOTHER pressed and dueled the leader through fast fractions, began to leak oil by the quarter pole and retreated
from that point. TWO TIMING was three wide in mid pack on the first turn, still two wide and not making a move on the far turn, faltering from there to the
finish.

Footnotes
MY SILENCER had early speed, moved clear midway through the backstretch, was under pressure on the turn, repelled a challenge from MALIBU SECRET
a furlong out and surged ahead then held under steady pressure. MALIBU SECRET stalked the pace on the backstretch, forced the issue on the turn,
launched a strong bid outside the pacesetter a furlong out but couldn't match strides and gave way grudgingly in the late stages. CASH DIVIDEND raced in
mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn then rallied inside rivals and gained gradually to the wire. SOLIDIFY settled in mid pack, was hustled three
and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and showed some interest in the stretch drive. DUN DRUM settled off the pace, closed two-wide on
the turn then finished gamely in vain. MAGICAL MAN stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. SENOR JOBIM drifted
out a bit leaving the gate, pressed the pace, chased three-wide on the turn, backed away at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MR NARCISSISTIC forced the pace, bid three-wide late turn, dueled into stretch and drove clear in the final 16th. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ pressed the
pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, yielded a 16th out but held the place. BLACK SUN raced in mid pack, closed five-wide
on the turn, chased into the stretch and was gaining late. KAWACATOOSE was prominent early, dueled on the turn, was steadied near the top of the stretch
then chased to the wire. SEVENTH WONDER broke inward, stalked the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then evened out in deep stretch.
TOUMAN broke inward and settled off the pace, came two-wide on the turn and ran into traffic approaching the stretch then rallied gamely between foes.
TIZ ROMANTIC broke alertly and stalked the pace, dropped back nearing the turn, chased four-wide late turn then evened out mid stretch. VERRAZANO
NARROWS, off a step slowly, closed to mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn and finished gamely but in vain. PINK GELATO, bumped at the
start, raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. HOMELANDER bumped with PINK GELATO at the
break, raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. PREACHLITTLEGOSPEL set a
pressured pace, dueled from the rail on the turn, gave way approaching the top of the stretch and faded. TOTAL DESTRUCTION was close early, backed
away quickly late backstretch and was pulled up and vanned off.
