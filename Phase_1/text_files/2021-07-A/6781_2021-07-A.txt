Footnotes
NEVERLOOKBACK showed speed outside, moved two wide to the front midway on the turn and edged clear under urging. YOU GO BOY was sent to a
short lead along the inside soon after the break then weakened. CUMBERLAND GAP advanced outside early, raced the three path around the turn and
weakened. AGAINST THE ODDS broke in the air, steadied while lacking room along the rail leaving the half mile pole until entering the turn, swung wide
into the stretch and finished well. LADDIE LIAM was hustled inside early, improved position on the turn then weakened. TOMMY'S TOP CAT was slow
early, swung wide into the stretch and failed to menace. LOVE THAT JAZZ was no factor. PRAY WITH FAITH briefly showed speed inside. CACTUS JACK
pulled up shortly after the break and was walked off.
