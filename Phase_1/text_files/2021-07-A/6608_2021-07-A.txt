Footnotes
HATCHET GURL was fractious in the gate, then vied for command on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the quarter pole and drew clear by the furlong
marker, then drew out to prove much the best under strong handling. FANCY BLAZE was well placed early on the inside, then eased off the rail to make a
three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive while saving the place award. DOHA was slow into stride and raced on the inside, angled off the
inside in the stretch and finished willingly through traffic to just miss the place award. IAMINTERESTING stalked the early pace four wide, then came five
wide into the drive but offered no kick. LIL RESPECT chased the early pace four wide and came into the stretch six wide but had no rally. MOORAC vied for
the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn but then was empty. MISS MESS was allowed to settle early, then was six wide on the turn but lacked
a rally. MS FALSETTO was void of early speed, then was four wide passed the quarter pole and was no threat.

Footnotes
ALEX JOON was taken back and moved over to the inside to save ground into the first turn, then moved off the rail on the backstretch to split horses by the
half mile marker, then advanced on the turn and was blocked passed the quarter pole, swung out six wide for racing room, then closed full of run on the
outside to draw clear late under left handed urging. READY TO ROLL was well rated early and made a inside move passed the quarter pole to draw clear
by the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner late while second best. BLACKROCK CASTLE was allowed to settle early, advanced five wide
passed the quarter pole, angled out wider in the drive, rallied. HALF OURS TO KEEP chased the early pace and made a four wide move on the far turn but
flattened out. LIFE ON THE ROAD was settled back early, advanced on the turn then angled out in the stretch and had a belated rally through traffic.
SWEET MEDICINE tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened. REALLY SLOW was reserved early, then advanced on the
turn on the inside but lacked a late response. LIL BIG MAN passed the tiring rivals. ALLEGE failed to menace. MORRICONE set the pace while racing off
the rail and gave way. UNBELIEVABULL stopped.
