VALYCOVE carried out at the break gave a middle to move to stalk through the far turn into upper stretch vying from mid track angling in while surging
steadily arriving in time. ECRU pressed from the half dueling through the far turn moving abreast foe in upper stretch wresting a late lead only to be grabbed
from the outside at the wire. AMIGO'S AFFAIR veered out leaving the gate hustling to the lead coming under pressure on the backside dueling inside of rival
to upper stretch battling back until the final yards. DYNAFORM went evenly through the far turn coming five wide in upper stretch giving a mild rally there
needing more. GRAN EDITION played no factor. RIVER OF CHAMPAGNE stalked the pace chasing on the far turn wearing out in upper stretch.
