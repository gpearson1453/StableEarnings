SALSA'S RETURN settled outside the pacesetters, bid on the final turn and edged away under moderate urging. LEGAL GUMP hustled to the front inside,
was collared by the winner on the final turn and yielded. RINGS OF JUPITER prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and continued willingly.
EARTHQUAKE lacked speed outside and was never in contention. DEVINE DENTAL settled behind the pacesetter and gave way after three quarters.
FINGLAS broke slowest, saved ground and was always far back.

Footnotes
FIVE MORE MINUTES dueled along the inside alternating for the lead then edged away through the stretch driving. MANAHAWKIN trailed far behind, split
rivals advancing in the stretch too late. GET THE W chased near the inside, moved in two path on the turn and closed well. LOVERBOY LOU vied for lead
outside to the stretch and drifted out weakening. MASS APPEAL angled out to three wide on the turn and was carried out in fading in the stretch. TACTICAL
PLAN lacked speed, moved extremely wide with a mild rally. JONES TAXI was urged within range inside then proved empty in the final furlong. LEGACY'S
PRINCE angled inside down the backstretch then drifted out fading in the stretch. A claim of foul by the rider of MASS APPEAL against the rider of
LOVERBOY LOU for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

EXIT RIGHT pinched back early, moved strongly wide, swept to the front near the three eighths pole and drew off while drifting out. YES FOR LESS vied
inside, was eased back before the half then came again along the rail to gain the place. CATCH MY VIBE reserved behind the leaders, awaited room into
the far turn then rallied when clear. MARTIAL EAGLE lagged far behind then showed some energy too late. VERO SUN saved ground off the pace and
weakened. BRONXVILLE ducked out early, rushed to duel outside and faded on the final turn. WYE MUMBO chased wide well behind and was never a
factor. GREEN GROWTH earned a narrow advantage inside, and gave way after five furlongs.

WENTZ dueled outside throughout and finished determinedly holding off several challengers to earn the narrow victory. THISCATCANJUMP vied along the
inside and battled to the finish losing the nod in a game showing. DONTMESAWITHME dropped well behind then closed strongly along the inside too late.
ARCH CAT well placed outside the dueling the leaders, moved wide in the stretch and continued willingly. BORRACHO stumbled badly at the start, rushed
up inside, angled out near the quarter pole, loomed a threat but tired. MIDNIGHTCHARLY lagged far behind throughout trailing his field.

PRINCESS GRACE settled inside, waited patiently to pounce to the stretch, found a seam, rapidly split rivals and edged outside opponent following a long
drive in a game victory. MADITA (GER) taken under a firm hold outside, advanced nicely, moved with the winner in the stretch and continued gamely to just
miss. PLATINUM PAYNTER pursued the loose pacesetter, led briefly between calls at the quarter pole and finished willingly. AMNIARIX dropped back off
the pace inside, angled out rallying on the final turn but could offer only a mild gain. B B'S BUSTED lacked speed in the two path and continued well while
no threat. TIC TIC TIC BOOM lagged far behind trailing her field then passed a fading rival. GLAMOROUS THUNDER hustled to a clear advantage, was
collared midway on the second turn and faltered through the stretch.
