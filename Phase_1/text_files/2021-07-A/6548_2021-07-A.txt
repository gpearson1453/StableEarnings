strong pressure. V K LEGACY showed good early speed along the inside down the backstretch, raced just off the inside in the stretch and couldn't match
strides with the winner in the final stages. WHAT A KNOCKOUT raced in tight at the seven eighths mile marker, raced four deep through the lane and
finished willingly to the wire. SPARKLING PLENTY settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. UNITEDTORUN was
unhurried early on, saved ground and had no response. LORETTAS COMITMENT showed good speed from the outside and gave way in the drive. BOLD'N

Footnotes
IRAZU stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn, swung out four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under
strong handling. YOU NEVER CALL showed good early speed to set all the pace but couldn't hold off the winner in the latter stages to finish second best.
DREAMING OF AUDREY tracked the leader while racing just off the inside and weakened a bit in the drive. FORBIDDEN DREAM was allowed to settle to
the middle of the pack, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no final response. PANOTTI raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. LIKEHAIL dropped back early and failed to respond. MORENA DANCER was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, was
slow early on and never threatened. TRIPLET failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
ZALFIERRO hesitated at the break, settled off the early pace, made a good middle move to take command down the backstretch and prevailed late under
strong handling. POSEIDONS MYTH stalked the early pace, raced three wide in the drive and closed in on the winner late to just miss. BEACH BANDIT
settled towards the back of the pack early on, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. PRINCE HAWK moved up
along the inside through the far turn through the stretch but had not enough in the drive. COMMANDER KEITH showed good early speed and gave way.
BRING IT BACK pressed the early pace from the outside and tired. OSABA settled off the early pace and failed to respond. THE EQUINEST dropped back
early and showed little.

the stretch and weakened. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE was slow early and never threatened. SENORITA AURORA failed to sustain a bid. MISS UTOPIA

Footnotes
LOVIELEE showed good early speed to set all the pace and was well clear in the stretch while never being asked to be an easily winner. LADY NOY raced
up close early on along the inside, raced three wide through the stretch and was no match for the winner. SPEEDY FIRE stalked the top pair, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. BELLE'S CACHET settled off the early pace and had no response. D FLAT WHITE was slow early, raced
four wide nearing the eighth pole and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SLAMBONE stalked the early pace, raced near the rail in the stretch and finished well to edge clear late under strong pressure. MISH showed good early
speed from the outside, raced just off the inside in the drive and finished second best. TIMBERFELL stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the
stretch and had not enough in the drive. SWILL MERCHANT stalked the pace along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. APPEAL TO
RESPOND settled off the early going, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no response. LOVER RODOLFO stalked early on, raced towards
the inside and never was a factor. SPRING LANDSCAPE was slow early and never threatened. BYRON'S GOLD saved ground and never menaced.
